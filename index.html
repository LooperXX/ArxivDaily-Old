standardized codes, which is an essential part of medical information systems
and health insurance reimbursement. Manual coding by trained human coders is
time-consuming and error-prone. Thus, automated coding algorithms have been
developed, building especially on the recent advances in machine learning and
deep neural networks. To solve the challenges of encoding lengthy and noisy
clinical documents and capturing code associations, we propose a multitask
recalibrated aggregation network. In particular, multitask learning shares
information across different coding schemes and captures the dependencies
between different medical codes. Feature recalibration and aggregation in
shared modules enhance representation learning for lengthy notes. Experiments
with a real-world MIMIC-III dataset show significantly improved predictive
performance.</span>

relation classification with a localized, marker-free context representation.
The model is trained using strong within-sentence negative samples, which are
efficiently extracted in a single BERT pass. These aspects facilitate a search
over all spans in the sentence.

In ablation studies, we demonstrate the benefits of pre-training, strong
negative sampling and localized context. Our model outperforms prior work by up

                                        <span>Natural language is compositional; the meaning of a sentence is a function of
the meaning of its parts. This property allows humans to create and interpret
novel sentences, generalizing robustly outside their prior experience. Neural
networks have been shown to struggle with this kind of generalization, in
particular performing poorly on tasks designed to assess compositional
generalization (i.e. where training and testing distributions differ in ways
that would be trivial for a compositional strategy to resolve). Their poor
performance on these tasks may in part be due to the nature of supervised
learning which assumes training and testing data to be drawn from the same
distribution. We implement a meta-learning augmented version of supervised
learning whose objective directly optimizes for out-of-distribution
generalization. We construct pairs of tasks for meta-learning by sub-sampling
existing training data. Each pair of tasks is constructed to contain relevant
examples, as determined by a similarity metric, in an effort to inhibit models
from memorizing their input. Experimental results on the COGS and SCAN datasets
show that our similarity-driven meta-learning can improve generalization
performance.</span>

                                        <span>Recently generating natural language explanations has shown very promising
results in not only offering interpretable explanations but also providing
additional information and supervision for prediction. However, existing
approaches usually require a large set of human annotated explanations for
training while collecting a large set of explanations is not only time
consuming but also expensive. In this paper, we develop a general framework for
interpretable natural language understanding that requires only a small set of
human annotated explanations for training. Our framework treats natural
language explanations as latent variables that model the underlying reasoning
process of a neural model. We develop a variational EM framework for
optimization where an explanation generation module and an
explanation-augmented prediction module are alternatively optimized and
mutually enhance each other. Moreover, we further propose an explanation-based
self-training method under this framework for semi-supervised learning. It
alternates between assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data and generating new
explanations to iteratively improve each other. Experiments on two natural
language understanding tasks demonstrate that our framework can not only make
effective predictions in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, but also
generate good natural language explanation.</span>

levels comparable to human transcribers, which led researchers to debate if the
machine has reached human performance. Previous work focused on the English
language and modular hidden Markov model-deep neural network (HMM-DNN) systems.
In this paper, we perform a comprehensive benchmarking for end-to-end
transformer ASR, modular HMM-DNN ASR, and human speech recognition (HSR) on the
Arabic language and its dialects. For the HSR, we evaluate linguist performance
and lay-native speaker performance on a new dataset collected as a part of this
study. For ASR the end-to-end work led to 12.5%, 27.5%, 33.8% WER; a new
performance milestone for the MGB2, MGB3, and MGB5 challenges respectively. Our
results suggest that human performance in the Arabic language is still
considerably better than the machine with an absolute WER gap of 3.5% on
average.</span>

                                        <span>With increasing popularity of social media platforms hate speech is emerging
as a major concern, where it expresses abusive speech that targets specific
group characteristics, such as gender, religion or ethnicity to spread
violence. Earlier people use to verbally deliver hate speeches but now with the
expansion of technology, some people are deliberately using social media
platforms to spread hate by posting, sharing, commenting, etc. Whether it is
Christchurch mosque shootings or hate crimes against Asians in west, it has
been observed that the convicts are very much influenced from hate text present
online. Even though AI systems are in place to flag such text but one of the
key challenges is to reduce the false positive rate (marking non hate as hate),
so that these systems can detect hate speech without undermining the freedom of
expression. In this paper, we use ETHOS hate speech detection dataset and
analyze the performance of hate speech detection classifier by replacing or
integrating the word embeddings (fastText (FT), GloVe (GV) or FT + GV) with
static BERT embeddings (BE). With the extensive experimental trails it is
observed that the neural network performed better with static BE compared to
using FT, GV or FT + GV as word embeddings. In comparison to fine-tuned BERT,
one metric that significantly improved is specificity.</span>

                                        <span>Electronic health record (EHR) coding is the task of assigning ICD codes to
each EHR. Most previous studies either only focus on the frequent ICD codes or
treat rare and frequent ICD codes in the same way. These methods perform well
on frequent ICD codes but due to the extremely unbalanced distribution of ICD
codes, the performance on rare ones is far from satisfactory. We seek to
improve the performance for both frequent and rare ICD codes by using a
contrastive graph-based EHR coding framework, CoGraph, which re-casts EHR
coding as a few-shot learning task. First, we construct a heterogeneous EHR
word-entity (HEWE) graph for each EHR, where the words and entities extracted
from an EHR serve as nodes and the relations between them serve as edges. Then,
CoGraph learns similarities and dissimilarities between HEWE graphs from
different ICD codes so that information can be transferred among them. In a
few-shot learning scenario, the model only has access to frequent ICD codes
during training, which might force it to encode features that are useful for
frequent ICD codes only. To mitigate this risk, CoGraph devises two graph
contrastive learning schemes, GSCL and GECL, that exploit the HEWE graph
structures so as to encode transferable features. GSCL utilizes the
intra-correlation of different sub-graphs sampled from HEWE graphs while GECL
exploits the inter-correlation among HEWE graphs at different clinical stages.
Experiments on the MIMIC-III benchmark dataset show that CoGraph significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on EHR coding, not only on frequent ICD
codes, but also on rare codes, in terms of several evaluation indicators. On
frequent ICD codes, GSCL and GECL improve the classification accuracy and F1 by
1.31% and 0.61%, respectively, and on rare ICD codes CoGraph has more obvious
improvements by 2.12% and 2.95%.</span>

speech in recent years. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on
neural TTS, aiming to provide a good understanding of current research and
future trends. We focus on the key components in neural TTS, including text
analysis, acoustic models and vocoders, and several advanced topics, including
fast TTS, low-resource TTS, robust TTS, expressive TTS, and adaptive TTS, etc.
We further summarize resources related to TTS (e.g., datasets, opensource
implementations) and discuss future research directions. This survey can serve
both academic researchers and industry practitioners working on TTS.</span>

                                        <span>The use of machine learning algorithms to model user behavior and drive
business decisions has become increasingly commonplace, specifically providing
intelligent recommendations to automated decision making. This has led to an
increase in the use of customers personal data to analyze customer behavior and
predict their interests in a companys products. Increased use of this customer
personal data can lead to better models but also to the potential of customer
data being leaked, reverse engineered, and mishandled. In this paper, we assess
differential privacy as a solution to address these privacy problems by
building privacy protections into the data engineering and model training
stages of predictive model development. Our interest is a pragmatic
implementation in an operational environment, which necessitates a general
purpose differentially private modeling framework, and we evaluate one such
tool from LeapYear as applied to the Credit Risk modeling domain. Credit Risk
Model is a major modeling methodology in banking and finance where user data is
analyzed to determine the total Expected Loss to the bank. We examine the
application of differential privacy on the credit risk model and evaluate the
performance of a Differentially Private Model with a Non Differentially Private
Model. Credit Risk Model is a major modeling methodology in banking and finance
where users data is analyzed to determine the total Expected Loss to the bank.
In this paper, we explore the application of differential privacy on the credit

translation (MT). We annotated MT evaluations conducted in 769 research papers
published from 2010 to 2020. Our study shows that practices for automatic MT
evaluation have dramatically changed during the past decade and follow
concerning trends. An increasing number of MT evaluations exclusively rely on
differences between BLEU scores to draw conclusions, without performing any
kind of statistical significance testing nor human evaluation, while at least
108 metrics claiming to be better than BLEU have been proposed. MT evaluations
in recent papers tend to copy and compare automatic metric scores from previous
work to claim the superiority of a method or an algorithm without confirming
neither exactly the same training, validating, and testing data have been used
nor the metric scores are comparable. Furthermore, tools for reporting
standardized metric scores are still far from being widely adopted by the MT
community. After showing how the accumulation of these pitfalls leads to
dubious evaluation, we propose a guideline to encourage better automatic MT
evaluation along with a simple meta-evaluation scoring method to assess its
credibility.</span>

presents significant opportunities for improving the resulting embeddings, and
consequently for increased performance in downstream applications. Yet, little
research effort has focussed on this area and much of the carried out research
reports only marginally improved results compared to models trained without
temporal scopes (static models). Furthermore, rather than leveraging existing
work on static models, they introduce new models specific to temporal knowledge
graphs. We propose a novel perspective that takes advantage of the power of
existing static embedding models by focussing effort on manipulating the data
instead. Our method, SpliMe, draws inspiration from the field of signal
processing and early work in graph embedding. We show that SpliMe competes with
or outperforms the current state of the art in temporal KGE. Additionally, we
uncover issues with the procedure currently used to assess the performance of
static models on temporal graphs and introduce two ways to counteract them.</span>

to meet the requirements of customers. One way how this research is conducted
is that a domain expert gathers and categorizes user-generated content into a
complex and fine-grained class structure. In many of such cases, little data
meets complex annotations. It is not yet fully understood how this can be
leveraged successfully for classification. We examine the classification
accuracy of expert labels when used with a) many fine-grained classes and b)
few abstract classes. For scenario b) we compare abstract class labels given by
the domain expert as baseline and by automatic hierarchical clustering. We
compare this to another baseline where the entire class structure is given by a
completely unsupervised clustering approach. By doing so, this work can serve
as an example of how complex expert annotations are potentially beneficial and
can be utilized in the most optimal way for opinion mining in highly specific
domains. By exploring across a range of techniques and experiments, we find
that automated class abstraction approaches in particular the unsupervised
approach performs remarkably well against domain expert baseline on text
classification tasks. This has the potential to inspire opinion mining
applications in order to support market researchers in practice and to inspire
fine-grained automated content analysis on a large scale.</span>

                                        <span>Text summarization is an approach for identifying important information
present within text documents. This computational technique aims to generate
shorter versions of the source text, by including only the relevant and salient
information present within the source text. In this paper, we propose a novel
method to summarize a text document by clustering its contents based on latent
topics produced using topic modeling techniques and by generating extractive
summaries for each of the identified text clusters. All extractive
sub-summaries are later combined to generate a summary for any given source
document. We utilize the lesser used and challenging WikiHow dataset in our
approach to text summarization. This dataset is unlike the commonly used news
datasets which are available for text summarization. The well-known news
datasets present their most important information in the first few lines of
their source texts, which make their summarization a lesser challenging task
when compared to summarizing the WikiHow dataset. Contrary to these news
datasets, the documents in the WikiHow dataset are written using a generalized
approach and have lesser abstractedness and higher compression ratio, thus
proposing a greater challenge to generate summaries. A lot of the current
state-of-the-art text summarization techniques tend to eliminate important
information present in source documents in the favor of brevity. Our proposed
technique aims to capture all the varied information present in source
documents. Although the dataset proved challenging, after performing extensive
tests within our experimental setup, we have discovered that our model produces
encouraging ROUGE results and summaries when compared to the other published
extractive and abstractive text summarization models.</span>

performance of a wide range of tasks in recent years, important questions are
being raised about their robustness and their underlying sensitivity to
systematic biases that may exist in their training and test data. Such issues
come to be manifest in performance problems when faced with out-of-distribution
data in the field. One recent solution has been to use counterfactually
augmented datasets in order to reduce any reliance on spurious patterns that
may exist in the original data. Producing high-quality augmented data can be
costly and time-consuming as it usually needs to involve human feedback and
crowdsourcing efforts. In this work, we propose an alternative by describing
and evaluating an approach to automatically generating counterfactual data for
data augmentation and explanation. A comprehensive evaluation on several
different datasets and using a variety of state-of-the-art benchmarks
demonstrate how our approach can achieve significant improvements in model
performance when compared to models training on the original data and even when
compared to models trained with the benefit of human-generated augmented data.</span>

allow for quick benchmarking, it isn&#x27;t clear how such metrics reflect human

previous protocols fail to account for belief biases affecting human
performance, which may lead to misleading conclusions. We provide an overview
of belief bias, its role in human evaluation, and ideas for NLP practitioners
on how to account for it. For two experimental paradigms, we present a case
study of gradient-based explainability introducing simple ways to account for
humans&#x27; prior beliefs: models of varying quality and adversarial examples. We
show that conclusions about the highest performing methods change when
introducing such controls, pointing to the importance of accounting for belief

enabled the generation of reasonably good speech quality with a single model
and made it possible to synthesize the speech of a speaker with limited
training data. Fine-tuning to the target speaker data with the multi-speaker
model can achieve better quality, however, there still exists a gap compared to
the real speech sample and the model depends on the speaker. In this work, we
propose GANSpeech, which is a high-fidelity multi-speaker TTS model that adopts
the adversarial training method to a non-autoregressive multi-speaker TTS
model. In addition, we propose simple but efficient automatic scaling methods
for feature matching loss used in adversarial training. In the subjective
listening tests, GANSpeech significantly outperformed the baseline
multi-speaker FastSpeech and FastSpeech2 models, and showed a better MOS score

                                        <span>Conversational machine reading (CMR) tools have seen a rapid progress in the
recent past. The current existing tools rely on the supervised learning
technique which require labeled dataset for their training. The supervised
technique necessitates that for every new rule text, a manually labeled dataset
must be created. This is tedious and error prone. This paper introduces and
demonstrates how unsupervised learning technique can be applied in the
development of CMR. Specifically, we demonstrate how unsupervised learning can
be used in rule extraction and entailment modules of CMR. Compared to the
current best CMR tool, our developed framework reports 3.3% improvement in
micro averaged accuracy and 1.4 % improvement in macro averaged accuracy.</span>

annotations to identify and classify named entity mentions. Prototypical
network shows superior performance on few-shot NER. However, existing
prototypical methods fail to differentiate rich semantics in other-class words,
which will aggravate overfitting under few shot scenario. To address the issue,
we propose a novel model, Mining Undefined Classes from Other-class (MUCO),
that can automatically induce different undefined classes from the other class
to improve few-shot NER. With these extra-labeled undefined classes, our method
will improve the discriminative ability of NER classifier and enhance the
understanding of predefined classes with stand-by semantic knowledge.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms five
state-of-the-art models in both 1-shot and 5-shots settings on four NER
benchmarks. We will release the code upon acceptance. The source code is

                                        <span>The evaluation of neural machine translation systems is usually built upon
generated translation of a certain decoding method (e.g., beam search) with
evaluation metrics over the generated translation (e.g., BLEU). However, this
evaluation framework suffers from high search errors brought by heuristic
search algorithms and is limited by its nature of evaluation over one best
candidate. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation protocol, which not
only avoids the effect of search errors but provides a system-level evaluation
in the perspective of model ranking. In particular, our method is based on our
newly proposed exact top-$k$ decoding instead of beam search. Our approach
evaluates model errors by the distance between the candidate spaces scored by
the references and the model respectively. Extensive experiments on WMT&#x27;14
English-German demonstrate that bad ranking ability is connected to the
well-known beam search curse, and state-of-the-art Transformer models are
facing serious ranking errors. By evaluating various model architectures and
techniques, we provide several interesting findings. Finally, to effectively
approximate the exact search algorithm with same time cost as original beam
search, we present a minimum heap augmented beam search algorithm.</span>

various smart devices with ease. However, such systems are limited to the
preset list of intents-terms or commands, which restricts the quick
customization of personal devices to new intents. This paper presents a
few-shot spoken intent classification approach with task-agnostic
representations via meta-learning paradigm. Specifically, we leverage the
popular representation-based meta-learning learning to build a task-agnostic
representation of utterances, that then use a linear classifier for prediction.
We evaluate three such approaches on our novel experimental protocol developed
on two popular spoken intent classification datasets: Google Commands and the
Fluent Speech Commands dataset. For a 5-shot (1-shot) classification of novel
classes, the proposed framework provides an average classification accuracy of
88.6% (76.3%) on the Google Commands dataset, and 78.5% (64.2%) on the Fluent
Speech Commands dataset. The performance is comparable to traditionally
supervised classification models with abundant training samples.</span>

less than ten years, and has already entered a mature phase. While considered
as the most widely used solution for Machine Translation, its performance on
low-resource language pairs still remains sub-optimal compared to the
high-resource counterparts, due to the unavailability of large parallel
corpora. Therefore, the implementation of NMT techniques for low-resource
language pairs has been receiving the spotlight in the recent NMT research
arena, thus leading to a substantial amount of research reported on this topic.
This paper presents a detailed survey of research advancements in low-resource
language NMT (LRL-NMT), along with a quantitative analysis aimed at identifying
the most popular solutions. Based on our findings from reviewing previous work,
this survey paper provides a set of guidelines to select the possible NMT
technique for a given LRL data setting. It also presents a holistic view of the
LRL-NMT research landscape and provides a list of recommendations to further
enhance the research efforts on LRL-NMT.</span>

                                        <span>Neural text generation models are typically trained by maximizing
log-likelihood with the sequence cross entropy loss, which encourages an exact
token-by-token match between a target sequence with a generated sequence. Such
training objective is sub-optimal when the target sequence not perfect, e.g.,
when the target sequence is corrupted with noises, or when only weak sequence
supervision is available. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
Edit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL), which computes the matching loss of a
target n-gram with all n-grams in the generated sequence. EISL draws
inspirations from convolutional networks (ConvNets) which are shift-invariant
to images, hence is robust to the shift of n-grams to tolerate edits in the
target sequences. Moreover, the computation of EISL is essentially a
convolution operation with target n-grams as kernels, which is easy to
implement with existing libraries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EISL, we
conduct experiments on three tasks: machine translation with noisy target
sequences, unsupervised text style transfer, and non-autoregressive machine
translation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms
cross entropy loss on these three tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Decomposable tasks are complex and comprise of a hierarchy of sub-tasks.
Spoken intent prediction, for example, combines automatic speech recognition
and natural language understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, typically
hold out examples for only the surface-level sub-task. As a result, models with
similar performance on these benchmarks may have unobserved performance
differences on the other sub-tasks. To allow insightful comparisons between
competitive end-to-end architectures, we propose a framework to construct
robust test sets using coordinate ascent over sub-task specific utility
functions. Given a dataset for a decomposable task, our method optimally
creates a test set for each sub-task to individually assess sub-components of
the end-to-end model. Using spoken language understanding as a case study, we
generate new splits for the Fluent Speech Commands and Snips SmartLights
datasets. Each split has two test sets: one with held-out utterances assessing
natural language understanding abilities, and one with held-out speakers to
test speech processing skills. Our splits identify performance gaps up to 10%
between end-to-end systems that were within 1% of each other on the original
test sets. These performance gaps allow more realistic and actionable
comparisons between different architectures, driving future model development.
We release our splits and tools for the community.</span>

detecting the language contained in a document based on its content. The
present Language Identification techniques presume that a document contains
text in one of the fixed set of languages, however, this presumption is
incorrect when dealing with multilingual document which includes content in
more than one possible language. Due to the unavailability of large standard
corpora for Hindi-English mixed lingual language processing tasks we propose
the language lexicons, a novel kind of lexical database that supports several
multilingual language processing tasks. These lexicons are built by learning
classifiers over transliterated Hindi and English vocabulary. The designed
lexicons possess richer quantitative characteristic than its primary source of
collection which is revealed using the visualization techniques.</span>

organizes respective tasks where different teams develop systems that are
evaluated on the same benchmark datasets that represent the real information
needs of experts in the biomedical domain. This paper presents an overview of
the ninth edition of the BioASQ challenge in the context of the Conference and
Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2021. In this year, a new question
answering task, named Synergy, is introduced to support researchers studying
the COVID-19 disease and measure the ability of the participating teams to
discern information while the problem is still developing. In total, 42 teams
with more than 170 systems were registered to participate in the four tasks of
the challenge. The evaluation results, similarly to previous years, show a
performance gain against the baselines which indicates the continuous
improvement of the state-of-the-art in this field.</span>

sources and has met significant success by adopting multi-document
summarization techniques. However, previous works generally view the abstract
as plain text, ignoring the fact that it is a description of a certain entity
and can be decomposed into different topics. In this paper, we propose a
two-stage model TWAG that guides the abstract generation with topical
information. First, we detect the topic of each input paragraph with a
classifier trained on existing Wikipedia articles to divide input documents
into different topics. Then, we predict the topic distribution of each abstract
sentence, and decode the sentence from topic-aware representations with a
Pointer-Generator network. We evaluate our model on the WikiCatSum dataset, and
the results show that \modelnames outperforms various existing baselines and is
capable of generating comprehensive abstracts. Our code and dataset can be

bias within our judicial system. We find that current bias detectino methods in
NLP are insufficient to determine gender bias in our case law database and
propose an alternative approach. We show that existing algorithms&#x27; inconsistent
results are consequences of prior research&#x27;s definition of biases themselves.
Bias detection algorithms rely on groups of words to represent bias (e.g.,
&#x27;salary,&#x27; &#x27;job,&#x27; and &#x27;boss&#x27; to represent employment as a potentially biased
theme against women in text). However, the methods to build these groups of
words have several weaknesses, primarily that the word lists are based on the
researchers&#x27; own intuitions. We suggest two new methods of automating the
creation of word lists to represent biases. We find that our methods outperform
current NLP bias detection methods. Our research improves the capabilities of
NLP technology to detect bias and highlights gender biases present in
influential case law. In order test our NLP bias detection method&#x27;s
performance, we regress our results of bias in case law against U.S census data

the basketball team Lebron James plays for. But language models (LMs) are
trained on snapshots of data collected at a specific moment in time, and this
can limit their utility, especially in the closed-book setting where the
pretraining corpus must contain the facts the model should memorize. We
introduce a diagnostic dataset aimed at probing LMs for factual knowledge that
changes over time and highlight problems with LMs at either end of the spectrum
-- those trained on specific slices of temporal data, as well as those trained
on a wide range of temporal data. To mitigate these problems, we propose a
simple technique for jointly modeling text with its timestamp. This improves
memorization of seen facts from the training time period, as well as
calibration on predictions about unseen facts from future time periods. We also
show that models trained with temporal context can be efficiently &#x60;&#x60;refreshed&#x27;&#x27;
as new data arrives, without the need for retraining from scratch.</span>

challenging task in natural language generation. Since several given topics
only provide limited source information, utilizing various topic-related
knowledge is essential for improving essay generation performance. However,
previous works cannot sufficiently use that knowledge to facilitate the
generation procedure. This paper aims to improve essay generation by extracting
information from both internal and external knowledge. Thus, a topic-to-essay
generation model with comprehensive knowledge enhancement, named TEGKE, is
proposed. For internal knowledge enhancement, both topics and related essays
are fed to a teacher network as source information. Then, informative features
would be obtained from the teacher network and transferred to a student network
which only takes topics as input but provides comparable information compared
with the teacher network. For external knowledge enhancement, a topic knowledge
graph encoder is proposed. Unlike the previous works only using the nearest
neighbors of topics in the commonsense base, our topic knowledge graph encoder
could exploit more structural and semantic information of the commonsense
knowledge graph to facilitate essay generation. Moreover, the adversarial
training based on the Wasserstein distance is proposed to improve generation
quality. Experimental results demonstrate that TEGKE could achieve
state-of-the-art performance on both automatic and human evaluation.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in image
restoration tasks by directly learning a powerful non-linear mapping from
corrupted images to their latent clean ones. However, there still exist two
major limitations for these deep learning (DL)-based methods. Firstly, the
noises contained in real corrupted images are very complex, usually neglected
and largely under-estimated in most current methods. Secondly, existing DL
methods are mostly trained on one pre-assumed degradation process for all of
the training image pairs, such as the widely used bicubic downsampling
assumption in the image super-resolution task, inevitably leading to poor
generalization performance when the true degradation does not match with such
assumed one. To address these issues, we propose a unified generative model for
the image restoration, which elaborately configures the degradation process
from the latent clean image to the observed corrupted one. Specifically,
different from most of current methods, the pixel-wisely non-i.i.d. Gaussian
distribution, being with more flexibility, is adopted in our method to fit the
complex real noises. Furthermore, the method is built on the general image
degradation process, making it capable of adapting diverse degradations under
one single model. Besides, we design a variational inference algorithm to learn
all parameters involved in the proposed model with explicit form of objective
loss. Specifically, beyond traditional variational methodology, two DNNs are
employed to parameterize the posteriori distributions, one to infer the
distribution of the latent clean image, and another to infer the distribution
of the image noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method on three classical image restoration tasks, including image
denoising, image super-resolution and JPEG image deblocking.</span>

with the main design goal of enabling both machine learning researchers and
non-technical geospatial domain experts to experiment with domain-specific
signals and datasets for solving a variety of complex problems on their own.
This versatility to solve diverse problems is achieved by transforming complex
Spatio-temporal datasets to make them consumable by standard deep learning
models, in this case, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and giving the
ability to formulate disparate problems in a standard way, eg. semantic
segmentation. With an intuitive user interface, a feature store that hosts
derivatives of complex feature engineering, a deep learning kernel, and a
scalable data processing mechanism, Trinity provides a powerful platform for
domain experts to share the stage with scientists and engineers in solving
business-critical problems. It enables quick prototyping, rapid experimentation
and reduces the time to production by standardizing model building and
deployment. In this paper, we present our motivation behind Trinity and its
design along with showcasing sample applications to motivate the idea of
lowering the bar to using AI.</span>

                                        <span>Compared with cheap addition operation, multiplication operation is of much
higher computation complexity. The widely-used convolutions in deep neural
networks are exactly cross-correlation to measure the similarity between input
feature and convolution filters, which involves massive multiplications between
float values. In this paper, we present adder networks (AdderNets) to trade
these massive multiplications in deep neural networks, especially convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), for much cheaper additions to reduce computation costs.
In AdderNets, we take the $\ell_1$-norm distance between filters and input
feature as the output response. We first develop a theoretical foundation for
AdderNets, by showing that both the single hidden layer AdderNet and the
width-bounded deep AdderNet with ReLU activation functions are universal
function approximators. An approximation bound for AdderNets with a single
hidden layer is also presented. We further analyze the influence of this new
similarity measure on the optimization of neural network and develop a special
training scheme for AdderNets. Based on the gradient magnitude, an adaptive
learning rate strategy is proposed to enhance the training procedure of
AdderNets. AdderNets can achieve a 75.7% Top-1 accuracy and a 92.3% Top-5
accuracy using ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset without any multiplication in
the convolutional layer.</span>

                                        <span>Features play a crucial role in computer vision. Initially designed to detect
salient elements by means of handcrafted algorithms, features are now often
learned by different layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper
develops a generic computer vision system based on features extracted from
trained CNNs. Multiple learned features are combined into a single structure to
work on different image classification tasks. The proposed system was
experimentally derived by testing several approaches for extracting features
from the inner layers of CNNs and using them as inputs to SVMs that are then
combined by sum rule. Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to reduce
the high dimensionality of inner layers. The resulting vision system is shown
to significantly boost the performance of standard CNNs across a large and
diverse collection of image data sets. An ensemble of different topologies
using the same approach obtains state-of-the-art results on a virus data set.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is clinically relevant in diagnoses, prognoses and surgery treatment, which
requires multiple modalities to provide complementary morphological and
physiopathologic information. However, missing modality commonly occurs due to
image corruption, artifacts, different acquisition protocols or allergies to
certain contrast agents in clinical practice. Though existing efforts
demonstrate the possibility of a unified model for all missing situations, most
of them perform poorly when more than one modality is missing. In this paper,
we propose a novel Adversarial Co-training Network (ACN) to solve this issue,
in which a series of independent yet related models are trained dedicated to
each missing situation with significantly better results. Specifically, ACN
adopts a novel co-training network, which enables a coupled learning process
for both full modality and missing modality to supplement each other&#x27;s domain
and feature representations, and more importantly, to recover the &#x60;missing&#x27;
information of absent modalities. Then, two unsupervised modules, i.e., entropy
and knowledge adversarial learning modules are proposed to minimize the domain
gap while enhancing prediction reliability and encouraging the alignment of
latent representations, respectively. We also adapt modality-mutual information
knowledge transfer learning to ACN to retain the rich mutual information among
modalities. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018 dataset show that our proposed
method significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art methods under any missing
situation.</span>

detection with deep edge detectors, based on an observation that the
localization ambiguity of deep edge detectors is mainly caused by the mixing
phenomenon of convolutional neural networks: feature mixing in edge
classification and side mixing during fusing side predictions. The CATS
consists of two modules: a novel tracing loss that performs feature unmixing by
tracing boundaries for better side edge learning, and a context-aware fusion
block that tackles the side mixing by aggregating the complementary merits of
learned side edges. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed CATS can be
integrated into modern deep edge detectors to improve localization accuracy.
With the vanilla VGG16 backbone, in terms of BSDS500 dataset, our CATS improves
the F-measure (ODS) of the RCF and BDCN deep edge detectors by 12% and 6%
respectively when evaluating without using the morphological non-maximal
suppression scheme for edge detection.</span>

requires the efforts of generation methods. However, current deepfake methods
suffer the effects of obscure workflow and poor performance. To solve this
problem, we present DeepFaceLab, the current dominant deepfake framework for
face-swapping. It provides the necessary tools as well as an easy-to-use way to
conduct high-quality face-swapping. It also offers a flexible and loose
coupling structure for people who need to strengthen their pipeline with other
features without writing complicated boilerplate code. We detail the principles
that drive the implementation of DeepFaceLab and introduce its pipeline,
through which every aspect of the pipeline can be modified painlessly by users
to achieve their customization purpose. It is noteworthy that DeepFaceLab could
achieve cinema-quality results with high fidelity. We demonstrate the advantage
of our system by comparing our approach with other face-swapping methods.For

                                        <span>Contrastive learning (CL) is effective in learning data representations
without label supervision, where the encoder needs to contrast each positive
sample over multiple negative samples via a one-vs-many softmax cross-entropy
loss. However, conventional CL is sensitive to how many negative samples are
included and how they are selected. Proposed in this paper is a doubly CL
strategy that contrasts positive samples and negative ones within themselves
separately. We realize this strategy with contrastive attraction and
contrastive repulsion (CACR) makes the query not only exert a greater force to
attract more distant positive samples but also do so to repel closer negative
samples. Theoretical analysis reveals the connection between CACR and CL from
the perspectives of both positive attraction and negative repulsion and shows
the benefits in both efficiency and robustness brought by separately
contrasting within the sampled positive and negative pairs. Extensive
large-scale experiments on standard vision tasks show that CACR not only
consistently outperforms existing CL methods on benchmark datasets in
representation learning, but also provides interpretable contrastive weights,
demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed doubly contrastive strategy.</span>

                                        <span>Adversarial training is one of the most effective approaches to improve model
robustness against adversarial examples. However, previous works mainly focus
on the overall robustness of the model, and the in-depth analysis on the role
of each class involved in adversarial training is still missing. In this paper,
we propose to analyze the class-wise robustness in adversarial training. First,
we provide a detailed diagnosis of adversarial training on six benchmark
datasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, STL-10 and ImageNet.
Surprisingly, we find that there are remarkable robustness discrepancies among
classes, leading to unbalance/unfair class-wise robustness in the robust
models. Furthermore, we keep investigating the relations between classes and
find that the unbalanced class-wise robustness is pretty consistent among
different attack and defense methods. Moreover, we observe that the stronger
attack methods in adversarial learning achieve performance improvement mainly
from a more successful attack on the vulnerable classes (i.e., classes with
less robustness). Inspired by these interesting findings, we design a simple
but effective attack method based on the traditional PGD attack, named
Temperature-PGD attack, which proposes to enlarge the robustness disparity
among classes with a temperature factor on the confidence distribution of each
image. Experiments demonstrate our method can achieve a higher attack rate than
the PGD attack. Furthermore, from the defense perspective, we also make some
modifications in the training and inference phase to improve the robustness of
the most vulnerable class, so as to mitigate the large difference in class-wise
robustness. We believe our work can contribute to a more comprehensive
understanding of adversarial training as well as rethinking the class-wise
properties in robust models.</span>

photo-realistic 3D digital human heads with a consumer RGB-D selfie camera. The
system only needs the user to take a short selfie RGB-D video while rotating
his/her head, and can produce a high quality head reconstruction in less than
30 seconds. Our main contribution is a new facial geometry modeling and
reflectance synthesis procedure that significantly improves the
state-of-the-art. Specifically, given the input video a two-stage frame
selection procedure is first employed to select a few high-quality frames for
reconstruction. Then a differentiable renderer based 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)
fitting algorithm is applied to recover facial geometries from multiview RGB-D
data, which takes advantages of a powerful 3DMM basis constructed with
extensive data generation and perturbation. Our 3DMM has much larger expressive
capacities than conventional 3DMM, allowing us to recover more accurate facial
geometry using merely linear basis. For reflectance synthesis, we present a
hybrid approach that combines parametric fitting and CNNs to synthesize
high-resolution albedo/normal maps with realistic hair/pore/wrinkle details.
Results show that our system can produce faithful 3D digital human faces with
extremely realistic details. The main code and the newly constructed 3DMM basis
is publicly available.</span>

personalized visual Memex. MemX captures human visual attention on the fly,
analyzes the salient visual content, and records moments of personal interest

analysis on resource-constrained platforms is challenging because these tasks
are computation and energy intensive. We propose a new temporal visual
attention network that unifies human visual attention tracking and salient
visual content analysis. Attention tracking focuses computation-intensive video
analysis on salient regions, while video analysis makes human attention
detection and tracking more accurate. Using the YouTube-VIS dataset and 30

without inductive biases on the models and the data. As an alternative
approach, recent methods rely on limited supervision to disentangle the factors
of variation and allow their identifiability. While annotating the true
generative factors is only required for a limited number of observations, we
argue that it is infeasible to enumerate all the factors of variation that
describe a real-world image distribution. To this end, we propose a method for
disentangling a set of factors which are only partially labeled, as well as
separating the complementary set of residual factors that are never explicitly
specified. Our success in this challenging setting, demonstrated on synthetic
benchmarks, gives rise to leveraging off-the-shelf image descriptors to
partially annotate a subset of attributes in real image domains (e.g. of human
faces) with minimal manual effort. Specifically, we use a recent language-image
embedding model (CLIP) to annotate a set of attributes of interest in a
zero-shot manner and demonstrate state-of-the-art disentangled image

can improve human and computer use of medical images. A CNN-based classifier
was developed to identify body regions in CT and MRI. 17 CT (18 MRI) body
regions covering the entire human body were defined for the classification
task. Three retrospective databases were built for the AI model training,
validation, and testing, with a balanced distribution of studies per body
region. The test databases originated from a different healthcare network.
Accuracy, recall and precision of the classifier was evaluated for patient age,
patient gender, institution, scanner manufacturer, contrast, slice thickness,
MRI sequence, and CT kernel. The data included a retrospective cohort of 2,934
anonymized CT cases (training: 1,804 studies, validation: 602 studies, test:
528 studies) and 3,185 anonymized MRI cases (training: 1,911 studies,
validation: 636 studies, test: 638 studies). 27 institutions from primary care
hospitals, community hospitals and imaging centers contributed to the test
datasets. The data included cases of all genders in equal proportions and
subjects aged from a few months old to +90 years old. An image-level prediction
accuracy of 91.9% (90.2 - 92.1) for CT, and 94.2% (92.0 - 95.6) for MRI was
achieved. The classification results were robust across all body regions and
confounding factors. Due to limited data, performance results for subjects
under 10 years-old could not be reliably evaluated. We show that deep learning
models can classify CT and MRI images by body region including lower and upper
extremities with high accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Video frame interpolation is the task of creating an interframe between two
adjacent frames along the time axis. So, instead of simply averaging two
adjacent frames to create an intermediate image, this operation should maintain
semantic continuity with the adjacent frames. Most conventional methods use
optical flow, and various tools such as occlusion handling and object smoothing
are indispensable. Since the use of these various tools leads to complex
problems, we tried to tackle the video interframe generation problem without
using problematic optical flow . To enable this , we have tried to use a deep
neural network with an invertible structure, and developed an U-Net based
Generative Flow which is a modified normalizing flow. In addition, we propose a
learning method with a new consistency loss in the latent space to maintain
semantic temporal consistency between frames. The resolution of the generated
image is guaranteed to be identical to that of the original images by using an
invertible network. Furthermore, as it is not a random image like the ones by
generative models, our network guarantees stable outputs without flicker.
Through experiments, we \sam {confirmed the feasibility of the proposed
algorithm and would like to suggest the U-Net based Generative Flow as a new
possibility for baseline in video frame interpolation. This paper is meaningful
in that it is the world&#x27;s first attempt to use invertible networks instead of
optical flows for video interpolation.</span>

highly dependent on the abundant and diverse datasets. However, it is very hard
to obtain and label the datasets of some specific scenes or applications. If we
train the detector using the data from one domain, it cannot perform well on
the data from another domain due to domain shift, which is one of the big
challenges of most object detection models. To address this issue, some
image-to-image translation techniques have been employed to generate some fake
data of some specific scenes to train the models. With the advent of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), we could realize unsupervised image-to-image
translation in both directions from a source to a target domain and from the
target to the source domain. In this study, we report a new approach to making
use of the generated images. We propose to concatenate the original 3-channel
images and their corresponding GAN-generated fake images to form 6-channel
representations of the dataset, hoping to address the domain shift problem
while exploiting the success of available detection models. The idea of
augmented data representation may inspire further study on object detection and
other applications.</span>

Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL). Our end-to-end approach learns progressively refined
generative embedding spaces constrained within and across the involved

action sequence embedding and embeddings of Parts of Speech (PoS) tagged words

generalize compositionally, i.e., recognize sequences whose action descriptions
contain words not encountered during training. We also extend our approach to
the more challenging Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) problem via a
confidence-based gating mechanism. We are the first to present zero-shot

                                        <span>Low-light imaging on mobile devices is typically challenging due to
insufficient incident light coming through the relatively small aperture,
resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the previous works on
low-light image processing focus either only on a single task such as
illumination adjustment, color enhancement, or noise removal; or on a joint
illumination adjustment and denoising task that heavily relies on short-long
exposure image pairs collected from specific camera models, and thus these
approaches are less practical and generalizable in real-world settings where
camera-specific joint enhancement and restoration is required. To tackle this
problem, in this paper, we propose a low-light image processing framework that
performs joint illumination adjustment, color enhancement, and denoising.
Considering the difficulty in model-specific data collection and the ultra-high
definition of the captured images, we design two branches: a coefficient
estimation branch as well as a joint enhancement and denoising branch. The
coefficient estimation branch works in a low-resolution space and predicts the
coefficients for enhancement via bilateral learning, whereas the joint
enhancement and denoising branch works in a full-resolution space and performs
joint enhancement and denoising in a progressive manner. In contrast to
existing methods, our framework does not need to recollect massive data when
being adapted to another camera model, which significantly reduces the efforts
required to fine-tune our approach for practical usage. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate its great potential in real-world low-light imaging
applications when compared with current state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic surgical gesture recognition is fundamentally important to enable
intelligent cognitive assistance in robotic surgery. With recent advancement in
robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, rich information including surgical
videos and robotic kinematics can be recorded, which provide complementary
knowledge for understanding surgical gestures. However, existing methods either
solely adopt uni-modal data or directly concatenate multi-modal
representations, which can not sufficiently exploit the informative
correlations inherent in visual and kinematics data to boost gesture
recognition accuracies. In this regard, we propose a novel online approach of
multi-modal relational graph network (i.e., MRG-Net) to dynamically integrate
visual and kinematics information through interactive message propagation in
the latent feature space. In specific, we first extract embeddings from video
and kinematics sequences with temporal convolutional networks and LSTM units.
Next, we identify multi-relations in these multi-modal embeddings and leverage
them through a hierarchical relational graph learning module. The effectiveness
of our method is demonstrated with state-of-the-art results on the public
JIGSAWS dataset, outperforming current uni-modal and multi-modal methods on
both suturing and knot typing tasks. Furthermore, we validated our method on
in-house visual-kinematics datasets collected with da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK)
platforms in two centers, with consistent promising performance achieved.</span>

                                        <span>Compared with cheap addition operation, multiplication operation is of much
higher computation complexity. The widely-used convolutions in deep neural
networks are exactly cross-correlation to measure the similarity between input
feature and convolution filters, which involves massive multiplications between
float values. In this paper, we present adder networks (AdderNets) to trade
these massive multiplications in deep neural networks, especially convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), for much cheaper additions to reduce computation costs.
In AdderNets, we take the $\ell_1$-norm distance between filters and input
feature as the output response. The influence of this new similarity measure on
the optimization of neural network have been thoroughly analyzed. To achieve a
better performance, we develop a special back-propagation approach for
AdderNets by investigating the full-precision gradient. We then propose an
adaptive learning rate strategy to enhance the training procedure of AdderNets
according to the magnitude of each neuron&#x27;s gradient. As a result, the proposed
AdderNets can achieve 74.9% Top-1 accuracy 91.7% Top-5 accuracy using ResNet-50
on the ImageNet dataset without any multiplication in convolution layer. The
codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/huaweinoah/AdderNet.</span>

                                        <span>With increasing popularity of social media platforms hate speech is emerging
as a major concern, where it expresses abusive speech that targets specific
group characteristics, such as gender, religion or ethnicity to spread
violence. Earlier people use to verbally deliver hate speeches but now with the
expansion of technology, some people are deliberately using social media
platforms to spread hate by posting, sharing, commenting, etc. Whether it is
Christchurch mosque shootings or hate crimes against Asians in west, it has
been observed that the convicts are very much influenced from hate text present
online. Even though AI systems are in place to flag such text but one of the
key challenges is to reduce the false positive rate (marking non hate as hate),
so that these systems can detect hate speech without undermining the freedom of
expression. In this paper, we use ETHOS hate speech detection dataset and
analyze the performance of hate speech detection classifier by replacing or
integrating the word embeddings (fastText (FT), GloVe (GV) or FT + GV) with
static BERT embeddings (BE). With the extensive experimental trails it is
observed that the neural network performed better with static BE compared to
using FT, GV or FT + GV as word embeddings. In comparison to fine-tuned BERT,
one metric that significantly improved is specificity.</span>

                                        <span>Perceiving the world in terms of objects and tracking them through time is a
crucial prerequisite for reasoning and scene understanding. Recently, several
methods have been proposed for unsupervised learning of object-centric
representations. However, since these models were evaluated on different
downstream tasks, it remains unclear how they compare in terms of basic
perceptual abilities such as detection, figure-ground segmentation and tracking
of objects. To close this gap, we design a benchmark with four data sets of
varying complexity and seven additional test sets featuring challenging
tracking scenarios relevant for natural videos. Using this benchmark, we
compare the perceptual abilities of four object-centric approaches: ViMON, a
video-extension of MONet, based on recurrent spatial attention, OP3, which
exploits clustering via spatial mixture models, as well as TBA and SCALOR,
which use explicit factorization via spatial transformers. Our results suggest
that the architectures with unconstrained latent representations learn more
powerful representations in terms of object detection, segmentation and
tracking than the spatial transformer based architectures. We also observe that
none of the methods are able to gracefully handle the most challenging tracking
scenarios despite their synthetic nature, suggesting that our benchmark may
provide fruitful guidance towards learning more robust object-centric video
representations.</span>

last few decades and their population is expected to further increase in the
upcoming future. Their increasing population is associated with their
increasing needs due to problems like physical disabilities, cognitive issues,
weakened memory and disorganized behavior, that elderly people face with
increasing age. To reduce their financial burden on the world economy and to
enhance their quality of life, it is essential to develop technology-based
solutions that are adaptive, assistive and intelligent in nature. Intelligent
Affect Aware Systems that can not only analyze but also predict the behavior of
elderly people in the context of their day to day interactions with technology
in an IoT-based environment, holds immense potential for serving as a long-term
solution for improving the user experience of elderly in smart homes. This work
therefore proposes the framework for an Intelligent Affect Aware environment
for elderly people that can not only analyze the affective components of their
interactions but also predict their likely user experience even before they
start engaging in any activity in the given smart home environment. This
forecasting of user experience would provide scope for enhancing the same,
thereby increasing the assistive and adaptive nature of such intelligent
systems. To uphold the efficacy of this proposed framework for improving the
quality of life of elderly people in smart homes, it has been tested on three
datasets and the results are presented and discussed.</span>

on the scale, quality and diversity of the data used for their training.
Collecting and manually annotating large amount of data can be both
time-consuming and costly tasks to perform. In the case of tasks related to
visual human-centric perception, the collection and distribution of such data
may also face restrictions due to legislation regarding privacy. In addition,
the design and testing of complex systems, e.g., robots, which often employ
deep learning-based perception models, may face severe difficulties as even
state-of-the-art methods trained on real and large-scale datasets cannot always
perform adequately as they have not adapted to the visual differences between
the virtual and the real world data. As an attempt to tackle and mitigate the
effect of these issues, we present a method that automatically generates
realistic synthetic data with annotations for a) person detection, b) face
recognition, and c) human pose estimation. The proposed method takes as input
real background images and populates them with human figures in various poses.
Instead of using hand-made 3D human models, we propose the use of models
generated through deep learning methods, further reducing the dataset creation
costs, while maintaining a high level of realism. In addition, we provide
open-source and easy to use tools that implement the proposed pipeline,
allowing for generating highly-realistic synthetic datasets for a variety of
tasks. A benchmarking and evaluation in the corresponding tasks shows that
synthetic data can be effectively used as a supplement to real data.</span>

                                        <span>Logic reasoning is a significant ability of human intelligence and also an
important task in artificial intelligence. The existing logic reasoning
methods, quite often, need to design some reasoning patterns beforehand. This
has led to an interesting question: can logic reasoning patterns be directly
learned from given data? The problem is termed as a data concept logic. In this
study, a learning logic task from images, called a LiLi task, first is
proposed. This task is to learn and reason the logic relation from images,
without presetting any reasoning patterns. As a preliminary exploration, we
design six LiLi data sets (Bitwise And, Bitwise Or, Bitwise Xor, Addition,
Subtraction and Multiplication), in which each image is embedded with a n-digit
number. It is worth noting that a learning model beforehand does not know the
meaning of the n-digit numbers embedded in images and the relation between the
input images and the output image. In order to tackle the task, in this work we
use many typical neural network models and produce fruitful results. However,
these models have the poor performances on the difficult logic task. For
furthermore addressing this task, a novel network framework called a divide and
conquer model by adding some label information is designed, achieving a high
testing accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Longitudinal studies are vital to understanding dynamic changes of the
planet, but labels (e.g., buildings, facilities, roads) are often available
only for a single point in time. We propose a general model, Temporal Cluster
Matching (TCM), for detecting building changes in time series of remotely
sensed imagery when footprint labels are observed only once. The intuition
behind the model is that the relationship between spectral values inside and
outside of building&#x27;s footprint will change when a building is constructed (or
demolished). For instance, in rural settings, the pre-construction area may
look similar to the surrounding environment until the building is constructed.
Similarly, in urban settings, the pre-construction areas will look different
from the surrounding environment until construction. We further propose a
heuristic method for selecting the parameters of our model which allows it to
be applied in novel settings without requiring data labeling efforts (to fit
the parameters). We apply our model over a dataset of poultry barns from
2016/2017 high-resolution aerial imagery in the Delmarva Peninsula and a
dataset of solar farms from a 2020 mosaic of Sentinel 2 imagery in India. Our
results show that our model performs as well when fit using the proposed
heuristic as it does when fit with labeled data, and further, that supervised
versions of our model perform the best among all the baselines we test against.
Finally, we show that our proposed approach can act as an effective data
augmentation strategy -- it enables researchers to augment existing structure
footprint labels along the time dimension and thus use imagery from multiple
points in time to train deep learning models. We show that this improves the
spatial generalization of such models when evaluated on the same change
detection task.</span>

                                        <span>Facial Expression Recognition is a commercially important application, but
one common limitation is that applications often require making predictions on
out-of-sample distributions, where target images may have very different
properties from the images that the model was trained on. How well, or badly,
do these models do on unseen target domains? In this paper, we provide a
systematic evaluation of domain adaptation in facial expression recognition.
Using state-of-the-art transfer learning techniques and six commonly-used
facial expression datasets (three collected in the lab and three
&quot;in-the-wild&quot;), we conduct extensive round-robin experiments to examine the
classification accuracies for a state-of-the-art CNN model. We also perform
multi-source experiments where we examine a model&#x27;s ability to transfer from
multiple source datasets, including (i) within-setting (e.g., lab to lab), (ii)
cross-setting (e.g., in-the-wild to lab), (iii) mixed-setting (e.g., lab and
wild to lab) transfer learning experiments. We find sobering results that the
accuracy of transfer learning is not high, and varies idiosyncratically with
the target dataset, and to a lesser extent the source dataset. Generally, the
best settings for transfer include fine-tuning the weights of a pre-trained
model, and we find that training with more datasets, regardless of setting,
improves transfer performance. We end with a discussion of the need for more --
and regular -- systematic investigations into the generalizability of FER
models, especially for deployed applications.</span>

susceptibility mapping (QSM) data processing: background field removal,
field-to-source inversion, and single-step QSM reconstruction. However, the
conventional padding mechanism used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can
introduce spatial artifacts, especially in QSM background field removal and
single-step QSM which requires inference from total fields with extreme large
values at the edge boundaries of volume of interest. To address this issue, we
propose an improved padding technique which utilizes the neighboring valid
voxels to estimate the invalid voxels of feature maps at volume boundaries in
the neural networks. Studies using simulated and in-vivo data show that the
proposed padding greatly improves estimation accuracy and reduces artifacts in
the results in the tasks of background field removal, field-to-source

that a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.
This is true for many applications, but not all. Myocardial segmentation of
Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography (MCE), a critical task in automatic
myocardial perfusion analysis, is an example. Due to the low resolution and
serious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can
vary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,
how can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we
train the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by
proposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation
performance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our
proposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new
metric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn
general features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set
demonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function
outperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from
multiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, our
grading study shows that using extended Dice as an evaluation metric can better
identify segmentation results that need manual correction compared with using
Dice.</span>

behaviors on videos, which imply the complex relations between users and

Sagittarius differentiates between different user behaviors by weighting and

Moreover, Sagittarius combines multiple optimization objectives to learn user

-- in very high-resolution satellite imagery is an important task for
supporting ecological studies. Prior work has shown that this is feasible with
deep learning based methods and sub-meter multi-spectral satellite imagery. We
extend this line of work by proposing a baseline method, CowNet, that
simultaneously estimates the number of animals in an image (counts), as well as
predicts their location at a pixel level (localizes). We also propose an
methodology for evaluating such models on counting and localization tasks
across large scenes that takes the uncertainty of noisy labels and the
information needed by stakeholders in ecological monitoring tasks into account.
Finally, we benchmark our baseline method with state of the art vision methods
for counting objects in scenes. We specifically test the temporal
generalization of the resulting models over a large landscape in Point Reyes
Seashore, CA. We find that the LC-FCN model performs the best and achieves an

                                        <span>3D semantic scene completion and 2D semantic segmentation are two tightly
correlated tasks that are both essential for indoor scene understanding,
because they predict the same semantic classes, using positively correlated
high-level features. Current methods use 2D features extracted from early-fused
RGB-D images for 2D segmentation to improve 3D scene completion. We argue that
this sequential scheme does not ensure these two tasks fully benefit each
other, and present an Iterative Mutual Enhancement Network (IMENet) to solve
them jointly, which interactively refines the two tasks at the late prediction
stage. Specifically, two refinement modules are developed under a unified
framework for the two tasks. The first is a 2D Deformable Context Pyramid (DCP)
module, which receives the projection from the current 3D predictions to refine
the 2D predictions. In turn, a 3D Deformable Depth Attention (DDA) module is
proposed to leverage the reprojected results from 2D predictions to update the
coarse 3D predictions. This iterative fusion happens to the stable high-level
features of both tasks at a late stage. Extensive experiments on NYU and NYUCAD

                                        <span>Building an interactive artificial intelligence that can ask questions about
the real world is one of the biggest challenges for vision and language
problems. In particular, goal-oriented visual dialogue, where the aim of the
agent is to seek information by asking questions during a turn-taking dialogue,
has been gaining scholarly attention recently. While several existing models
based on the GuessWhat?! dataset have been proposed, the Questioner typically
asks simple category-based questions or absolute spatial questions. This might
be problematic for complex scenes where the objects share attributes or in
cases where descriptive questions are required to distinguish objects. In this
paper, we propose a novel Questioner architecture, called Unified Questioner
Transformer (UniQer), for descriptive question generation with referring
expressions. In addition, we build a goal-oriented visual dialogue task called
CLEVR Ask. It synthesizes complex scenes that require the Questioner to
generate descriptive questions. We train our model with two variants of CLEVR
Ask datasets. The results of the quantitative and qualitative evaluations show
that UniQer outperforms the baseline.</span>

detection, suffer from exceedingly foreground-background imbalance.
Fortunately, modification of loss function appears to solve this puzzle once
and for all. In this paper, we propose a pixel-based adaptive weighted
cross-entropy loss in conjunction with Jaccard distance to facilitate
high-quality pixel-level road crack detection. Our work profoundly demonstrates
the influence of loss functions on detection outcomes, and sheds light on the
sophisticated consecutive improvements in the realm of crack detection.
Specifically, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed loss, we conduct
extensive experiments on four public databases, i.e., CrackForest, AigleRN,
Crack360, and BJN260. Compared with the vanilla weighted cross-entropy, the
proposed loss significantly speeds up the training process while retaining the
test accuracy.</span>

computer vision datasets. While the impact of label noise on learning in deep
neural networks has been studied in prior work, these studies have exclusively
focused on homogeneous label noise, i.e., the degree of label noise is the same
across all categories. However, in the real-world, label noise is often
heterogeneous, with some categories being affected to a greater extent than
others. Here, we address this gap in the literature. We hypothesized that
heterogeneous label noise would only affect the classes that had label noise
unless there was transfer from those classes to the classes without label
noise. To test this hypothesis, we designed a series of computer vision studies
using MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MS-COCO where we imposed heterogeneous
label noise during the training of multi-class, multi-task, and multi-label
systems. Our results provide evidence in support of our hypothesis: label noise
only affects the class affected by it unless there is transfer.</span>

technology for medical image analysis in the last decades. However, it still
remains challenging due to its distinctive complexity of acquiring and
annotating image data, extracting medical domain knowledge, and explaining the
diagnostic decision for medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose a
data-knowledge-driven framework termed as Parallel Medical Imaging (PMI) for
intelligent medical image analysis based on the methodology of interactive
ACP-based parallel intelligence. In the PMI framework, computational
experiments with predictive learning in a data-driven way are conducted to
extract medical knowledge for diagnostic decision support. Artificial imaging
systems are introduced to select and prescriptively generate medical image data
in a knowledge-driven way to utilize medical domain knowledge. Through the
closed-loop optimization based on parallel execution, our proposed PMI
framework can boost the generalization ability and alleviate the limitation of
medical interpretation for diagnostic decisions. Furthermore, we illustrate the
preliminary implementation of PMI method through the case studies of mammogram
analysis and skin lesion image analysis. Experimental results on several public
medical image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed PMI.</span>

acquisition is typically expensive and time-consuming, medium-quality images
are faster to acquire, at lower equipment costs, and available in larger

can leverage training data at multiple levels of quality (e.g., high and medium
quality) to improve performance while limiting costs of data curation. We apply
our mixed-supervision GAN to (i) super-resolve histopathology images and (ii)
enhance laparoscopy images by combining super-resolution and surgical smoke

as kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with different kernels. This
unification can be interpreted as eigenfunction learning or representation of
kernel in terms of distance matrix. Then, since the spectral methods are
unified as kernel PCA, we say let us learn the best kernel for unfolding the
manifold of data to its maximum variance. We first briefly introduce kernel
learning by SDP for the transduction task. Then, we explain MVU in detail.
Various versions of supervised MVU using nearest neighbors graph, by class-wise
unfolding, by Fisher criterion, and by colored MVU are explained. We also
explain out-of-sample extension of MVU using eigenfunctions and kernel mapping.
Finally, we introduce other variants of MVU including action respecting

imaging tasks such as attenuation correction, motion correction, undersampled
reconstruction, and denoising. Generative adversarial networks have been shown
to achieve the state-of-the-art in generating high fidelity images for these
tasks. However, the state-of-the-art GAN-based frameworks do not estimate the
uncertainty in the predictions made by the network that is essential for making
informed medical decisions and subsequent revision by medical experts and has
recently been shown to improve the performance and interpretability of the
model. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-guided progressive learning
scheme for image-to-image translation. By incorporating aleatoric uncertainty
as attention maps for GANs trained in a progressive manner, we generate images
of increasing fidelity progressively. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model
on three challenging medical image translation tasks, including PET to CT
translation, undersampled MRI reconstruction, and MRI motion artefact
correction. Our model generalizes well in three different tasks and improves
performance over state of the art under full-supervision and weak-supervision
with limited data. Code is released here:

method, which enables learning robust classifiers in presence of noisy data. To
achieve this goal, we propose a new adversarial regularization scheme based on
the Wasserstein distance. Using this distance allows taking into account
specific relations between classes by leveraging the geometric properties of
the labels space. Our Wasserstein Adversarial Regularization (WAR) encodes a
selective regularization, which promotes smoothness of the classifier between
some classes, while preserving sufficient complexity of the decision boundary
between others. We first discuss how and why adversarial regularization can be
used in the context of label noise and then show the effectiveness of our
method on five datasets corrupted with noisy labels: in both benchmarks and
real datasets, WAR outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.</span>

questions about them. Specifically, models need to incorporate a new modality
of text present in the images and reason over it to answer TextVQA questions.
In this challenge, we use generative model T5 for TextVQA task. Based on
pre-trained checkpoint T5-3B from HuggingFace repository, two other
pre-training tasks including masked language modeling(MLM) and relative
position prediction(RPP) are designed to better align object feature and scene
text. In the stage of pre-training, encoder is dedicate to handle the fusion
among multiple modalities: question text, object text labels, scene text
labels, object visual features, scene visual features. After that decoder
generates the text sequence step-by-step, cross entropy loss is required by
default. We use a large-scale scene text dataset in pre-training and then
fine-tune the T5-3B with the TextVQA dataset only.</span>

in coronal and sagittal views, which causes harm to diagnosis and image
post-processing. Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential to re-construct
the high-resolution (HR) thin-slice MR images from those low-resolution (LR)
cases, which we refer to as the slice interpolation task in this work. However,
since it is generally difficult to sample abundant paired LR-HR MR images, the
classical fully supervised DL-based models cannot be effectively trained to get
robust performance. To this end, we propose a novel Two-stage Self-supervised
Cycle-consistency Network (TSCNet) for MR slice interpolation, in which a
two-stage self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy is developed for unsupervised
DL network training. The paired LR-HR images are synthesized along the sagittal
and coronal directions of input LR images for network pretraining in the
first-stage SSL, and then a cyclic in-terpolation procedure based on triplet
axial slices is designed in the second-stage SSL for further refinement. More
training samples with rich contexts along all directions are exploited as
guidance to guarantee the improved in-terpolation performance. Moreover, a new
cycle-consistency constraint is proposed to supervise this cyclic procedure,
which encourages the network to reconstruct more realistic HR images. The
experimental results on a real MRI dataset indicate that TSCNet achieves
superior performance over the conventional and other SSL-based algorithms, and
obtains competitive quali-tative and quantitative results compared with the
fully supervised algorithm.</span>

                                        <span>Graph-based multi-view clustering has become an active topic due to the
efficiency in characterizing both the complex structure and relationship
between multimedia data. However, existing methods have the following
shortcomings: (1) They are inefficient or even fail for graph learning in large
scale due to the graph construction and eigen-decomposition. (2) They cannot
well exploit both the complementary information and spatial structure embedded
in graphs of different views. To well exploit complementary information and
tackle the scalability issue plaguing graph-based multi-view clustering, we
propose an efficient multiple graph learning model via a small number of anchor
points and tensor Schatten p-norm minimization. Specifically, we construct a
hidden and tractable large graph by anchor graph for each view and well exploit
complementary information embedded in anchor graphs of different views by
tensor Schatten p-norm regularizer. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm,
which scales linearly with the data size, to solve our proposed model.
Extensive experimental results on several datasets indicate that our proposed
method outperforms some state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms.</span>

benchmark, the network contains a Triple Attention module and Coarse-to-Fine
Regression module to improve the robustness and accuracy of 3D Detection.
However, since the original input data (point clouds) contains a lot of noise
during collecting the data, which will further affect the training of the
model. For example, the object is far from the robot, the sensor is difficult
to obtain enough pointcloud. If the objects only contains few point clouds, and
the samples are fed into model with the normal samples together during
training, the detector will be difficult to distinguish the individual with few
pointcloud belong to object or background. In this paper, we propose TANet++ to
improve the performance on 3D Detection, which adopt a novel training strategy
on training the TANet. In order to reduce the negative impact by the weak
samples, the training strategy previously filtered the training data, and then
the TANet++ is trained by the rest of data. The experimental results shows that

image from an abnormal one (e.g., with lesions), is critical in many
perspectives, from lesion detection, data augmentation to clinical surgery
suggestion. However, it is challenging to generate high-quality pseudo-normal
images in the absence of the lesion information. Thus, expensive lesion
segmentation data have been introduced to provide lesion information for the
generative models and improve the quality of the synthetic images. In this
paper, we aim to alleviate the need of a large amount of lesion segmentation
data when generating pseudo-normal images. We propose a Semi-supervised Medical
Image generative LEarning network (SMILE) which not only utilizes limited
medical images with segmentation masks, but also leverages massive medical
images without segmentation masks to generate realistic pseudo-normal images.
Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms the best state-of-the-art

images. Moreover, the proposed semi-supervised learning achieves comparable
medical image synthesis quality with supervised learning model, using only 50

learning problems in an energy-efficient manner. However, they are still
limited to simple classification tasks. In this paper, we propose Spiking-GAN,
the first spike-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). It employs a kind
of temporal coding scheme called time-to-first-spike coding. We train it using
approximate backpropagation in the temporal domain. We use simple
integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons with very high refractory period for our
network which ensures a maximum of one spike per neuron. This makes the model
much sparser than a spike rate-based system. Our modified temporal loss
function called &#x27;Aggressive TTFS&#x27; improves the inference time of the network by
over 33% and reduces the number of spikes in the network by more than 11%
compared to previous works. Our experiments show that on training the network
on the MNIST dataset using this approach, we can generate high quality samples.
Thereby demonstrating the potential of this framework for solving such problems

adopts the single-step adversarial training for quickly developing
adversarially robust models. However, the single-step adversarial training is
most likely to cause catastrophic overfitting, as after a few training epochs
it will be hard to generate strong adversarial examples to continuously boost
the adversarial robustness. In this work, we aim to avoid the catastrophic
overfitting by introducing multi-step adversarial examples during the
single-step adversarial training. Then, to balance the large training overhead
of generating multi-step adversarial examples, we propose a Multi-stage
Optimization based Adversarial Training (MOAT) method that periodically trains
the model on mixed benign examples, single-step adversarial examples, and
multi-step adversarial examples stage by stage. In this way, the overall
training overhead is reduced significantly, meanwhile, the model could avoid
catastrophic overfitting. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets demonstrate that under similar amount of training overhead, the
proposed MOAT exhibits better robustness than either single-step or multi-step
adversarial training methods.</span>

when implemented in low-energy computing platforms as required in many
industrial applications. Herein, a framework for optimizing compact LB-CNN is
introduced and its effectiveness is evaluated. The framework is freely
available and may run on free-access cloud platforms, thus requiring no major
investments. The optimized model is saved in the standardized .h5 format and
can be used as input to specialized tools for further deployment into specific
technologies, thus enabling the rapid development of various intelligent image
sensors. The main ingredient in accelerating the optimization of our model,
particularly the selection of binary convolution kernels, is the Chainer/Cupy
machine learning library offering significant speed-ups for training the output
layer as an extreme-learning machine. Additional training of the output layer
using Keras/Tensorflow is included, as it allows an increase in accuracy.
Results for widely used datasets including MNIST, GTSRB, ORL, VGG show very
good compromise between accuracy and complexity. Particularly, for face

                                        <span>We provide a probabilistic interpretation of attention and show that the
standard dot-product attention in transformers is a special case of Maximum A
Posteriori (MAP) inference. The proposed approach suggests the use of
Expectation Maximization algorithms for online adaptation of key and value
model parameters. This approach is useful for cases in which external agents,
e.g., annotators, provide inference-time information about the correct values
of some tokens, e.g, the semantic category of some pixels, and we need for this
new information to propagate to other tokens in a principled manner. We
illustrate the approach on an interactive semantic segmentation task in which
annotators and models collaborate online to improve annotation efficiency.
Using standard benchmarks, we observe that key adaptation boosts model
performance ($\sim10\%$ mIoU) in the low feedback regime and value propagation
improves model responsiveness in the high feedback regime. A PyTorch layer
implementation of our probabilistic attention model will be made publicly
available.</span>

                                        <span>Scene text image super-resolution (STISR) aims to improve the resolution and
visual quality of low-resolution (LR) scene text images, and consequently boost
the performance of text recognition. However, most of existing STISR methods
regard text images as natural scene images, ignoring the categorical
information of text. In this paper, we make an inspiring attempt to embed
categorical text prior into STISR model training. Specifically, we adopt the
character probability sequence as the text prior, which can be obtained
conveniently from a text recognition model. The text prior provides categorical
guidance to recover high-resolution (HR) text images. On the other hand, the
reconstructed HR image can refine the text prior in return. Finally, we present
a multi-stage text prior guided super-resolution (TPGSR) framework for STISR.
Our experiments on the benchmark TextZoom dataset show that TPGSR can not only
effectively improve the visual quality of scene text images, but also
significantly improve the text recognition accuracy over existing STISR
methods. Our model trained on TextZoom also demonstrates certain generalization
capability to the LR images in other datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Image inpainting is one of the important tasks in computer vision which
focuses on the reconstruction of missing regions in an image. The aim of this
paper is to introduce an image inpainting model based on Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Imputation Network. The generator network of the model uses
building blocks of convolutional layers with different dilation rates, together
with skip connections that help the model reproduce fine details of the output.
This combination yields a universal imputation model that is able to handle
various scenarios of missingness with sufficient quality. To show this
experimentally, the model is simultaneously trained to deal with three
scenarios given by missing pixels at random, missing various smaller square
regions, and one missing square placed in the center of the image. It turns out
that our model achieves high-quality inpainting results on all scenarios.
Performance is evaluated using peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural
similarity index on two real-world benchmark datasets, CelebA faces and Paris
StreetView. The results of our model are compared to biharmonic imputation and
to some of the other state-of-the-art image inpainting methods.</span>

                                        <span>We study a practical domain adaptation task, called source-free unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) problem, in which we cannot access source domain data
due to data privacy issues but only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled
target data are available. This task, however, is very difficult due to one key
challenge: the lack of source data and target domain labels makes model
adaptation very challenging. To address this, we propose to mine the hidden
knowledge in the source model and exploit it to generate source avatar
prototypes (i.e., representative features for each source class) as well as
target pseudo labels for domain alignment. To this end, we propose a
Contrastive Prototype Generation and Adaptation (CPGA) method. Specifically,
CPGA consists of two stages: (1) prototype generation: by exploring the
classification boundary information of the source model, we train a prototype
generator to generate avatar prototypes via contrastive learning. (2) prototype
adaptation: based on the generated source prototypes and target pseudo labels,
we develop a new robust contrastive prototype adaptation strategy to align each
pseudo-labeled target data to the corresponding source prototypes. Extensive
experiments on three UDA benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of the proposed method.</span>

                                        <span>With the goal of making deep learning more label-efficient, a growing number
of papers have been studying active learning (AL) for deep models. However,
there are a number of issues in the prevalent experimental settings, mainly
stemming from a lack of unified implementation and benchmarking. Issues in the
current literature include sometimes contradictory observations on the
performance of different AL algorithms, unintended exclusion of important
generalization approaches such as data augmentation and SGD for optimization, a
lack of study of evaluation facets like the labeling efficiency of AL, and
little or no clarity on the scenarios in which AL outperforms random sampling
(RS). In this work, we present a unified re-implementation of state-of-the-art
AL algorithms in the context of image classification, and we carefully study
these issues as facets of effective evaluation. On the positive side, we show
that AL techniques are 2x to 4x more label-efficient compared to RS with the
use of data augmentation. Surprisingly, when data augmentation is included,
there is no longer a consistent gain in using BADGE, a state-of-the-art
approach, over simple uncertainty sampling. We then do a careful analysis of
how existing approaches perform with varying amounts of redundancy and number
of examples per class. Finally, we provide several insights for AL
practitioners to consider in future work, such as the effect of the AL batch
size, the effect of initialization, the importance of retraining a new model at
every round, and other insights.</span>

restoration using patch-based prior distributions. While Monte Carlo techniques
are classically used to sample from intractable posterior distributions, they
can suffer from scalability issues in high-dimensional inference problems such
as image restoration. To address this issue, EP is used here to approximate the
posterior distributions using products of multivariate Gaussian densities.
Moreover, imposing structural constraints on the covariance matrices of these
densities allows for greater scalability and distributed computation. While the
method is naturally suited to handle additive Gaussian observation noise, it
can also be extended to non-Gaussian noise. Experiments conducted for
denoising, inpainting and deconvolution problems with Gaussian and Poisson
noise illustrate the potential benefits of such flexible approximate Bayesian
method for uncertainty quantification in imaging problems, at a reduced
computational cost compared to sampling techniques.</span>

such as the variation in illumination conditions and poses. Convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used to perform intelligent visual
object recognition. Yet, CNNs still suffer from severe accuracy degradation,
particularly on illumination-variant datasets. To address this problem, we
propose a new CNN method based on orientation fusion for visual object
recognition. The proposed cloud-based video analytics system pioneers the use
of bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition to split a video frame into
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). We further propose these IMFs to endure Reisz
transform to produce monogenic object components, which are in turn used for
the training of CNNs. Past works have demonstrated how the object orientation
component may be used to pursue accuracy levels as high as 93\%. Herein we
demonstrate how a feature-fusion strategy of the orientation components leads
to further improving visual recognition accuracy to 97\%. We also assess the
scalability of our method, looking at both the number and the size of the video
streams under scrutiny. We carry out extensive experimentation on the publicly
available Yale dataset, including also a self generated video datasets, finding
significant improvements (both in accuracy and scale), in comparison to
AlexNet, LeNet and SE-ResNeXt, which are the three most commonly used deep
learning models for visual object recognition and classification.</span>

                                        <span>3D model generation from single 2D RGB images is a challenging and actively
researched computer vision task. Various techniques using conventional network
architectures have been proposed for the same. However, the body of research
work is limited and there are various issues like using inefficient 3D
representation formats, weak 3D model generation backbones, inability to
generate dense point clouds, dependence of post-processing for generation of
dense point clouds, and dependence on silhouettes in RGB images. In this paper,
a novel 2D RGB image to point cloud conversion technique is proposed, which
improves the state of art in the field due to its efficient, robust and simple
model by using the concept of parallelization in network architecture. It not
only uses the efficient and rich 3D representation of point clouds, but also
uses a novel and robust point cloud generation backbone in order to address the
prevalent issues. This involves using a single-encoder multiple-decoder deep
network architecture wherein each decoder generates certain fixed viewpoints.
This is followed by fusing all the viewpoints to generate a dense point cloud.
Various experiments are conducted on the technique and its performance is
compared with those of other state of the art techniques and impressive gains
in performance are demonstrated. Code is available at

                                        <span>Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has developed into a prominent tool for
adaptive, scale-based signal analysis in various fields like robotics, security
and biomedical engineering. Since the dramatic increase in amount of data puts
forward higher requirements for the capability of real-time signal analysis, it
is difficult for existing EMD and its variants to trade off the growth of data
dimension and the speed of signal analysis. In order to decompose
multi-dimensional signals at a faster speed, we present a novel
signal-serialization method (serial-EMD), which concatenates multi-variate or
multi-dimensional signals into a one-dimensional signal and uses various
one-dimensional EMD algorithms to decompose it. To verify the effects of the
proposed method, synthetic multi-variate time series, artificial 2D images with
various textures and real-world facial images are tested. Compared with
existing multi-EMD algorithms, the decomposition time becomes significantly
reduced. In addition, the results of facial recognition with Intrinsic Mode
Functions (IMFs) extracted using our method can achieve a higher accuracy than
those obtained by existing multi-EMD algorithms, which demonstrates the
superior performance of our method in terms of the quality of IMFs.
Furthermore, this method can provide a new perspective to optimize the existing
EMD algorithms, that is, transforming the structure of the input signal rather
than being constrained by developing envelope computation techniques or signal
decomposition methods. In summary, the study suggests that the serial-EMD
technique is a highly competitive and fast alternative for multi-dimensional
signal analysis.</span>

and consistent performance by professional forensic face examiners and others
who perform face identification tasks in applied scenarios. Current proficiency
tests rely on static sets of stimulus items, and so, cannot be administered
validly to the same individual multiple times. To create a proficiency test, a
large number of items of &quot;known&quot; difficulty must be assembled. Multiple tests
of equal difficulty can be constructed then using subsets of items. Here, we
introduce a proficiency test, the Triad Identity Matching (TIM) test, based on
stimulus difficulty measures based on Item Response Theory (IRT). Participants
view face-image &quot;triads&quot; (N&#x3D;225) (two images of one identity and one image of a
different identity) and select the different identity. In Experiment 1,
university students (N&#x3D;197) showed wide-ranging accuracy on the TIM test.
Furthermore, IRT modeling demonstrated that the TIM test produces items of
various difficulty levels. In Experiment 2, IRT-based item difficulty measures
were used to partition the TIM test into three equally &quot;easy&quot; and three equally
&quot;difficult&quot; subsets. Simulation results indicated that the full set, as well as
curated subsets, of the TIM items yielded reliable estimates of subject
ability. In summary, the TIM test can provide a starting point for developing a
framework that is flexible, calibrated, and adaptive to measure proficiency
across various ability levels (e.g., professionals or populations with face
processing deficits)</span>

difficult due to the large number of frames to consider and the high costs of
running convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on each one. A natural solution is
to perform a subset of the necessary computations ahead of time, as video is
ingested. However, existing ingest-time systems require knowledge of the
specific CNN that will be used in future queries -- a challenging requisite
given the evergrowing space of CNN architectures and training
datasets/methodologies.

This paper presents Boggart, a retrospective video analytics system that
delivers ingest-time speedups in a model-agnostic manner. Our underlying
insight is that traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms are capable of
performing computations that can be used to accelerate diverse queries with
wide-ranging CNNs. Building on this, at ingest-time, Boggart carefully employs
a variety of motion tracking algorithms to identify potential objects and their
trajectories across frames. Then, at query-time, Boggart uses several novel
techniques to collect the smallest sample of CNN results required to meet the
target accuracy: (1) a clustering strategy to efficiently unearth the
inevitable discrepancies between CV- and CNN-generated outputs, and (2) a set
of accuracy-preserving propagation techniques to safely extend sampled results
along each trajectory. Across many videos, CNNs, and queries Boggart
consistently meets accuracy targets while using CNNs sparingly (on 3-54% of
frames).</span>

data have been heavily studied recently. However, the generalization ability of
deep models on complex real-world HAR data is limited by the availability of
high-quality labeled activity data, which are hard to obtain. In this paper, we
design a similarity embedding neural network that maps input sensor signals
onto real vectors through carefully designed convolutional and LSTM layers. The
embedding network is trained with a pairwise similarity loss, encouraging the
clustering of samples from the same class in the embedded real space, and can
be effectively trained on a small dataset and even on a noisy dataset with
mislabeled samples. Based on the learned embeddings, we further propose both
nonparametric and parametric approaches for activity recognition. Extensive
evaluation based on two public datasets has shown that the proposed similarity
embedding network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep models on HAR
classification tasks, is robust to mislabeled samples in the training set, and
can also be used to effectively denoise a noisy dataset.</span>

(MFR) held within the 2021 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB
2021). The competition attracted a total of 10 participating teams with valid
submissions. The affiliations of these teams are diverse and associated with
academia and industry in nine different countries. These teams successfully
submitted 18 valid solutions. The competition is designed to motivate solutions
aiming at enhancing the face recognition accuracy of masked faces. Moreover,
the competition considered the deployability of the proposed solutions by
taking the compactness of the face recognition models into account. A private
dataset representing a collaborative, multi-session, real masked, capture
scenario is used to evaluate the submitted solutions. In comparison to one of
the top-performing academic face recognition solutions, 10 out of the 18
submitted solutions did score higher masked face verification accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>We focus on electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), aiming to improve
access and expand their utility, since more than 6 million are publicly
available, and they constitute an important corpus to aid research and
education across disciplines. The corpus is growing as new born-digital
documents are included, and since millions of older theses and dissertations
have been converted to digital form to be disseminated electronically in
institutional repositories. In ETDs, as with other scholarly works, figures and
tables can communicate a large amount of information in a concise way. Although
methods have been proposed for extracting figures and tables from born-digital
PDFs, they do not work well with scanned ETDs. Considering this problem, our
assessment of state-of-the-art figure extraction systems is that the reason
they do not function well on scanned PDFs is that they have only been trained
on born-digital documents. To address this limitation, we present ScanBank, a
new dataset containing 10 thousand scanned page images, manually labeled by
humans as to the presence of the 3.3 thousand figures or tables found therein.
We use this dataset to train a deep neural network model based on YOLOv5 to
accurately extract figures and tables from scanned ETDs. We pose and answer
important research questions aimed at finding better methods for figure
extraction from scanned documents. One of those concerns the value for
training, of data augmentation techniques applied to born-digital documents
which are used to train models better suited for figure extraction from scanned
documents. To the best of our knowledge, ScanBank is the first manually
annotated dataset for figure and table extraction for scanned ETDs. A
YOLOv5-based model, trained on ScanBank, outperforms existing comparable
open-source and freely available baseline methods by a considerable margin.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning approaches are nowadays ubiquitously used to tackle computer
vision tasks such as semantic segmentation, requiring large datasets and
substantial computational power. Continual learning for semantic segmentation
(CSS) is an emerging trend that consists in updating an old model by
sequentially adding new classes. However, continual learning methods are
usually prone to catastrophic forgetting. This issue is further aggravated in
CSS where, at each step, old classes from previous iterations are collapsed
into the background. In this paper, we propose Local POD, a multi-scale pooling
distillation scheme that preserves long- and short-range spatial relationships
at feature level. Furthermore, we design an entropy-based pseudo-labelling of
the background w.r.t. classes predicted by the old model to deal with
background shift and avoid catastrophic forgetting of the old classes. Finally,
we introduce a novel rehearsal method that is particularly suited for
segmentation. Our approach, called PLOP, significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in existing CSS scenarios, as well as in newly
proposed challenging benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the problem of predicting the future path of a pedestrian using
its motion history and the motion history of the surrounding pedestrians,
called social information. Since the seminal paper on Social-LSTM,
deep-learning has become the main tool used to model the impact of social
interactions on a pedestrian&#x27;s motion. The demonstration that these models can
learn social interactions relies on an ablative study of these models. The
models are compared with and without their social interactions module on two
standard metrics, the Average Displacement Error and Final Displacement Error.
Yet, these complex models were recently outperformed by a simple
constant-velocity approach. This questions if they actually allow to model
social interactions as well as the validity of the proof. In this paper, we
focus on the deep-learning models with a soft-attention mechanism for social
interaction modeling and study whether they use social information at
prediction time. We conduct two experiments across four state-of-the-art
approaches on the ETH and UCY datasets, which were also used in previous work.
First, the models are trained by replacing the social information with random
noise and compared to model trained with actual social information. Second, we
use a gating mechanism along with a $L_0$ penalty, allowing models to shut down
their inner components. The models consistently learn to prune their
soft-attention mechanism. For both experiments, neither the course of the
convergence nor the prediction performance were altered. This demonstrates that
the soft-attention mechanism and therefore the social information are ignored
by the models.</span>

                                        <span>Automatically evaluating the quality of image captions can be very
challenging since human language is quite flexible that there can be various
expressions for the same meaning. Most of the current captioning metrics rely
on token level matching between candidate caption and the ground truth label
sentences. It usually neglects the sentence-level information. Motivated by the
auto-encoder mechanism and contrastive representation learning advances, we
propose a learning-based metric for image captioning, which we call Intrinsic
Image Captioning Evaluation($I^2CE$). We develop three progressive model
structures to learn the sentence level representations--single branch model,
dual branches model, and triple branches model. Our empirical tests show that
$I^2CE$ trained with dual branches structure achieves better consistency with
human judgments to contemporary image captioning evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, We select several state-of-the-art image captioning models and
test their performances on the MS COCO dataset concerning both contemporary
metrics and the proposed $I^2CE$. Experiment results show that our proposed
method can align well with the scores generated from other contemporary
metrics. On this concern, the proposed metric could serve as a novel indicator
of the intrinsic information between captions, which may be complementary to
the existing ones.</span>

conceptual one incorporating both behavior and data. It should therefore model
actors, devices, tools, their complex interactions and data flow. To capture
and model these, we take advantage of the latest computer vision methodologies
for generating 3D scene graphs from camera views. We then introduce the
Multimodal Semantic Scene Graph (MSSG) which aims at providing a unified
symbolic, spatiotemporal and semantic representation of surgical procedures.
This methodology aims at modeling the relationship between different components
in surgical domain including medical staff, imaging systems, and surgical
devices, opening the path towards holistic understanding and modeling of
surgical procedures. We then use MSSG to introduce a dynamically generated
graphical user interface tool for surgical procedure analysis which could be
used for many applications including process optimization, OR design and
automatic report generation. We finally demonstrate that the proposed MSSGs
could also be used for synchronizing different complex surgical procedures.
While the system still needs to be integrated into real operating rooms before
getting validated, this conference paper aims mainly at providing the community
with the basic principles of this novel concept through a first prototypal
partial realization based on MVOR dataset.</span>

behavior recognition makes an increasing demand for multi-person pose
estimation-based applications, especially on mobile platforms. However, to
achieve high accuracy, state-of-the-art methods tend to have a large model size

multi-person pose estimation on mobile devices. With our optimization
framework, we achieve up to 2.51x faster model inference speed with higher
accuracy compared to representative lightweight multi-person pose estimator.</span>

second -- following the first very successful ABAW Competition held in
conjunction with IEEE FG 2020- Competition that aims at automatically analyzing
affect. ABAW2 is split into three Challenges, each one addressing one of the
three main behavior tasks of valence-arousal estimation, basic expression
classification and action unit detection. All three Challenges are based on a
common benchmark database, Aff-Wild2, which is a large scale in-the-wild
database and the first one to be annotated for all these three tasks. In this
paper, we describe this Competition, to be held in conjunction with ICCV 2021.
We present the three Challenges, with the utilized Competition corpora. We
outline the evaluation metrics and present the baseline system with its
results. More information regarding the Competition is provided in the

                                        <span>Domain generalization in person re-identification is a highly important
meaningful and practical task in which a model trained with data from several
source domains is expected to generalize well to unseen target domains. Domain
adversarial learning is a promising domain generalization method that aims to
remove domain information in the latent representation through adversarial
training. However, in person re-identification, the domain and class are
correlated, and we theoretically show that domain adversarial learning will
lose certain information about class due to this domain-class correlation.
Inspired by casual inference, we propose to perform interventions to the domain
factor $d$, aiming to decompose the domain-class correlation. To achieve this
goal, we proposed estimating the resulting representation $z^{*}$ caused by the
intervention through first- and second-order statistical characteristic
matching. Specifically, we build a memory bank to restore the statistical
characteristics of each domain. Then, we use the newly generated samples
$\{z^{*},y,d^{*}\}$ to compute the loss function. These samples are
domain-class correlation decomposed; thus, we can learn a domain-invariant
representation that can capture more class-related features. Extensive
experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the
large-scale domain generalization Re-ID benchmark.</span>

that draw upon the content of 3D models of urban scenes. Such 3D models can be
used to visualize city images at multiple scales from individual buildings to
entire cities prior to and after a change has occurred. This ability is of
great importance in day-to-day work and special projects undertaken by
planners, geo-designers, and architects. In this research, we implemented a
novel approach to 3D building models for such matter, which included the
integration of geographic information systems (GIS) and 3D Computer Graphics
(3DCG) components that generate 3D house models from building footprints
(polygons), and the automated generation of simple and complex roof geometries
for rapid roof area damage reporting. These polygons (footprints) are usually
orthogonal. A complicated orthogonal polygon can be partitioned into a set of
rectangles. The proposed GIS and 3DCG integrated system partitions orthogonal
building polygons into a set of rectangles and places rectangular roofs and
box-shaped building bodies on these rectangles. Since technicians are drawing
these polygons manually with digitizers, depending on aerial photos, not all
building polygons are precisely orthogonal. But, when placing a set of boxes as
building bodies for creating the buildings, there may be gaps or overlaps
between these boxes if building polygons are not precisely orthogonal. In our
proposal, after approximately orthogonal building polygons are partitioned and
rectified into a set of mutually orthogonal rectangles, each rectangle knows
which rectangle is adjacent to and which edge of the rectangle is adjacent to,
which will avoid unwanted intersection of windows and doors when building
bodies combined.</span>

or overfitting in the presence of noisily labelled data. For the problem of
robust learning under such noisy data, several algorithms have been proposed. A
prominent class of algorithms rely on sample selection strategies, motivated by
curriculum learning. For example, many algorithms use the &#x60;small loss trick&#x27;
wherein a fraction of samples with loss values below a certain threshold are
selected for training. These algorithms are sensitive to such thresholds, and
it is difficult to fix or learn these thresholds. Often, these algorithms also
require information such as label noise rates which are typically unavailable
in practice. In this paper, we propose a data-dependent, adaptive sample
selection strategy that relies only on batch statistics of a given mini-batch
to provide robustness against label noise. The algorithm does not have any
additional hyperparameters for sample selection, does not need any information
on noise rates, and does not need access to separate data with clean labels. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on benchmark
datasets.</span>

vasculature allows to navigate endovascular devices in minimally invasive
neuro-vascular treatment, while reducing the usage of harmful iodine contrast
medium. The alignment of the fluoroscopy images and the 3D reconstruction is
initialized using the sensor information of the X-ray C-arm geometry. Patient
motion is then corrected by an image-based registration algorithm, based on a
gradient difference similarity measure using digital reconstructed radiographs
of the 3D reconstruction. This algorithm does not require the vessels in the
fluoroscopy image to be filled with iodine contrast agent, but rather relies on
gradients in the image (bone structures, sinuses) as landmark features. This
paper investigates the accuracy, robustness and computation time aspects of the
image-based registration algorithm. Using phantom experiments 97% of the
registration attempts passed the success criterion of a residual registration
error of less than 1 mm translation and 3{\deg} rotation. The paper establishes
a new method for validation of 2D-3D registration without requiring changes to
the clinical workflow, such as attaching fiducial markers. As a consequence,
this method can be retrospectively applied to pre-existing clinical data. For
clinical data experiments, 87% of the registration attempts passed the
criterion of a residual translational error of &lt; 1 mm, and 84% possessed a

components, i.e. albedo, normal and lighting. To solve this ill-posed problem
from single image, state-of-the-art methods in shape from shading mostly resort
to supervised training on all the components on either synthetic or real
datasets. Here, we propose a new self-supervised training paradigm that 1)
reduces the need for full supervision on the decomposition task and 2) takes
into account the relighting task. We introduce new self-supervised loss terms
that leverage the consistencies between multi-lit images (images of the same
scene under different illuminations). Our approach is applicable to multi-lit
datasets. We apply our training approach in two settings: 1) train on a mixture
of synthetic and real data, 2) train on real datasets with limited supervision.
We show-case the effectiveness of our training paradigm on both intrinsic
decomposition and relighting and demonstrate how the model struggles in both
tasks without the self-supervised loss terms in limited supervision settings.
We provide results of comprehensive experiments on SfSNet, CelebA and Photoface

learning tasks due to their translation equivariance property. Recent work has
generalized the traditional convolutional layer of a convolutional neural
network to non-Euclidean spaces and shown group equivariance of the generalized
convolution operation. In this paper, we present a novel higher order Volterra
convolutional neural network (VolterraNet) for data defined as samples of
functions on Riemannian homogeneous spaces. Analagous to the result for
traditional convolutions, we prove that the Volterra functional convolutions
are equivariant to the action of the isometry group admitted by the Riemannian
homogeneous spaces, and under some restrictions, any non-linear equivariant
function can be expressed as our homogeneous space Volterra convolution,
generalizing the non-linear shift equivariant characterization of Volterra
expansions in Euclidean space. We also prove that second order functional
convolution operations can be represented as cascaded convolutions which leads
to an efficient implementation. Beyond this, we also propose a dilated
VolterraNet model. These advances lead to large parameter reductions relative
to baseline non-Euclidean CNNs. To demonstrate the efficacy of the VolterraNet
performance, we present several real data experiments involving classification
tasks on spherical-MNIST, atomic energy, Shrec17 data sets, and group testing
on diffusion MRI data. Performance comparisons to the state-of-the-art are also

                                        <span>In sparse coding, we attempt to extract features of input vectors, assuming
that the data is inherently structured as a sparse superposition of basic
building blocks. Similarly, neural networks perform a given task by learning
features of the training data set. Recently both data-driven and model-driven
feature extracting methods have become extremely popular and have achieved
remarkable results. Nevertheless, practical implementations are often too slow
to be employed in real-life scenarios, especially for real-time applications.
We propose a speed-up upgraded version of the classic iterative thresholding
algorithm, that produces a good approximation of the convolutional sparse code
within 2-5 iterations. The speed advantage is gained mostly from the
observation that most solvers are slowed down by inefficient global
thresholding. The main idea is to normalize each data point by the local
receptive field energy, before applying a threshold. This way, the natural
inclination towards strong feature expressions is suppressed, so that one can
rely on a global threshold that can be easily approximated, or learned during
training. The proposed algorithm can be employed with a known predetermined
dictionary, or with a trained dictionary. The trained version is implemented as
a neural net designed as the unfolding of the proposed solver. The performance
of the proposed solution is demonstrated via the seismic inversion problem in
both synthetic and real data scenarios. We also provide theoretical guarantees
for a stable support recovery. Namely, we prove that under certain conditions
the true support is perfectly recovered within the first iteration.</span>

photovoltaic systems is a time-consuming process that requires on-site
measurements, a difficult task to achieve on a large scale. In this paper, we
present an approach to estimate the solar potential of rooftops based on their
location and architectural characteristics, as well as the amount of solar
radiation they receive annually. Our technique uses computer vision to achieve
semantic segmentation of roof sections and roof objects on the one hand, and a
machine learning model based on structured building features to predict roof
pitch on the other hand. We then compute the azimuth and maximum number of
solar panels that can be installed on a rooftop with geometric approaches.
Finally, we compute precise shading masks and combine them with solar
irradiation data that enables us to estimate the yearly solar potential of a
rooftop.</span>

like deep learning, have helped the automatic grading of colorectal
adenocarcinoma cancer (CRA). Present automated CRA grading methods, however,
usually use tiny image patches and thus fail to integrate the entire tissue
micro-architecture for grading purposes. To tackle these challenges, we propose
to use a statistical network analysis method to describe the complex structure
of the tissue micro-environment by modelling nuclei and their connections as a
network. We show that by analyzing only the interactions between the cells in a
network, we can extract highly discriminative statistical features for CRA
grading. Unlike other deep learning or convolutional graph-based approaches,
our method is highly scalable (can be used for cell networks consist of
millions of nodes), completely explainable, and computationally inexpensive. We
create cell networks on a broad CRC histology image dataset, experiment with
our method, and report state-of-the-art performance for the prediction of
three-class CRA grading.</span>

threatened by a rise in human-elephant conflict and poaching. Monitoring
population dynamics is essential in conservation efforts; however, tracking
elephants is a difficult task, usually relying on the invasive and sometimes
dangerous placement of GPS collars. Although there have been many recent
successes in the use of computer vision techniques for automated identification
of other species, identification of elephants is extremely difficult and

                                        <span>Face sketch synthesis has made significant progress with the development of
deep neural networks in these years. The delicate depiction of sketch portraits
facilitates a wide range of applications like digital entertainment and law
enforcement. However, accurate and realistic face sketch generation is still a
challenging task due to the illumination variations and complex backgrounds in
the real scenes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Semantic-Driven
Generative Adversarial Network (SDGAN) which embeds global structure-level
style injection and local class-level knowledge re-weighting. Specifically, we
conduct facial saliency detection on the input face photos to provide overall
facial texture structure, which could be used as a global type of prior
information. In addition, we exploit face parsing layouts as the semantic-level
spatial prior to enforce globally structural style injection in the generator
of SDGAN. Furthermore, to enhance the realistic effect of the details, we
propose a novel Adaptive Re-weighting Loss (ARLoss) which dedicates to balance
the contributions of different semantic classes. Experimentally, our extensive
experiments on CUFS and CUFSF datasets show that our proposed algorithm
achieves state-of-the-art performance.</span>

                                        <span>The last-generation video conferencing software allows users to utilize a
virtual background to conceal their personal environment due to privacy
concerns, especially in official meetings with other employers. On the other
hand, users maybe want to fool people in the meeting by considering the virtual
background to conceal where they are. In this case, developing tools to
understand the virtual background utilize for fooling people in meeting plays
an important role. Besides, such detectors must prove robust against different
kinds of attacks since a malicious user can fool the detector by applying a set
of adversarial editing steps on the video to conceal any revealing footprint.
In this paper, we study the feasibility of an efficient tool to detect whether
a videoconferencing user background is real. In particular, we provide the
first tool which computes pixel co-occurrences matrices and uses them to search
for inconsistencies among spectral and spatial bands. Our experiments confirm
that cross co-occurrences matrices improve the robustness of the detector
against different kinds of attacks. This work&#x27;s performance is especially
noteworthy with regard to color SPAM features. Moreover, the performance
especially is significant with regard to robustness versus post-processing,
like geometric transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, and JPEG
compression with different quality factors.</span>

a baseline for future investigations on document enhancement using deep

                                        <span>Temporal action detection (TAD) is a challenging task which aims to
temporally localize and recognize the human action in untrimmed videos. Current
mainstream one-stage TAD approaches localize and classify action proposals
relying on pre-defined anchors, where the location and scale for action
instances are set by designers. Obviously, such an anchor-based TAD method
limits its generalization capability and will lead to performance degradation
when videos contain rich action variation. In this study, we explore to remove
the requirement of pre-defined anchors for TAD methods. A novel TAD model
termed as Selective Receptive Field Network (SRF-Net) is developed, in which
the location offsets and classification scores at each temporal location can be
directly estimated in the feature map and SRF-Net is trained in an end-to-end
manner. Innovatively, a building block called Selective Receptive Field
Convolution (SRFC) is dedicatedly designed which is able to adaptively adjust
its receptive field size according to multiple scales of input information at
each temporal location in the feature map. Extensive experiments are conducted
on the THUMOS14 dataset, and superior results are reported comparing to

                                        <span>We show that cascaded diffusion models are capable of generating high
fidelity images on the class-conditional ImageNet generation challenge, without
any assistance from auxiliary image classifiers to boost sample quality. A
cascaded diffusion model comprises a pipeline of multiple diffusion models that
generate images of increasing resolution, beginning with a standard diffusion
model at the lowest resolution, followed by one or more super-resolution
diffusion models that successively upsample the image and add higher resolution
details. We find that the sample quality of a cascading pipeline relies
crucially on conditioning augmentation, our proposed method of data
augmentation of the lower resolution conditioning inputs to the
super-resolution models. Our experiments show that conditioning augmentation
prevents compounding error during sampling in a cascaded model, helping us to
train cascading pipelines achieving FID scores of 1.48 at 64x64, 3.52 at
128x128 and 4.88 at 256x256 resolutions, outperforming BigGAN-deep.</span>

                                        <span>3D LiDAR (light detection and ranging) based semantic segmentation is
important in scene understanding for many applications, such as auto-driving
and robotics. For example, for autonomous cars equipped with RGB cameras and
LiDAR, it is crucial to fuse complementary information from different sensors
for robust and accurate segmentation. Existing fusion-based methods, however,
may not achieve promising performance due to the vast difference between two
modalities. In this work, we investigate a collaborative fusion scheme called
perception-aware multi-sensor fusion (PMF) to exploit perceptual information
from two modalities, namely, appearance information from RGB images and
spatio-depth information from point clouds. To this end, we first project point
clouds to the camera coordinates to provide spatio-depth information for RGB
images. Then, we propose a two-stream network to extract features from the two
modalities, separately, and fuse the features by effective residual-based
fusion modules. Moreover, we propose additional perception-aware losses to
measure the great perceptual difference between the two modalities. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark data sets show the superiority of our method. For
example, on nuScenes, our PMF outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.8%
in mIoU.</span>

                                        <span>Omnidirectional lighting provides the foundation for achieving
spatially-variant photorealistic 3D rendering, a desirable property for mobile
augmented reality applications. However, in practice, estimating
omnidirectional lighting can be challenging due to limitations such as partial
panoramas of the rendering positions, and the inherent environment lighting and
mobile user dynamics. A new opportunity arises recently with the advancements
in mobile 3D vision, including built-in high-accuracy depth sensors and deep
learning-powered algorithms, which provide the means to better sense and
understand the physical surroundings. Centering the key idea of 3D vision, in
this work, we design an edge-assisted framework called Xihe to provide mobile
AR applications the ability to obtain accurate omnidirectional lighting
estimation in real time. Specifically, we develop a novel sampling technique
that efficiently compresses the raw point cloud input generated at the mobile
device. This technique is derived based on our empirical analysis of a recent
3D indoor dataset and plays a key role in our 3D vision-based lighting
estimator pipeline design. To achieve the real-time goal, we develop a tailored
GPU pipeline for on-device point cloud processing and use an encoding technique
that reduces network transmitted bytes. Finally, we present an adaptive
triggering strategy that allows Xihe to skip unnecessary lighting estimations
and a practical way to provide temporal coherent rendering integration with the
mobile AR ecosystem. We evaluate both the lighting estimation accuracy and time
of Xihe using a reference mobile application developed with Xihe&#x27;s APIs. Our
results show that Xihe takes as fast as 20.67ms per lighting estimation and
achieves 9.4% better estimation accuracy than a state-of-the-art neural
network.</span>

                                        <span>Depth perception is fundamental for robots to understand the surrounding
environment. As the view of cognitive neuroscience, visual depth perception
methods are divided into three categories, namely binocular, active, and
pictorial. The first two categories have been studied for decades in detail.
However, research for the exploration of the third category is still in its
infancy and has got momentum by the advent of deep learning methods in recent
years. In cognitive neuroscience, it is known that pictorial depth perception
mechanisms are dependent on the perception of seen objects. Inspired by this
fact, in this thesis, we investigated the relation of perception of objects and
depth estimation convolutional neural networks. For this purpose, we developed
new network structures based on a simple depth estimation network that only
used a single image at its input. Our proposed structures use both an image and
a semantic label of the image as their input. We used semantic labels as the
output of object perception. The obtained results of performance comparison
between the developed network and original network showed that our novel
structures can improve the performance of depth estimation by 52\% of relative
error of distance in the examined cases. Most of the experimental studies were
carried out on synthetic datasets that were generated by game engines to
isolate the performance comparison from the effect of inaccurate depth and
semantic labels of non-synthetic datasets. It is shown that particular
synthetic datasets may be used for training of depth networks in cases that an
appropriate dataset is not available. Furthermore, we showed that in these
cases, usage of semantic labels improves the robustness of the network against
domain shift from synthetic training data to non-synthetic test data.</span>

diagnosis, and automated WSI analysis is key for computer-aided diagnosis.
Currently, analyzing the integrated descriptor of probabilities or feature maps
from massive local patches encoded by ResNet classifier is the main manner for
WSI-level prediction. Feature representations of the sparse and tiny lesion
cells in cervical slides, however, are still challengeable for the
under-promoted upstream encoders, while the unused spatial representations of
cervical cells are the available features to supply the semantics analysis. As
well as patches sampling with overlap and repetitive processing incur the
inefficiency and the unpredictable side effect. This study designs a novel
inline connection network (InCNet) by enriching the multi-scale connectivity to
build the lightweight model named You Only Look Cytopathology Once (YOLCO) with
the additional supervision of spatial information. The proposed model allows
the input size enlarged to megapixel that can stitch the WSI without any
overlap by the average repeats decreased from $10^3\sim10^4$ to $10^1\sim10^2$
for collecting features and predictions at two scales. Based on Transformer for
classifying the integrated multi-scale multi-task features, the experimental
results appear $0.872$ AUC score better and $2.51\times$ faster than the best
conventional method in WSI classification on multicohort datasets of 2,019
slides from four scanning devices.</span>

image reconstruction network named IREM, which is trained on multiple
low-resolution (LR) MR images and achieve an arbitrary up-sampling rate for HR
image reconstruction. In this work, we suppose the desired HR image as an
implicit continuous function of the 3D image spatial coordinate and the
thick-slice LR images as several sparse discrete samplings of this function.
Then the super-resolution (SR) task is to learn the continuous volumetric
function from a limited observations using an fully-connected neural network
combined with Fourier feature positional encoding. By simply minimizing the
error between the network prediction and the acquired LR image intensity across
each imaging plane, IREM is trained to represent a continuous model of the
observed tissue anatomy. Experimental results indicate that IREM succeeds in
representing high frequency image feature, and in real scene data collection,
IREM reduces scan time and achieves high-quality high-resolution MR imaging in
terms of SNR and local image detail.</span>

studies how to colourise greyscale images (for restoration). Deep learning
techniques improved image colourisation yielding astonishing results. These
differ by various factors, such as structural differences, input types, user
assistance, etc. Most of them, base the architectural structure on
convolutional layers with no emphasis on layers specialised in object features
extraction. We introduce a novel downsampling upsampling architecture named
TUCaN (Tiny UCapsNet) that exploits the collaboration of convolutional layers
and capsule layers to obtain a neat colourisation of entities present in every
single image. This is obtained by enforcing collaboration among such layers by
skip and residual connections. We pose the problem as a per pixel colour
classification task that identifies colours as a bin in a quantized space. To
train the network, in contrast with the standard end to end learning method, we
propose the progressive learning scheme to extract the context of objects by
only manipulating the learning process without changing the model. In this
scheme, the upsampling starts from the reconstruction of low resolution images
and progressively grows to high resolution images throughout the training
phase. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our approach
with ImageNet10k dataset outperforms existing methods on standard quality
metrics and achieves state of the art performances on image colourisation. We
performed a user study to quantify the perceptual realism of the colourisation
results demonstrating: that progressive learning let the TUCaN achieve better
colours than the end to end scheme; and pointing out the limitations of the
existing evaluation metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Semi-supervised learning is a challenging problem which aims to construct a
model by learning from a limited number of labeled examples. Numerous methods
have been proposed to tackle this problem, with most focusing on utilizing the
predictions of unlabeled instances consistency alone to regularize networks.
However, treating labeled and unlabeled data separately often leads to the
discarding of mass prior knowledge learned from the labeled examples, and
failure to mine the feature interaction between the labeled and unlabeled image
pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel method for semi-supervised semantic
segmentation named GuidedMix-Net, by leveraging labeled information to guide
the learning of unlabeled instances. Specifically, we first introduce a feature
alignment objective between labeled and unlabeled data to capture potentially
similar image pairs and then generate mixed inputs from them. The proposed
mutual information transfer (MITrans), based on the cluster assumption, is
shown to be a powerful knowledge module for further progressive refining
features of unlabeled data in the mixed data space. To take advantage of the
labeled examples and guide unlabeled data learning, we further propose a mask
generation module to generate high-quality pseudo masks for the unlabeled data.
Along with supervised learning for labeled data, the prediction of unlabeled
data is jointly learned with the generated pseudo masks from the mixed data.
Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context and Cityscapes
demonstrate the effectiveness of our GuidedMix-Net, which achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy and significantly improves the mIoU by +7$\%$ compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches.</span>

                                        <span>One essential problem in skeleton-based action recognition is how to extract
discriminative features over all skeleton joints. However, the complexity of
the recent State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) models for this task tends to be exceedingly
sophisticated and over-parameterized. The low efficiency in model training and
inference has increased the validation costs of model architectures in
large-scale datasets. To address the above issue, recent advanced separable
convolutional layers are embedded into an early fused Multiple Input Branches
(MIB) network, constructing an efficient Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
baseline for skeleton-based action recognition. In addition, based on such the
baseline, we design a compound scaling strategy to expand the model&#x27;s width and
depth synchronously, and eventually obtain a family of efficient GCN baselines
with high accuracies and small amounts of trainable parameters, termed
EfficientGCN-Bx, where &#x27;&#x27;x&#x27;&#x27; denotes the scaling coefficient. On two
large-scale datasets, i.e., NTU RGB+D 60 and 120, the proposed EfficientGCN-B4
baseline outperforms other SOTA methods, e.g., achieving 91.7% accuracy on the
cross-subject benchmark of NTU 60 dataset, while being 3.15x smaller and 3.21x
faster than MS-G3D, which is one of the best SOTA methods. The source code in
PyTorch version and the pretrained models are available at

                                        <span>Visual recognition tasks are often limited to dealing with a small subset of
classes simply because the labels for the remaining classes are unavailable. We
are interested in identifying novel concepts in a dataset through
representation learning based on the examples in both labeled and unlabeled
classes, and extending the horizon of recognition to both known and novel
classes. To address this challenging task, we propose a combinatorial learning
approach, which naturally clusters the examples in unseen classes using the
compositional knowledge given by multiple supervised meta-classifiers on
heterogeneous label spaces. We also introduce a metric learning strategy to
estimate pairwise pseudo-labels for improving representations of unlabeled
examples, which preserves semantic relations across known and novel classes
effectively. The proposed algorithm discovers novel concepts via a joint
optimization of enhancing the discrimitiveness of unseen classes as well as
learning the representations of known classes generalizable to novel ones. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable performance gains by the proposed
approach in multiple image retrieval and novel class discovery benchmarks.</span>

agent-object (e.g., human-object, hand-object, robot-object) interaction in
computer vision and robotics, very few past works have studied the task of
object-object interaction, which also plays an important role in robotic
manipulation and planning tasks. There is a rich space of object-object
interaction scenarios in our daily life, such as placing an object on a messy
tabletop, fitting an object inside a drawer, pushing an object using a tool,
etc. In this paper, we propose a unified affordance learning framework to learn
object-object interaction for various tasks. By constructing four object-object
interaction task environments using physical simulation (SAPIEN) and thousands
of ShapeNet models with rich geometric diversity, we are able to conduct
large-scale object-object affordance learning without the need for human
annotations or demonstrations. At the core of technical contribution, we
propose an object-kernel point convolution network to reason about detailed
interaction between two objects. Experiments on large-scale synthetic data and
real-world data prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Please refer

mobile devices in today&#x27;s world. In recent studies, however, deep learning
models are shown vulnerable to adversarial examples. One variant of adversarial
examples, called adversarial patch, draws researchers&#x27; attention due to its
strong attack abilities. Though adversarial patches achieve high attack success
rates, they are easily being detected because of the visual inconsistency
between the patches and the original images. Besides, it usually requires a
large amount of data for adversarial patch generation in the literature, which
is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To tackle these challenges, we
propose an approach to generate inconspicuous adversarial patches with one
single image. In our approach, we first decide the patch locations basing on
the perceptual sensitivity of victim models, then produce adversarial patches
in a coarse-to-fine way by utilizing multiple-scale generators and
discriminators. The patches are encouraged to be consistent with the background
images with adversarial training while preserving strong attack abilities. Our
approach shows the strong attack abilities in white-box settings and the
excellent transferability in black-box settings through extensive experiments
on various models with different architectures and training methods. Compared
to other adversarial patches, our adversarial patches hold the most negligible
risks to be detected and can evade human observations, which is supported by
the illustrations of saliency maps and results of user evaluations. Lastly, we
show that our adversarial patches can be applied in the physical world.</span>

given labelled examples of other classes. We present a new approach called
AutoNovel to address this problem by combining three ideas: (1) we suggest that
the common approach of bootstrapping an image representation using the labelled
data only introduces an unwanted bias, and that this can be avoided by using
self-supervised learning to train the representation from scratch on the union
of labelled and unlabelled data; (2) we use ranking statistics to transfer the
model&#x27;s knowledge of the labelled classes to the problem of clustering the
unlabelled images; and, (3) we train the data representation by optimizing a
joint objective function on the labelled and unlabelled subsets of the data,
improving both the supervised classification of the labelled data, and the
clustering of the unlabelled data. Moreover, we propose a method to estimate
the number of classes for the case where the number of new categories is not
known a priori. We evaluate AutoNovel on standard classification benchmarks and
substantially outperform current methods for novel category discovery. In
addition, we also show that AutoNovel can be used for fully unsupervised image
clustering, achieving promising results.</span>

allows their inference process to become dynamic, which is useful for time
critical IoT applications with stringent latency requirements, but with

computing systems and IoT networks where the exact computation time budget is

                                        <span>Research in action detection has grown in the recentyears, as it plays a key
role in video understanding. Modelling the interactions (either spatial or
temporal) between actors and their context has proven to be essential for this
task. While recent works use spatial features with aggregated temporal
information, this work proposes to use non-aggregated temporal information.
This is done by adding an attention based method that leverages spatio-temporal
interactions between elements in the scene along the clip.The main contribution
of this work is the introduction of two cross attention blocks to effectively
model the spatial relations and capture short range temporal
interactions.Experiments on the AVA dataset show the advantages of the proposed
approach that models spatio-temporal relations between relevant elements in the
scene, outperforming other methods that model actor interactions with their
context by +0.31 mAP.</span>

specifically find the trends in font usage using robust regression on a large

this task because movie posters can represent time periods by using their

                                        <span>Attention Mechanism is a widely used method for improving the performance of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on computer vision tasks. Despite its
pervasiveness, we have a poor understanding of what its effectiveness stems
from. It is popularly believed that its effectiveness stems from the visual
attention explanation, advocating focusing on the important part of input data
rather than ingesting the entire input. In this paper, we find that there is
only a weak consistency between the attention weights of features and their
importance. Instead, we verify the crucial role of feature map multiplication
in attention mechanism and uncover a fundamental impact of feature map
multiplication on the learned landscapes of CNNs: with the high order
non-linearity brought by the feature map multiplication, it played a
regularization role on CNNs, which made them learn smoother and more stable
landscapes near real samples compared to vanilla CNNs. This smoothness and
stability induce a more predictive and stable behavior in-between real samples,
and make CNNs generate better. Moreover, motivated by the proposed
effectiveness of feature map multiplication, we design feature map
multiplication network (FMMNet) by simply replacing the feature map addition in
ResNet with feature map multiplication. FMMNet outperforms ResNet on various
datasets, and this indicates that feature map multiplication plays a vital role
in improving the performance even without finely designed attention mechanism
in existing methods.</span>

reasoning about the inherent uncertainty in goals and driving behavior. This
uncertainty can be loosely decoupled into lateral (e.g., keeping lane, turning)
and longitudinal (e.g., accelerating, braking). We present a novel method that
combines learned discrete policy rollouts with a focused decoder on subsets of
the lane graph. The policy rollouts explore different goals given our current
observations, ensuring that the model captures lateral variability. The
longitudinal variability is captured by our novel latent variable model decoder
that is conditioned on various subsets of the lane graph. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes motion prediction dataset, and
qualitatively demonstrates excellent scene compliance. Detailed ablations
highlight the importance of both the policy rollouts and the decoder

Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to improve the wide variety of applications that
exploit this architecture. The first main contribution is an analysis of cGANs
to show that they are not explicitly conditional. In particular, it will be
shown that the discriminator and subsequently the cGAN does not automatically
learn the conditionality between inputs. The second contribution is a new
method, called acontrario, that explicitly models conditionality for both parts
of the adversarial architecture via a novel acontrario loss that involves
training the discriminator to learn unconditional (adverse) examples. This
leads to a novel type of data augmentation approach for GANs (acontrario
learning) which allows to restrict the search space of the generator to
conditional outputs using adverse examples. Extensive experimentation is
carried out to evaluate the conditionality of the discriminator by proposing a
probability distribution analysis. Comparisons with the cGAN architecture for
different applications show significant improvements in performance on well
known datasets including, semantic image synthesis, image segmentation and
monocular depth prediction using different metrics including Fr\&#x27;echet

                                        <span>Face recognition is greatly improved by deep convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). Recently, these face recognition models have been used for identity
authentication in security sensitive applications. However, deep CNNs are
vulnerable to adversarial patches, which are physically realizable and
stealthy, raising new security concerns on the real-world applications of these
models. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of face recognition models
using adversarial patches based on transferability, where the attacker has
limited accessibility to the target models. First, we extend the existing
transfer-based attack techniques to generate transferable adversarial patches.
However, we observe that the transferability is sensitive to initialization and
degrades when the perturbation magnitude is large, indicating the overfitting
to the substitute models. Second, we propose to regularize the adversarial
patches on the low dimensional data manifold. The manifold is represented by
generative models pre-trained on legitimate human face images. Using face-like
features as adversarial perturbations through optimization on the manifold, we
show that the gaps between the responses of substitute models and the target
models dramatically decrease, exhibiting a better transferability. Extensive
digital world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method in the black-box setting. We apply the proposed method in the
physical world as well.</span>

                                        <span>This paper studies construction of above-ground biomass (AGB) prediction maps
from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images. The purpose is to improve
traditional regression models based on SAR intensity, trained with a limited
amount of AGB in situ measurements. Although it is costly to collect, data from
airborne laser scanning (ALS) sensors are highly correlated with AGB.
Therefore, we propose using AGB predictions based on ALS data as surrogate
response variables for SAR data in a sequential modelling fashion. This
increases the amount of training data dramatically. To model the regression
function between SAR intensity and ALS-predicted AGB we propose to utilise a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), i.e. the Pix2Pix
convolutional neural network. This enables the recreation of existing ALS-based
AGB prediction maps. The generated synthesised ALS-based AGB predictions are
evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively against ALS-based AGB predictions
retrieved from a traditional non-sequential regression model trained in the
same area. Results show that the proposed architecture manages to capture
characteristics of the actual data. This suggests that the use of ALS-guided
generative models is a promising avenue for AGB prediction from SAR intensity.
Further research on this area has the potential of providing both large-scale
and low-cost predictions of AGB.</span>

                                        <span>The unprecedented performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to large
strides in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference tasks, such as object
and speech recognition. Nevertheless, deploying such AI models across commodity
devices faces significant challenges: large computational cost, multiple
performance objectives, hardware heterogeneity and a common need for high
accuracy, together pose critical problems to the deployment of DNNs across the
various embedded and mobile devices in the wild. As such, we have yet to
witness the mainstream usage of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms
across consumer devices. In this paper, we provide preliminary answers to this
potentially game-changing question by presenting an array of design techniques
for efficient AI systems. We start by examining the major roadblocks when
targeting both programmable processors and custom accelerators. Then, we
present diverse methods for achieving real-time performance following a
cross-stack approach. These span model-, system- and hardware-level techniques,
and their combination. Our findings provide illustrative examples of AI systems
that do not overburden mobile hardware, while also indicating how they can
improve inference accuracy. Moreover, we showcase how custom ASIC- and
FPGA-based accelerators can be an enabling factor for next-generation AI
applications, such as multi-DNN systems. Collectively, these results highlight
the critical need for further exploration as to how the various cross-stack
solutions can be best combined in order to bring the latest advances in deep
learning close to users, in a robust and efficient manner.</span>

from documents, which initially aims to enhance the anonymization during the
data transmission. The concatenated fusion of original and preprocessed images
containing both printed texts and handwritten notes or signatures are fed into
the convolutional neural network, where the bounding boxes are learned to
detect the handwriting. Afterwards, the handwritten regions can be processed
(e.g. replaced with redacted signatures) to conceal the personally identifiable
information (PII). This processing pipeline based on the deep learning network
Cascade R-CNN works at 10 fps on a GPU during the inference, which ensures the
enhanced anonymization with minimal computational overheads. Furthermore, the
impressive generalizability has been empirically showcased: the trained model
based on the English-dominant dataset works well on the fictitious unseen
invoices, even in Chinese. The proposed approach is also expected to facilitate
other tasks such as handwriting recognition and signature verification.</span>

                                        <span>The rapid rise of accessibility of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones pose a
threat to general security and confidentiality. Most of the commercially
available or custom-built drones are multi-rotors and are comprised of multiple
propellers. Since these propellers rotate at a high-speed, they are generally
the fastest moving parts of an image and cannot be directly &quot;seen&quot; by a
classical camera without severe motion blur. We utilize a class of sensors that
are particularly suitable for such scenarios called event cameras, which have a
high temporal resolution, low-latency, and high dynamic range.

In this paper, we model the geometry of a propeller and use it to generate
simulated events which are used to train a deep neural network called EVPropNet
to detect propellers from the data of an event camera. EVPropNet directly
transfers to the real world without any fine-tuning or retraining. We present
two applications of our network: (a) tracking and following an unmarked drone
and (b) landing on a near-hover drone. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate
the proposed approach in many real-world experiments with different propeller
shapes and sizes. Our network can detect propellers at a rate of 85.1% even
when 60% of the propeller is occluded and can run at upto 35Hz on a 2W power
budget. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based solution for
detecting propellers (to detect drones). Finally, our applications also show an
impressive success rate of 92% and 90% for the tracking and landing tasks
respectively.</span>

                                        <span>For distant iris recognition, a long focal length lens is generally used to
ensure the resolution ofiris images, which reduces the depth of field and leads
to potential defocus blur. To accommodate users at different distances, it is
necessary to control focus quickly and accurately. While for users in motion,
it is expected to maintain the correct focus on the iris area continuously. In
this paper, we introduced a novel rapid autofocus camera for active refocusing
ofthe iris area ofthe moving objects using a focus-tunable lens. Our end-to-end
computational algorithm can predict the best focus position from one single
blurred image and generate a lens diopter control signal automatically. This
scene-based active manipulation method enables real-time focus tracking of the
iris area ofa moving object. We built a testing bench to collect real-world
focal stacks for evaluation of the autofocus methods. Our camera has reached an
autofocus speed ofover 50 fps. The results demonstrate the advantages of our
proposed camera for biometric perception in static and dynamic scenes. The code

CCD-captured data, but detecting CRs in single-exposure images has remained
challenging. Conventional CR-detection algorithms require tuning multiple
parameters experimentally making it hard to automate across different
instruments or observation requests. Recent work using deep learning to train
CR-detection models has demonstrated promising results. However,
instrument-specific models suffer from performance loss on images from
ground-based facilities not included in the training data. In this work, we
present Cosmic-CoNN, a deep-learning framework designed to produce generic
CR-detection models. We build a large, diverse ground-based CR dataset
leveraging thousands of images from the Las Cumbres Observatory global
telescope network to produce a generic CR-detection model which achieves a
99.91% true-positive detection rate and maintains over 96.40% true-positive
rates on unseen data from Gemini GMOS-N/S, with a false-positive rate of 0.01%.
Apart from the open-source framework and dataset, we also build a suite of
tools including console commands, a web-based application, and Python APIs to
make automatic, robust CR detection widely accessible by the community of

                                        <span>Class imbalance is a fundamental problem in computer vision applications such
as semantic segmentation. Specifically, uneven class distributions in a
training dataset often result in unsatisfactory performance on
under-represented classes. Many works have proposed to weight the standard
cross entropy loss function with pre-computed weights based on class
statistics, such as the number of samples and class margins. There are two
major drawbacks to these methods: 1) constantly up-weighting minority classes
can introduce excessive false positives in semantic segmentation; 2) a minority
class is not necessarily a hard class. The consequence is low precision due to
excessive false positives. In this regard, we propose a hard-class mining loss
by reshaping the vanilla cross entropy loss such that it weights the loss for
each class dynamically based on instantaneous recall performance. We show that
the novel recall loss changes gradually between the standard cross entropy loss
and the inverse frequency weighted loss. Recall loss also leads to improved
mean accuracy while offering competitive mean Intersection over Union (IoU)
performance. On Synthia dataset, recall loss achieves 9% relative improvement
on mean accuracy with competitive mean IoU using DeepLab-ResNet18 compared to
the cross entropy loss. Code available at

                                        <span>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has lately attracted increasing attention due to its
vital role in securing face recognition systems from presentation attacks
(PAs). As more and more realistic PAs with novel types spring up, traditional
FAS methods based on handcrafted features become unreliable due to their
limited representation capacity. With the emergence of large-scale academic
datasets in the recent decade, deep learning based FAS achieves remarkable
performance and dominates this area. However, existing reviews in this field
mainly focus on the handcrafted features, which are outdated and uninspiring
for the progress of FAS community. In this paper, to stimulate future research,
we present the first comprehensive review of recent advances in deep learning
based FAS. It covers several novel and insightful components: 1) besides
supervision with binary label (e.g., &#x27;0&#x27; for bonafide vs. &#x27;1&#x27; for PAs), we also
investigate recent methods with pixel-wise supervision (e.g., pseudo depth
map); 2) in addition to traditional intra-dataset evaluation, we collect and
analyze the latest methods specially designed for domain generalization and
open-set FAS; and 3) besides commercial RGB camera, we summarize the deep
learning applications under multi-modal (e.g., depth and infrared) or
specialized (e.g., light field and flash) sensors. We conclude this survey by
emphasizing current open issues and highlighting potential prospects.</span>

                                        <span>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a neuroimaging technique that
records neural activations in the brain by capturing the blood oxygen level in
different regions based on the task performed by a subject. Given fMRI data,
the problem of predicting the state of cognitive fatigue in a person has not
been investigated to its full extent. This paper proposes tackling this issue
as a multi-class classification problem by dividing the state of cognitive
fatigue into six different levels, ranging from no-fatigue to extreme fatigue
conditions. We built a spatio-temporal model that uses convolutional neural
networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and a long short-term memory
(LSTM) network for temporal modeling of 4D fMRI scans. We also applied a
self-supervised method called MoCo to pre-train our model on a public dataset
BOLD5000 and fine-tuned it on our labeled dataset to classify cognitive
fatigue. Our novel dataset contains fMRI scans from Traumatic Brain Injury
(TBI) patients and healthy controls (HCs) while performing a series of
cognitive tasks. This method establishes a state-of-the-art technique to
analyze cognitive fatigue from fMRI data and beats previous approaches to solve
this problem.</span>

                                        <span>Object detection plays an important role in self-driving cars for security
development. However, mobile systems on self-driving cars with limited
computation resources lead to difficulties for object detection. To facilitate
this, we propose a compiler-aware neural pruning search framework to achieve
high-speed inference on autonomous vehicles for 2D and 3D object detection. The
framework automatically searches the pruning scheme and rate for each layer to
find a best-suited pruning for optimizing detection accuracy and speed
performance under compiler optimization. Our experiments demonstrate that for
the first time, the proposed method achieves (close-to) real-time, 55ms and
99ms inference times for YOLOv4 based 2D object detection and PointPillars
based 3D detection, respectively, on an off-the-shelf mobile phone with minor

                                        <span>Deep neural networks have emerged as very successful tools for image
restoration and reconstruction tasks. These networks are often trained
end-to-end to directly reconstruct an image from a noisy or corrupted
measurement of that image. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, training on
large and diverse sets of images is considered critical. However, it is often
difficult and/or expensive to collect large amounts of training images.
Inspired by the success of Data Augmentation (DA) for classification problems,
in this paper, we propose a pipeline for data augmentation for accelerated MRI
reconstruction and study its effectiveness at reducing the required training
data in a variety of settings. Our DA pipeline, MRAugment, is specifically
designed to utilize the invariances present in medical imaging measurements as
naive DA strategies that neglect the physics of the problem fail. Through
extensive studies on multiple datasets we demonstrate that in the low-data
regime DA prevents overfitting and can match or even surpass the state of the
art while using significantly fewer training data, whereas in the high-data
regime it has diminishing returns. Furthermore, our findings show that DA can
improve the robustness of the model against various shifts in the test
distribution.</span>

                                        <span>Novel view synthesis is a long-standing problem in machine learning and
computer vision. Significant progress has recently been made in developing
neural scene representations and rendering techniques that synthesize
photorealistic images from arbitrary views. These representations, however, are
extremely slow to train and often also slow to render. Inspired by neural
variants of image-based rendering, we develop a new neural rendering approach
with the goal of quickly learning a high-quality representation which can also
be rendered in real-time. Our approach, MetaNLR++, accomplishes this by using a
unique combination of a neural shape representation and 2D CNN-based image
feature extraction, aggregation, and re-projection. To push representation
convergence times down to minutes, we leverage meta learning to learn neural
shape and image feature priors which accelerate training. The optimized shape
and image features can then be extracted using traditional graphics techniques
and rendered in real time. We show that MetaNLR++ achieves similar or better
novel view synthesis results in a fraction of the time that competing methods
require.</span>

                                        <span>Text summarization is an approach for identifying important information
present within text documents. This computational technique aims to generate
shorter versions of the source text, by including only the relevant and salient
information present within the source text. In this paper, we propose a novel
method to summarize a text document by clustering its contents based on latent
topics produced using topic modeling techniques and by generating extractive
summaries for each of the identified text clusters. All extractive
sub-summaries are later combined to generate a summary for any given source
document. We utilize the lesser used and challenging WikiHow dataset in our
approach to text summarization. This dataset is unlike the commonly used news
datasets which are available for text summarization. The well-known news
datasets present their most important information in the first few lines of
their source texts, which make their summarization a lesser challenging task
when compared to summarizing the WikiHow dataset. Contrary to these news
datasets, the documents in the WikiHow dataset are written using a generalized
approach and have lesser abstractedness and higher compression ratio, thus
proposing a greater challenge to generate summaries. A lot of the current
state-of-the-art text summarization techniques tend to eliminate important
information present in source documents in the favor of brevity. Our proposed
technique aims to capture all the varied information present in source
documents. Although the dataset proved challenging, after performing extensive
tests within our experimental setup, we have discovered that our model produces
encouraging ROUGE results and summaries when compared to the other published
extractive and abstractive text summarization models.</span>

                                        <span>As a new type of e-commerce platform developed in recent years, local
consumer service platform provides users with software to consume service to
the nearby store or to the home, such as Groupon and Koubei. Different from
other common e-commerce platforms, the behavior of users on the local consumer
service platform is closely related to their real-time local context
information. Therefore, building a context-aware user behavior prediction
system is able to provide both merchants and users better service in local
consumer service platforms. However, most of the previous work just treats the
contextual information as an ordinary feature into the prediction model to
obtain the prediction list under a specific context, which ignores the fact
that the interest of a user in different contexts is often significantly
different. Hence, in this paper, we propose a context-aware heterogeneous graph
attention network (CHGAT) to dynamically generate the representation of the
user and to estimate the probability for future behavior. Specifically, we
first construct the meta-path based heterogeneous graphs with the historical
behaviors from multiple sources and comprehend heterogeneous vertices in the
graph with a novel unified knowledge representing approach. Next, a multi-level
attention mechanism is introduced for context-aware aggregation with graph
vertices, which contains the vertex-level attention network and the path-level
attention network. Both of them aim to capture the semantic correlation between
information contained in the graph and the outside real-time contextual
information in the search system. Then the model proposed in this paper
aggregates specific graphs with their corresponding context features and
obtains the representation of user interest under a specific context and input
it into the prediction network to finally obtain the predicted probability of
user behavior.</span>

to meet the requirements of customers. One way how this research is conducted
is that a domain expert gathers and categorizes user-generated content into a
complex and fine-grained class structure. In many of such cases, little data
meets complex annotations. It is not yet fully understood how this can be
leveraged successfully for classification. We examine the classification
accuracy of expert labels when used with a) many fine-grained classes and b)
few abstract classes. For scenario b) we compare abstract class labels given by
the domain expert as baseline and by automatic hierarchical clustering. We
compare this to another baseline where the entire class structure is given by a
completely unsupervised clustering approach. By doing so, this work can serve
as an example of how complex expert annotations are potentially beneficial and
can be utilized in the most optimal way for opinion mining in highly specific
domains. By exploring across a range of techniques and experiments, we find
that automated class abstraction approaches in particular the unsupervised
approach performs remarkably well against domain expert baseline on text
classification tasks. This has the potential to inspire opinion mining
applications in order to support market researchers in practice and to inspire
fine-grained automated content analysis on a large scale.</span>

                                        <span>With the development of blockchain technologies, the number of smart
contracts deployed on blockchain platforms is growing exponentially, which
makes it difficult for users to find desired services by manual screening. The
automatic classification of smart contracts can provide blockchain users with
keyword-based contract searching and helps to manage smart contracts
effectively. Current research on smart contract classification focuses on
Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions which are based on contract source
code. However, more than 94% of smart contracts are not open-source, so the
application scenarios of NLP methods are very limited. Meanwhile, NLP models
are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a classification
model based on features from contract bytecode instead of source code to solve
these problems. We also use feature selection and ensemble learning to optimize
the model. Our experimental studies on over 3,300 real-world Ethereum smart
contracts show that our model can classify smart contracts without source code
and has better performance than baseline models. Our model also has good
resistance to adversarial attacks compared with NLP-based models. In addition,
our analysis reveals that account features used in many smart contract
classification models have little effect on classification and can be excluded.</span>

                                        <span>Near neighbor search (NNS) is a powerful abstraction for data access;
however, data indexing is troublesome even for approximate indexes. For
intrinsically high-dimensional data, high-quality fast searches demand either
indexes with impractically large memory usage or preprocessing time.

In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to solve a nearest-neighbor query
$q$ by minimizing a kernel function defined by the distance from $q$ to each
object in the database. The minimization is performed using metaheuristics to
solve the problem rapidly; even when some methods in the literature use this
strategy behind the scenes, our approach is the first one using it explicitly.
We also provide two approaches to select edges in the graph&#x27;s construction
stage that limit memory footprint and reduce the number of free parameters
simultaneously.

We carry out a thorough experimental comparison with state-of-the-art indexes
through synthetic and real-world datasets; we found out that our contributions
achieve competitive performances regarding speed, accuracy, and memory in
almost any of our benchmarks.</span>

combination with a network perspective. We argue that some of these
network-based rankings can produce misleading results. From a theoretical point
of view, we show that the standard network modelling approach of citation data
at the journal level (i.e., the projection of paper citations onto journals)
introduces fictitious relations among journals. To overcome this problem, we
propose a citation path perspective, and empirically show that rankings based
on the network and the citation path perspective are very different. Based on
our theoretical and empirical analysis, we highlight the limitations of
standard network metrics, and propose a method to overcome these limitations
and compute journal rankings.</span>

                                        <span>In quantum private information retrieval (QPIR), a user retrieves a classical
file from multiple servers by downloading quantum systems without revealing the
identity of the file. The QPIR capacity is the maximal achievable ratio of the
retrieved file size to the total download size. In this paper, the capacity of
QPIR from MDS-coded and colluding servers is studied. Two classes of QPIR,
called stabilizer QPIR and dimension squared QPIR induced from classical
strongly linear PIR are defined, and the related QPIR capacities are derived.
For the non-colluding case, the general QPIR capacity is derived when the
number of files goes to infinity. The capacities of symmetric and non-symmetric
QPIR with coded and colluding servers are proved to coincide, being double to
their classical counterparts. A general statement on the converse bound for
QPIR with coded and colluding servers is derived showing that the capacities of
stabilizer QPIR and dimension squared QPIR induced from any class of PIR are
upper bounded by twice the classical capacity of the respective PIR class. The
proposed capacity-achieving scheme combines the star-product scheme by
Freij-Hollanti et al. and the stabilizer QPIR scheme by Song et al. by
employing (weakly) self-dual Reed--Solomon codes.</span>

organizes respective tasks where different teams develop systems that are
evaluated on the same benchmark datasets that represent the real information
needs of experts in the biomedical domain. This paper presents an overview of
the ninth edition of the BioASQ challenge in the context of the Conference and
Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2021. In this year, a new question
answering task, named Synergy, is introduced to support researchers studying
the COVID-19 disease and measure the ability of the participating teams to
discern information while the problem is still developing. In total, 42 teams
with more than 170 systems were registered to participate in the four tasks of
the challenge. The evaluation results, similarly to previous years, show a
performance gain against the baselines which indicates the continuous
improvement of the state-of-the-art in this field.</span>

today&#x27;s largest online platforms, including YouTube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.
These systems produce recommendations in two steps: (i) multiple nominators --
tuned for low prediction latency -- preselect a small subset of candidates from
the whole item pool; (ii)~a slower but more accurate ranker further narrows
down the nominated items, and serves to the user. Despite their popularity, the
literature on two-stage recommenders is relatively scarce, and the algorithms
are often treated as the sum of their parts. Such treatment presupposes that
the two-stage performance is explained by the behavior of individual components
if they were deployed independently. This is not the case: using synthetic and
real-world data, we demonstrate that interactions between the ranker and the
nominators substantially affect the overall performance. Motivated by these
findings, we derive a generalization lower bound which shows that careful
choice of each nominator&#x27;s training set is sometimes the only difference
between a poor and an optimal two-stage recommender. Since searching for a good
choice manually is difficult, we learn one instead. In particular, using a
Mixture-of-Experts approach, we train the nominators (experts) to specialize on
different subsets of the item pool. This significantly improves performance.</span>

                                        <span>Knowledge graph embedding research has mainly focused on the two smallest
normed division algebras, $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. Recent results suggest
that trilinear products of quaternion-valued embeddings can be a more effective
means to tackle link prediction. In addition, models based on convolutions on
real-valued embeddings often yield state-of-the-art results for link
prediction. In this paper, we investigate a composition of convolution
operations with hypercomplex multiplications. We propose the four approaches
QMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO to tackle the link prediction problem. QMult and
OMult can be considered as quaternion and octonion extensions of previous
state-of-the-art approaches, including DistMult and ComplEx. ConvQ and ConvO
build upon QMult and OMult by including convolution operations in a way
inspired by the residual learning framework. We evaluated our approaches on
seven link prediction datasets including WN18RR, FB15K-237 and YAGO3-10.
Experimental results suggest that the benefits of learning hypercomplex-valued
vector representations become more apparent as the size and complexity of the
knowledge graph grows. ConvO outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
FB15K-237 in MRR, Hit@1 and Hit@3, while QMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO
outperform state-of-the-approaches on YAGO3-10 in all metrics. Results also
suggest that link prediction performances can be further improved via
prediction averaging. To foster reproducible research, we provide an
open-source implementation of approaches, including training and evaluation
scripts as well as pretrained models.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic surgical gesture recognition is fundamentally important to enable
intelligent cognitive assistance in robotic surgery. With recent advancement in
robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, rich information including surgical
videos and robotic kinematics can be recorded, which provide complementary
knowledge for understanding surgical gestures. However, existing methods either
solely adopt uni-modal data or directly concatenate multi-modal
representations, which can not sufficiently exploit the informative
correlations inherent in visual and kinematics data to boost gesture
recognition accuracies. In this regard, we propose a novel online approach of
multi-modal relational graph network (i.e., MRG-Net) to dynamically integrate
visual and kinematics information through interactive message propagation in
the latent feature space. In specific, we first extract embeddings from video
and kinematics sequences with temporal convolutional networks and LSTM units.
Next, we identify multi-relations in these multi-modal embeddings and leverage
them through a hierarchical relational graph learning module. The effectiveness
of our method is demonstrated with state-of-the-art results on the public
JIGSAWS dataset, outperforming current uni-modal and multi-modal methods on
both suturing and knot typing tasks. Furthermore, we validated our method on
in-house visual-kinematics datasets collected with da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK)
platforms in two centers, with consistent promising performance achieved.</span>

                                        <span>With the rise of single-cell sequencing technologies, there is a growing need
for robust clustering algorithms to extract deeper insights from data. Here, we
introduce an intuitive and efficient clustering method, Forest Fire Clustering,
for discovering and validating cell types in single-cell sequencing analysis.
Compared to existing methods, our clustering algorithm makes minimum prior
assumptions about the data distribution and can provide a point-wise
significance value via Monte Carlo simulations for internal validation.
Additionally, point-wise label entropies can highlight novel transition cell
types \emph{de novo} along developmental pseudo-time manifolds. Lastly, our
inductive algorithm has the ability to make robust inferences in an
online-learning context. In this paper, we describe the method, provide a
summary of its performance against common clustering benchmarks, and
demonstrate that Forest Fire Clustering is uniquely suitable for single-cell
sequencing analysis.</span>

requires the efforts of generation methods. However, current deepfake methods
suffer the effects of obscure workflow and poor performance. To solve this
problem, we present DeepFaceLab, the current dominant deepfake framework for
face-swapping. It provides the necessary tools as well as an easy-to-use way to
conduct high-quality face-swapping. It also offers a flexible and loose
coupling structure for people who need to strengthen their pipeline with other
features without writing complicated boilerplate code. We detail the principles
that drive the implementation of DeepFaceLab and introduce its pipeline,
through which every aspect of the pipeline can be modified painlessly by users
to achieve their customization purpose. It is noteworthy that DeepFaceLab could
achieve cinema-quality results with high fidelity. We demonstrate the advantage
of our system by comparing our approach with other face-swapping methods.For

obtained from crowdsourcing or Web scraping. We propose a new regularization
method, which enables learning robust classifiers in presence of noisy data. To
achieve this goal, we propose a new adversarial regularization scheme based on
the Wasserstein distance. Using this distance allows taking into account
specific relations between classes by leveraging the geometric properties of
the labels space. Our Wasserstein Adversarial Regularization (WAR) encodes a
selective regularization, which promotes smoothness of the classifier between
some classes, while preserving sufficient complexity of the decision boundary
between others. We first discuss how and why adversarial regularization can be
used in the context of label noise and then show the effectiveness of our
method on five datasets corrupted with noisy labels: in both benchmarks and
real datasets, WAR outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.</span>

dimensionality of the action-space or objective multiplicity grow very large.
This occurs, in part, because the variance on score-based gradient estimators
scales quadratically. In this paper, we address this problem through a causal
baseline which exploits independence structure encoded in a novel action-target
influence network. Causal policy gradients (CPGs), which follow, provide a
common framework for analysing key state-of-the-art algorithms, are shown to
generalise traditional policy gradients, and yield a principled way of
incorporating prior knowledge of a problem domain&#x27;s generative processes. We
provide an analysis of the proposed estimator and identify the conditions under
which variance is reduced. The algorithmic aspects of CPGs are discussed,
including optimal policy factorisation, as characterised by minimum biclique
coverings, and the implications for the bias-variance trade-off of incorrectly
specifying the network. Finally, we demonstrate the performance advantages of
our algorithm on large-scale bandit and traffic intersection problems,
providing a novel contribution to the latter in the form of a spatio-causal
approximation.</span>

                                        <span>Learning to flexibly follow task instructions in dynamic environments poses
interesting challenges for reinforcement learning agents. We focus here on the
problem of learning control flow that deviates from a strict step-by-step
execution of instructions -- that is, control flow that may skip forward over
parts of the instructions or return backward to previously completed or skipped
steps. Demand for such flexible control arises in two fundamental ways:
explicitly when control is specified in the instructions themselves (such as
conditional branching and looping) and implicitly when stochastic environment
dynamics require re-completion of instructions whose effects have been
perturbed, or opportunistic skipping of instructions whose effects are already
present. We formulate an attention-based architecture that meets these
challenges by learning, from task reward only, to flexibly attend to and
condition behavior on an internal encoding of the instructions. We test the
architecture&#x27;s ability to learn both explicit and implicit control in two
illustrative domains -- one inspired by Minecraft and the other by StarCraft --
and show that the architecture exhibits zero-shot generalization to novel
instructions of length greater than those in a training set, at a performance
level unmatched by two baseline recurrent architectures and one ablation
architecture.</span>

rate of the Broyden class of quasi-Newton methods including
Davidon--Fletcher--Powell (DFP) method and Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno
(BFGS) method. The asymptotic superlinear convergence rate of these
quasi-Newton methods has been extensively studied, but their explicit finite
time local convergence rate is not fully investigated. In this paper, we
provide a finite time (non-asymptotic) convergence analysis for BFGS and DFP
methods under the assumptions that the objective function is strongly convex,
its gradient is Lipschitz continuous, and its Hessian is Lipschitz continuous
only in the direction of the optimal solution. We show that in a local
neighborhood of the optimal solution, the iterates generated by both DFP and
BFGS converge to the optimal solution at a superlinear rate of $(1/k)^{k/2}$,
where $k$ is the number of iterations. We also prove the same local superlinear
convergence rate in the case that the objective function is self-concordant.
Numerical experiments on different objective functions confirm our explicit
convergence rates. Our theoretical guarantee is one of the first results that
provide a non-asymptotic superlinear convergence rate for DFP and BFGS

in many tasks. Combining GPs with deep learning methods via deep kernel
learning (DKL) is especially compelling due to the strong representational
power induced by the network. However, inference in GPs, whether with or
without DKL, can be computationally challenging on large datasets. Here, we
propose GP-Tree, a novel method for multi-class classification with Gaussian
processes and DKL. We develop a tree-based hierarchical model in which each
internal node of the tree fits a GP to the data using the P\&#x27;olya Gamma
augmentation scheme. As a result, our method scales well with both the number
of classes and data size. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
against other Gaussian process training baselines, and we show how our general

                                        <span>Scalable Gaussian Process methods are computationally attractive, yet
introduce modeling biases that require rigorous study. This paper analyzes two
common techniques: early truncated conjugate gradients (CG) and random Fourier
features (RFF). We find that both methods introduce a systematic bias on the
learned hyperparameters: CG tends to underfit while RFF tends to overfit. We
address these issues using randomized truncation estimators that eliminate bias
in exchange for increased variance. In the case of RFF, we show that the
bias-to-variance conversion is indeed a trade-off: the additional variance
proves detrimental to optimization. However, in the case of CG, our unbiased
learning procedure meaningfully outperforms its biased counterpart with minimal
additional computation.</span>

from controlling the $\ell_2$ norm of the weights in linear convolutional
networks. We view this in terms of an induced regularizer in the function space
given by the minimum norm of weights required to realize a linear function. For
two layer linear convolutional networks with $C$ output channels and kernel
size $K$, we show the following: (a) If the inputs to the network have a single
channel, the induced regularizer for any $K$ is a norm given by a semidefinite
program (SDP) that is independent of the number of output channels $C$. (b) In
contrast, for networks with multi-channel inputs, multiple output channels can
be necessary to merely realize all matrix-valued linear functions and thus the
inductive bias does depend on $C$. Further, for sufficiently large $C$, the
induced regularizer for $K&#x3D;1$ and $K&#x3D;D$ are the nuclear norm and the
$\ell_{2,1}$ group-sparse norm, respectively, of the Fourier coefficients. (c)
Complementing our theoretical results, we show through experiments on MNIST and
CIFAR-10 that our key findings extend to implicit biases from gradient descent
in overparameterized networks.</span>

                                        <span>This paper addresses the growing need to process non-Euclidean data, by
introducing a geometric deep learning (GDL) framework for building universal
feedforward-type models compatible with differentiable manifold geometries. We
show that our GDL models can approximate any continuous target function
uniformly on compacts of a controlled maximum diameter. We obtain curvature
dependant lower-bounds on this maximum diameter and upper-bounds on the depth
of our approximating GDL models. Conversely, we find that there is always a
continuous function between any two non-degenerate compact manifolds that any
&quot;locally-defined&quot; GDL model cannot uniformly approximate. Our last main result
identifies data-dependent conditions guaranteeing that the GDL model
implementing our approximation breaks &quot;the curse of dimensionality.&quot; We find
that any &quot;real-world&quot; (i.e. finite) dataset always satisfies our condition and,
conversely, any dataset satisfies our requirement if the target function is
smooth. As applications, we confirm the universal approximation capabilities of
the following GDL models: Ganea et al. (2018)&#x27;s hyperbolic feedforward
networks, the architecture implementing Krishnan et al. (2015)&#x27;s deep
Kalman-Filter, and deep softmax classifiers. We build universal
extensions/variants of: the SPD-matrix regressor of Meyer et al. (2011), and
Fletcher et al. (2009)&#x27;s Procrustean regressor. In the Euclidean setting, our
results imply a quantitative version of Kidger and Lyons (2020)&#x27;s approximation

                                        <span>Recently, learning algorithms motivated from sharpness of loss surface as an
effective measure of generalization gap have shown state-of-the-art
performances. Nevertheless, sharpness defined in a rigid region with a fixed
radius, has a drawback in sensitivity to parameter re-scaling which leaves the
loss unaffected, leading to weakening of the connection between sharpness and
generalization gap. In this paper, we introduce the concept of adaptive
sharpness which is scale-invariant and propose the corresponding generalization
bound. We suggest a novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware
minimization (ASAM), utilizing the proposed generalization bound. Experimental
results in various benchmark datasets show that ASAM contributes to significant
improvement of model generalization performance.</span>

levels comparable to human transcribers, which led researchers to debate if the
machine has reached human performance. Previous work focused on the English
language and modular hidden Markov model-deep neural network (HMM-DNN) systems.
In this paper, we perform a comprehensive benchmarking for end-to-end
transformer ASR, modular HMM-DNN ASR, and human speech recognition (HSR) on the
Arabic language and its dialects. For the HSR, we evaluate linguist performance
and lay-native speaker performance on a new dataset collected as a part of this

performance milestone for the MGB2, MGB3, and MGB5 challenges respectively. Our
results suggest that human performance in the Arabic language is still
considerably better than the machine with an absolute WER gap of 3.5% on

of signal parameters of discretely sampled signals. In particular, we use dense
autoencoder networks to extract the parameters of interest from exponentially
decaying signals and decaying oscillations. By using a three-stage training
method and careful choice of the neural network size, we are able to retrieve
the relevant signal parameters directly from the latent space of the
autoencoder network at significantly improved rates compared to traditional
algorithmic signal-analysis approaches. We show that the achievable precision
and accuracy of this method of analysis is similar to conventional
algorithm-based signal analysis methods, by demonstrating that the extracted
signal parameters are approaching their fundamental parameter estimation limit
as provided by the Cram\&#x27;er-Rao bound. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
autoencoder networks are able to achieve signal analysis, and, hence, parameter
extraction, at rates of 75 kHz, orders-of-magnitude faster than conventional
techniques with similar precision. Finally, we explore the limitations of our

further optimization of the transfer rate between the data-acquisition system

                                        <span>Stochastic dual dynamic programming is a cutting plane type algorithm for
multi-stage stochastic optimization originated about 30 years ago. In spite of
its popularity in practice, there does not exist any analysis on the
convergence rates of this method. In this paper, we first establish the number
of iterations, i.e., iteration complexity, required by a basic dynamic cutting
plane method for solving relatively simple multi-stage optimization problems,
by introducing novel mathematical tools including the saturation of search
points. We then refine these basic tools and establish the iteration complexity
for both deterministic and stochastic dual dynamic programming methods for
solving more general multi-stage stochastic optimization problems under the
standard stage-wise independence assumption. Our results indicate that the
complexity of these methods mildly increases with the number of stages $T$, in
fact linearly dependent on $T$ for discounted problems. Therefore, they are
efficient for strategic decision making which involves a large number of
stages, but with a relatively small number of decision variables in each stage.
Without explicitly discretizing the state and action spaces, these methods
might also be pertinent to the related reinforcement learning and stochastic
control areas.</span>

TESS missions has discovered many worlds that differ substantially from planets
in our own Solar system, including more than 400 exoplanets orbiting binary or
multi-star systems. This not only broadens our understanding of the diversity
of exoplanets, but also promotes our study of exoplanets in the complex binary
and multi-star systems and provides motivation to explore their habitability.
In this study, we analyze orbital stability of exoplanets in non-coplanar
circumbinary systems using a numerical simulation method, with which a large
number of circumbinary planet samples are generated in order to quantify the
effects of various orbital parameters on orbital stability. We also train a
machine learning model that can quickly determine the stability of the
circumbinary planetary systems. Our results indicate that larger inclinations
of the planet tend to increase the stability of its orbit, but change in the

stability of the system. In addition, we find that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)

Rashtchian (ICML&#x27;20) introduced explainable clustering, where the cluster
boundaries are axis-parallel hyperplanes and the clustering is obtained by
applying a decision tree to the data. The central question here is: how much
does the explainability constraint increase the value of the cost function?

Given $d$-dimensional data points, we show an efficient algorithm that finds
an explainable clustering whose $k$-means cost is at most $k^{1 -
2/d}\mathrm{poly}(d\log k)$ times the minimum cost achievable by a clustering
without the explainability constraint, assuming $k,d\ge 2$. Combining this with
an independent work by Makarychev and Shan (ICML&#x27;21), we get an improved bound
of $k^{1 - 2/d}\mathrm{polylog}(k)$, which we show is optimal for every choice
of $k,d\ge 2$ up to a poly-logarithmic factor in $k$. For $d &#x3D; 2$ in
particular, we show an $O(\log k\log\log k)$ bound, improving exponentially
over the previous best bound of $\widetilde O(k)$.</span>

                                        <span>This article addresses the problem of approximating a function in a Hilbert
space by an expansion over a dictionary $\mathbb{D}$. We introduce the notion
of a smoothly parameterized dictionary and give upper bounds on the
approximation rates, metric entropy and $n$-widths of the absolute convex hull,
which we denote $B_1(\mathbb{D})$, of such dictionaries. The upper bounds
depend upon the order of smoothness of the parameterization, and improve upon
existing results in many cases. The main applications of these results is to
the dictionaries $\mathbb{D} &#x3D; \{\sigma(\omega\cdot x + b)\}\subset L^2$
corresponding to shallow neural networks with activation function $\sigma$, and
to the dictionary of decaying Fourier modes corresponding to the spectral
Barron space. This improves upon existing approximation rates for shallow
neural networks when $\sigma &#x3D; \text{ReLU}^k$ for $k\geq 2$, sharpens bounds on
the metric entropy, and provides the first bounds on the Gelfand $n$-widths of
the Barron space and spectral Barron space.</span>

show that, together with so-called conceptors, they also allow fast learning,
in contrast to other deep learning methods. In addition, a relatively small

demonstrate this with two applications, namely speech recognition and detecting
car driving maneuvers. We improve the state of the art by application-specific

detecting car driving maneuvers can be done without the commonly used

                                        <span>Decentralized learning enables a group of collaborative agents to learn
models using a distributed dataset without the need for a central parameter
server. Recently, decentralized learning algorithms have demonstrated
state-of-the-art results on benchmark data sets, comparable with centralized
algorithms. However, the key assumption to achieve competitive performance is
that the data is independently and identically distributed (IID) among the
agents which, in real-life applications, is often not applicable. Inspired by
ideas from continual learning, we propose Cross-Gradient Aggregation (CGA), a
novel decentralized learning algorithm where (i) each agent aggregates
cross-gradient information, i.e., derivatives of its model with respect to its
neighbors&#x27; datasets, and (ii) updates its model using a projected gradient
based on quadratic programming (QP). We theoretically analyze the convergence
characteristics of CGA and demonstrate its efficiency on non-IID data
distributions sampled from the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our empirical
comparisons show superior learning performance of CGA over existing
state-of-the-art decentralized learning algorithms, as well as maintaining the
improved performance under information compression to reduce peer-to-peer
communication overhead. The code is available here on GitHub.</span>

as the gold standard. We present a new end-to-end differentiable method to

(\texttt{MLR}), penalizes memorization through the generation of uninformative
labels and the application of a differentiable close-form regularization scheme
on the last hidden layer during training. \texttt{MLR} outperforms classical NN
and the gold standard (GBDT, RF) for regression and classification tasks on
several datasets from the UCI database and Kaggle covering a large range of

has adopted a diverse set of objectives, most research on off-policy evaluation

risk functionals, a broad class of objectives that subsumes conditional
value-at-risk (CVaR), variance, mean-variance, many distorted risks, and CPT
risks, among others. We propose Off-Policy Risk Assessment (OPRA), a framework
that first estimates a target policy&#x27;s CDF and then generates plugin estimates
for any collection of Lipschitz risks, providing finite sample guarantees that
hold simultaneously over the entire class. We instantiate OPRA with both
importance sampling and doubly robust estimators. Our primary theoretical
contributions are (i) the first uniform concentration inequalities for both CDF
estimators in contextual bandits and (ii) error bounds on our Lipschitz risk
estimates, which all converge at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$.</span>

without inductive biases on the models and the data. As an alternative
approach, recent methods rely on limited supervision to disentangle the factors
of variation and allow their identifiability. While annotating the true
generative factors is only required for a limited number of observations, we
argue that it is infeasible to enumerate all the factors of variation that
describe a real-world image distribution. To this end, we propose a method for
disentangling a set of factors which are only partially labeled, as well as
separating the complementary set of residual factors that are never explicitly
specified. Our success in this challenging setting, demonstrated on synthetic
benchmarks, gives rise to leveraging off-the-shelf image descriptors to
partially annotate a subset of attributes in real image domains (e.g. of human
faces) with minimal manual effort. Specifically, we use a recent language-image
embedding model (CLIP) to annotate a set of attributes of interest in a
zero-shot manner and demonstrate state-of-the-art disentangled image
manipulation results.</span>

                                        <span>Video frame interpolation is the task of creating an interframe between two
adjacent frames along the time axis. So, instead of simply averaging two
adjacent frames to create an intermediate image, this operation should maintain
semantic continuity with the adjacent frames. Most conventional methods use
optical flow, and various tools such as occlusion handling and object smoothing
are indispensable. Since the use of these various tools leads to complex
problems, we tried to tackle the video interframe generation problem without
using problematic optical flow . To enable this , we have tried to use a deep
neural network with an invertible structure, and developed an U-Net based
Generative Flow which is a modified normalizing flow. In addition, we propose a
learning method with a new consistency loss in the latent space to maintain
semantic temporal consistency between frames. The resolution of the generated
image is guaranteed to be identical to that of the original images by using an
invertible network. Furthermore, as it is not a random image like the ones by
generative models, our network guarantees stable outputs without flicker.
Through experiments, we \sam {confirmed the feasibility of the proposed
algorithm and would like to suggest the U-Net based Generative Flow as a new
possibility for baseline in video frame interpolation. This paper is meaningful
in that it is the world&#x27;s first attempt to use invertible networks instead of
optical flows for video interpolation.</span>

                                        <span>Networks have been widely used to represent the relations between objects
such as academic networks and social networks, and learning embedding for
networks has thus garnered plenty of research attention. Self-supervised
network representation learning aims at extracting node embedding without
external supervision. Recently, maximizing the mutual information between the
local node embedding and the global summary (e.g. Deep Graph Infomax, or DGI
for short) has shown promising results on many downstream tasks such as node
classification. However, there are two major limitations of DGI. Firstly, DGI
merely considers the extrinsic supervision signal (i.e., the mutual information
between node embedding and global summary) while ignores the intrinsic signal
(i.e., the mutual dependence between node embedding and node attributes).
Secondly, nodes in a real-world network are usually connected by multiple edges
with different relations, while DGI does not fully explore the various
relations among nodes. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a
novel framework, called High-order Deep Multiplex Infomax (HDMI), for learning
node embedding on multiplex networks in a self-supervised way. To be more
specific, we first design a joint supervision signal containing both extrinsic
and intrinsic mutual information by high-order mutual information, and we
propose a High-order Deep Infomax (HDI) to optimize the proposed supervision
signal. Then we propose an attention based fusion module to combine node
embedding from different layers of the multiplex network. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed HDMI on various downstream tasks such as unsupervised clustering
and supervised classification. The experimental results show that HDMI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Random graph alignment refers to recovering the underlying vertex
correspondence between two random graphs with correlated edges. This can be
viewed as an average-case and noisy version of the well-known graph isomorphism
problem. For the correlated Erd\&quot;os-R\&#x27;enyi model, we prove an impossibility
result for partial recovery in the sparse regime, with constant average degree
and correlation, as well as a general bound on the maximal reachable overlap.
Our bound is tight in the noiseless case (the graph isomorphism problem) and we
conjecture that it is still tight with noise. Our proof technique relies on a
careful application of the probabilistic method to build automorphisms between
tree components of a subcritical Erd\&quot;os-R\&#x27;enyi graph.</span>

                                        <span>Recently generating natural language explanations has shown very promising
results in not only offering interpretable explanations but also providing
additional information and supervision for prediction. However, existing
approaches usually require a large set of human annotated explanations for
training while collecting a large set of explanations is not only time
consuming but also expensive. In this paper, we develop a general framework for
interpretable natural language understanding that requires only a small set of
human annotated explanations for training. Our framework treats natural
language explanations as latent variables that model the underlying reasoning
process of a neural model. We develop a variational EM framework for
optimization where an explanation generation module and an
explanation-augmented prediction module are alternatively optimized and
mutually enhance each other. Moreover, we further propose an explanation-based
self-training method under this framework for semi-supervised learning. It
alternates between assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data and generating new
explanations to iteratively improve each other. Experiments on two natural
language understanding tasks demonstrate that our framework can not only make
effective predictions in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, but also
generate good natural language explanation.</span>

                                        <span>The problem of real time prediction of blood glucose (BG) levels based on the
readings from a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device is a problem of
great importance in diabetes care, and therefore, has attracted a lot of
research in recent years, especially based on machine learning. An accurate
prediction with a 30, 60, or 90 minute prediction horizon has the potential of
saving millions of dollars in emergency care costs. In this paper, we treat the
problem as one of function approximation, where the value of the BG level at
time $t+h$ (where $h$ the prediction horizon) is considered to be an unknown
function of $d$ readings prior to the time $t$. This unknown function may be
supported in particular on some unknown submanifold of the $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space. While manifold learning is classically done in a
semi-supervised setting, where the entire data has to be known in advance, we
use recent ideas to achieve an accurate function approximation in a supervised
setting; i.e., construct a model for the target function. We use the
state-of-the-art clinically relevant PRED-EGA grid to evaluate our results, and
demonstrate that for a real life dataset, our method performs better than a
standard deep network, especially in hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic regimes.
One noteworthy aspect of this work is that the training data and test data may
come from different distributions.</span>

learning and graph convolutional neural networks. Our approach is to
recursively partition coarser representations of a given graph. The neural
network is implemented using SAGE graph convolution layers, and trained using
an advantage actor critic (A2C) agent. We present two variants, one for finding
an edge separator that minimizes the normalized cut or quotient cut, and one
that finds a small vertex separator. The vertex separators are then used to
construct a nested dissection ordering to permute a sparse matrix so that its
triangular factorization will incur less fill-in. The partitioning quality is
compared with partitions obtained using METIS and SCOTCH, and the nested
dissection ordering is evaluated in the sparse solver SuperLU. Our results show
that the proposed method achieves similar partitioning quality as METIS and
SCOTCH. Furthermore, the method generalizes across different classes of graphs,
and works well on a variety of graphs from the SuiteSparse sparse matrix

                                        <span>The Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal of resting-state fMRI
(rs-fMRI) records the temporal dynamics of intrinsic functional networks in the
brain. However, existing deep learning methods applied to rs-fMRI either
neglect the functional dependency between different brain regions in a network
or discard the information in the temporal dynamics of brain activity. To
overcome those shortcomings, we propose to formulate functional connectivity
networks within the context of spatio-temporal graphs. We train a
spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) on short sub-sequences of
the BOLD time series to model the non-stationary nature of functional
connectivity. Simultaneously, the model learns the importance of graph edges
within ST-GCN to gain insight into the functional connectivities contributing
to the prediction. In analyzing the rs-fMRI of the Human Connectome Project
(HCP, N&#x3D;1,091) and the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in
Adolescence (NCANDA, N&#x3D;773), ST-GCN is significantly more accurate than common
approaches in predicting gender and age based on BOLD signals. Furthermore, the
brain regions and functional connections significantly contributing to the
predictions of our model are important markers according to the neuroscience
literature.</span>

                                        <span>Byzantine robustness has received significant attention recently given its
importance for distributed and federated learning. In spite of this, we
identify severe flaws in existing algorithms even when the data across the
participants is identically distributed. First, we show realistic examples
where current state of the art robust aggregation rules fail to converge even
in the absence of any Byzantine attackers. Secondly, we prove that even if the
aggregation rules may succeed in limiting the influence of the attackers in a
single round, the attackers can couple their attacks across time eventually
leading to divergence. To address these issues, we present two surprisingly
simple strategies: a new robust iterative clipping procedure, and incorporating
worker momentum to overcome time-coupled attacks. This is the first provably
robust method for the standard stochastic optimization setting. Our code is

estimating the vibrational velocity field of a structure by means of acoustic
measurements. In this paper, we propose a NAH technique based on Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). The devised CNN predicts the vibrational field on the
surface of arbitrary shaped plates (violin plates) with orthotropic material
properties from a limited number of measurements. In particular, the
architecture, named Super Resolution CNN (SRCNN), is able to estimate the
vibrational field with a higher spatial resolution compared to the input
pressure. The pressure and velocity datasets have been generated through Finite
Element Method simulations. We validate the proposed method by comparing the
estimates with the synthesized ground truth and with a state-of-the-art
technique. Moreover, we evaluate the robustness of the devised network against

                                        <span>The Poisson equation is commonly encountered in engineering, for instance in
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) where it is needed to compute corrections to
the pressure field to ensure the incompressibility of the velocity field. In
the present work, we propose a novel fully convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture to infer the solution of the Poisson equation on a 2D Cartesian
grid with different resolutions given the right hand side term, arbitrary
boundary conditions and grid parameters. It provides unprecedented versatility
for a CNN approach dealing with partial differential equations. The boundary
conditions are handled using a novel approach by decomposing the original
Poisson problem into a homogeneous Poisson problem plus four inhomogeneous
Laplace sub-problems. The model is trained using a novel loss function
approximating the continuous $L^p$ norm between the prediction and the target.
Even when predicting on grids denser than previously encountered, our model
demonstrates encouraging capacity to reproduce the correct solution profile.
The proposed model, which outperforms well-known neural network models, can be
included in a CFD solver to help with solving the Poisson equation. Analytical
test cases indicate that our CNN architecture is capable of predicting the
correct solution of a Poisson problem with mean percentage errors below 10%, an
improvement by comparison to the first step of conventional iterative methods.
Predictions from our model, used as the initial guess to iterative algorithms
like Multigrid, can reduce the RMS error after a single iteration by more than
90% compared to a zero initial guess.</span>

                                        <span>In the domain generalization literature, a common objective is to learn
representations independent of the domain after conditioning on the class
label. We show that this objective is not sufficient: there exist
counter-examples where a model fails to generalize to unseen domains even after
satisfying class-conditional domain invariance. We formalize this observation
through a structural causal model and show the importance of modeling
within-class variations for generalization. Specifically, classes contain
objects that characterize specific causal features, and domains can be
interpreted as interventions on these objects that change non-causal features.
We highlight an alternative condition: inputs across domains should have the
same representation if they are derived from the same object. Based on this
objective, we propose matching-based algorithms when base objects are observed
(e.g., through data augmentation) and approximate the objective when objects
are not observed (MatchDG). Our simple matching-based algorithms are
competitive to prior work on out-of-domain accuracy for rotated MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, PACS, and Chest-Xray datasets. Our method MatchDG also recovers
ground-truth object matches: on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, top-10 matches from
MatchDG have over 50% overlap with ground-truth matches.</span>

as the source and target, respectively, we exploit both the chain rule and
Bayes&#x27; theorem to construct conditional transport (CT), which is constituted by
both a forward component and a backward one. The forward CT is the expected
cost of moving a source data point to a target one, with their joint
distribution defined by the product of the source probability density function
(PDF) and a source-dependent conditional distribution, which is related to the
target PDF via Bayes&#x27; theorem. The backward CT is defined by reversing the
direction. The CT cost can be approximated by replacing the source and target
PDFs with their discrete empirical distributions supported on mini-batches,
making it amenable to implicit distributions and stochastic gradient
descent-based optimization. When applied to train a generative model, CT is
shown to strike a good balance between mode-covering and mode-seeking behaviors
and strongly resist mode collapse. On a wide variety of benchmark datasets for
generative modeling, substituting the default statistical distance of an
existing generative adversarial network with CT is shown to consistently
improve the performance. PyTorch-style code is provided.</span>

                                        <span>When studying the expressive power of neural networks, a main challenge is to
understand how the size and depth of the network affect its ability to
approximate real functions. However, not all functions are interesting from a
practical viewpoint: functions of interest usually have a polynomially-bounded
Lipschitz constant, and can be computed efficiently. We call functions that
satisfy these conditions &quot;benign&quot;, and explore the benefits of size and depth
for approximation of benign functions with ReLU networks. As we show, this
problem is more challenging than the corresponding problem for non-benign
functions. We give barriers to showing depth-lower-bounds: Proving existence of
a benign function that cannot be approximated by polynomial-size networks of
depth $4$ would settle longstanding open problems in computational complexity.
It implies that beyond depth $4$ there is a barrier to showing depth-separation
for benign functions, even between networks of constant depth and networks of
nonconstant depth. We also study size-separation, namely, whether there are
benign functions that can be approximated with networks of size $O(s(d))$, but
not with networks of size $O(s&#x27;(d))$. We show a complexity-theoretic barrier to
proving such results beyond size $O(d\log^2(d))$, but also show an explicit
benign function, that can be approximated with networks of size $O(d)$ and not
with networks of size $o(d/\log d)$. For approximation in $L_\infty$ we achieve
such separation already between size $O(d)$ and size $o(d)$. Moreover, we show
superpolynomial size lower bounds and barriers to such lower bounds, depending
on the assumptions on the function. Our size-separation results rely on an
analysis of size lower bounds for Boolean functions, which is of independent
interest: We show linear size lower bounds for computing explicit Boolean
functions with neural networks and threshold circuits.</span>

open yet essential problem to characterize the origin of the adversarial
vulnerability of a multi-label learning system and assess its attackability. In
this study, we focus on non-targeted evasion attack against multi-label
classifiers. The goal of the threat is to cause miss-classification with
respect to as many labels as possible, with the same input perturbation. Our
work gains in-depth understanding about the multi-label adversarial attack by
first characterizing the transferability of the attack based on the functional
properties of the multi-label classifier. We unveil how the transferability
level of the attack determines the attackability of the classifier via
establishing an information-theoretic analysis of the adversarial risk.
Furthermore, we propose a transferability-centered attackability assessment,
named Soft Attackability Estimator (SAE), to evaluate the intrinsic
vulnerability level of the targeted multi-label classifier. This estimator is
then integrated as a transferability-tuning regularization term into the
multi-label learning paradigm to achieve adversarially robust classification.
The experimental study on real-world data echos the theoretical analysis and
verify the validity of the transferability-regularized multi-label learning
method.</span>

                                        <span>Quantum auto-encoder (QAE) is a powerful tool to relieve the curse of
dimensionality encountered in quantum physics, celebrated by the ability to
extract low-dimensional patterns from quantum states living in the
high-dimensional space. Despite its attractive properties, little is known
about the practical applications of QAE with provable advantages. To address
these issues, here we prove that QAE can be used to efficiently calculate the
eigenvalues and prepare the corresponding eigenvectors of a high-dimensional
quantum state with the low-rank property. With this regard, we devise three
effective QAE-based learning protocols to solve the low-rank state fidelity
estimation, the quantum Gibbs state preparation, and the quantum metrology
tasks, respectively. Notably, all of these protocols are scalable and can be
readily executed on near-term quantum machines. Moreover, we prove that the
error bounds of the proposed QAE-based methods outperform those in previous
literature. Numerical simulations collaborate with our theoretical analysis.
Our work opens a new avenue of utilizing QAE to tackle various quantum physics
and quantum information processing problems in a scalable way.</span>

datasets is a fundamental analysis task. For high-dimensional data,
dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are often used to find the
characteristics of each group. However, existing DR methods provide limited
capability and flexibility for such comparative analysis as each method is
designed only for a narrow analysis target, such as identifying factors that
most differentiate groups. In this work, we introduce an interactive DR
framework where we integrate our new DR method, called ULCA (unified linear
comparative analysis), with an interactive visual interface. ULCA unifies two
DR schemes, discriminant analysis and contrastive learning, to support various
comparative analysis tasks. To provide flexibility for comparative analysis, we
develop an optimization algorithm that enables analysts to interactively refine
ULCA results. Additionally, we provide an interactive visualization interface
to examine ULCA results with a rich set of analysis libraries. We evaluate ULCA
and the optimization algorithm to show their efficiency as well as present
multiple case studies using real-world datasets to demonstrate the usefulness
of our framework.</span>

                                        <span>Conditional gradient methods have attracted much attention in both machine
learning and optimization communities recently. These simple methods can
guarantee the generation of sparse solutions. In addition, without the
computation of full gradients, they can handle huge-scale problems sometimes
even with an exponentially increasing number of decision variables. This paper
aims to significantly expand the application areas of these methods by
presenting new conditional gradient methods for solving convex optimization
problems with general affine and nonlinear constraints. More specifically, we
first present a new constraint extrapolated condition gradient (CoexCG) method
that can achieve an ${\cal O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity for both
smooth and structured nonsmooth function constrained convex optimization. We
further develop novel variants of CoexCG, namely constraint extrapolated and
dual regularized conditional gradient (CoexDurCG) methods, that can achieve
similar iteration complexity to CoexCG but allow adaptive selection for
algorithmic parameters. We illustrate the effectiveness of these methods for
solving an important class of radiation therapy treatment planning problems
arising from healthcare industry. To the best of our knowledge, all the
algorithmic schemes and their complexity results are new in the area of
projection-free methods.</span>

recently. Existing studies address the problem using shallow learning
mechanisms such as subspace selection, ego-network, or community analysis.
These models do not take into account the multifaceted interactions between the
structure and attributes in the network. In this paper, we propose GraphAnoGAN,
an anomalous snapshot ranking framework, which consists of two core components
-- generative and discriminative models. Specifically, the generative model
learns to approximate the distribution of anomalous samples from the candidate
set of graph snapshots, and the discriminative model detects whether the
sampled snapshot is from the ground-truth or not. Experiments on 4 real-world
networks show that GraphAnoGAN outperforms 6 baselines with a significant
margin (28.29% and 22.01% higher precision and recall, respectively compared to
the best baseline, averaged across all datasets).</span>

performant and flexible deployment policies that can readily incorporate
constraints during deployment. One such class of policies are the
semi-parametric H-step lookahead policies, which select actions using
trajectory optimization over a dynamics model for a fixed horizon with a
terminal value function. In this work, we investigate a novel instantiation of
H-step lookahead with a learned model and a terminal value function learned by
a model-free off-policy algorithm, named Learning Off-Policy with Online
Planning (LOOP). We provide a theoretical analysis of this method, suggesting a
tradeoff between model errors and value function errors and empirically
demonstrate this tradeoff to be beneficial in deep reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, we identify the &quot;Actor Divergence&quot; issue in this framework and
propose Actor Regularized Control (ARC), a modified trajectory optimization
procedure. We evaluate our method on a set of robotic tasks for Offline and
Online RL and demonstrate improved performance. We also show the flexibility of
LOOP to incorporate safety constraints during deployment with a set of
navigation environments. We demonstrate that LOOP is a desirable framework for
robotics applications based on its strong performance in various important RL
settings.</span>

                                        <span>With the development of blockchain technologies, the number of smart
contracts deployed on blockchain platforms is growing exponentially, which
makes it difficult for users to find desired services by manual screening. The
automatic classification of smart contracts can provide blockchain users with
keyword-based contract searching and helps to manage smart contracts
effectively. Current research on smart contract classification focuses on
Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions which are based on contract source
code. However, more than 94% of smart contracts are not open-source, so the
application scenarios of NLP methods are very limited. Meanwhile, NLP models
are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a classification
model based on features from contract bytecode instead of source code to solve
these problems. We also use feature selection and ensemble learning to optimize
the model. Our experimental studies on over 3,300 real-world Ethereum smart
contracts show that our model can classify smart contracts without source code
and has better performance than baseline models. Our model also has good
resistance to adversarial attacks compared with NLP-based models. In addition,
our analysis reveals that account features used in many smart contract
classification models have little effect on classification and can be excluded.</span>

Intelligence (AI) errors. Systematic re-training of a large AI system is hardly
possible. To solve this problem, special external devices, correctors, are
developed. They should provide quick and non-iterative system fix without
modification of a legacy AI system. A common universal part of the AI corrector
is a classifier that should separate undesired and erroneous behavior from
normal operation. Training of such classifiers is a grand challenge at the
heart of the one- and few-shot learning methods. Effectiveness of one- and
few-short methods is based on either significant dimensionality reductions or
the blessing of dimensionality effects. Stochastic separability is a blessing
of dimensionality phenomenon that allows one-and few-shot error correction: in
high-dimensional datasets under broad assumptions each point can be separated
from the rest of the set by simple and robust linear discriminant. The
hierarchical structure of data universe is introduced where each data cluster
has a granular internal structure, etc. New stochastic separation theorems for
the data distributions with fine-grained structure are formulated and proved.
Separation theorems in infinite-dimensional limits are proven under assumptions
of compact embedding of patterns into data space. New multi-correctors of AI
systems are presented and illustrated with examples of predicting errors and
learning new classes of objects by a deep convolutional neural network.</span>

does not guarantee convergence. In this work, we show that DQN can diverge and
cease to operate in realistic settings. Although there exist gradient-based
convergent methods, we show that they actually have inherent problems in
learning behaviour and elucidate why they often fail in practice. To overcome
these problems, we propose a convergent DQN algorithm (C-DQN) by carefully
modifying DQN, and we show that the algorithm is convergent and can work with
large discount factors (0.9998). It learns robustly in difficult settings and
can learn several difficult games in the Atari 2600 benchmark where DQN fail,
within a moderate computational budget. Our codes have been publicly released

the success of downstream tasks such as unsupervised clustering and data

produce aligned latent spaces by stretching along the left singular vectors of
the data. We fully characterize the amount of stretching in linear autoencoders
and provide an initialization scheme to arbitrarily stretch along the top

nonlinear autoencoders in a simplified setting. We use our theoretical results

                                        <span>Researchers have been battling with the question of how we can identify
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases efficiently, affordably and at scale.
Recent work has shown how audio based approaches, which collect respiratory
audio data (cough, breathing and voice) can be used for testing, however there
is a lack of exploration of how biases and methodological decisions impact
these tools&#x27; performance in practice. In this paper, we explore the realistic
performance of audio-based digital testing of COVID-19. To investigate this, we
collected a large crowdsourced respiratory audio dataset through a mobile app,
alongside recent COVID-19 test result and symptoms intended as a ground truth.
Within the collected dataset, we selected 5,240 samples from 2,478 participants
and split them into different participant-independent sets for model
development and validation. Among these, we controlled for potential
confounding factors (such as demographics and language). The unbiased model
takes features extracted from breathing, coughs, and voice signals as
predictors and yields an AUC-ROC of 0.71 (95\% CI: 0.65$-$0.77). We further
explore different unbalanced distributions to show how biases and participant
splits affect performance. Finally, we discuss how the realistic model
presented could be integrated in clinical practice to realize continuous,
ubiquitous, sustainable and affordable testing at population scale.</span>

tasks and holds promise for providing important empirical insight into the
behaviour of machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive meta-learning study of data sets and methods for multi-label
classification (MLC). MLC is a practically relevant machine learning task where
each example is labelled with multiple labels simultaneously. Here, we analyze
40 MLC data sets by using 50 meta features describing different properties of
the data. The main findings of this study are as follows. First, the most
prominent meta features that describe the space of MLC data sets are the ones
assessing different aspects of the label space. Second, the meta models show
that the most important meta features describe the label space, and, the meta
features describing the relationships among the labels tend to occur a bit more
often than the meta features describing the distributions between and within
the individual labels. Third, the optimization of the hyperparameters can
improve the predictive performance, however, quite often the extent of the
improvements does not always justify the resource utilization.</span>

collaboratively train a global model, which potentially address the data
privacy issue of machine learning. In such promising paradigm, the performance
will be deteriorated without sufficient training data and other resources in
the learning process. Thus, it is quite crucial to inspire more participants to
contribute their valuable resources with some payments for federated learning.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of incentive schemes for
federate learning. Specifically, we identify the incentive problem in federated
learning and then provide a taxonomy for various schemes. Subsequently, we
summarize the existing incentive mechanisms in terms of the main techniques,
such as Stackelberg game, auction, contract theory, Shapley value,
reinforcement learning, blockchain. By reviewing and comparing some impressive

                                        <span>In the field of adversarial robustness, there is a common practice that
adopts the single-step adversarial training for quickly developing
adversarially robust models. However, the single-step adversarial training is
most likely to cause catastrophic overfitting, as after a few training epochs
it will be hard to generate strong adversarial examples to continuously boost
the adversarial robustness. In this work, we aim to avoid the catastrophic
overfitting by introducing multi-step adversarial examples during the
single-step adversarial training. Then, to balance the large training overhead
of generating multi-step adversarial examples, we propose a Multi-stage
Optimization based Adversarial Training (MOAT) method that periodically trains
the model on mixed benign examples, single-step adversarial examples, and
multi-step adversarial examples stage by stage. In this way, the overall
training overhead is reduced significantly, meanwhile, the model could avoid
catastrophic overfitting. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets demonstrate that under similar amount of training overhead, the
proposed MOAT exhibits better robustness than either single-step or multi-step
adversarial training methods.</span>

large zoo of pretrained models are available. When transferring from a model
zoo, applying classic single-model based transfer learning methods to each
source model suffers from high computational burden and cannot fully utilize
the rich knowledge in the zoo. We propose \emph{Zoo-Tuning} to address these
challenges, which learns to adaptively transfer the parameters of pretrained
models to the target task. With the learnable channel alignment layer and
adaptive aggregation layer, Zoo-Tuning \emph{adaptively aggregates channel
aligned pretrained parameters} to derive the target model, which promotes
knowledge transfer by simultaneously adapting multiple source models to
downstream tasks. The adaptive aggregation substantially reduces the
computation cost at both training and inference. We further propose lite
Zoo-Tuning with the temporal ensemble of batch average gating values to reduce
the storage cost at the inference time. We evaluate our approach on a variety
of tasks, including reinforcement learning, image classification, and facial
landmark detection. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive
transfer learning approach can transfer knowledge from a zoo of models more

efficiency in characterizing both the complex structure and relationship
between multimedia data. However, existing methods have the following
shortcomings: (1) They are inefficient or even fail for graph learning in large
scale due to the graph construction and eigen-decomposition. (2) They cannot
well exploit both the complementary information and spatial structure embedded
in graphs of different views. To well exploit complementary information and
tackle the scalability issue plaguing graph-based multi-view clustering, we
propose an efficient multiple graph learning model via a small number of anchor
points and tensor Schatten p-norm minimization. Specifically, we construct a
hidden and tractable large graph by anchor graph for each view and well exploit
complementary information embedded in anchor graphs of different views by
tensor Schatten p-norm regularizer. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm,
which scales linearly with the data size, to solve our proposed model.
Extensive experimental results on several datasets indicate that our proposed
method outperforms some state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms.</span>

these difficulties, we propose a new interaction detection method, named Online
Random Intersection Chains. The method, which is based on the idea of frequent
itemset mining, detects informative interactions by observing the intersections
of randomly chosen samples. The discovered interactions enjoy high
interpretability as they can be comprehended as logical expressions. ORIC can
be updated every time new data is collected, without being retrained on
historical data. What&#x27;s more, the importance of the historical and latest data
can be controlled by a tuning parameter. A framework is designed to deal with
the streaming interactions, so almost all existing models for CTR prediction
can be applied after interaction detection. Empirical results demonstrate the
efficiency and effectiveness of ORIC on three benchmark datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning aims to learn a global model that performs well on client
devices with limited cross-client communication. Personalized federated
learning (PFL) further extends this setup to handle data heterogeneity between
clients by learning personalized models. A key challenge in this setting is to
learn effectively across clients even though each client has unique data that
is often limited in size. Here we present pFedGP, a solution to PFL that is
based on Gaussian processes (GPs) with deep kernel learning. GPs are highly
expressive models that work well in the low data regime due to their Bayesian
nature. However, applying GPs to PFL raises multiple challenges. Mainly, GPs
performance depends heavily on access to a good kernel function, and learning a
kernel requires a large training set. Therefore, we propose learning a shared
kernel function across all clients, parameterized by a neural network, with a
personal GP classifier for each client. We further extend pFedGP to include
inducing points using two novel methods, the first helps to improve
generalization in the low data regime and the second reduces the computational
cost. We derive a PAC-Bayes generalization bound on novel clients and
empirically show that it gives non-vacuous guarantees. Extensive experiments on
standard PFL benchmarks with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10, and on a new
setup of learning under input noise show that pFedGP achieves well-calibrated
predictions while significantly outperforming baseline methods, reaching up to
21% in accuracy gain.</span>

                                        <span>The Sliced-Wasserstein distance (SW) is being increasingly used in machine
learning applications as an alternative to the Wasserstein distance and offers
significant computational and statistical benefits. Since it is defined as an
expectation over random projections, SW is commonly approximated by Monte
Carlo. We adopt a new perspective to approximate SW by making use of the
concentration of measure phenomenon: under mild assumptions, one-dimensional
projections of a high-dimensional random vector are approximately Gaussian.
Based on this observation, we develop a simple deterministic approximation for
SW. Our method does not require sampling a number of random projections, and is
therefore both accurate and easy to use compared to the usual Monte Carlo
approximation. We derive nonasymptotical guarantees for our approach, and show
that the approximation error goes to zero as the dimension increases, under a
weak dependence condition on the data distribution. We validate our theoretical
findings on synthetic datasets, and illustrate the proposed approximation on a
generative modeling problem.</span>

from complex visual scenes due to their inability to prioritize task-relevant
features. To mitigate this problem, we propose learning Task Informed
Abstractions (TIA) that explicitly separates reward-correlated visual features
from distractors. For learning TIA, we introduce the formalism of Task Informed
MDP (TiMDP) that is realized by training two models that learn visual features
via cooperative reconstruction, but one model is adversarially dissociated from
the reward signal. Empirical evaluation shows that TIA leads to significant
performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on many visual control tasks

last few decades and their population is expected to further increase in the
upcoming future. Their increasing population is associated with their
increasing needs due to problems like physical disabilities, cognitive issues,
weakened memory and disorganized behavior, that elderly people face with
increasing age. To reduce their financial burden on the world economy and to
enhance their quality of life, it is essential to develop technology-based
solutions that are adaptive, assistive and intelligent in nature. Intelligent
Affect Aware Systems that can not only analyze but also predict the behavior of
elderly people in the context of their day to day interactions with technology
in an IoT-based environment, holds immense potential for serving as a long-term
solution for improving the user experience of elderly in smart homes. This work
therefore proposes the framework for an Intelligent Affect Aware environment
for elderly people that can not only analyze the affective components of their
interactions but also predict their likely user experience even before they
start engaging in any activity in the given smart home environment. This
forecasting of user experience would provide scope for enhancing the same,
thereby increasing the assistive and adaptive nature of such intelligent

stamps exist in many disciplines. Fitting this type of data using statistical
models with continuous dynamics is not only promising at an intuitive level but
also has practical benefits, including the ability to generate continuous
trajectories and to perform inference on previously unseen time stamps. Despite
exciting progress in this area, the existing models still face challenges in
terms of their representational power and the quality of their variational
approximations. We tackle these challenges with continuous latent process flows
(CLPF), a principled architecture decoding continuous latent processes into
continuous observable processes using a time-dependent normalizing flow driven
by a stochastic differential equation. To optimize our model using maximum
likelihood, we propose a novel piecewise construction of a variational
posterior process and derive the corresponding variational lower bound using
trajectory re-weighting. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of
our contributions in various inference tasks on irregular time grids.
Comparisons to state-of-the-art baselines show our model&#x27;s favourable
performance on both synthetic and real-world time-series data.</span>

Benchmark Large Scale Challenge (OGB-LSC) was proposed at the KDD Cup 2021. The
PCQM4M-LSC dataset defines a molecular HOMO-LUMO property prediction task on
about 3.8M graphs. In this short paper, we show our current work-in-progress
solution which builds an ensemble of three graph neural networks models based
on GIN, Bayesian Neural Networks and DiffPool. Our approach outperforms the
provided baseline by 7.6%. Moreover, using uncertainty in our ensemble&#x27;s
prediction, we can identify molecules whose HOMO-LUMO gaps are harder to
predict (with Pearson&#x27;s correlation of 0.5181). We anticipate that this will
facilitate active learning.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks for image quality enhancement typically need large
quantities of highly-curated training data comprising pairs of low-quality
images and their corresponding high-quality images. While high-quality image
acquisition is typically expensive and time-consuming, medium-quality images
are faster to acquire, at lower equipment costs, and available in larger
quantities. Thus, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) that
can leverage training data at multiple levels of quality (e.g., high and medium
quality) to improve performance while limiting costs of data curation. We apply
our mixed-supervision GAN to (i) super-resolve histopathology images and (ii)
enhance laparoscopy images by combining super-resolution and surgical smoke
removal. Results on large clinical and pre-clinical datasets show the benefits
of our mixed-supervision GAN over the state of the art.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performances
for quantum mechanical problems. However, a graph convolution can only cover a
localized region, and cannot capture long-range interactions of atoms. This
behavior is contrary to theoretical interatomic potentials, which is a
fundamental limitation of the spatial based GNNs. In this work, we propose a
novel attention-based framework for molecular property prediction tasks. We
represent a molecular conformation as a discrete atomic sequence combined by
atom-atom distance attributes, named Geometry-aware Transformer (GeoT). In
particular, we adopt a Transformer architecture, which has been widely used for
sequential data. Our proposed model trains sequential representations of
molecular graphs based on globally constructed attentions, maintaining all
spatial arrangements of atom pairs. Our method does not suffer from cost
intensive computations, such as angle calculations. The experimental results on
several public benchmarks and visualization maps verified that keeping the
long-range interatomic attributes can significantly improve the model
predictability.</span>

                                        <span>Despite enormous successful applications of graph neural networks (GNNs)
recently, theoretical understandings of their generalization ability,
especially for node-level tasks where data are not independent and
identically-distributed (IID), have been sparse. The theoretical investigation
of the generalization performance is beneficial for understanding fundamental
issues (such as fairness) of GNN models and designing better learning methods.
In this paper, we present a novel PAC-Bayesian analysis for GNNs under a
non-IID semi-supervised learning setup. Moreover, we analyze the generalization
performances on different subgroups of unlabeled nodes, which allows us to
further study an accuracy-(dis)parity-style (un)fairness of GNNs from a
theoretical perspective. Under reasonable assumptions, we demonstrate that the
distance between a test subgroup and the training set can be a key factor
affecting the GNN performance on that subgroup, which calls special attention
to the training node selection for fair learning. Experiments across multiple
GNN models and datasets support our theoretical results.</span>

                                        <span>Localizing and counting large ungulates -- hoofed mammals like cows and elk
-- in very high-resolution satellite imagery is an important task for
supporting ecological studies. Prior work has shown that this is feasible with
deep learning based methods and sub-meter multi-spectral satellite imagery. We
extend this line of work by proposing a baseline method, CowNet, that
simultaneously estimates the number of animals in an image (counts), as well as
predicts their location at a pixel level (localizes). We also propose an
methodology for evaluating such models on counting and localization tasks
across large scenes that takes the uncertainty of noisy labels and the
information needed by stakeholders in ecological monitoring tasks into account.
Finally, we benchmark our baseline method with state of the art vision methods
for counting objects in scenes. We specifically test the temporal
generalization of the resulting models over a large landscape in Point Reyes
Seashore, CA. We find that the LC-FCN model performs the best and achieves an
average precision between 0.56 and 0.61 and an average recall between 0.78 and
0.92 over three held out test scenes.</span>

the presence of latent variables. The main problem of interest is recovering
the causal structure over the latent variables while allowing for general,
potentially nonlinear dependence between the variables. In many practical
problems, the dependence between raw observations (e.g. pixels in an image) is
much less relevant than the dependence between certain high-level, latent
features (e.g. concepts or objects), and this is the setting of interest. We
provide conditions under which both the latent representations and the
underlying latent causal model are identifiable by a reduction to a mixture
oracle. The proof is constructive, and leads to several algorithms for
explicitly reconstructing the full graphical model. We discuss efficient
algorithms and provide experiments illustrating the algorithms in practice.</span>

depends on the proper structure of the modeling pipeline. The proposed approach
is aimed to automate the design of composite machine learning pipelines, which
is equivalent to computation workflows that consist of models and data
operations. The approach combines key ideas of both automated machine learning
and workflow management systems. It designs the pipelines with a customizable
graph-based structure, analyzes the obtained results, and reproduces them. The
evolutionary approach is used for the flexible identification of pipeline
structure. The additional algorithms for sensitivity analysis, atomization, and
hyperparameter tuning are implemented to improve the effectiveness of the
approach. Also, the software implementation on this approach is presented as an
open-source framework. The set of experiments is conducted for the different

                                        <span>The performance of supervised deep learning algorithms depends significantly
on the scale, quality and diversity of the data used for their training.
Collecting and manually annotating large amount of data can be both
time-consuming and costly tasks to perform. In the case of tasks related to
visual human-centric perception, the collection and distribution of such data
may also face restrictions due to legislation regarding privacy. In addition,
the design and testing of complex systems, e.g., robots, which often employ
deep learning-based perception models, may face severe difficulties as even
state-of-the-art methods trained on real and large-scale datasets cannot always
perform adequately as they have not adapted to the visual differences between
the virtual and the real world data. As an attempt to tackle and mitigate the
effect of these issues, we present a method that automatically generates
realistic synthetic data with annotations for a) person detection, b) face
recognition, and c) human pose estimation. The proposed method takes as input
real background images and populates them with human figures in various poses.
Instead of using hand-made 3D human models, we propose the use of models
generated through deep learning methods, further reducing the dataset creation
costs, while maintaining a high level of realism. In addition, we provide
open-source and easy to use tools that implement the proposed pipeline,
allowing for generating highly-realistic synthetic datasets for a variety of
tasks. A benchmarking and evaluation in the corresponding tasks shows that
synthetic data can be effectively used as a supplement to real data.</span>

                                        <span>Bayesian optimization is a promising methodology for analog circuit
synthesis. However, the sequential nature of the Bayesian optimization
framework significantly limits its ability to fully utilize real-world
computational resources. In this paper, we propose an efficient parallelizable
Bayesian optimization algorithm via Multi-objective ACquisition function
Ensemble (MACE) to further accelerate the optimization procedure. By sampling
query points from the Pareto front of the probability of improvement (PI),
expected improvement (EI) and lower confidence bound (LCB), we combine the
benefits of state-of-the-art acquisition functions to achieve a delicate
tradeoff between exploration and exploitation for the unconstrained
optimization problem. Based on this batch design, we further adjust the
algorithm for the constrained optimization problem. By dividing the
optimization procedure into two stages and first focusing on finding an initial
feasible point, we manage to gain more information about the valid region and
can better avoid sampling around the infeasible area. After achieving the first
feasible point, we favor the feasible region by adopting a specially designed
penalization term to the acquisition function ensemble. The experimental
results quantitatively demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce the
overall simulation time by up to 74 times compared to differential evolution
(DE) for the unconstrained optimization problem when the batch size is 15. For
the constrained optimization problem, our proposed algorithm can speed up the
optimization process by up to 15 times compared to the weighted expected
improvement based Bayesian optimization (WEIBO) approach, when the batch size
is 15.</span>

                                        <span>Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is one of the most popular and
widely-adopted meta-learning algorithms nowadays, which achieves remarkable
success in various learning problems. Yet, with the unique design of nested
inner-loop and outer-loop updates which respectively govern the task-specific
and meta-model-centric learning, the underlying learning objective of MAML
still remains implicit and thus impedes a more straightforward understanding of
it. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to the working mechanism of
MAML and discover that: MAML is analogous to a meta-learner using a supervised
contrastive objective function, where the query features are pulled towards the
support features of the same class and against those of different classes, in
which such contrastiveness is experimentally verified via an analysis based on
the cosine similarity. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the vanilla MAML
algorithm has an undesirable interference term originating from the random
initialization and the cross-task interaction. We therefore propose a simple
but effective technique, zeroing trick, to alleviate such interference, where
the extensive experiments are then conducted on both miniImagenet and Omniglot
datasets to demonstrate the consistent improvement brought by our proposed
technique thus well validating its effectiveness.</span>

                                        <span>Having access to an exploring restart distribution (the so-called wide
coverage assumption) is critical with policy gradient methods. This is due to
the fact that, while the objective function is insensitive to updates in
unlikely states, the agent may still need improvements in those states in order
to reach a nearly optimal payoff. For this reason, wide coverage is used in
some form when analyzing theoretical properties of practical policy gradient
methods. However, this assumption can be unfeasible in certain environments,
for instance when learning is online, or when restarts are possible only from a
fixed initial state. In these cases, classical policy gradient algorithms can
have very poor convergence properties and sample efficiency. In this paper, we
develop Curious Explorer, a novel and simple iterative state space exploration
strategy that can be used with any starting distribution $\rho$. Curious
Explorer starts from $\rho$, then using intrinsic rewards assigned to the set
of poorly visited states produces a sequence of policies, each one more
exploratory than the previous one in an informed way, and finally outputs a
restart model $\mu$ based on the state visitation distribution of the
exploratory policies. Curious Explorer is provable, in the sense that we
provide theoretical upper bounds on how often an optimal policy visits poorly
visited states. These bounds can be used to prove PAC convergence and sample
efficiency results when a PAC optimizer is plugged in Curious Explorer. This
allows to achieve global convergence and sample efficiency results without any
coverage assumption for REINFORCE, and potentially for any other policy
gradient method ensuring PAC convergence with wide coverage. Finally, we plug
(the output of) Curious Explorer into REINFORCE and TRPO, and show empirically
that it can improve performance in MDPs with challenging exploration.</span>

learning for linearly-solvable Markov decision processes. Our approach assumes
that the state space is partitioned, and the subtasks consist in moving between
the partitions. We represent value functions on several levels of abstraction,
and use the compositionality of subtasks to estimate the optimal values of the
states in each partition. The policy is implicitly defined on these optimal
value estimates, rather than being decomposed among the subtasks. As a
consequence, our approach can learn the globally optimal policy, and does not
suffer from the non-stationarity of high-level decisions. If several partitions
have equivalent dynamics, the subtasks of those partitions can be shared. If
the set of boundary states is smaller than the entire state space, our approach
can have significantly smaller sample complexity than that of a flat learner,
and we validate this empirically in several experiments.</span>

                                        <span>3D model generation from single 2D RGB images is a challenging and actively
researched computer vision task. Various techniques using conventional network
architectures have been proposed for the same. However, the body of research
work is limited and there are various issues like using inefficient 3D
representation formats, weak 3D model generation backbones, inability to
generate dense point clouds, dependence of post-processing for generation of
dense point clouds, and dependence on silhouettes in RGB images. In this paper,
a novel 2D RGB image to point cloud conversion technique is proposed, which
improves the state of art in the field due to its efficient, robust and simple
model by using the concept of parallelization in network architecture. It not
only uses the efficient and rich 3D representation of point clouds, but also
uses a novel and robust point cloud generation backbone in order to address the
prevalent issues. This involves using a single-encoder multiple-decoder deep
network architecture wherein each decoder generates certain fixed viewpoints.
This is followed by fusing all the viewpoints to generate a dense point cloud.
Various experiments are conducted on the technique and its performance is
compared with those of other state of the art techniques and impressive gains
in performance are demonstrated. Code is available at

                                        <span>Scientific and engineering problems often require the use of artificial
intelligence to aid understanding and the search for promising designs. While
Gaussian processes (GP) stand out as easy-to-use and interpretable learners,
they have difficulties in accommodating big datasets, categorical inputs, and
multiple responses, which has become a common challenge for a growing number of
data-driven design applications. In this paper, we propose a GP model that
utilizes latent variables and functions obtained through variational inference
to address the aforementioned challenges simultaneously. The method is built
upon the latent variable Gaussian process (LVGP) model where categorical
factors are mapped into a continuous latent space to enable GP modeling of
mixed-variable datasets. By extending variational inference to LVGP models, the
large training dataset is replaced by a small set of inducing points to address
the scalability issue. Output response vectors are represented by a linear
combination of independent latent functions, forming a flexible kernel
structure to handle multiple responses that might have distinct behaviors.
Comparative studies demonstrate that the proposed method scales well for large
datasets with over 10^4 data points, while outperforming state-of-the-art
machine learning methods without requiring much hyperparameter tuning. In
addition, an interpretable latent space is obtained to draw insights into the
effect of categorical factors, such as those associated with building blocks of
architectures and element choices in metamaterial and materials design. Our
approach is demonstrated for machine learning of ternary oxide materials and
topology optimization of a multiscale compliant mechanism with aperiodic
microstructures and multiple materials.</span>

increase in the use of customers personal data to analyze customer behavior and
predict their interests in a companys products. Increased use of this customer

building privacy protections into the data engineering and model training

components, i.e. albedo, normal and lighting. To solve this ill-posed problem
from single image, state-of-the-art methods in shape from shading mostly resort
to supervised training on all the components on either synthetic or real
datasets. Here, we propose a new self-supervised training paradigm that 1)
reduces the need for full supervision on the decomposition task and 2) takes
into account the relighting task. We introduce new self-supervised loss terms
that leverage the consistencies between multi-lit images (images of the same
scene under different illuminations). Our approach is applicable to multi-lit
datasets. We apply our training approach in two settings: 1) train on a mixture
of synthetic and real data, 2) train on real datasets with limited supervision.
We show-case the effectiveness of our training paradigm on both intrinsic
decomposition and relighting and demonstrate how the model struggles in both
tasks without the self-supervised loss terms in limited supervision settings.
We provide results of comprehensive experiments on SfSNet, CelebA and Photoface

                                        <span>Spreadsheet formula prediction has been an important program synthesis
problem with many real-world applications. Previous works typically utilize
input-output examples as the specification for spreadsheet formula synthesis,
where each input-output pair simulates a separate row in the spreadsheet.
However, this formulation does not fully capture the rich context in real-world
spreadsheets. First, spreadsheet data entries are organized as tables, thus
rows and columns are not necessarily independent from each other. In addition,
many spreadsheet tables include headers, which provide high-level descriptions
of the cell data. However, previous synthesis approaches do not consider
headers as part of the specification. In this work, we present the first
approach for synthesizing spreadsheet formulas from tabular context, which
includes both headers and semi-structured tabular data. In particular, we
propose SpreadsheetCoder, a BERT-based model architecture to represent the
tabular context in both row-based and column-based formats. We train our model
on a large dataset of spreadsheets, and demonstrate that SpreadsheetCoder
achieves top-1 prediction accuracy of 42.51%, which is a considerable
improvement over baselines that do not employ rich tabular context. Compared to
the rule-based system, SpreadsheetCoder assists 82% more users in composing
formulas on Google Sheets.</span>

                                        <span>Gene expression datasets consist of thousand of genes with relatively small
samplesizes (i.e. are large-$p$-small-$n$). Moreover, dependencies of various
orders co-exist in the datasets. In the Undirected probabilistic Graphical
Model (UGM) framework the Glasso algorithm has been proposed to deal with high
dimensional micro-array datasets forcing sparsity. Also, modifications of the
default Glasso algorithm are developed to overcome the problem of complex
interaction structure. In this work we advocate the use of a simple score-based
Hill Climbing algorithm (HC) that learns Gaussian Bayesian Networks (BNs)
leaning on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). We compare HC with Glasso and its
modifications in the UGM framework on their capability to reconstruct GRNs from
micro-array data belonging to the Escherichia Coli genome. We benefit from the
analytical properties of the Joint Probability Density (JPD) function on which
both directed and undirected PGMs build to convert DAGs to UGMs.

We conclude that dependencies in complex data are learned best by the HC
algorithm, presenting them most accurately and efficiently, simultaneously
modelling strong local and weaker but significant global connections coexisting
in the gene expression dataset. The HC algorithm adapts intrinsically to the
complex dependency structure of the dataset, without forcing a specific
structure in advance. On the contrary, Glasso and modifications model
unnecessary dependencies at the expense of the probabilistic information in the
network and of a structural bias in the JPD function that can only be relieved
including many parameters.</span>

class expression learning on RDF knowledge graphs. These approaches often need
to explore a large number of concepts to find adequate hypotheses. This need
arguably stems from current approaches relying on myopic heuristic functions to
guide their search through an infinite concept space. In turn, deep
reinforcement learning provides effective means to address myopia by estimating
how much discounted cumulated future reward states promise. In this work, we
leverage deep reinforcement learning to accelerate the learning of concepts in
$\mathcal{ALC}$ by proposing DRILL -- a novel class expression learning
approach that uses a convolutional deep Q-learning model to steer its search.
By virtue of its architecture, DRILL is able to compute the expected discounted
cumulated future reward of more than $10^3$ class expressions in a second on
standard hardware. We evaluate DRILL on four benchmark datasets against
state-of-the-art approaches. Our results suggest that DRILL converges to goal
states at least 2.7$\times$ faster than state-of-the-art models on all
benchmark datasets. We provide an open-source implementation of our approach,

                                        <span>Critical role of Internet of Things (IoT) in various domains like smart city,
healthcare, supply chain and transportation has made them the target of
malicious attacks. Past works in this area focused on centralized Intrusion
Detection System (IDS), assuming the existence of a central entity to perform
data analysis and identify threats. However, such IDS may not always be
feasible, mainly due to spread of data across multiple sources and gathering at
central node can be costly. Also, the earlier works primarily focused on
improving True Positive Rate (TPR) and ignored the False Positive Rate (FPR),
which is also essential to avoid unnecessary downtime of the systems. In this
paper, we first present an architecture for IDS based on hybrid ensemble model,
named PHEC, which gives improved performance compared to state-of-the-art
architectures. We then adapt this model to a federated learning framework that
performs local training and aggregates only the model parameters. Next, we
propose Noise-Tolerant PHEC in centralized and federated settings to address
the label-noise problem. The proposed idea uses classifiers using weighted
convex surrogate loss functions. Natural robustness of KNN classifier towards
noisy data is also used in the proposed architecture. Experimental results on
four benchmark datasets drawn from various security attacks show that our model
achieves high TPR while keeping FPR low on noisy and clean data. Further, they
also demonstrate that the hybrid ensemble models achieve performance in
federated settings close to that of the centralized settings.</span>

image from an abnormal one (e.g., with lesions), is critical in many
perspectives, from lesion detection, data augmentation to clinical surgery
suggestion. However, it is challenging to generate high-quality pseudo-normal
images in the absence of the lesion information. Thus, expensive lesion
segmentation data have been introduced to provide lesion information for the
generative models and improve the quality of the synthetic images. In this
paper, we aim to alleviate the need of a large amount of lesion segmentation
data when generating pseudo-normal images. We propose a Semi-supervised Medical
Image generative LEarning network (SMILE) which not only utilizes limited
medical images with segmentation masks, but also leverages massive medical
images without segmentation masks to generate realistic pseudo-normal images.
Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms the best state-of-the-art
model by up to 6% for data augmentation task and 3% in generating high-quality
images. Moreover, the proposed semi-supervised learning achieves comparable
medical image synthesis quality with supervised learning model, using only 50
of segmentation data.</span>

                                        <span>Image inpainting is one of the important tasks in computer vision which
focuses on the reconstruction of missing regions in an image. The aim of this
paper is to introduce an image inpainting model based on Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Imputation Network. The generator network of the model uses
building blocks of convolutional layers with different dilation rates, together
with skip connections that help the model reproduce fine details of the output.
This combination yields a universal imputation model that is able to handle
various scenarios of missingness with sufficient quality. To show this
experimentally, the model is simultaneously trained to deal with three
scenarios given by missing pixels at random, missing various smaller square
regions, and one missing square placed in the center of the image. It turns out
that our model achieves high-quality inpainting results on all scenarios.
Performance is evaluated using peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural
similarity index on two real-world benchmark datasets, CelebA faces and Paris
StreetView. The results of our model are compared to biharmonic imputation and
to some of the other state-of-the-art image inpainting methods.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning (ML) models trained on personal data have been shown to leak
information about users. Differential privacy (DP) enables model training with
a guaranteed bound on this leakage. Each new model trained with DP increases
the bound on data leakage and can be seen as consuming part of a global privacy
budget that should not be exceeded. This budget is a scarce resource that must
be carefully managed to maximize the number of successfully trained models.

We describe PrivateKube, an extension to the popular Kubernetes datacenter
orchestrator that adds privacy as a new type of resource to be managed
alongside other traditional compute resources, such as CPU, GPU, and memory.
The abstractions we design for the privacy resource mirror those defined by
Kubernetes for traditional resources, but there are also major differences. For
example, traditional compute resources are replenishable while privacy is not:
a CPU can be regained after a model finishes execution while privacy budget
cannot. This distinction forces a re-design of the scheduler. We present DPF
(Dominant Private Block Fairness) -- a variant of the popular Dominant Resource
Fairness (DRF) algorithm -- that is geared toward the non-replenishable privacy
resource but enjoys similar theoretical properties as DRF.

We evaluate PrivateKube and DPF on microbenchmarks and an ML workload on
Amazon Reviews data. Compared to existing baselines, DPF allows training more
models under the same global privacy guarantee. This is especially true for DPF
over R\&#x27;enyi DP, a highly composable form of DP.</span>

standard dot-product attention in transformers is a special case of Maximum A
Posteriori (MAP) inference. The proposed approach suggests the use of
Expectation Maximization algorithms for online adaptation of key and value
model parameters. This approach is useful for cases in which external agents,
e.g., annotators, provide inference-time information about the correct values
of some tokens, e.g, the semantic category of some pixels, and we need for this
new information to propagate to other tokens in a principled manner. We
illustrate the approach on an interactive semantic segmentation task in which
annotators and models collaborate online to improve annotation efficiency.
Using standard benchmarks, we observe that key adaptation boosts model
performance ($\sim10\%$ mIoU) in the low feedback regime and value propagation
improves model responsiveness in the high feedback regime. A PyTorch layer

                                        <span>Compressive phase retrieval is a popular variant of the standard compressive
sensing problem, in which the measurements only contain magnitude information.
In this paper, motivated by recent advances in deep generative models, we
provide recovery guarantees with order-optimal sample complexity bounds for
phase retrieval with generative priors. We first show that when using i.i.d.
Gaussian measurements and an $L$-Lipschitz continuous generative model with
bounded $k$-dimensional inputs, roughly $O(k \log L)$ samples suffice to
guarantee that the signal is close to any vector that minimizes an
amplitude-based empirical loss function. Attaining this sample complexity with
a practical algorithm remains a difficult challenge, and a popular spectral
initialization method has been observed to pose a major bottleneck. To
partially address this, we further show that roughly $O(k \log L)$ samples
ensure sufficient closeness between the signal and any {\em globally optimal}
solution to an optimization problem designed for spectral initialization
(though finding such a solution may still be challenging). We adapt this result
to sparse phase retrieval, and show that $O(s \log n)$ samples are sufficient
for a similar guarantee when the underlying signal is $s$-sparse and
$n$-dimensional, matching an information-theoretic lower bound. While our
guarantees do not directly correspond to a practical algorithm, we propose a
practical spectral initialization method motivated by our findings, and
experimentally observe significant performance gains over various existing
spectral initialization methods of sparse phase retrieval.</span>

reduction methods, kernel learning by Semidefinite Programming (SDP), Maximum
Variance Unfolding (MVU) or Semidefinite Embedding (SDE), and its variants. We
first explain how the spectral dimensionality reduction methods can be unified
as kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with different kernels. This
unification can be interpreted as eigenfunction learning or representation of
kernel in terms of distance matrix. Then, since the spectral methods are
unified as kernel PCA, we say let us learn the best kernel for unfolding the
manifold of data to its maximum variance. We first briefly introduce kernel
learning by SDP for the transduction task. Then, we explain MVU in detail.
Various versions of supervised MVU using nearest neighbors graph, by class-wise
unfolding, by Fisher criterion, and by colored MVU are explained. We also
explain out-of-sample extension of MVU using eigenfunctions and kernel mapping.
Finally, we introduce other variants of MVU including action respecting
embedding, relaxed MVU, and landmark MVU for big data.</span>

to meet the requirements of customers. One way how this research is conducted
is that a domain expert gathers and categorizes user-generated content into a
complex and fine-grained class structure. In many of such cases, little data
meets complex annotations. It is not yet fully understood how this can be
leveraged successfully for classification. We examine the classification
accuracy of expert labels when used with a) many fine-grained classes and b)
few abstract classes. For scenario b) we compare abstract class labels given by
the domain expert as baseline and by automatic hierarchical clustering. We
compare this to another baseline where the entire class structure is given by a
completely unsupervised clustering approach. By doing so, this work can serve
as an example of how complex expert annotations are potentially beneficial and
can be utilized in the most optimal way for opinion mining in highly specific
domains. By exploring across a range of techniques and experiments, we find
that automated class abstraction approaches in particular the unsupervised
approach performs remarkably well against domain expert baseline on text
classification tasks. This has the potential to inspire opinion mining
applications in order to support market researchers in practice and to inspire
fine-grained automated content analysis on a large scale.</span>

sensor data to perception algorithms to understand the environment. Sensor
fusion, and particularly semantic fusion, with multi-frame tracking is becoming
increasingly popular for detecting 3D objects. Recently, it was shown that
LiDAR-based perception built on deep neural networks is vulnerable to LiDAR
spoofing attacks. Thus, in this work, we perform the first analysis of
camera-LiDAR fusion under spoofing attacks and the first security analysis of
semantic fusion in any AV context. We find first that fusion is more successful
than existing defenses at guarding against naive spoofing. However, we then
define the frustum attack as a new class of attacks on AVs and find that
semantic camera-LiDAR fusion exhibits widespread vulnerability to frustum
attacks with between 70% and 90% success against target models. Importantly,
the attacker needs less than 20 random spoof points on average for successful
attacks - an order of magnitude less than established maximum capability.
Finally, we are the first to analyze the longitudinal impact of perception
attacks by showing the impact of multi-frame attacks.</span>

problem of fundamental importance. Prior work has focused on parametric
approaches that require a known parametric model, which makes estimation
procedures less robust to model mis-specification, non-linearities and
heterogeneities. In this paper, we develop a semi-parametric approach based on
the monotone single-index multi-variate autoregressive model (SIMAM) which
addresses these challenges. We provide theoretical guarantees for dependent
data and an alternating projected gradient descent algorithm. Significantly we
do not explicitly assume mixing conditions on the process (although we do
require conditions analogous to restricted strong convexity) and we achieve
rates of the form $O(T^{-\frac{1}{3}} \sqrt{s\log(TM)})$ (optimal in the
independent design case) where $s$ is the threshold for the maximum in-degree
of the network that indicates the sparsity level, $M$ is the number of actors
and $T$ is the number of time points. In addition, we demonstrate the superior
performance both on simulated data and two real data examples where our SIMAM
approach out-performs state-of-the-art parametric methods both in terms of
prediction and network estimation.</span>

solution vector (coefficients) of regression problems, particularly when there
are many predictors relative to the number of observations. Solving the lasso
in this high-dimensional setting can, however, be computationally demanding.
Fortunately, this demand can be alleviated via the use of screening rules that
discard predictors prior to fitting the model, leading to a reduced problem to
be solved. In this paper, we present a new screening strategy: look-ahead
screening. Our method uses safe screening rules to find a range of penalty
values for which a given predictor cannot enter the model, thereby screening
predictors along the remainder of the path. In experiments we show that these
look-ahead screening rules outperform the active warm-start version of the Gap
Safe rules.</span>

                                        <span>The generalization gap in reinforcement learning (RL) has been a significant
obstacle that prevents the RL agent from learning general skills and adapting
to varying environments. Increasing the generalization capacity of the RL
systems can significantly improve their performance on real-world working
environments. In this work, we propose a novel policy-aware adversarial data
augmentation method to augment the standard policy learning method with
automatically generated trajectory data. Different from the commonly used
observation transformation based data augmentations, our proposed method
adversarially generates new trajectory data based on the policy gradient
objective and aims to more effectively increase the RL agent&#x27;s generalization
ability with the policy-aware data augmentation. Moreover, we further deploy a
mixup step to integrate the original and generated data to enhance the
generalization capacity while mitigating the over-deviation of the adversarial
data. We conduct experiments on a number of RL tasks to investigate the
generalization performance of the proposed method by comparing it with the
standard baselines and the state-of-the-art mixreg approach. The results show
our method can generalize well with limited training diversity, and achieve the
state-of-the-art generalization test performance.</span>

intelligible and natural speech given text, is a hot research topic in speech,
language, and machine learning communities and has broad applications in the
industry. As the development of deep learning and artificial intelligence,
neural network-based TTS has significantly improved the quality of synthesized
speech in recent years. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on
neural TTS, aiming to provide a good understanding of current research and
future trends. We focus on the key components in neural TTS, including text
analysis, acoustic models and vocoders, and several advanced topics, including
fast TTS, low-resource TTS, robust TTS, expressive TTS, and adaptive TTS, etc.
We further summarize resources related to TTS (e.g., datasets, opensource
implementations) and discuss future research directions. This survey can serve
both academic researchers and industry practitioners working on TTS.</span>

challenge, we envision that the weight pruning technique will help DNNs against
MIA while reducing model storage and computational operation. In this work, we
propose a pruning algorithm, and we show that the proposed algorithm can find a

can improve human and computer use of medical images. A CNN-based classifier
was developed to identify body regions in CT and MRI. 17 CT (18 MRI) body
regions covering the entire human body were defined for the classification
task. Three retrospective databases were built for the AI model training,
validation, and testing, with a balanced distribution of studies per body
region. The test databases originated from a different healthcare network.
Accuracy, recall and precision of the classifier was evaluated for patient age,
patient gender, institution, scanner manufacturer, contrast, slice thickness,
MRI sequence, and CT kernel. The data included a retrospective cohort of 2,934
anonymized CT cases (training: 1,804 studies, validation: 602 studies, test:
528 studies) and 3,185 anonymized MRI cases (training: 1,911 studies,
validation: 636 studies, test: 638 studies). 27 institutions from primary care
hospitals, community hospitals and imaging centers contributed to the test
datasets. The data included cases of all genders in equal proportions and
subjects aged from a few months old to +90 years old. An image-level prediction
accuracy of 91.9% (90.2 - 92.1) for CT, and 94.2% (92.0 - 95.6) for MRI was
achieved. The classification results were robust across all body regions and
confounding factors. Due to limited data, performance results for subjects
under 10 years-old could not be reliably evaluated. We show that deep learning
models can classify CT and MRI images by body region including lower and upper
extremities with high accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning (ML) currently exerts an outsized influence on the world,
increasingly affecting communities and institutional practices. It is therefore
critical that we question vague conceptions of the field as value-neutral or
universally beneficial, and investigate what specific values the field is
advancing. In this paper, we present a rigorous examination of the values of
the field by quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing 100 highly cited ML
papers published at premier ML conferences, ICML and NeurIPS. We annotate key
features of papers which reveal their values: how they justify their choice of
project, which aspects they uplift, their consideration of potential negative
consequences, and their institutional affiliations and funding sources. We find
that societal needs are typically very loosely connected to the choice of
project, if mentioned at all, and that consideration of negative consequences
is extremely rare. We identify 67 values that are uplifted in machine learning
research, and, of these, we find that papers most frequently justify and assess
themselves based on performance, generalization, efficiency, researcher
understanding, novelty, and building on previous work. We present extensive
textual evidence and analysis of how these values are operationalized. Notably,
we find that each of these top values is currently being defined and applied
with assumptions and implications generally supporting the centralization of
power. Finally, we find increasingly close ties between these highly cited
papers and tech companies and elite universities.</span>

of papers have been studying active learning (AL) for deep models. However,
there are a number of issues in the prevalent experimental settings, mainly
stemming from a lack of unified implementation and benchmarking. Issues in the
current literature include sometimes contradictory observations on the
performance of different AL algorithms, unintended exclusion of important
generalization approaches such as data augmentation and SGD for optimization, a
lack of study of evaluation facets like the labeling efficiency of AL, and
little or no clarity on the scenarios in which AL outperforms random sampling
(RS). In this work, we present a unified re-implementation of state-of-the-art
AL algorithms in the context of image classification, and we carefully study
these issues as facets of effective evaluation. On the positive side, we show
that AL techniques are 2x to 4x more label-efficient compared to RS with the
use of data augmentation. Surprisingly, when data augmentation is included,
there is no longer a consistent gain in using BADGE, a state-of-the-art
approach, over simple uncertainty sampling. We then do a careful analysis of
how existing approaches perform with varying amounts of redundancy and number
of examples per class. Finally, we provide several insights for AL
practitioners to consider in future work, such as the effect of the AL batch
size, the effect of initialization, the importance of retraining a new model at
every round, and other insights.</span>

framework for mobile systems to limit privacy leakages in federated learning.
Leveraging the widespread presence of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in
high-end and mobile devices, we utilize TEEs on clients for local training, and
on servers for secure aggregation, so that model/gradient updates are hidden
from adversaries. Challenged by the limited memory size of current TEEs, we
leverage greedy layer-wise training to train each model&#x27;s layer inside the
trusted area until its convergence. The performance evaluation of our
implementation shows that $PPFL$ can significantly improve privacy while
incurring small system overheads at the client-side. In particular, $PPFL$ can
successfully defend the trained model against data reconstruction, property
inference, and membership inference attacks. Furthermore, it can achieve
comparable model utility with fewer communication rounds (0.54$\times$) and a
similar amount of network traffic (1.002$\times$) compared to the standard
federated learning of a complete model. This is achieved while only introducing
up to ~15% CPU time, ~18% memory usage, and ~21% energy consumption overhead in
$PPFL$&#x27;s client-side.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a novel algorithm named Expert Q-learning. Expert Q-learning was
inspired by Dueling Q-learning and aimed at incorporating the ideas from
semi-supervised learning into reinforcement learning through splitting Q-values
into state values and action advantages. Different from Generative Adversarial
Imitation Learning and Deep Q-Learning from Demonstrations, the offline expert
we have used only predicts the value of a state from {-1, 0, 1}, indicating
whether this is a bad, neutral or good state. An expert network was designed in
addition to the Q-network, which updates each time following the regular
offline minibatch update whenever the expert example buffer is not empty. The
Q-network plays the role of the advantage function only during the update. Our
algorithm also keeps asynchronous copies of the Q-network and expert network,
predicting the target values using the same manner as of Double Q-learning.

We compared on the game of Othello our algorithm with the state-of-the-art
Q-learning algorithm, which was a combination of Double Q-learning and Dueling
Q-learning. The results showed that Expert Q-learning was indeed useful and
more resistant to the overestimation bias of Q-learning. The baseline
Q-learning algorithm exhibited unstable and suboptimal behavior, especially
when playing against a stochastic player, whereas Expert Q-learning
demonstrated more robust performance with higher scores. Expert Q-learning
without using examples has also gained better results than the baseline
algorithm when trained and tested against a fixed player. On the other hand,
Expert Q-learning without examples cannot win against the baseline Q-learning
algorithm in direct game competitions despite the fact that it has also shown
the strength of reducing the overestimation bias.</span>

authentication, to add security to their apps. However, the ethical
implications of this type of architecture has not been studied previously. In
this paper, we present a large-scale measurement study of running an existing
anti-fraud security challenge, Boxer, in real apps running on mobile devices.
We find that although Boxer does work well overall, it is unable to scan
effectively on devices that run its machine learning models at less than one
frame per second (FPS), blocking users who use inexpensive devices. With the
insights from our study, we design Daredevil, anew anti-fraud system for
scanning payment cards that work swell across the broad range of performance
characteristics and hardware configurations found on modern mobile devices.
Daredevil reduces the number of devices that run at less than one FPS by an
order of magnitude compared to Boxer, providing a more equitable system for
fighting fraud. In total, we collect data from 5,085,444 real devices spread
across 496 real apps running production software and interacting with real
users.</span>

                                        <span>Min-max saddle point games have recently been intensely studied, due to their
wide range of applications, including training Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs). However, most of the recent efforts for solving them are limited to
special regimes such as convex-concave games. Further, it is customarily
assumed that the underlying optimization problem is solved either by a single
machine or in the case of multiple machines connected in centralized fashion,
wherein each one communicates with a central node. The latter approach becomes
challenging, when the underlying communications network has low bandwidth. In
addition, privacy considerations may dictate that certain nodes can communicate
with a subset of other nodes. Hence, it is of interest to develop methods that
solve min-max games in a decentralized manner. To that end, we develop a
decentralized adaptive momentum (ADAM)-type algorithm for solving min-max
optimization problem under the condition that the objective function satisfies
a Minty Variational Inequality condition, which is a generalization to
convex-concave case. The proposed method overcomes shortcomings of recent
non-adaptive gradient-based decentralized algorithms for min-max optimization
problems that do not perform well in practice and require careful tuning. In
this paper, we obtain non-asymptotic rates of convergence of the proposed
algorithm (coined DADAM$^3$) for finding a (stochastic) first-order Nash
equilibrium point and subsequently evaluate its performance on training GANs.
The extensive empirical evaluation shows that DADAM$^3$ outperforms recently
developed methods, including decentralized optimistic stochastic gradient for
solving such min-max problems.</span>

                                        <span>Image-to-image translation plays a vital role in tackling various medical
imaging tasks such as attenuation correction, motion correction, undersampled
reconstruction, and denoising. Generative adversarial networks have been shown
to achieve the state-of-the-art in generating high fidelity images for these
tasks. However, the state-of-the-art GAN-based frameworks do not estimate the
uncertainty in the predictions made by the network that is essential for making
informed medical decisions and subsequent revision by medical experts and has
recently been shown to improve the performance and interpretability of the
model. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-guided progressive learning
scheme for image-to-image translation. By incorporating aleatoric uncertainty
as attention maps for GANs trained in a progressive manner, we generate images
of increasing fidelity progressively. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model
on three challenging medical image translation tasks, including PET to CT
translation, undersampled MRI reconstruction, and MRI motion artefact
correction. Our model generalizes well in three different tasks and improves
performance over state of the art under full-supervision and weak-supervision
with limited data. Code is released here:

                                        <span>Contrastive learning (CL) is effective in learning data representations
without label supervision, where the encoder needs to contrast each positive
sample over multiple negative samples via a one-vs-many softmax cross-entropy
loss. However, conventional CL is sensitive to how many negative samples are
included and how they are selected. Proposed in this paper is a doubly CL
strategy that contrasts positive samples and negative ones within themselves
separately. We realize this strategy with contrastive attraction and
contrastive repulsion (CACR) makes the query not only exert a greater force to
attract more distant positive samples but also do so to repel closer negative
samples. Theoretical analysis reveals the connection between CACR and CL from
the perspectives of both positive attraction and negative repulsion and shows
the benefits in both efficiency and robustness brought by separately
contrasting within the sampled positive and negative pairs. Extensive
large-scale experiments on standard vision tasks show that CACR not only
consistently outperforms existing CL methods on benchmark datasets in
representation learning, but also provides interpretable contrastive weights,
demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed doubly contrastive strategy.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks have been highly successful in image-based
learning tasks due to their translation equivariance property. Recent work has
generalized the traditional convolutional layer of a convolutional neural
network to non-Euclidean spaces and shown group equivariance of the generalized
convolution operation. In this paper, we present a novel higher order Volterra
convolutional neural network (VolterraNet) for data defined as samples of
functions on Riemannian homogeneous spaces. Analagous to the result for
traditional convolutions, we prove that the Volterra functional convolutions
are equivariant to the action of the isometry group admitted by the Riemannian
homogeneous spaces, and under some restrictions, any non-linear equivariant
function can be expressed as our homogeneous space Volterra convolution,
generalizing the non-linear shift equivariant characterization of Volterra
expansions in Euclidean space. We also prove that second order functional
convolution operations can be represented as cascaded convolutions which leads
to an efficient implementation. Beyond this, we also propose a dilated
VolterraNet model. These advances lead to large parameter reductions relative
to baseline non-Euclidean CNNs. To demonstrate the efficacy of the VolterraNet
performance, we present several real data experiments involving classification
tasks on spherical-MNIST, atomic energy, Shrec17 data sets, and group testing
on diffusion MRI data. Performance comparisons to the state-of-the-art are also
presented.</span>

to study, track, monitor, and analyze human behavior during activities of daily
living (ADLs). The framework consists of two novel functionalities. First, it
can perform the semantic analysis of user interactions on the diverse
contextual parameters during ADLs to identify a list of distinct behavioral
patterns associated with different complex activities. Second, it consists of
an intelligent decision-making algorithm that can analyze these behavioral
patterns and their relationships with the dynamic contextual and spatial
features of the environment to detect any anomalies in user behavior that could
constitute an emergency. These functionalities of this interdisciplinary
framework were developed by integrating the latest advancements and
technologies in human-computer interaction, machine learning, Internet of

evaluated on a dataset of ADLs, and the performance accuracies of these two
functionalities were found to be 76.71% and 83.87%, respectively. The presented

to learn a good initialization for model parameters that can help solve unseen
&quot;test tasks&quot; with very few samples by fine-tuning from this initialization.
Although successful in practice, theoretical understanding of such methods is
limited. This work studies an important aspect of these methods: splitting the
data from each task into train (support) and validation (query) sets during
meta-training. Inspired by recent work (Raghu et al., 2020), we view such
meta-learning methods through the lens of representation learning and argue
that the train-validation split encourages the learned representation to be
low-rank without compromising on expressivity, as opposed to the non-splitting
variant that encourages high-rank representations. Since sample efficiency
benefits from low-rankness, the splitting strategy will require very few
samples to solve unseen test tasks. We present theoretical results that
formalize this idea for linear representation learning on a subspace
meta-learning instance, and experimentally verify this practical benefit of
splitting in simulations and on standard meta-learning benchmarks.</span>

access and expand their utility, since more than 6 million are publicly
available, and they constitute an important corpus to aid research and
education across disciplines. The corpus is growing as new born-digital
documents are included, and since millions of older theses and dissertations
have been converted to digital form to be disseminated electronically in
institutional repositories. In ETDs, as with other scholarly works, figures and
tables can communicate a large amount of information in a concise way. Although
methods have been proposed for extracting figures and tables from born-digital
PDFs, they do not work well with scanned ETDs. Considering this problem, our
assessment of state-of-the-art figure extraction systems is that the reason
they do not function well on scanned PDFs is that they have only been trained
on born-digital documents. To address this limitation, we present ScanBank, a
new dataset containing 10 thousand scanned page images, manually labeled by
humans as to the presence of the 3.3 thousand figures or tables found therein.
We use this dataset to train a deep neural network model based on YOLOv5 to
accurately extract figures and tables from scanned ETDs. We pose and answer
important research questions aimed at finding better methods for figure
extraction from scanned documents. One of those concerns the value for
training, of data augmentation techniques applied to born-digital documents
which are used to train models better suited for figure extraction from scanned
documents. To the best of our knowledge, ScanBank is the first manually
annotated dataset for figure and table extraction for scanned ETDs. A
YOLOv5-based model, trained on ScanBank, outperforms existing comparable
open-source and freely available baseline methods by a considerable margin.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the problem of predicting the future path of a pedestrian using
its motion history and the motion history of the surrounding pedestrians,
called social information. Since the seminal paper on Social-LSTM,
deep-learning has become the main tool used to model the impact of social
interactions on a pedestrian&#x27;s motion. The demonstration that these models can
learn social interactions relies on an ablative study of these models. The
models are compared with and without their social interactions module on two
standard metrics, the Average Displacement Error and Final Displacement Error.
Yet, these complex models were recently outperformed by a simple
constant-velocity approach. This questions if they actually allow to model
social interactions as well as the validity of the proof. In this paper, we
focus on the deep-learning models with a soft-attention mechanism for social
interaction modeling and study whether they use social information at
prediction time. We conduct two experiments across four state-of-the-art
approaches on the ETH and UCY datasets, which were also used in previous work.
First, the models are trained by replacing the social information with random
noise and compared to model trained with actual social information. Second, we
use a gating mechanism along with a $L_0$ penalty, allowing models to shut down
their inner components. The models consistently learn to prune their
soft-attention mechanism. For both experiments, neither the course of the
convergence nor the prediction performance were altered. This demonstrates that
the soft-attention mechanism and therefore the social information are ignored
by the models.</span>

                                        <span>Sound event localization and detection consists of two subtasks which are
sound event detection and direction-of-arrival estimation. While sound event
detection mainly relies on time-frequency patterns to distinguish different
sound classes, direction-of-arrival estimation uses magnitude or phase
differences between microphones to estimate source directions. Therefore, it is
often difficult to jointly train these two subtasks simultaneously. We propose
a novel feature called spatial cue-augmented log-spectrogram (SALSA) with exact
time-frequency mapping between the signal power and the source
direction-of-arrival. The feature includes multichannel log-spectrograms
stacked along with the estimated direct-to-reverberant ratio and a normalized
version of the principal eigenvector of the spatial covariance matrix at each
time-frequency bin on the spectrograms. Experimental results on the DCASE 2021
dataset for sound event localization and detection with directional
interference showed that the deep learning-based models trained on this new
feature outperformed the DCASE challenge baseline by a large margin. We
combined several models with slightly different architectures that were trained
on the new feature to further improve the system performances for the DCASE
sound event localization and detection challenge.</span>

                                        <span>In sparse coding, we attempt to extract features of input vectors, assuming
that the data is inherently structured as a sparse superposition of basic
building blocks. Similarly, neural networks perform a given task by learning
features of the training data set. Recently both data-driven and model-driven
feature extracting methods have become extremely popular and have achieved
remarkable results. Nevertheless, practical implementations are often too slow
to be employed in real-life scenarios, especially for real-time applications.
We propose a speed-up upgraded version of the classic iterative thresholding
algorithm, that produces a good approximation of the convolutional sparse code
within 2-5 iterations. The speed advantage is gained mostly from the
observation that most solvers are slowed down by inefficient global
thresholding. The main idea is to normalize each data point by the local
receptive field energy, before applying a threshold. This way, the natural
inclination towards strong feature expressions is suppressed, so that one can
rely on a global threshold that can be easily approximated, or learned during
training. The proposed algorithm can be employed with a known predetermined
dictionary, or with a trained dictionary. The trained version is implemented as
a neural net designed as the unfolding of the proposed solver. The performance
of the proposed solution is demonstrated via the seismic inversion problem in
both synthetic and real data scenarios. We also provide theoretical guarantees
for a stable support recovery. Namely, we prove that under certain conditions
the true support is perfectly recovered within the first iteration.</span>

shootings reported by media, more people in the U.S. think that police use
excessive force during law enforcement, especially to a specific group of
people. We want to apply multidimensional statistical analysis to reveal more
facts than the monotone mainstream media. Our paper has three parts. First, we
proposed a new method to quantify fatal police shooting news reporting
deviation of mainstream media, which includes CNN, FOX, ABC, and NBC. Second,
we analyzed the most comprehensive US fatal police shooting dataset from
Washington Post. We used FP-growth to reveal the frequent patterns and DBSCAN
clustering to find fatal shooting hotspots. We brought multi-attributes (social
economics, demographics, political tendency, education, gun ownership rate,
police training hours, etc.) to reveal connections under the iceberg. We found
that the police shooting rate of a state depends on many variables. The top
four most relevant attributes were state joined year, state land area, gun
ownership rate, and violent crime rate. Third, we proposed four regression
models to predict police shooting rates at the state level. The best model
Kstar could predict the fatal police shooting rate with about 88.53%
correlation coefficient. We also proposed classification models, including
Gradient Boosting Machine, Multi-class Classifier, Logistic Regression, and
Naive Bayes Classifier, to predict the race of fatal police shooting victims.
Our classification models show no significant evidence to conclude that racial
discrimination happened during fatal police shootings recorded by the WP
dataset.</span>

state databases containing information about which citizens are eligible to
vote. Administrators at the state and local level are faced with the
exceedingly difficult task of ensuring that each of their jurisdictions is
properly managed, while also monitoring for improper modifications to the
database. Monitoring changes to Voter Registration Files (VRFs) is crucial,
given that a malicious actor wishing to disrupt the democratic process in the
US would be well-advised to manipulate the contents of these files in order to
achieve their goals. In 2020, we saw election officials perform admirably when
faced with administering one of the most contentious elections in US history,
but much work remains to secure and monitor the election systems Americans rely
on. Using data created by comparing snapshots taken of VRFs over time, we
present a set of methods that make use of machine learning to ease the burden
on analysts and administrators in protecting voter rolls. We first evaluate the
effectiveness of multiple unsupervised anomaly detection methods in detecting
VRF modifications by modeling anomalous changes as sparse additive noise. In
this setting we determine that statistical models comparing administrative
districts within a short time span and non-negative matrix factorization are
most effective for surfacing anomalous events for review. These methods were
deployed during 2019-2020 in our organization&#x27;s monitoring system and were used
in collaboration with the office of the Iowa Secretary of State. Additionally,
we propose a newly deployed model which uses historical and demographic
metadata to label the likely root cause of database modifications. We hope to
use this model to predict which modifications have known causes and therefore
better identify potentially anomalous modifications.</span>

architectures applied to the problem of enhancing camera-captured document
images. The results from each network were evaluated both qualitatively and
quantitatively using Image Quality Assessment (IQA) metrics, and also compared
with an existing approach based on traditional computer vision techniques. The
best performing architectures generally produced good enhancement compared to
the existing algorithm, showing that it is possible to use DNNs for document
image enhancement. Furthermore, the best performing architectures could work as
a baseline for future investigations on document enhancement using deep
learning techniques. The main contributions of this paper are: a baseline of
deep learning techniques that can be further improved to provide better
results, and a evaluation methodology using IQA metrics for quantitatively
comparing the produced images from the neural networks to a ground truth.</span>

photovoltaic systems is a time-consuming process that requires on-site
measurements, a difficult task to achieve on a large scale. In this paper, we
present an approach to estimate the solar potential of rooftops based on their
location and architectural characteristics, as well as the amount of solar
radiation they receive annually. Our technique uses computer vision to achieve
semantic segmentation of roof sections and roof objects on the one hand, and a
machine learning model based on structured building features to predict roof
pitch on the other hand. We then compute the azimuth and maximum number of
solar panels that can be installed on a rooftop with geometric approaches.
Finally, we compute precise shading masks and combine them with solar
irradiation data that enables us to estimate the yearly solar potential of a
rooftop.</span>

                                        <span>Visual recognition tasks are often limited to dealing with a small subset of
classes simply because the labels for the remaining classes are unavailable. We
are interested in identifying novel concepts in a dataset through
representation learning based on the examples in both labeled and unlabeled
classes, and extending the horizon of recognition to both known and novel
classes. To address this challenging task, we propose a combinatorial learning
approach, which naturally clusters the examples in unseen classes using the
compositional knowledge given by multiple supervised meta-classifiers on
heterogeneous label spaces. We also introduce a metric learning strategy to
estimate pairwise pseudo-labels for improving representations of unlabeled
examples, which preserves semantic relations across known and novel classes
effectively. The proposed algorithm discovers novel concepts via a joint
optimization of enhancing the discrimitiveness of unseen classes as well as
learning the representations of known classes generalizable to novel ones. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable performance gains by the proposed
approach in multiple image retrieval and novel class discovery benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Recent work on graph generative models has made remarkable progress towards
generating increasingly realistic graphs, as measured by global graph features
such as degree distribution, density, and clustering coefficients. Deep
generative models have also made significant advances through better modelling
of the local correlations in the graph topology, which have been very useful
for predicting unobserved graph components, such as the existence of a link or
the class of a node, from nearby observed graph components. A complete
scientific understanding of graph data should address both global and local
structure. In this paper, we propose a joint model for both as complementary
objectives in a graph VAE framework. Global structure is captured by
incorporating graph kernels in a probabilistic model whose loss function is
closely related to the maximum mean discrepancy(MMD) between the global
structures of the reconstructed and the input graphs. The ELBO objective
derived from the model regularizes a standard local link reconstruction term
with an MMD term. Our experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in the
realism of the generated graph structures, typically by 1-2 orders of magnitude
of graph structure metrics, compared to leading graph VAEand GAN models. Local
link reconstruction improves as well in many cases.</span>

                                        <span>The last-generation video conferencing software allows users to utilize a
virtual background to conceal their personal environment due to privacy
concerns, especially in official meetings with other employers. On the other
hand, users maybe want to fool people in the meeting by considering the virtual
background to conceal where they are. In this case, developing tools to
understand the virtual background utilize for fooling people in meeting plays
an important role. Besides, such detectors must prove robust against different
kinds of attacks since a malicious user can fool the detector by applying a set
of adversarial editing steps on the video to conceal any revealing footprint.
In this paper, we study the feasibility of an efficient tool to detect whether
a videoconferencing user background is real. In particular, we provide the
first tool which computes pixel co-occurrences matrices and uses them to search
for inconsistencies among spectral and spatial bands. Our experiments confirm
that cross co-occurrences matrices improve the robustness of the detector
against different kinds of attacks. This work&#x27;s performance is especially
noteworthy with regard to color SPAM features. Moreover, the performance
especially is significant with regard to robustness versus post-processing,
like geometric transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, and JPEG
compression with different quality factors.</span>

solving new tasks, which suggests the need for learning algorithms that can
modify the mechanisms for choosing certain actions independently of those for
choosing others. However, there is currently no formalism nor theory for how to
achieve this kind of modular credit assignment. To answer this question, we
define modular credit assignment as a constraint on minimizing the algorithmic
mutual information among feedback signals for different decisions. We introduce
what we call the modularity criterion for testing whether a learning algorithm
satisfies this constraint by performing causal analysis on the algorithm
itself. We generalize the recently proposed societal decision-making framework
as a more granular formalism than the Markov decision process to prove that for
decision sequences that do not contain cycles, certain single-step temporal
difference action-value methods meet this criterion while all policy-gradient
methods do not. Empirical evidence suggests that such action-value methods are
more sample efficient than policy-gradient methods on transfer problems that
require only sparse changes to a sequence of previously optimal decisions.</span>

population dynamics is essential in conservation efforts; however, tracking
elephants is a difficult task, usually relying on the invasive and sometimes
dangerous placement of GPS collars. Although there have been many recent

                                        <span>Knowledge graph embedding research has mainly focused on the two smallest
normed division algebras, $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. Recent results suggest
that trilinear products of quaternion-valued embeddings can be a more effective
means to tackle link prediction. In addition, models based on convolutions on
real-valued embeddings often yield state-of-the-art results for link
prediction. In this paper, we investigate a composition of convolution
operations with hypercomplex multiplications. We propose the four approaches
QMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO to tackle the link prediction problem. QMult and
OMult can be considered as quaternion and octonion extensions of previous
state-of-the-art approaches, including DistMult and ComplEx. ConvQ and ConvO
build upon QMult and OMult by including convolution operations in a way
inspired by the residual learning framework. We evaluated our approaches on
seven link prediction datasets including WN18RR, FB15K-237 and YAGO3-10.
Experimental results suggest that the benefits of learning hypercomplex-valued
vector representations become more apparent as the size and complexity of the
knowledge graph grows. ConvO outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
FB15K-237 in MRR, Hit@1 and Hit@3, while QMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO
outperform state-of-the-approaches on YAGO3-10 in all metrics. Results also
suggest that link prediction performances can be further improved via
prediction averaging. To foster reproducible research, we provide an
open-source implementation of approaches, including training and evaluation
scripts as well as pretrained models.</span>

                                        <span>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been shown to be susceptible to memorization
or overfitting in the presence of noisily labelled data. For the problem of
robust learning under such noisy data, several algorithms have been proposed. A
prominent class of algorithms rely on sample selection strategies, motivated by
curriculum learning. For example, many algorithms use the &#x60;small loss trick&#x27;
wherein a fraction of samples with loss values below a certain threshold are
selected for training. These algorithms are sensitive to such thresholds, and
it is difficult to fix or learn these thresholds. Often, these algorithms also
require information such as label noise rates which are typically unavailable
in practice. In this paper, we propose a data-dependent, adaptive sample
selection strategy that relies only on batch statistics of a given mini-batch
to provide robustness against label noise. The algorithm does not have any
additional hyperparameters for sample selection, does not need any information
on noise rates, and does not need access to separate data with clean labels. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on benchmark
datasets.</span>

proposed by \citet{garber2020online}, where the loss functions may be chosen by
an adversary, but are then presented to the online algorithm in a uniformly
random order. Focusing on the scenario where the cumulative loss function is
(strongly) convex, yet individual loss functions are smooth but might be
non-convex, we give algorithms that achieve the optimal bounds and
significantly outperform the results of \citet{garber2020online}, completely
removing the dimension dependence and improving their scaling with respect to
the strong convexity parameter. Our analysis relies on novel connections
between algorithmic stability and generalization for sampling
without-replacement analogous to those studied in the with-replacement
i.i.d.~setting, as well as on a refined average stability analysis of

factorization (NMF) with the $\beta$-divergence objective function. Our new
updates are derived from a joint majorization-minimization (MM) scheme, in
which an auxiliary function (a tight upper bound of the objective function) is
built for the two factors jointly and minimized at each iteration. This is in
contrast with the classic approach in which the factors are optimized
alternately and a MM scheme is applied to each factor individually. Like the
classic approach, our joint MM algorithm also results in multiplicative updates
that are simple to implement. They however yield a significant drop of
computation time (for equally good solutions), in particular for some
$\beta$-divergences of important applicative interest, such as the squared
Euclidean distance and the Kullback-Leibler or Itakura-Saito divergences. We
report experimental results using diverse datasets: face images, audio
spectrograms, hyperspectral data and song play counts. Depending on the value
of $\beta$ and on the dataset, our joint MM approach yields a CPU time
reduction of about $10\%$ to $78\%$ in comparison to the classic alternating
scheme.</span>

presents significant opportunities for improving the resulting embeddings, and
consequently for increased performance in downstream applications. Yet, little
research effort has focussed on this area and much of the carried out research
reports only marginally improved results compared to models trained without
temporal scopes (static models). Furthermore, rather than leveraging existing
work on static models, they introduce new models specific to temporal knowledge
graphs. We propose a novel perspective that takes advantage of the power of
existing static embedding models by focussing effort on manipulating the data
instead. Our method, SpliMe, draws inspiration from the field of signal
processing and early work in graph embedding. We show that SpliMe competes with
or outperforms the current state of the art in temporal KGE. Additionally, we
uncover issues with the procedure currently used to assess the performance of
static models on temporal graphs and introduce two ways to counteract them.</span>

strides in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference tasks, such as object
and speech recognition. Nevertheless, deploying such AI models across commodity
devices faces significant challenges: large computational cost, multiple
performance objectives, hardware heterogeneity and a common need for high
accuracy, together pose critical problems to the deployment of DNNs across the
various embedded and mobile devices in the wild. As such, we have yet to
witness the mainstream usage of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms
across consumer devices. In this paper, we provide preliminary answers to this
potentially game-changing question by presenting an array of design techniques
for efficient AI systems. We start by examining the major roadblocks when
targeting both programmable processors and custom accelerators. Then, we
present diverse methods for achieving real-time performance following a
cross-stack approach. These span model-, system- and hardware-level techniques,
and their combination. Our findings provide illustrative examples of AI systems
that do not overburden mobile hardware, while also indicating how they can
improve inference accuracy. Moreover, we showcase how custom ASIC- and
FPGA-based accelerators can be an enabling factor for next-generation AI
applications, such as multi-DNN systems. Collectively, these results highlight
the critical need for further exploration as to how the various cross-stack

not easy, and thus a lot of researches have been done to handle data with noisy
labels. Most recent state-of-art solutions for noisy label problems are built
on the small-loss strategy which exploits the memorization effect. While it is
a powerful tool, the memorization effect has several drawbacks. The
performances are sensitive to the choice of a training epoch required for
utilizing the memorization effect. In addition, when the labels are heavily
contaminated or imbalanced, the memorization effect may not occur in which case
the methods based on the small-loss strategy fail to identify clean labeled
data. We introduce a new method called INN(Integration with the Nearest
Neighborhoods) to refine clean labeled data from training data with noisy
labels. The proposed method is based on a new discovery that a prediction
pattern at neighbor regions of clean labeled data is consistently different
from that of noisy labeled data regardless of training epochs. The INN method
requires more computation but is much stable and powerful than the small-loss
strategy. By carrying out various experiments, we demonstrate that the INN
method resolves the shortcomings in the memorization effect successfully and
thus is helpful to construct more accurate deep prediction models with training
data with noisy labels.</span>

We model each agent&#x27;s state over time as a two-state Markov chain that
indicates Byzantine or trustworthy behaviors at different time instants. We set
no restrictions on the maximum number of Byzantine agents at any given time. We
design our method based on three layers of defense: 1) Temporal gradient
averaging, 2) robust aggregation, and 3) gradient normalization. We study two

important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. However, the
experimental determination of miRNA sequence and structure is both expensive
and time-consuming. Therefore, computational and machine learning-based
approaches have been adopted to predict novel microRNAs. With the involvement
of data science and machine learning in biology, multiple research studies have
been conducted to find microRNAs with different computational methods and
different miRNA features. Multiple approaches are discussed in detail
considering the learning algorithm/s used, features considered, dataset/s used
and the criteria used in evaluations. This systematic review focuses on the
machine learning methods developed for miRNA identification in plants. This
will help researchers to gain a detailed idea about past studies and identify
novel paths that solve drawbacks occurred in past studies. Our findings
highlight the need for plant-specific computational methods for miRNA
identification.</span>

                                        <span>Attention Mechanism is a widely used method for improving the performance of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on computer vision tasks. Despite its
pervasiveness, we have a poor understanding of what its effectiveness stems
from. It is popularly believed that its effectiveness stems from the visual
attention explanation, advocating focusing on the important part of input data
rather than ingesting the entire input. In this paper, we find that there is
only a weak consistency between the attention weights of features and their
importance. Instead, we verify the crucial role of feature map multiplication
in attention mechanism and uncover a fundamental impact of feature map
multiplication on the learned landscapes of CNNs: with the high order
non-linearity brought by the feature map multiplication, it played a
regularization role on CNNs, which made them learn smoother and more stable
landscapes near real samples compared to vanilla CNNs. This smoothness and
stability induce a more predictive and stable behavior in-between real samples,
and make CNNs generate better. Moreover, motivated by the proposed
effectiveness of feature map multiplication, we design feature map
multiplication network (FMMNet) by simply replacing the feature map addition in
ResNet with feature map multiplication. FMMNet outperforms ResNet on various
datasets, and this indicates that feature map multiplication plays a vital role
in improving the performance even without finely designed attention mechanism
in existing methods.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic image colourisation is the computer vision research path that
studies how to colourise greyscale images (for restoration). Deep learning
techniques improved image colourisation yielding astonishing results. These
differ by various factors, such as structural differences, input types, user
assistance, etc. Most of them, base the architectural structure on
convolutional layers with no emphasis on layers specialised in object features
extraction. We introduce a novel downsampling upsampling architecture named
TUCaN (Tiny UCapsNet) that exploits the collaboration of convolutional layers
and capsule layers to obtain a neat colourisation of entities present in every
single image. This is obtained by enforcing collaboration among such layers by
skip and residual connections. We pose the problem as a per pixel colour
classification task that identifies colours as a bin in a quantized space. To
train the network, in contrast with the standard end to end learning method, we
propose the progressive learning scheme to extract the context of objects by
only manipulating the learning process without changing the model. In this
scheme, the upsampling starts from the reconstruction of low resolution images
and progressively grows to high resolution images throughout the training
phase. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our approach
with ImageNet10k dataset outperforms existing methods on standard quality
metrics and achieves state of the art performances on image colourisation. We
performed a user study to quantify the perceptual realism of the colourisation
results demonstrating: that progressive learning let the TUCaN achieve better
colours than the end to end scheme; and pointing out the limitations of the
existing evaluation metrics.</span>

                                        <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled
source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous methods focus on learning
domain-invariant features to decrease the discrepancy between the feature
distributions as well as minimizing the source error and have made remarkable
progress. However, a recently proposed theory reveals that such a strategy is
not sufficient for a successful domain adaptation. It shows that besides a
small source error, both the discrepancy between the feature distributions and
the discrepancy between the labeling functions should be small across domains.
The discrepancy between the labeling functions is essentially the cross-domain
errors which are ignored by existing methods. To overcome this issue, in this
paper, a novel method is proposed to integrate all the objectives into a
unified optimization framework. Moreover, the incorrect pseudo labels widely
used in previous methods can lead to error accumulation during learning. To
alleviate this problem, the pseudo labels are obtained by utilizing structural
information of the target domain besides source classifier and we propose a
curriculum learning based strategy to select the target samples with more
accurate pseudo-labels during training. Comprehensive experiments are
conducted, and the results validate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images. The purpose is to improve
traditional regression models based on SAR intensity, trained with a limited
amount of AGB in situ measurements. Although it is costly to collect, data from
airborne laser scanning (ALS) sensors are highly correlated with AGB.
Therefore, we propose using AGB predictions based on ALS data as surrogate
response variables for SAR data in a sequential modelling fashion. This
increases the amount of training data dramatically. To model the regression
function between SAR intensity and ALS-predicted AGB we propose to utilise a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), i.e. the Pix2Pix
convolutional neural network. This enables the recreation of existing ALS-based
AGB prediction maps. The generated synthesised ALS-based AGB predictions are
evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively against ALS-based AGB predictions
retrieved from a traditional non-sequential regression model trained in the
same area. Results show that the proposed architecture manages to capture
characteristics of the actual data. This suggests that the use of ALS-guided
generative models is a promising avenue for AGB prediction from SAR intensity.
Further research on this area has the potential of providing both large-scale
and low-cost predictions of AGB.</span>

fundamental demand for next generation indoor and outdoor location-based
services. To bring about such ambition, a suite of collaborative sensing
modalities is required in order to sustain performance irrespective of
challenging dynamic conditions. Of the many modalities on offer, inertial
tracking plays a key role under momentary unfavourable operational conditions
owing to its independence of the surrounding environment. However, inertial
tracking has traditionally (i) suffered from excessive error growth and (ii)
required extensive and cumbersome tuning. Both of these issues have limited the
appeal and utility of inertial tracking. In this paper, we present DIT: a novel
Deep learning Inertial Tracking system that overcomes prior limitations;
namely, by (i) significantly reducing tracking drift and (ii) seamlessly
constructing robust and generalisable learned models. DIT describes two core
contributions: (i) DIT employs a robotic platform augmented with a mechanical
slider subsystem that automatically samples inertial signal variabilities
arising from different sensor mounting geometries. We use the platform to
curate in-house a 7.2 million sample dataset covering an aggregate distance of
21 kilometres split into 11 indexed sensor mounting geometries. (ii) DIT uses
deep learning, optimal transport, and domain adaptation (DA) to create a model
which is robust to variabilities in sensor mounting geometry. The overall
system synthesises high-performance and generalisable inertial navigation
models in an end-to-end, robotic-learning fashion. In our evaluation, DIT
outperforms an industrial-grade sensor fusion baseline by 10x (90th percentile)
and a state-of-the-art adversarial DA technique by &gt; 2.5x in performance (90th

                                        <span>Deep neural networks often exhibit poor performance on data that is unlikely
under the train-time data distribution, for instance data affected by
corruptions. Previous works demonstrate that test-time adaptation to data
shift, for instance using entropy minimization, effectively improves
performance on such shifted distributions. This paper focuses on the fully
test-time adaptation setting, where only unlabeled data from the target
distribution is required. This allows adapting arbitrary pretrained networks.
Specifically, we propose a novel loss that improves test-time adaptation by
addressing both premature convergence and instability of entropy minimization.
This is achieved by replacing the entropy by a non-saturating surrogate and
adding a diversity regularizer based on batch-wise entropy maximization that
prevents convergence to trivial collapsed solutions. Moreover, we propose to
prepend an input transformation module to the network that can partially undo
test-time distribution shifts. Surprisingly, this preprocessing can be learned
solely using the fully test-time adaptation loss in an end-to-end fashion
without any target domain labels or source domain data. We show that our
approach outperforms previous work in improving the robustness of publicly
available pretrained image classifiers to common corruptions on such
challenging benchmarks as ImageNet-C.</span>

                                        <span>Federated Learning (FL) is a promising framework that has great potentials in
privacy preservation and in lowering the computation load at the cloud. FedAvg
and FedProx are two widely adopted algorithms. However, recent work raised
concerns on these two methods: (1) their fixed points do not correspond to the
stationary points of the original optimization problem, and (2) the common
model found might not generalize well locally.

In this paper, we alleviate these concerns. Towards this, we adopt the
statistical learning perspective yet allow the distributions to be
heterogeneous and the local data to be unbalanced. We show, in the general
kernel regression setting, that both FedAvg and FedProx converge to the
minimax-optimal error rates. Moreover, when the kernel function has a finite
rank, the convergence is exponentially fast. Our results further analytically
quantify the impact of the model heterogeneity and characterize the federation
gain - the reduction of the estimation error for a worker to join the federated
learning compared to the best local estimator. To the best of our knowledge, we
are the first to show the achievability of minimax error rates under FedAvg and
FedProx, and the first to characterize the gains in joining FL. Numerical
experiments further corroborate our theoretical findings on the statistical
optimality of FedAvg and FedProx and the federation gains.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in neural multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) models have
enabled the generation of reasonably good speech quality with a single model
and made it possible to synthesize the speech of a speaker with limited
training data. Fine-tuning to the target speaker data with the multi-speaker
model can achieve better quality, however, there still exists a gap compared to
the real speech sample and the model depends on the speaker. In this work, we
propose GANSpeech, which is a high-fidelity multi-speaker TTS model that adopts
the adversarial training method to a non-autoregressive multi-speaker TTS
model. In addition, we propose simple but efficient automatic scaling methods
for feature matching loss used in adversarial training. In the subjective
listening tests, GANSpeech significantly outperformed the baseline
multi-speaker FastSpeech and FastSpeech2 models, and showed a better MOS score
than the speaker-specific fine-tuned FastSpeech2.</span>

applications, such as smart homes and assisted living. In this paper, we target
a new healthcare application of human activity recognition, early mobility
recognition for Intensive Care Unit(ICU) patients. Early mobility is essential
for ICU patients who suffer from long-time immobilization. Our system includes
accelerometer-based data collection from ICU patients and an AI model to
recognize patients&#x27; early mobility. To improve the model accuracy and
stability, we identify features that are insensitive to sensor orientations and
propose a segment voting process that leverages a majority voting strategy to
recognize each segment&#x27;s activity. Our results show that our system improves
model accuracy from 77.78\% to 81.86\% and reduces the model instability
(standard deviation) from 16.69\% to 6.92\%, compared to the same AI model

severe consequences of falling. This is why rapid assistance is a critical
task. Ambient assisted living (AAL) uses recent technologies such as 5G
networks and the internet of medical things (IoMT) to address this research
area. Edge computing can reduce the cost of cloud communication, including high
latency and bandwidth use, by moving conventional healthcare services and
applications closer to end-users. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such
as deep learning (DL) have been used recently for automatic fall detection, as
well as supporting healthcare services. However, DL requires a vast amount of
data and substantial processing power to improve its performance for the IoMT
linked to the traditional edge computing environment. This research proposes an
effective fall detection framework based on DL algorithms and mobile edge
computing (MEC) within 5G wireless networks, the aim being to empower
IoMT-based healthcare applications. We also propose the use of a deep gated
recurrent unit (DGRU) neural network to improve the accuracy of existing
DL-based fall detection methods. DGRU has the advantage of dealing with
time-series IoMT data, and it can reduce the number of parameters and avoid the
vanishing gradient problem. The experimental results on two public datasets
show that the DGRU model of the proposed framework achieves higher accuracy
rates compared to the current related works on the same datasets.</span>

their limitation defined by Federal Communications Commission (FCC). To this

we introduce a Federated Learning (FL) based framework for the task of DSA,
where FL is a distributive machine learning framework that can reserve the

computer vision. Significant progress has recently been made in developing
neural scene representations and rendering techniques that synthesize
photorealistic images from arbitrary views. These representations, however, are
extremely slow to train and often also slow to render. Inspired by neural
variants of image-based rendering, we develop a new neural rendering approach
with the goal of quickly learning a high-quality representation which can also
be rendered in real-time. Our approach, MetaNLR++, accomplishes this by using a
unique combination of a neural shape representation and 2D CNN-based image
feature extraction, aggregation, and re-projection. To push representation
convergence times down to minutes, we leverage meta learning to learn neural
shape and image feature priors which accelerate training. The optimized shape
and image features can then be extracted using traditional graphics techniques
and rendered in real time. We show that MetaNLR++ achieves similar or better
novel view synthesis results in a fraction of the time that competing methods
require.</span>

convergence and generalization of gradient-based methods on nonconvex losses
with overparameterized models. Nevertheless, many aspects of optimization and
generalization and in particular the critical role of small random
initialization are not fully understood. In this paper, we take a step towards
demystifying this role by proving that small random initialization followed by
a few iterations of gradient descent behaves akin to popular spectral methods.
We also show that this implicit spectral bias from small random initialization,
which is provably more prominent for overparameterized models, also puts the
gradient descent iterations on a particular trajectory towards solutions that
are not only globally optimal but also generalize well. Concretely, we focus on
the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few measurements via a
natural nonconvex formulation. In this setting, we show that the trajectory of
the gradient descent iterations from small random initialization can be
approximately decomposed into three phases: (I) a spectral or alignment phase
where we show that that the iterates have an implicit spectral bias akin to
spectral initialization allowing us to show that at the end of this phase the
column space of the iterates and the underlying low-rank matrix are
sufficiently aligned, (II) a saddle avoidance/refinement phase where we show
that the trajectory of the gradient iterates moves away from certain degenerate
saddle points, and (III) a local refinement phase where we show that after
avoiding the saddles the iterates converge quickly to the underlying low-rank
matrix. Underlying our analysis are insights for the analysis of
overparameterized nonconvex optimization schemes that may have implications for
computational problems beyond low-rank reconstruction.</span>

                                        <span>Face recognition is greatly improved by deep convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). Recently, these face recognition models have been used for identity
authentication in security sensitive applications. However, deep CNNs are
vulnerable to adversarial patches, which are physically realizable and
stealthy, raising new security concerns on the real-world applications of these
models. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of face recognition models
using adversarial patches based on transferability, where the attacker has
limited accessibility to the target models. First, we extend the existing
transfer-based attack techniques to generate transferable adversarial patches.
However, we observe that the transferability is sensitive to initialization and
degrades when the perturbation magnitude is large, indicating the overfitting
to the substitute models. Second, we propose to regularize the adversarial
patches on the low dimensional data manifold. The manifold is represented by
generative models pre-trained on legitimate human face images. Using face-like
features as adversarial perturbations through optimization on the manifold, we
show that the gaps between the responses of substitute models and the target
models dramatically decrease, exhibiting a better transferability. Extensive
digital world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method in the black-box setting. We apply the proposed method in the
physical world as well.</span>

                                        <span>Quantifying entropy production (EP) is essential to understand stochastic
systems at mesoscopic scales, such as living organisms or biological
assemblies. However, without tracking the relevant variables, it is challenging
to figure out where and to what extent EP occurs from recorded time-series
image data from experiments. Here, applying a convolutional neural network
(CNN), a powerful tool for image processing, we develop an estimation method
for EP through an unsupervised learning algorithm that calculates only from
movies. Together with an attention map of the CNN&#x27;s last layer, our method can
not only quantify stochastic EP but also produce the spatiotemporal pattern of
the EP (dissipation map). We show that our method accurately measures the EP
and creates a dissipation map in two nonequilibrium systems, the bead-spring
model and a network of elastic filaments. We further confirm high performance
even with noisy, low spatial resolution data, and partially observed
situations. Our method will provide a practical way to obtain dissipation maps
and ultimately contribute to uncovering the nonequilibrium nature of complex
systems.</span>

processes more comprehensively than homogeneous systems. Access to multiple
modalities of sensory data allow such systems to fuse information between
complementary sources and learn richer representations of a phenomenon of
interest. Often, these data are correlated but vary in fidelity, i.e., accuracy
(bias) and precision (noise). Low-fidelity data may be more plentiful, while
high-fidelity data may be more trustworthy. In this paper, we address the
problem of multi-robot online estimation and coverage control by combining low-
and high-fidelity data to learn and cover a sensory function of interest. We
propose two algorithms for this task of heterogeneous learning and coverage --
namely Stochastic Sequencing of Multi-fidelity Learning and Coverage (SMLC) and
Deterministic Sequencing of Multi-fidelity Learning and Coverage (DMLC) -- and
prove that they converge asymptotically. In addition, we demonstrate the

today&#x27;s largest online platforms, including YouTube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.
These systems produce recommendations in two steps: (i) multiple nominators --
tuned for low prediction latency -- preselect a small subset of candidates from
the whole item pool; (ii)~a slower but more accurate ranker further narrows
down the nominated items, and serves to the user. Despite their popularity, the
literature on two-stage recommenders is relatively scarce, and the algorithms
are often treated as the sum of their parts. Such treatment presupposes that
the two-stage performance is explained by the behavior of individual components
if they were deployed independently. This is not the case: using synthetic and
real-world data, we demonstrate that interactions between the ranker and the
nominators substantially affect the overall performance. Motivated by these
findings, we derive a generalization lower bound which shows that careful
choice of each nominator&#x27;s training set is sometimes the only difference
between a poor and an optimal two-stage recommender. Since searching for a good
choice manually is difficult, we learn one instead. In particular, using a
Mixture-of-Experts approach, we train the nominators (experts) to specialize on
different subsets of the item pool. This significantly improves performance.</span>

to the variation norm. Upper bounds on these rates have been established for
sigmoidal and ReLU activation functions, but it has remained an important open
problem whether these rates are sharp. In this article, we provide a solution
to this problem by proving sharp lower bounds on the approximation rates for
shallow neural networks, which are obtained by lower bounding the $L^2$-metric
entropy of the convex hull of the neural network basis functions. In addition,
our methods also give sharp lower bounds on the Kolmogorov $n$-widths of this
convex hull, which show that the variation spaces corresponding to shallow
neural networks cannot be efficiently approximated by linear methods. These
lower bounds apply to both sigmoidal activation functions with bounded
variation and to activation functions which are a power of the ReLU. Our
results also quantify how much stronger the Barron spectral norm is than the
variation norm and, combined with previous results, give the asymptotics of the
$L^\infty$-metric entropy up to logarithmic factors in the case of the ReLU
activation function.</span>

data have been heavily studied recently. However, the generalization ability of
deep models on complex real-world HAR data is limited by the availability of
high-quality labeled activity data, which are hard to obtain. In this paper, we
design a similarity embedding neural network that maps input sensor signals
onto real vectors through carefully designed convolutional and LSTM layers. The
embedding network is trained with a pairwise similarity loss, encouraging the
clustering of samples from the same class in the embedded real space, and can
be effectively trained on a small dataset and even on a noisy dataset with
mislabeled samples. Based on the learned embeddings, we further propose both
nonparametric and parametric approaches for activity recognition. Extensive
evaluation based on two public datasets has shown that the proposed similarity
embedding network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep models on HAR
classification tasks, is robust to mislabeled samples in the training set, and
can also be used to effectively denoise a noisy dataset.</span>

when implemented in low-energy computing platforms as required in many
industrial applications. Herein, a framework for optimizing compact LB-CNN is
introduced and its effectiveness is evaluated. The framework is freely
available and may run on free-access cloud platforms, thus requiring no major
investments. The optimized model is saved in the standardized .h5 format and
can be used as input to specialized tools for further deployment into specific
technologies, thus enabling the rapid development of various intelligent image
sensors. The main ingredient in accelerating the optimization of our model,
particularly the selection of binary convolution kernels, is the Chainer/Cupy
machine learning library offering significant speed-ups for training the output
layer as an extreme-learning machine. Additional training of the output layer
using Keras/Tensorflow is included, as it allows an increase in accuracy.
Results for widely used datasets including MNIST, GTSRB, ORL, VGG show very
good compromise between accuracy and complexity. Particularly, for face

to go before putting it safely into practice. In autonomous driving systems,
the detection of obstacles and traffic lights are of importance as well as lane
tracking. In this study, an autonomous driving system is developed and tested
in the experimental environment designed for this purpose. In this system, a
model vehicle having a camera is used to trace the lanes and avoid obstacles to
experimentally study autonomous driving behavior. Convolutional Neural Network
models were trained for Lane tracking. For the vehicle to avoid obstacles,
corner detection, optical flow, focus of expansion, time to collision, balance
calculation, and decision mechanism were created, respectively.</span>

                                        <span>In the past decades, many graph drawing techniques have been proposed for
generating aesthetically pleasing graph layouts. However, it remains a
challenging task since different layout methods tend to highlight different
characteristics of the graphs. Recently, studies on deep learning based graph
drawing algorithm have emerged but they are often not generalizable to
arbitrary graphs without re-training. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional
Graph Neural Network based deep learning framework, DeepGD, which can draw
arbitrary graphs once trained. It attempts to generate layouts by compromising
among multiple pre-specified aesthetics considering a good graph layout usually
complies with multiple aesthetics simultaneously. In order to balance the
trade-off, we propose two adaptive training strategies which adjust the weight
factor of each aesthetic dynamically during training. The quantitative and
qualitative assessment of DeepGD demonstrates that it is capable of drawing
arbitrary graphs effectively, while being flexible at accommodating different
aesthetic criteria.</span>

fidelity images on the class-conditional ImageNet generation challenge, without
any assistance from auxiliary image classifiers to boost sample quality. A
cascaded diffusion model comprises a pipeline of multiple diffusion models that
generate images of increasing resolution, beginning with a standard diffusion
model at the lowest resolution, followed by one or more super-resolution
diffusion models that successively upsample the image and add higher resolution
details. We find that the sample quality of a cascading pipeline relies
crucially on conditioning augmentation, our proposed method of data
augmentation of the lower resolution conditioning inputs to the
super-resolution models. Our experiments show that conditioning augmentation
prevents compounding error during sampling in a cascaded model, helping us to
train cascading pipelines achieving FID scores of 1.48 at 64x64, 3.52 at
128x128 and 4.88 at 256x256 resolutions, outperforming BigGAN-deep.</span>

                                        <span>Depth perception is fundamental for robots to understand the surrounding
environment. As the view of cognitive neuroscience, visual depth perception
methods are divided into three categories, namely binocular, active, and
pictorial. The first two categories have been studied for decades in detail.
However, research for the exploration of the third category is still in its
infancy and has got momentum by the advent of deep learning methods in recent
years. In cognitive neuroscience, it is known that pictorial depth perception
mechanisms are dependent on the perception of seen objects. Inspired by this
fact, in this thesis, we investigated the relation of perception of objects and
depth estimation convolutional neural networks. For this purpose, we developed
new network structures based on a simple depth estimation network that only
used a single image at its input. Our proposed structures use both an image and
a semantic label of the image as their input. We used semantic labels as the
output of object perception. The obtained results of performance comparison
between the developed network and original network showed that our novel
structures can improve the performance of depth estimation by 52\% of relative
error of distance in the examined cases. Most of the experimental studies were
carried out on synthetic datasets that were generated by game engines to
isolate the performance comparison from the effect of inaccurate depth and
semantic labels of non-synthetic datasets. It is shown that particular
synthetic datasets may be used for training of depth networks in cases that an
appropriate dataset is not available. Furthermore, we showed that in these
cases, usage of semantic labels improves the robustness of the network against
domain shift from synthetic training data to non-synthetic test data.</span>

have promised to increase data throughput by allowing concurrent communication
between one Access Point and multiple users. However, we are still a long way
from enjoying such MU-MIMO MAC protocol improvements for bandwidth hungry
applications such as video streaming in practical WiFi network settings due to
heterogeneous channel conditions and devices, unreliable transmissions, and
lack of useful feedback exchange among the lower and upper layers&#x27;
requirements. This paper introduces MuViS, a novel dual-phase optimization
framework that proposes a Quality of Experience (QoE) aware MU-MIMO
optimization for multi-user video streaming over IEEE 802.11ac. MuViS first
employs reinforcement learning to optimize the MU-MIMO user group and mode
selection for users based on their PHY/MAC layer characteristics. The video
bitrate is then optimized based on the user&#x27;s mode (Multi-User (MU) or
Single-User (SU)). We present our design and its evaluation on smartphones and
laptops using 802.11ac WiFi. Our experimental results in various indoor
environments and configurations show a scalable framework that can support a
large number of users with streaming at high video rates and satisfying QoE
requirements.</span>

state-of-the-art performance with orders of magnitude less labeled data.
However, such methods are domain-specific and little has been done to leverage
this technique on real-world tabular datasets. We propose SCARF, a simple,
widely-applicable technique for contrastive learning, where views are formed by
corrupting a random subset of features. When applied to pre-train deep neural
networks on the 69 real-world, tabular classification datasets from the
OpenML-CC18 benchmark, SCARF not only improves classification accuracy in the
fully-supervised setting but does so also in the presence of label noise and in
the semi-supervised setting where only a fraction of the available training
data is labeled. We show that SCARF complements existing strategies and
outperforms alternatives like autoencoders. We conduct comprehensive ablations,

a subset of the training data they were trained on is deleted. Methods for the
task are desired to combine effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., they should
effectively &quot;unlearn&quot; deleted data, but in a way that does not require
excessive computation effort (e.g., a full retraining) for a small amount of
deletions. Such a combination is typically achieved by tolerating some amount
of approximation in the unlearning. In addition, laws and regulations in the
spirit of &quot;the right to be forgotten&quot; have given rise to requirements for
certifiability, i.e., the ability to demonstrate that the deleted data has
indeed been unlearned by the ML model.

In this paper, we present an experimental study of the three state-of-the-art
approximate unlearning methods for linear models and demonstrate the trade-offs
between efficiency, effectiveness and certifiability offered by each method. In
implementing the study, we extend some of the existing works and describe a
common ML pipeline to compare and evaluate the unlearning methods on six
real-world datasets and a variety of settings. We provide insights into the
effect of the quantity and distribution of the deleted data on ML models and
the performance of each unlearning method in different settings. We also
propose a practical online strategy to determine when the accumulated error
from approximate unlearning is large enough to warrant a full retrain of the ML
model.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we introduce adversarially robust streaming algorithms for
central machine learning and algorithmic tasks, such as regression and
clustering, as well as their more general counterparts, subspace embedding,
low-rank approximation, and coreset construction. For regression and other
numerical linear algebra related tasks, we consider the row arrival streaming
model. Our results are based on a simple, but powerful, observation that many
importance sampling-based algorithms give rise to adversarial robustness which
is in contrast to sketching based algorithms, which are very prevalent in the
streaming literature but suffer from adversarial attacks. In addition, we show
that the well-known merge and reduce paradigm in streaming is adversarially
robust. Since the merge and reduce paradigm allows coreset constructions in the
streaming setting, we thus obtain robust algorithms for $k$-means, $k$-median,
$k$-center, Bregman clustering, projective clustering, principal component
analysis (PCA) and non-negative matrix factorization. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first adversarially robust results for these problems
yet require no new algorithmic implementations. Finally, we empirically confirm
the robustness of our algorithms on various adversarial attacks and demonstrate
that by contrast, some common existing algorithms are not robust.

                                        <span>Molecular graph generation is a fundamental but challenging task in various
applications such as drug discovery and material science, which requires
generating valid molecules with desired properties. Auto-regressive models,
which usually construct graphs following sequential actions of adding nodes and
edges at the atom-level, have made rapid progress in recent years. However,
these atom-level models ignore high-frequency subgraphs that not only capture
the regularities of atomic combination in molecules but also are often related
to desired chemical properties. In this paper, we propose a method to
automatically discover such common substructures, which we call {\em graph
pieces}, from given molecular graphs. Based on graph pieces, we leverage a
variational autoencoder to generate molecules in two phases: piece-level graph
generation followed by bond completion. Experiments show that our graph piece
variational autoencoder achieves better performance over state-of-the-art
baselines on property optimization and constrained property optimization tasks
with higher computational efficiency.</span>

structured domains. Existing approaches have focused on static structures,
whereas many real graph data represent a dynamic structure, limiting the
applications of GGPs. To overcome this we propose evolving-Graph Gaussian
Processes (e-GGPs). The proposed method is capable of learning the transition
function of graph vertices over time with a neighbourhood kernel to model the
connectivity and interaction changes between vertices. We assess the

                                        <span>Deep neural networks have emerged as very successful tools for image
restoration and reconstruction tasks. These networks are often trained
end-to-end to directly reconstruct an image from a noisy or corrupted
measurement of that image. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, training on
large and diverse sets of images is considered critical. However, it is often
difficult and/or expensive to collect large amounts of training images.
Inspired by the success of Data Augmentation (DA) for classification problems,
in this paper, we propose a pipeline for data augmentation for accelerated MRI
reconstruction and study its effectiveness at reducing the required training
data in a variety of settings. Our DA pipeline, MRAugment, is specifically
designed to utilize the invariances present in medical imaging measurements as
naive DA strategies that neglect the physics of the problem fail. Through
extensive studies on multiple datasets we demonstrate that in the low-data
regime DA prevents overfitting and can match or even surpass the state of the
art while using significantly fewer training data, whereas in the high-data
regime it has diminishing returns. Furthermore, our findings show that DA can
improve the robustness of the model against various shifts in the test
distribution.</span>

                                        <span>Balancing exploration and exploitation (EE) is a fundamental problem in
contex-tual bandit. One powerful principle for EE trade-off isOptimism in Face
of Uncer-tainty(OFU), in which the agent takes the action according to an upper
confidencebound (UCB) of reward. OFU has achieved (near-)optimal regret bound
for lin-ear/kernel contextual bandits. However, it is in general unknown how to
deriveefficient and effective EE trade-off methods for non-linearcomplex tasks,
suchas contextual bandit with deep neural network as the reward function. In
thispaper, we propose a novel OFU algorithm namedregularized OFU(ROFU). InROFU,
we measure the uncertainty of the reward by a differentiable function
andcompute the upper confidence bound by solving a regularized optimization
prob-lem. We prove that, for multi-armed bandit, kernel contextual bandit and
neuraltangent kernel bandit, ROFU achieves (near-)optimal regret bounds with
certainuncertainty measure, which theoretically justifies its effectiveness on
EE trade-off.Importantly, ROFU admits a very efficient implementation with
gradient-basedoptimizer, which easily extends to general deep neural network
models beyondneural tangent kernel, in sharp contrast with previous OFU
methods. The em-pirical evaluation demonstrates that ROFU works extremelywell
for contextualbandits under various settings.</span>

various matrices, and uses the knowledge for factorizing unseen matrices. The
proposed method uses a neural network that takes a matrix as input, and
generates prior distributions of factorized matrices of the given matrix. The
neural network is meta-learned such that the expected imputation error is
minimized when the factorized matrices are adapted to each matrix by a maximum
a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We use a gradient descent method for the MAP
estimation, which enables us to backpropagate the expected imputation error
through the gradient descent steps for updating neural network parameters since
each gradient descent step is written in a closed form and is differentiable.
The proposed method can meta-learn from matrices even when their rows and
columns are not shared, and their sizes are different from each other. In our
experiments with three user-item rating datasets, we demonstrate that our

                                        <span>Learning from multiple annotators aims to induce a high-quality classifier
from training instances, where each of them is associated with a set of
possibly noisy labels provided by multiple annotators under the influence of
their varying abilities and own biases. In modeling the probability transition
process from latent true labels to observed labels, most existing methods adopt
class-level confusion matrices of annotators that observed labels do not depend
on the instance features, just determined by the true labels. It may limit the
performance that the classifier can achieve. In this work, we propose the noise
transition matrix, which incorporates the influence of instance features on
annotators&#x27; performance based on confusion matrices. Furthermore, we propose a
simple yet effective learning framework, which consists of a classifier module
and a noise transition matrix module in a unified neural network architecture.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in comparison

of novel waveforms that can support these emerging applications becomes
increasingly challenging. We present in this work an end-to-end learning
approach to design waveforms through joint learning of pulse shaping and

Optimization is performed to maximize an achievable information rate, while
satisfying constraints on out-of-band emission and power envelope. Our results
show that the proposed approach enables up to orders of magnitude smaller
adjacent channel leakage ratios (ACLRs) with peak-to-average power ratios

We show that the proposed method performs well against the benchmark selection
methods. We use our findings to develop a highly effective machine
learning-based detection systems that achieves 99.9% accuracy in distinguishing
between DDoS and benign signals. We believe that our results can be useful to
experts who are interested in designing and building automated intrusion
detection systems.</span>

                                        <span>Text to speech (TTS), or speech synthesis, which aims to synthesize
intelligible and natural speech given text, is a hot research topic in speech,
language, and machine learning communities and has broad applications in the
industry. As the development of deep learning and artificial intelligence,
neural network-based TTS has significantly improved the quality of synthesized
speech in recent years. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on
neural TTS, aiming to provide a good understanding of current research and
future trends. We focus on the key components in neural TTS, including text
analysis, acoustic models and vocoders, and several advanced topics, including
fast TTS, low-resource TTS, robust TTS, expressive TTS, and adaptive TTS, etc.
We further summarize resources related to TTS (e.g., datasets, opensource
implementations) and discuss future research directions. This survey can serve
both academic researchers and industry practitioners working on TTS.</span>

Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL). Our end-to-end approach learns progressively refined
generative embedding spaces constrained within and across the involved
modalities (visual, language). The inter-modal constraints are defined between
action sequence embedding and embeddings of Parts of Speech (PoS) tagged words
in the corresponding action description. We deploy SynSE for the task of
skeleton-based action sequence recognition. Our design choices enable SynSE to
generalize compositionally, i.e., recognize sequences whose action descriptions
contain words not encountered during training. We also extend our approach to
the more challenging Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) problem via a
confidence-based gating mechanism. We are the first to present zero-shot
skeleton action recognition results on the large-scale NTU-60 and NTU-120
skeleton action datasets with multiple splits. Our results demonstrate SynSE&#x27;s
state of the art performance in both ZSL and GZSL settings compared to strong
baselines on the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets. The code and pretrained models

requires the efforts of generation methods. However, current deepfake methods
suffer the effects of obscure workflow and poor performance. To solve this
problem, we present DeepFaceLab, the current dominant deepfake framework for
face-swapping. It provides the necessary tools as well as an easy-to-use way to
conduct high-quality face-swapping. It also offers a flexible and loose
coupling structure for people who need to strengthen their pipeline with other
features without writing complicated boilerplate code. We detail the principles
that drive the implementation of DeepFaceLab and introduce its pipeline,
through which every aspect of the pipeline can be modified painlessly by users
to achieve their customization purpose. It is noteworthy that DeepFaceLab could
achieve cinema-quality results with high fidelity. We demonstrate the advantage
of our system by comparing our approach with other face-swapping methods.For

                                        <span>Over the last decade, the bandwidth expansion and MU-MIMO spectral efficiency
have promised to increase data throughput by allowing concurrent communication
between one Access Point and multiple users. However, we are still a long way
from enjoying such MU-MIMO MAC protocol improvements for bandwidth hungry
applications such as video streaming in practical WiFi network settings due to
heterogeneous channel conditions and devices, unreliable transmissions, and
lack of useful feedback exchange among the lower and upper layers&#x27;
requirements. This paper introduces MuViS, a novel dual-phase optimization
framework that proposes a Quality of Experience (QoE) aware MU-MIMO
optimization for multi-user video streaming over IEEE 802.11ac. MuViS first
employs reinforcement learning to optimize the MU-MIMO user group and mode
selection for users based on their PHY/MAC layer characteristics. The video
bitrate is then optimized based on the user&#x27;s mode (Multi-User (MU) or
Single-User (SU)). We present our design and its evaluation on smartphones and
laptops using 802.11ac WiFi. Our experimental results in various indoor
environments and configurations show a scalable framework that can support a
large number of users with streaming at high video rates and satisfying QoE
requirements.</span>

                                        <span>The last-generation video conferencing software allows users to utilize a
virtual background to conceal their personal environment due to privacy
concerns, especially in official meetings with other employers. On the other
hand, users maybe want to fool people in the meeting by considering the virtual
background to conceal where they are. In this case, developing tools to
understand the virtual background utilize for fooling people in meeting plays
an important role. Besides, such detectors must prove robust against different
kinds of attacks since a malicious user can fool the detector by applying a set
of adversarial editing steps on the video to conceal any revealing footprint.
In this paper, we study the feasibility of an efficient tool to detect whether
a videoconferencing user background is real. In particular, we provide the
first tool which computes pixel co-occurrences matrices and uses them to search
for inconsistencies among spectral and spatial bands. Our experiments confirm
that cross co-occurrences matrices improve the robustness of the detector
against different kinds of attacks. This work&#x27;s performance is especially
noteworthy with regard to color SPAM features. Moreover, the performance
especially is significant with regard to robustness versus post-processing,
like geometric transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, and JPEG
compression with different quality factors.</span>

response generation and then the degree of task completion, is essential for
task-oriented dialogue systems. However, the unbalanced distribution of system
actions in dialogue datasets often causes difficulty in learning to generate
desired actions and responses. In this paper, we propose a
retrieve-and-memorize framework to enhance the learning of system actions.
Specially, we first design a neural context-aware retrieval module to retrieve
multiple candidate system actions from the training set given a dialogue
context. Then, we propose a memory-augmented multi-decoder network to generate
the system actions conditioned on the candidate actions, which allows the
network to adaptively select key information in the candidate actions and
ignore noises. We conduct experiments on the large-scale multi-domain
task-oriented dialogue dataset MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.1. Experimental
results show that our method achieves competitive performance among several
state-of-the-art models in the context-to-response generation task.</span>

                                        <span>Recent developments in Text Style Transfer have led this field to be more
highlighted than ever. The task of transferring an input&#x27;s style to another is
accompanied by plenty of challenges (e.g., fluency and content preservation)
that need to be taken care of. In this research, we introduce PGST, a novel
polyglot text style transfer approach in the gender domain, composed of
different constitutive elements. In contrast to prior studies, it is feasible
to apply a style transfer method in multiple languages by fulfilling our
method&#x27;s predefined elements. We have proceeded with a pre-trained word
embedding for token replacement purposes, a character-based token classifier
for gender exchange purposes, and a beam search algorithm for extracting the
most fluent combination. Since different approaches are introduced in our
research, we determine a trade-off value for evaluating different models&#x27;
success in faking our gender identification model with transferred text. To
demonstrate our method&#x27;s multilingual applicability, we applied our method on
both English and Persian corpora and ended up defeating our proposed gender
identification model by 45.6% and 39.2%, respectively. While this research&#x27;s
focus is not limited to a specific language, our obtained evaluation results
are highly competitive in an analogy among English state of the art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Research on overlapped and discontinuous named entity recognition (NER) has
received increasing attention. The majority of previous work focuses on either
overlapped or discontinuous entities. In this paper, we propose a novel
span-based model that can recognize both overlapped and discontinuous entities
jointly. The model includes two major steps. First, entity fragments are
recognized by traversing over all possible text spans, thus, overlapped
entities can be recognized. Second, we perform relation classification to judge
whether a given pair of entity fragments to be overlapping or succession. In
this way, we can recognize not only discontinuous entities, and meanwhile
doubly check the overlapped entities. As a whole, our model can be regarded as
a relation extraction paradigm essentially. Experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets (i.e., CLEF, GENIA and ACE05) show that our model is highly
competitive for overlapped and discontinuous NER.</span>

                                        <span>Toxicity detection of text has been a popular NLP task in the recent years.
In SemEval-2021 Task-5 Toxic Spans Detection, the focus is on detecting toxic
spans within passages. Most state-of-the-art span detection approaches employ
various techniques, each of which can be broadly classified into Token
Classification or Span Prediction approaches. In our paper, we explore simple
versions of both of these approaches and their performance on the task.
Specifically, we use BERT-based models -- BERT, RoBERTa, and SpanBERT for both
approaches. We also combine these approaches and modify them to bring
improvements for Toxic Spans prediction. To this end, we investigate results on
four hybrid approaches -- Multi-Span, Span+Token, LSTM-CRF, and a combination
of predicted offsets using union/intersection. Additionally, we perform a
thorough ablative analysis and analyze our observed results. Our best
submission -- a combination of SpanBERT Span Predictor and RoBERTa Token
Classifier predictions -- achieves an F1 score of 0.6753 on the test set. Our
best post-eval F1 score is 0.6895 on intersection of predicted offsets from
top-3 RoBERTa Token Classification checkpoints. These approaches improve the
performance by 3% on average than those of the shared baseline models -- RNNSL
and SpaCy NER.</span>

practice in diagnostic radiology. On one hand, it can relieve radiologists from
the heavy burden of report writing; On the other hand, it can remind
radiologists of abnormalities and avoid the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.
Yet, this task remains a challenging job for data-driven neural networks, due
to the serious visual and textual data biases. To this end, we propose a
Posterior-and-Prior Knowledge Exploring-and-Distilling approach (PPKED) to
imitate the working patterns of radiologists, who will first examine the
abnormal regions and assign the disease topic tags to the abnormal regions, and
then rely on the years of prior medical knowledge and prior working experience
accumulations to write reports. Thus, the PPKED includes three modules:
Posterior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE), Prior Knowledge Explorer (PrKE) and
Multi-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD). In detail, PoKE explores the posterior
knowledge, which provides explicit abnormal visual regions to alleviate visual
data bias; PrKE explores the prior knowledge from the prior medical knowledge
graph (medical knowledge) and prior radiology reports (working experience) to
alleviate textual data bias. The explored knowledge is distilled by the MKD to
generate the final reports. Evaluated on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets, our
method is able to outperform previous state-of-the-art models on these two
datasets.</span>

charts in real world, one should take the challenges of efficiency, imbalanced
data and table context into consideration. In this paper, we propose
Table2Charts framework which learns common patterns from a large corpus of

heuristic searching, Table2Charts does table-to-sequence generation, where each
sequence follows a chart template. On a large spreadsheet corpus with 165k
tables and 266k charts, we show that Table2Charts could learn a shared
representation of table fields so that recommendation tasks on different chart
types could mutually enhance each other. Table2Charts outperforms other chart
recommendation systems in both multi-type task (with doubled recall numbers

NLP, there have been several efforts to understand what information such
representations contain. A common strategy to use such representations is to
fine-tune them for an end task. However, how fine-tuning for a task changes the
underlying space is less studied. In this work, we study the English BERT
family and use two probing techniques to analyze how fine-tuning changes the
space. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning improves performance because it
pushes points associated with a label away from other labels. By comparing the
representations before and after fine-tuning, we also discover that fine-tuning
does not change the representations arbitrarily; instead, it adjusts the
representations to downstream tasks while preserving the original structure.
Finally, using carefully constructed experiments, we show that fine-tuning can
encode training sets in a representation, suggesting an overfitting problem of
a new kind.</span>

                                        <span>There is an escalating need for methods to identify latent patterns in text
data from many domains. We introduce a new method to identify topics in a
corpus and represent documents as topic sequences. Discourse Atom Topic
Modeling draws on advances in theoretical machine learning to integrate topic
modeling and word embedding, capitalizing on the distinct capabilities of each.
We first identify a set of vectors (&quot;discourse atoms&quot;) that provide a sparse
representation of an embedding space. Atom vectors can be interpreted as latent
topics: Through a generative model, atoms map onto distributions over words;
one can also infer the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate
our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the U.S. National
Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS summarizes violent death
incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify
225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical
aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured
variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender, and
recent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias
of our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then
compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female
versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of
reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a
flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data.</span>

participation in the shared task namely Artificial Intelligence for Legal
Assistance (AILA 2019). This is an integral event of Forum for Information
Retrieval Evaluation-2019. The outcomes of this track would be helpful for the
automation of the working process of the Indian Judiciary System. The manual
working procedures and documentation at any level (from lower to higher court)
of the judiciary system are very complex in nature. The systems produced as a
part of this track would assist the law practitioners. It would be helpful for
common men too. This kind of track also opens the path of research of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in the judicial domain. This track defined two
problems such as Task 1: Identifying relevant prior cases for a given situation
and Task 2: Identifying the most relevant statutes for a given situation. We
tackled both of them. Our proposed approaches are based on BM25 and Doc2Vec. As
per the results declared by the task organizers, we are in 3rd and a modest
position in Task 1 and Task 2 respectively.</span>

Reading Comprehension of Abstract Meaning. Given a fill-in-the-blank-type
question and a corresponding context, the task is to predict the most suitable
word from a list of 5 options. There are three sub-tasks within this task:
Imperceptibility (subtask-I), Non-Specificity (subtask-II), and Intersection
(subtask-III). We use encoders of transformers-based models pre-trained on the
masked language modelling (MLM) task to build our Fill-in-the-blank (FitB)
models. Moreover, to model imperceptibility, we define certain linguistic
features, and to model non-specificity, we leverage information from hypernyms
and hyponyms provided by a lexical database. Specifically, for non-specificity,
we try out augmentation techniques, and other statistical techniques. We also
propose variants, namely Chunk Voting and Max Context, to take care of input
length restrictions for BERT, etc. Additionally, we perform a thorough ablation
study, and use Integrated Gradients to explain our predictions on a few
samples. Our best submissions achieve accuracies of 75.31% and 77.84%, on the
test sets for subtask-I and subtask-II, respectively. For subtask-III, we
achieve accuracies of 65.64% and 62.27%.</span>

                                        <span>Intelligent robots designed to interact with humans in real scenarios need to
be able to refer to entities actively by natural language. In spatial referring
expression generation, the ambiguity is unavoidable due to the diversity of
reference frames, which will lead to an understanding gap between humans and
robots. To narrow this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel
perspective-corrected spatial referring expression generation (PcSREG) approach
for human-robot interaction by considering the selection of reference frames.
The task of referring expression generation is simplified into the process of
generating diverse spatial relation units. First, we pick out all landmarks in
these spatial relation units according to the entropy of preference and allow
its updating through a stack model. Then all possible referring expressions are
generated according to different reference frame strategies. Finally, we
evaluate every expression using a probabilistic referring expression resolution
model and find the best expression that satisfies both of the appropriateness
and effectiveness. We implement the proposed approach on a robot system and
empirical experiments show that our approach can generate more effective
spatial referring expressions for practical applications.</span>

translation task by the UPC Machine Translation group. The task consists of
building a system capable of translating English audio recordings extracted
from TED talks into German text. Submitted systems can be either cascade or
end-to-end and use a custom or given segmentation. Our submission is an
end-to-end speech translation system, which combines pre-trained models
(Wav2Vec 2.0 and mBART) with coupling modules between the encoder and decoder,
and uses an efficient fine-tuning technique, which trains only 20% of its total
parameters. We show that adding an Adapter to the system and pre-training it,
can increase the convergence speed and the final result, with which we achieve
a BLEU score of 27.3 on the MuST-C test set. Our final model is an ensemble
that obtains 28.22 BLEU score on the same set. Our submission also uses a
custom segmentation algorithm that employs pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 for
identifying periods of untranscribable text and can bring improvements of 2.5
to 3 BLEU score on the IWSLT 2019 test set, as compared to the result with the
given segmentation.</span>

                                        <span>Intent classification is a major task in spoken language understanding (SLU).
Since most models are built with pre-collected in-domain (IND) training
utterances, their ability to detect unsupported out-of-domain (OOD) utterances
has a critical effect in practical use. Recent works have shown that using
extra data and labels can improve the OOD detection performance, yet it could
be costly to collect such data. This paper proposes to train a model with only
IND data while supporting both IND intent classification and OOD detection. Our
method designs a novel domain-regularized module (DRM) to reduce the
overconfident phenomenon of a vanilla classifier, achieving a better
generalization in both cases. Besides, DRM can be used as a drop-in replacement
for the last layer in any neural network-based intent classifier, providing a
low-cost strategy for a significant improvement. The evaluation on four
datasets shows that our method built on BERT and RoBERTa models achieves
state-of-the-art performance against existing approaches and the strong
baselines we created for the comparisons.</span>

                                        <span>Target speech separation is the process of filtering a certain speaker&#x27;s
voice out of speech mixtures according to the additional speaker identity
information provided. Recent works have made considerable improvement by
processing signals in the time domain directly. The majority of them take fully
overlapped speech mixtures for training. However, since most real-life
conversations occur randomly and are sparsely overlapped, we argue that
training with different overlap ratio data benefits. To do so, an unavoidable
problem is that the popularly used SI-SNR loss has no definition for silent
sources. This paper proposes the weighted SI-SNR loss, together with the joint
learning of target speech separation and personal VAD. The weighted SI-SNR loss
imposes a weight factor that is proportional to the target speaker&#x27;s duration
and returns zero when the target speaker is absent. Meanwhile, the personal VAD
generates masks and sets non-target speech to silence. Experiments show that
our proposed method outperforms the baseline by 1.73 dB in terms of SDR on
fully overlapped speech, as well as by 4.17 dB and 0.9 dB on sparsely
overlapped speech of clean and noisy conditions. Besides, with slight
degradation in performance, our model could reduce the time costs in inference.</span>

can enable the use of radiology report information for a variety of critical
healthcare applications. In our work, we present RadGraph, a dataset of
entities and relations in full-text chest X-ray radiology reports based on a
novel information extraction schema we designed to structure radiology reports.
We release a development dataset, which contains board-certified radiologist
annotations for 500 radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR dataset (14,579
entities and 10,889 relations), and a test dataset, which contains two
independent sets of board-certified radiologist annotations for 100 radiology
reports split equally across the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert datasets. Using these
datasets, we train and test a deep learning model, RadGraph Benchmark, that
achieves a micro F1 of 0.82 and 0.73 on relation extraction on the MIMIC-CXR
and CheXpert test sets respectively. Additionally, we release an inference
dataset, which contains annotations automatically generated by RadGraph
Benchmark across 220,763 MIMIC-CXR reports (around 6 million entities and 4
million relations) and 500 CheXpert reports (13,783 entities and 9,908
relations) with mappings to associated chest radiographs. Our freely available

processing, as well as computer vision and multi-modal learning when linked to
chest radiographs.</span>

                                        <span>We generalize deep self-attention distillation in MiniLM (Wang et al., 2020)
by only using self-attention relation distillation for task-agnostic
compression of pretrained Transformers. In particular, we define multi-head
self-attention relations as scaled dot-product between the pairs of query, key,
and value vectors within each self-attention module. Then we employ the above
relational knowledge to train the student model. Besides its simplicity and
unified principle, more favorably, there is no restriction in terms of the
number of student&#x27;s attention heads, while most previous work has to guarantee
the same head number between teacher and student. Moreover, the fine-grained
self-attention relations tend to fully exploit the interaction knowledge
learned by Transformer. In addition, we thoroughly examine the layer selection
strategy for teacher models, rather than just relying on the last layer as in
MiniLM. We conduct extensive experiments on compressing both monolingual and
multilingual pretrained models. Experimental results demonstrate that our
models distilled from base-size and large-size teachers (BERT, RoBERTa and
XLM-R) outperform the state-of-the-art.</span>

                                        <span>Learning vector representations for words is one of the most fundamental
topics in NLP, capable of capturing syntactic and semantic relationships useful
in a variety of downstream NLP tasks. Vector representations can be limiting,
however, in that typical scoring such as dot product similarity intertwines
position and magnitude of the vector in space. Exciting innovations in the
space of representation learning have proposed alternative fundamental
representations, such as distributions, hyperbolic vectors, or regions. Our
model, Word2Box, takes a region-based approach to the problem of word
representation, representing words as $n$-dimensional rectangles. These
representations encode position and breadth independently and provide
additional geometric operations such as intersection and containment which
allow them to model co-occurrence patterns vectors struggle with. We
demonstrate improved performance on various word similarity tasks, particularly
on less common words, and perform a qualitative analysis exploring the
additional unique expressivity provided by Word2Box.</span>

best fits a provided dataset of input and output values. Due to the richness of
the space of mathematical expressions, symbolic regression is generally a
challenging problem. While conventional approaches based on genetic evolution
algorithms have been used for decades, deep learning-based methods are
relatively new and an active research area. In this work, we present
SymbolicGPT, a novel transformer-based language model for symbolic regression.
This model exploits the advantages of probabilistic language models like GPT,
including strength in performance and flexibility. Through comprehensive

notable ability to learn a new language task after being prompted with just a
few examples. Here, we present a simple, yet effective, approach for
transferring this few-shot learning ability to a multimodal setting (vision and
language). Using aligned image and caption data, we train a vision encoder to
represent each image as a sequence of continuous embeddings, such that a
pre-trained, frozen language model prompted with this prefix generates the
appropriate caption. The resulting system is a multimodal few-shot learner,
with the surprising ability to learn a variety of new tasks when conditioned on
examples, represented as a sequence of multiple interleaved image and text
embeddings. We demonstrate that it can rapidly learn words for new objects and
novel visual categories, do visual question-answering with only a handful of
examples, and make use of outside knowledge, by measuring a single model on a
variety of established and new benchmarks.</span>

on grammar rule pattern learning and pairing via intermediate logic forms.
Although those methods give an acceptable performance on certain specific
database and parsing tasks, they are hard to generalize and scale. On the other
hand, recent progress in neural deep learning seems to provide a promising
direction towards building a general NLIDB system. Unlike the traditional
approach, those neural methodologies treat the parsing problem as a

on high-resource languages like English, mostly due to the limited availability
of datasets for low/mid-resource ones. In this work, we present XL-Sum, a
comprehensive and diverse dataset comprising 1 million professionally annotated
article-summary pairs from BBC, extracted using a set of carefully designed
heuristics. The dataset covers 44 languages ranging from low to high-resource,
for many of which no public dataset is currently available. XL-Sum is highly
abstractive, concise, and of high quality, as indicated by human and intrinsic
evaluation. We fine-tune mT5, a state-of-the-art pretrained multilingual model,
with XL-Sum and experiment on multilingual and low-resource summarization
tasks. XL-Sum induces competitive results compared to the ones obtained using
similar monolingual datasets: we show higher than 11 ROUGE-2 scores on 10
languages we benchmark on, with some of them exceeding 15, as obtained by
multilingual training. Additionally, training on low-resource languages
individually also provides competitive performance. To the best of our
knowledge, XL-Sum is the largest abstractive summarization dataset in terms of
the number of samples collected from a single source and the number of
languages covered. We are releasing our dataset and models to encourage future
research on multilingual abstractive summarization. The resources can be found

resource languages such as Persian. In this research we prepare a causality
human annotated corpus for the Persian language which consists of 4446
sentences and 5128 causal relations and three labels of cause, effect and
causal mark -- if possibl -- are specified for each relation. We have used this
corpus to train a system for detecting causal elements boundaries. Also, we
present a causality detection benchmark for three machine learning methods and
two deep learning systems based on this corpus. Performance evaluations
indicate that our best total result is obtained through CRF classifier which
has F-measure of 0.76 and the best accuracy obtained through Bi-LSTM-CRF deep
learning method with Accuracy equal to %91.4.</span>

                                        <span>Argumentation mining is a field of computational linguistics that is devoted
to extracting from texts and classifying arguments and relations between them,
as well as constructing an argumentative structure. A significant obstacle to
research in this area for the Russian language is the lack of annotated
Russian-language text corpora. This article explores the possibility of
improving the quality of argumentation mining using the extension of the
Russian-language version of the Argumentative Microtext Corpus (ArgMicro) based
on the machine translation of the Persuasive Essays Corpus (PersEssays). To
make it possible to use these two corpora combined, we propose a Joint Argument
Annotation Scheme based on the schemes used in ArgMicro and PersEssays. We
solve the problem of classifying argumentative discourse units (ADUs) into two
classes - &quot;pro&quot; (&quot;for&quot;) and &quot;opp&quot; (&quot;against&quot;) using traditional machine
learning techniques (SVM, Bagging and XGBoost) and a deep neural network (BERT
model). An ensemble of XGBoost and BERT models was proposed, which showed the
highest performance of ADUs classification for both corpora.</span>

metrics have been widely explored. However, collecting human-annotated
references and ratings are costly and time-consuming. To avoid these
limitations, we propose a training-free and reference-free summarization
evaluation metric. Our metric consists of a centrality-weighted relevance score
and a self-referenced redundancy score. The relevance score is computed between
the pseudo reference built from the source document and the given summary,
where the pseudo reference content is weighted by the sentence centrality to
provide importance guidance. Besides an $F_1$-based relevance score, we also
design an $F_\beta$-based variant that pays more attention to the recall score.
As for the redundancy score of the summary, we compute a self-masked similarity
score with the summary itself to evaluate the redundant information in the
summary. Finally, we combine the relevance and redundancy scores to produce the
final evaluation score of the given summary. Extensive experiments show that
our methods can significantly outperform existing methods on both
multi-document and single-document summarization evaluation.</span>

of the knowledge graph by inferring from the facts contained in it. Recent work
in link prediction has attempted to provide a model for increasing link
prediction accuracy by using more layers in neural network architecture or
methods that add to the computational complexity of models. This paper we
proposed a method for refining the knowledge graph, which makes the knowledge
graph more informative, and link prediction operations can be performed more
accurately using relatively fast translational models. Translational link
prediction models, such as TransE, TransH, TransD, etc., have much less
complexity than deep learning approaches. This method uses the hierarchy of
relationships and also the hierarchy of entities in the knowledge graph to add
the entity information as a new entity to the graph and connect it to the nodes
which contain this information in their hierarchy. Our experiments show that
our method can significantly increase the performance of translational link
prediction methods in H@10, MR, MRR.</span>

diagnosis of medical conditions such as depression, using a collection of a
person&#x27;s utterances. Depression is a serious medical illness that can have
adverse effects on how one feels, thinks, and acts, which can lead to emotional
and physical problems. Due to the sensitive nature of such data, privacy
measures need to be taken for handling and training models with such data. In
this work, we study the effects that the application of Differential Privacy
(DP) has, in both a centralized and a Federated Learning (FL) setup, on
training contextualized language models (BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa and DistilBERT).
We offer insights on how to privately train NLP models and what architectures
and setups provide more desirable privacy utility trade-offs. We envisage this
work to be used in future healthcare and mental health studies to keep medical
history private. Therefore, we provide an open-source implementation of this

                                        <span>In the field of inorganic materials science, there is a growing demand to
extract knowledge such as physical properties and synthesis processes of
materials by machine-reading a large number of papers. This is because
materials researchers refer to many papers in order to come up with promising
terms of experiments for material synthesis. However, there are only a few
systems that can extract material names and their properties. This study
proposes a large-scale natural language processing (NLP) pipeline for
extracting material names and properties from materials science literature to
enable the search and retrieval of results in materials science. Therefore, we
propose a label definition for extracting material names and properties and
accordingly build a corpus containing 836 annotated paragraphs extracted from
301 papers for training a named entity recognition (NER) model. Experimental
results demonstrate the utility of this NER model; it achieves successful
extraction with a micro-F1 score of 78.1%. To demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach, we present a thorough evaluation on a real-world automatically
annotated corpus by applying our trained NER model to 12,895 materials science
papers. We analyze the trend in materials science by visualizing the outputs of
the NLP pipeline. For example, the country-by-year analysis indicates that in
recent years, the number of papers on &quot;MoS2,&quot; a material used in perovskite
solar cells, has been increasing rapidly in China but decreasing in the United
States. Further, according to the conditions-by-year analysis, the processing
temperature of the catalyst material &quot;PEDOT:PSS&quot; is shifting below 200 degree,
and the number of reports with a processing time exceeding 5 h is increasing
slightly.</span>

                                        <span>Extracting relational triples from texts is a fundamental task in knowledge
graph construction. The popular way of existing methods is to jointly extract
entities and relations using a single model, which often suffers from the
overlapping triple problem. That is, there are multiple relational triples that
share the same entities within one sentence. In this work, we propose an
effective cascade dual-decoder approach to extract overlapping relational
triples, which includes a text-specific relation decoder and a
relation-corresponded entity decoder. Our approach is straightforward: the
text-specific relation decoder detects relations from a sentence according to
its text semantics and treats them as extra features to guide the entity
extraction; for each extracted relation, which is with trainable embedding, the
relation-corresponded entity decoder detects the corresponding head and tail
entities using a span-based tagging scheme. In this way, the overlapping triple
problem is tackled naturally. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate
that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves
better F1 scores under the strict evaluation metric. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/prastunlp/DualDec.</span>

                                        <span>Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a fundamental role in modeling and
simulating problems across a wide range of disciplines. Recent advances in deep
learning have shown the great potential of physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) to solve PDEs as a basis for data-driven modeling and inverse analysis.
However, the majority of existing PINN methods, based on fully-connected NNs,
pose intrinsic limitations to low-dimensional spatiotemporal parameterizations.
Moreover, since the initial/boundary conditions (I/BCs) are softly imposed via
penalty, the solution quality heavily relies on hyperparameter tuning. To this
end, we propose the novel physics-informed convolutional-recurrent learning
architectures (PhyCRNet and PhyCRNet-s) for solving PDEs without any labeled
data. Specifically, an encoder-decoder convolutional long short-term memory
network is proposed for low-dimensional spatial feature extraction and temporal
evolution learning. The loss function is defined as the aggregated discretized
PDE residuals, while the I/BCs are hard-encoded in the network to ensure
forcible satisfaction (e.g., periodic boundary padding). The networks are
further enhanced by autoregressive and residual connections that explicitly
simulate time marching. The performance of our proposed methods has been
assessed by solving three nonlinear PDEs (e.g., 2D Burgers&#x27; equations, the
$\lambda$-$\omega$ and FitzHugh Nagumo reaction-diffusion equations), and
compared against the start-of-the-art baseline algorithms. The numerical
results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodology in the context
of solution accuracy, extrapolability and generalizability.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in the areas of multimodal machine learning and artificial
intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the
intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI.
Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or
two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center
of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered,
more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as
opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the
field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning
(EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation
problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a
taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison
of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments,
as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core
challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we
advocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers
real-world deployment.</span>

                                        <span>Explainable machine learning models primarily justify predicted labels using
either extractive rationales (i.e., subsets of input features) or free-text
natural language explanations (NLEs) as abstractive justifications. While NLEs
can be more comprehensive than extractive rationales, machine-generated NLEs
have been shown to sometimes lack commonsense knowledge. Here, we show that
commonsense knowledge can act as a bridge between extractive rationales and
NLEs, rendering both types of explanations better. More precisely, we introduce
a unified framework, called RExC (Rationale-Inspired Explanations with
Commonsense), that (1) extracts rationales as a set of features responsible for
machine predictions, (2) expands the extractive rationales using available
commonsense resources, and (3) uses the expanded knowledge to generate natural
language explanations. Our framework surpasses by a large margin the previous
state-of-the-art in generating NLEs across five tasks in both natural language
processing and vision-language understanding, with human annotators
consistently rating the explanations generated by RExC to be more
comprehensive, grounded in commonsense, and overall preferred compared to
previous state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our work shows that
commonsense-grounded explanations can enhance both task performance and
rationales extraction capabilities.</span>

                                        <span>Forming and interpreting abstraction is a core process in human
communication. In particular, when giving and performing complex instructions
stated in natural language (NL), people may naturally evoke abstract constructs
such as objects, loops, conditions and functions to convey their intentions in
an efficient and precise way. Yet, interpreting and grounding abstraction
stated in NL has not been systematically studied in NLP/AI. To elicit
naturally-occurring abstractions in NL we develop the Hexagons referential
game, where players describe increasingly complex images on a two-dimensional
Hexagons board, and other players need to follow these instructions to recreate
the images. Using this game we collected the Hexagons dataset, which consists
of 164 images and over 3000 naturally-occurring instructions, rich with diverse
abstractions. Results of our baseline models on an instruction-to-execution
task derived from the Hexagons dataset confirm that higher-level abstractions
in NL are indeed more challenging for current systems to process. Thus, this
dataset exposes a new and challenging dimension for grounded semantic parsing,
and we propose it for the community as a future benchmark to explore more
sophisticated and high-level communication within NLP applications.</span>

                                        <span>We present a novel multi-view training framework and CNN architecture for
combining information from multiple overlapping satellite images and noisy
training labels derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to semantically label
buildings and roads across large geographic regions (100 km$^2$). Our approach
to multi-view semantic segmentation yields a 4-7% improvement in the per-class
IoU scores compared to the traditional approaches that use the views
independently of one another. A unique (and, perhaps, surprising) property of
our system is that modifications that are added to the tail-end of the CNN for
learning from the multi-view data can be discarded at the time of inference
with a relatively small penalty in the overall performance. This implies that
the benefits of training using multiple views are absorbed by all the layers of
the network. Additionally, our approach only adds a small overhead in terms of
the GPU-memory consumption even when training with as many as 32 views per
scene. The system we present is end-to-end automated, which facilitates
comparing the classifiers trained directly on true orthophotos vis-a-vis first
training them on the off-nadir images and subsequently translating the
predicted labels to geographical coordinates. With no human supervision, our
IoU scores for the buildings and roads classes are 0.8 and 0.64 respectively
which are better than state-of-the-art approaches that use OSM labels and that
are not completely automated.</span>

                                        <span>Low-dose CT has been a key diagnostic imaging modality to reduce the
potential risk of radiation overdose to patient health. Despite recent
advances, CNN-based approaches typically apply filters in a spatially invariant
way and adopt similar pixel-level losses, which treat all regions of the CT
image equally and can be inefficient when fine-grained structures coexist with
non-uniformly distributed noises. To address this issue, we propose a
Structure-preserving Kernel Prediction Network (StructKPN) that combines the
kernel prediction network with a structure-aware loss function that utilizes
the pixel gradient statistics and guides the model towards spatially-variant
filters that enhance noise removal, prevent over-smoothing and preserve
detailed structures for different regions in CT imaging. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach achieved superior performance on both synthetic
and non-synthetic datasets, and better preserves structures that are highly
desired in clinical screening and low-dose protocol optimization.</span>

labeled input data, but DNNs sometimes fail to generalize to test data sampled
from different input distributions. Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA)
proves useful when no input labels are available, and distribution shifts are
observed in the target domain (TD). Experiments are performed on seismic images
of the F3 block 3D dataset from offshore Netherlands (source domain; SD) and
Penobscot 3D survey data from Canada (target domain; TD). Three geological
classes from SD and TD that have similar reflection patterns are considered. In
the present study, an improved deep neural network architecture named
EarthAdaptNet (EAN) is proposed to semantically segment the seismic images. We
specifically use a transposed residual unit to replace the traditional dilated
convolution in the decoder block. The EAN achieved a pixel-level accuracy &gt;84%
and an accuracy of ~70% for the minority classes, showing improved performance
compared to existing architectures. In addition, we introduced the CORAL
(Correlation Alignment) method to the EAN to create an unsupervised deep domain
adaptation network (EAN-DDA) for the classification of seismic reflections
fromF3 and Penobscot. Maximum class accuracy achieved was ~99% for class 2 of
Penobscot with &gt;50% overall accuracy. Taken together, EAN-DDA has the potential
to classify target domain seismic facies classes with high accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Attention mechanism has shown enormous potential for single image
super-resolution (SISR). However, existing works only proposed some attention
mechanism for a specific network. A universal attention mechanism for SISR,
which could further improve the performance of networks without attention and
provide a baseline for networks with attention, is still lacking. To fit this
gap, we propose a lightweight and efficient Balanced Attention Mechanism (BAM),
which consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and Maxpool Spatial
Attention Module (MSAM) in parallel. The information extraction mechanism of
ACAM and MSAM effectively filters redundant information, making the overall
structure of BAM very lightweight. Owing to the parallel structure, during the
gradient backpropagation process of BAM, ACAM and MSAM not only conduct
self-optimization, but also mutual optimization so as to generate more balanced
attention information. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we
applied it to 12 state-ofthe-art SISR networks. The results on 4 benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BAM can efficiently improve the networks&#x27;
performance, and for those with attention, the substitution with BAM further
reduces the amount of parameters and increase the inference speed. Moreover,
ablation experiments were conducted to prove the minimalism of BAM.</span>

dependencies. However, so far it has not been deployed in invertible networks.
This is due to the fact that in order to make a network invertible, every
component within the network needs to be a bijective transformation, but a
normal attention block is not. In this paper, we propose invertible attention
that can be plugged into existing invertible models. We mathematically and
experimentally prove that the invertibility of an attention model can be
achieved by carefully constraining its Lipschitz constant. We validate the
invertibility of our invertible attention on image reconstruction task with 3
popular datasets: CIFAR-10, SVHN, and CelebA. We also show that our invertible
attention achieves similar performance in comparison with normal non-invertible
attention on dense prediction tasks. The code is available at

                                        <span>Rotated object detection is a challenging issue of computer vision field.
Loss of spatial information and confusion of parametric order have been the
bottleneck for rotated detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose an
orientation-sensitive keypoint based rotated detector OSKDet. We adopt a set of
keypoints to characterize the target and predict the keypoint heatmap on ROI to
form a rotated target. By proposing the orientation-sensitive heatmap, OSKDet
could learn the shape and direction of rotated target implicitly and has
stronger modeling capabilities for target representation, which improves the
localization accuracy and acquires high quality detection results. To extract
highly effective features at border areas, we design a rotation-aware
deformable convolution module. Furthermore, we explore a new keypoint reorder
algorithm and feature fusion module based on the angle distribution to
eliminate the confusion of keypoint order. Experimental results on several
public benchmarks show the state-of-the-art performance of OSKDet.
Specifically, we achieve an AP of 77.81% on DOTA, 89.91% on HRSC2016, and
97.18% on UCAS-AOD, respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Automatically generating radiology reports can improve current clinical
practice in diagnostic radiology. On one hand, it can relieve radiologists from
the heavy burden of report writing; On the other hand, it can remind
radiologists of abnormalities and avoid the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.
Yet, this task remains a challenging job for data-driven neural networks, due
to the serious visual and textual data biases. To this end, we propose a
Posterior-and-Prior Knowledge Exploring-and-Distilling approach (PPKED) to
imitate the working patterns of radiologists, who will first examine the
abnormal regions and assign the disease topic tags to the abnormal regions, and
then rely on the years of prior medical knowledge and prior working experience
accumulations to write reports. Thus, the PPKED includes three modules:
Posterior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE), Prior Knowledge Explorer (PrKE) and
Multi-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD). In detail, PoKE explores the posterior
knowledge, which provides explicit abnormal visual regions to alleviate visual
data bias; PrKE explores the prior knowledge from the prior medical knowledge
graph (medical knowledge) and prior radiology reports (working experience) to
alleviate textual data bias. The explored knowledge is distilled by the MKD to
generate the final reports. Evaluated on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets, our
method is able to outperform previous state-of-the-art models on these two
datasets.</span>

                                        <span>We present a learning-based method for building driving-signal aware
full-body avatars. Our model is a conditional variational autoencoder that can
be animated with incomplete driving signals, such as human pose and facial
keypoints, and produces a high-quality representation of human geometry and
view-dependent appearance. The core intuition behind our method is that better
drivability and generalization can be achieved by disentangling the driving
signals and remaining generative factors, which are not available during
animation. To this end, we explicitly account for information deficiency in the
driving signal by introducing a latent space that exclusively captures the
remaining information, thus enabling the imputation of the missing factors
required during full-body animation, while remaining faithful to the driving
signal. We also propose a learnable localized compression for the driving
signal which promotes better generalization, and helps minimize the influence
of global chance-correlations often found in real datasets. For a given driving
signal, the resulting variational model produces a compact space of uncertainty
for missing factors that allows for an imputation strategy best suited to a
particular application. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the
challenging problem of full-body animation for virtual telepresence with
driving signals acquired from minimal sensors placed in the environment and
mounted on a VR-headset.</span>

                                        <span>The transformer networks are particularly good at modeling long-range
dependencies within a long sequence. In this paper, we conduct research on
applying the transformer networks for salient object detection (SOD). We adopt
the dense transformer backbone for fully supervised RGB image based SOD, RGB-D
image pair based SOD, and weakly supervised SOD within a unified framework
based on the observation that the transformer backbone can provide accurate
structure modeling, which makes it powerful in learning from weak labels with
less structure information. Further, we find that the vision transformer
architectures do not offer direct spatial supervision, instead encoding
position as a feature. Therefore, we investigate the contributions of two
strategies to provide stronger spatial supervision through the transformer
layers within our unified framework, namely deep supervision and
difficulty-aware learning. We find that deep supervision can get gradients back
into the higher level features, thus leads to uniform activation within the
same semantic object. Difficulty-aware learning on the other hand is capable of
identifying the hard pixels for effective hard negative mining. We also
visualize features of conventional backbone and transformer backbone before and
after fine-tuning them for SOD, and find that transformer backbone encodes more
accurate object structure information and more distinct semantic information
within the lower and higher level features respectively. We also apply our
model to camouflaged object detection (COD) and achieve similar observations as
the above three SOD tasks. Extensive experimental results on various SOD and
COD tasks illustrate that transformer networks can transform SOD and COD,
leading to new benchmarks for each related task. The source code and
experimental results are available via our project page:

engineering along with the API recommendation systems and relevant libraries to
be used. In this context, the existing tools like SentiCR, SentiStrength-SE,
etc. exhibited low f1-scores that completely defeats the purpose of deployment
of such strategies, thereby there is enough scope for performance improvement.
Recent advancements show that transformer based pre-trained models (e.g., BERT,
RoBERTa, ALBERT, etc.) have displayed better results in the text classification
task. Following this context, the present research explores different
BERT-based models to analyze the sentences in GitHub comments, Jira comments,

analyse BERT based model for sentiment analysis, where in the first strategy
the BERT based pre-trained models are fine-tuned; in the second strategy an
ensemble model is developed from BERT variants, and in the third strategy a
compressed model (Distil BERT) is used. The experimental results show that the

                                        <span>The costly process of obtaining semantic segmentation labels has driven
research towards weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods, using
only image-level, point, or box labels. The lack of dense scene representation
requires methods to increase complexity to obtain additional semantic
information about the scene, often done through multiple stages of training and
refinement. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models leverage image-level labels
to produce class activation maps (CAMs) which go through multiple stages of
refinement before they are thresholded to make pseudo-masks for supervision.
The multi-stage approach is computationally expensive, and dependency on
image-level labels for CAMs generation lacks generalizability to more complex
scenes. In contrary, our method offers a single-stage approach generalizable to
arbitrary dataset, that is trainable from scratch, without any dependency on
pre-trained backbones, classification, or separate refinement tasks. We utilize
point annotations to generate reliable, on-the-fly pseudo-masks through refined
and filtered features. While our method requires point annotations that are
only slightly more expensive than image-level annotations, we are to
demonstrate SOTA performance on benchmark datasets (PascalVOC 2012), as well as
significantly outperform other SOTA WSSS methods on recent real-world datasets

                                        <span>Channel Pruning has been long studied to compress CNNs for efficient image
classification. Prior works implement channel pruning in an unexplainable
manner, which tends to reduce the final classification errors while failing to
consider the internal influence of each channel. In this paper, we conduct
channel pruning in a white box. Through deep visualization of feature maps
activated by different channels, we observe that different channels have a
varying contribution to different categories in image classification. Inspired
by this, we choose to preserve channels contributing to most categories.
Specifically, to model the contribution of each channel to differentiating
categories, we develop a class-wise mask for each channel, implemented in a
dynamic training manner w.r.t. the input image&#x27;s category. On the basis of the
learned class-wise mask, we perform a global voting mechanism to remove
channels with less category discrimination. Lastly, a fine-tuning process is
conducted to recover the performance of the pruned model. To our best
knowledge, it is the first time that CNN interpretability theory is considered
to guide channel pruning. Extensive experiments on representative image
classification tasks demonstrate the superiority of our White-Box over many
state-of-the-arts. For instance, on CIFAR-10, it reduces 65.23% FLOPs with even
0.62% accuracy improvement for ResNet-110. On ILSVRC-2012, White-Box achieves a
45.6% FLOPs reduction with only a small loss of 0.83% in the top-1 accuracy for
ResNet-50.</span>

                                        <span>The rapid progress in 3D scene understanding has come with growing demand for
data; however, collecting and annotating 3D scenes (e.g. point clouds) are
notoriously hard. For example, the number of scenes (e.g. indoor rooms) that
can be accessed and scanned might be limited; even given sufficient data,
acquiring 3D labels (e.g. instance masks) requires intensive human labor. In
this paper, we explore data-efficient learning for 3D point cloud. As a first
step towards this direction, we propose Contrastive Scene Contexts, a 3D
pre-training method that makes use of both point-level correspondences and
spatial contexts in a scene. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on a
suite of benchmarks where training data or labels are scarce. Our study reveals
that exhaustive labelling of 3D point clouds might be unnecessary; and
remarkably, on ScanNet, even using 0.1% of point labels, we still achieve 89%
(instance segmentation) and 96% (semantic segmentation) of the baseline
performance that uses full annotations.</span>

DJI Mavic Pro quadcopters, after Hurricane Harvey. The dataset presents a
unique challenge of advancing the damage assessment process for post-disaster
scenarios using unlabeled and limited labeled dataset. We propose a solution to
address their classification and semantic segmentation challenge. We approach
this problem by generating pseudo labels for both classification and
segmentation during training and slowly incrementing the amount by which the
pseudo label loss affects the final loss. Using this semi-supervised method of
training helped us improve our baseline supervised loss by a huge margin for
classification, allowing the model to generalize and perform better on the
validation and test splits of the dataset. In this paper, we compare and
contrast the various methods and models for image classification and semantic
segmentation on the FloodNet dataset.</span>

supervised pre-trained for transfer learning. By synthesizing annotations on
pretext tasks, self-supervision allows to pre-train models on large amounts of
pseudo-labels before fine-tuning them on the target task. In this work, we
assess self-supervision for the diagnosis of skin lesions, comparing three
self-supervised pipelines to a challenging supervised baseline, on five test

self-supervision is competitive both in improving accuracies and in reducing
the variability of outcomes. Self-supervision proves particularly useful for
low training data scenarios ($&lt;1\,500$ and $&lt;150$ samples), where its ability
to stabilize the outcomes is essential to provide sound results.</span>

assessment (IQA), held in conjunction with the New Trends in Image Restoration
and Enhancement workshop (NTIRE) workshop at CVPR 2021. As a new type of image
processing technology, perceptual image processing algorithms based on
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have produced images with more realistic
textures. These output images have completely different characteristics from
traditional distortions, thus pose a new challenge for IQA methods to evaluate
their visual quality. In comparison with previous IQA challenges, the training
and testing datasets in this challenge include the outputs of perceptual image
processing algorithms and the corresponding subjective scores. Thus they can be
used to develop and evaluate IQA methods on GAN-based distortions. The
challenge has 270 registered participants in total. In the final testing stage,
13 participating teams submitted their models and fact sheets. Almost all of
them have achieved much better results than existing IQA methods, while the
winning method can demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.</span>

and Chinese offline handwritten text line images. As far as we know, it is the
first approach that adopts the RNN-Transducer model for offline handwritten
text recognition. The proposed model consists of three main components: a
visual feature encoder that extracts visual features from an input image by CNN
and then encodes the visual features by BLSTM; a linguistic context encoder
that extracts and encodes linguistic features from the input image by embedded
layers and LSTM; and a joint decoder that combines and then decodes the visual
features and the linguistic features into the final label sequence by fully
connected and softmax layers. The proposed model takes advantage of both visual
and linguistic information from the input image. In the experiments, we
evaluated the performance of the proposed model on the two datasets: Kuzushiji
and SCUT-EPT. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on all datasets.</span>

                                        <span>A table arranging data in rows and columns is a very effective data
structure, which has been widely used in business and scientific research.
Considering large-scale tabular data in online and offline documents, automatic
table recognition has attracted increasing attention from the document analysis
community. Though human can easily understand the structure of tables, it
remains a challenge for machines to understand that, especially due to a
variety of different table layouts and styles. Existing methods usually model a
table as either the markup sequence or the adjacency matrix between different
table cells, failing to address the importance of the logical location of table
cells, e.g., a cell is located in the first row and the second column of the
table. In this paper, we reformulate the problem of table structure recognition
as the table graph reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end trainable table
graph reconstruction network (TGRNet) for table structure recognition.
Specifically, the proposed method has two main branches, a cell detection
branch and a cell logical location branch, to jointly predict the spatial
location and the logical location of different cells. Experimental results on
three popular table recognition datasets and a new dataset with table graph
annotations (TableGraph-350K) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
TGRNet for table structure recognition. Code and annotations will be made
publicly available.</span>

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) task. In this work, we present Multi-Modal
Mutual Enhancement Module (M3EM), a deep module for jointly considering
information from multiple modalities to find the most transferable
representations across domains. We achieve this by implementing two sub-modules
for enhancing each modality using the context of other modalities. The first
sub-module exchanges information across modalities through the semantic space,
while the second sub-module finds the most transferable spatial region based on
the consensus of all modalities.</span>

system, which is used to perceive the surrounding world. While making a
prediction, the human brain tends to relate crucial cues from multiple sources
of information. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal fusion module that
learns to emphasize more contributive features across all modalities.
Specifically, the proposed Multimodal Split Attention Fusion (MSAF) module
splits each modality into channel-wise equal feature blocks and creates a joint
representation that is used to generate soft attention for each channel across
the feature blocks. Further, the MSAF module is designed to be compatible with
features of various spatial dimensions and sequence lengths, suitable for both
CNNs and RNNs. Thus, MSAF can be easily added to fuse features of any unimodal
networks and utilize existing pretrained unimodal model weights. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of our fusion module, we design three multimodal networks
with MSAF for emotion recognition, sentiment analysis, and action recognition
tasks. Our approach achieves competitive results in each task and outperforms
other application-specific networks and multimodal fusion benchmarks.</span>

the power loads&#x27; appliance-by-appliance from the whole consumption measured by
a single meter. In this paper, we propose a conditional density estimation
model, based on deep neural networks, that joins a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder with a Conditional Invertible Normalizing Flow model to estimate
the individual appliance&#x27;s power demand. The resulting model is called Prior
Flow Variational Autoencoder or, for simplicity PFVAE. Thus, instead of having
one model per appliance, the resulting model is responsible for estimating the
power demand, appliance-by-appliance, at once. We train and evaluate our
proposed model in a publicly available dataset composed of power demand
measures from a poultry feed factory located in Brazil. The proposed model&#x27;s
quality is evaluated by comparing the obtained normalized disaggregation error
(NDE) and signal aggregated error (SAE) with the previous work values on the

the eight machines belonging to the dataset, we observe consistent improvements

(DR), a frequent complication of diabetes that can lead to visual impairment
and blindness. Adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) provides
real-time retinal images with resolution down to 2 $\mu m$ and thus allows
detection of the morphologies of individual MAs, a potential marker that might
dictate MA pathology and affect the progression of DR. In contrast to the
numerous automatic models developed for assessing the number of MAs on fundus
photographs, currently there is no high throughput image protocol available for
automatic analysis of AOSLO photographs. To address this urgency, we introduce
AOSLO-net, a deep neural network framework with customized training policies to
automatically segment MAs from AOSLO images. We evaluate the performance of
AOSLO-net using 87 DR AOSLO images and our results demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation model both in
accuracy and cost and enables correct MA morphological classification.</span>

                                        <span>Transformer, which can benefit from global (long-range) information modeling
using self-attention mechanisms, has been successful in natural language
processing and 2D image classification recently. However, both local and global
features are crucial for dense prediction tasks, especially for 3D medical
image segmentation. In this paper, we for the first time exploit Transformer in
3D CNN for MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation and propose a novel network named
TransBTS based on the encoder-decoder structure. To capture the local 3D
context information, the encoder first utilizes 3D CNN to extract the
volumetric spatial feature maps. Meanwhile, the feature maps are reformed
elaborately for tokens that are fed into Transformer for global feature
modeling. The decoder leverages the features embedded by Transformer and
performs progressive upsampling to predict the detailed segmentation map.
Extensive experimental results on both BraTS 2019 and 2020 datasets show that
TransBTS achieves comparable or higher results than previous state-of-the-art
3D methods for brain tumor segmentation on 3D MRI scans. The source code is

                                        <span>Machine learning analysis of longitudinal neuroimaging data is typically
based on supervised learning, which requires a large number of ground-truth
labels to be informative. As ground-truth labels are often missing or expensive
to obtain in neuroscience, we avoid them in our analysis by combing factor
disentanglement with self-supervised learning to identify changes and
consistencies across the multiple MRIs acquired of each individual over time.
Specifically, we propose a new definition of disentanglement by formulating a
multivariate mapping between factors (e.g., brain age) associated with an MRI
and a latent image representation. Then, factors that evolve across
acquisitions of longitudinal sequences are disentangled from that mapping by
self-supervised learning in such a way that changes in a single factor induce
change along one direction in the representation space. We implement this
model, named Longitudinal Self-Supervised Learning (LSSL), via a standard
autoencoding structure with a cosine loss to disentangle brain age from the
image representation. We apply LSSL to two longitudinal neuroimaging studies to
highlight its strength in extracting the brain-age information from MRI and
revealing informative characteristics associated with neurodegenerative and
neuropsychological disorders. Moreover, the representations learned by LSSL
facilitate supervised classification by recording faster convergence and higher
(or similar) prediction accuracy compared to several other representation
learning techniques.</span>

                                        <span>In most existing learning systems, images are typically viewed as 2D pixel
arrays. However, in another paradigm gaining popularity, a 2D image is
represented as an implicit neural representation (INR) - an MLP that predicts
an RGB pixel value given its (x,y) coordinate. In this paper, we propose two
novel architectural techniques for building INR-based image decoders:
factorized multiplicative modulation and multi-scale INRs, and use them to
build a state-of-the-art continuous image GAN. Previous attempts to adapt INRs
for image generation were limited to MNIST-like datasets and do not scale to
complex real-world data. Our proposed INR-GAN architecture improves the
performance of continuous image generators by several times, greatly reducing
the gap between continuous image GANs and pixel-based ones. Apart from that, we
explore several exciting properties of the INR-based decoders, like
out-of-the-box superresolution, meaningful image-space interpolation,
accelerated inference of low-resolution images, an ability to extrapolate
outside of image boundaries, and strong geometric prior. The project page is

                                        <span>There are many real-life use cases such as barcode scanning or billboard
reading where people need to detect objects and read the object contents.
Commonly existing methods are first trying to localize object regions, then
determine layout and lastly classify content units. However, for simple fixed
structured objects like license plates, this approach becomes overkill and
lengthy to run. This work aims to solve this detect-and-read problem in a
lightweight way by integrating multi-digit recognition into a one-stage object
detection model. Our unified method not only eliminates the duplication in
feature extraction (one for localizing, one again for classifying) but also
provides useful contextual information around object regions for
classification. Additionally, our choice of backbones and modifications in
architecture, loss function, data augmentation and training make the method
robust, efficient and speedy. Secondly, we made a public benchmark dataset of
diverse real-life 1D barcodes for a reliable evaluation, which we collected,
annotated and checked carefully. Eventually, experimental results prove the
method&#x27;s efficiency on the barcode problem by outperforming industrial tools in
both detecting and decoding rates with a real-time fps at a VGA-similar
resolution. It also did a great job expectedly on the license-plate recognition
task (on the AOLP dataset) by outperforming the current state-of-the-art method
significantly in terms of recognition rate and inference time.</span>

                                        <span>Object recognition in the real-world requires handling long-tailed or even
open-ended data. An ideal visual system needs to recognize the populated head
visual concepts reliably and meanwhile efficiently learn about emerging new
tail categories with a few training instances. Class-balanced many-shot
learning and few-shot learning tackle one side of this problem, by either
learning strong classifiers for head or learning to learn few-shot classifiers
for the tail. In this paper, we investigate the problem of generalized few-shot
learning (GFSL) -- a model during the deployment is required to learn about
tail categories with few shots and simultaneously classify the head classes. We
propose the ClAssifier SynThesis LEarning (CASTLE), a learning framework that
learns how to synthesize calibrated few-shot classifiers in addition to the
multi-class classifiers of head classes with a shared neural dictionary,
shedding light upon the inductive GFSL. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive
version of CASTLE (ACASTLE) that adapts the head classifiers conditioned on the
incoming tail training examples, yielding a framework that allows effective
backward knowledge transfer. As a consequence, ACASTLE can handle GFSL with
classes from heterogeneous domains effectively. CASTLE and ACASTLE demonstrate
superior performances than existing GFSL algorithms and strong baselines on
MiniImageNet as well as TieredImageNet datasets. More interestingly, they
outperform previous state-of-the-art methods when evaluated with standard
few-shot learning criteria.</span>

                                        <span>Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a classification task that points to
face variants. Hence, there are certain affinity features between facial
expressions, receiving little attention in the FER literature. Convolution
padding, despite helping capture the edge information, causes erosion of the
feature map simultaneously. After multi-layer filling convolution, the output
feature map named albino feature definitely weakens the representation of the
expression. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel architecture named
Amending Representation Module (ARM). ARM is a substitute for the pooling
layer. Theoretically, it can be embedded in the back end of any network to deal
with the Padding Erosion. ARM efficiently enhances facial expression
representation from two different directions: 1) reducing the weight of eroded
features to offset the side effect of padding, and 2) sharing affinity features
over mini-batch to strengthen the representation learning. Experiments on
public benchmarks prove that our ARM boosts the performance of FER remarkably.
The validation accuracies are respectively 92.05% on RAF-DB, 65.2% on
Affect-Net, and 58.71% on SFEW, exceeding current state-of-the-art methods. Our
implementation and trained models are available at

                                        <span>Indoor panorama typically consists of human-made structures parallel or
perpendicular to gravity. We leverage this phenomenon to approximate the scene
in a 360-degree image with (H)orizontal-planes and (V)ertical-planes. To this
end, we propose an effective divide-and-conquer strategy that divides pixels
based on their plane orientation estimation; then, the succeeding instance
segmentation module conquers the task of planes clustering more easily in each
plane orientation group. Besides, parameters of V-planes depend on camera yaw
rotation, but translation-invariant CNNs are less aware of the yaw change. We
thus propose a yaw-invariant V-planar reparameterization for CNNs to learn. We
create a benchmark for indoor panorama planar reconstruction by extending
existing 360 depth datasets with ground truth H\&amp;V-planes (referred to as
PanoH&amp;V dataset) and adopt state-of-the-art planar reconstruction methods to
predict H\&amp;V-planes as our baselines. Our method outperforms the baselines by a

fixed mapping rules between inputs and outputs, thereby limiting their
application in more complex and dynamic situations in which the mapping rules
are not kept the same but changing according to different contexts. To lift
such limits, we developed a novel approach involving a learning algorithm,
called orthogonal weights modification (OWM), with the addition of a
context-dependent processing (CDP) module. We demonstrated that with OWM to
overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting, and the CDP module to learn
how to reuse a feature representation and a classifier for different contexts,
a single network can acquire numerous context-dependent mapping rules in an
online and continual manner, with as few as $\sim$10 samples to learn each.
This should enable highly compact systems to gradually learn myriad
regularities of the real world and eventually behave appropriately within it.</span>

their gripper and tactile sensing is often necessary in tasks that involve
contact-rich motion. In this work, we leverage surprise from mismatches in
touch feedback to guide exploration in hard sparse-reward reinforcement
learning tasks. Our approach, Touch-based Curiosity (ToC), learns what visible
objects interactions are supposed to &quot;feel&quot; like. We encourage exploration by
rewarding interactions where the expectation and the experience don&#x27;t match. In
our proposed method, an initial task-independent exploration phase is followed
by an on-task learning phase, in which the original interactions are relabeled
with on-task rewards. We test our approach on a range of touch-intensive robot
arm tasks (e.g. pushing objects, opening doors), which we also release as part
of this work. Across multiple experiments in a simulated setting, we
demonstrate that our method is able to learn these difficult tasks through
sparse reward and curiosity alone. We compare our cross-modal approach to
single-modality (touch- or vision-only) approaches as well as other

datasets, which make it hard to identify durable and generalizable scientific

classification with a new large-scale training and testing dataset, SF300,
including both vertical and oblique aerial images and made available to the
research community, and an associated fine-tuning method. We additionally
propose a new adversarial fine-tuning method for global descriptors. We show

                                        <span>Image registration has been widely studied over the past several decades,
with numerous applications in science, engineering and medicine. Most of the
conventional mathematical models for large deformation image registration rely
on prescribed landmarks, which usually require tedious manual labeling and are
prone to error. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in the use
of machine learning for image registration. In this paper, we develop a novel
method for large deformation image registration by a fusion of quasiconformal
theory and convolutional neural network (CNN). More specifically, we propose a
quasiconformal energy model with a novel fidelity term that incorporates the
features extracted using a pre-trained CNN, thereby allowing us to obtain
meaningful registration results without any guidance of prescribed landmarks.
Moreover, unlike many prior image registration methods, the bijectivity of our
method is guaranteed by quasiconformal theory. Experimental results are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. More
broadly, our work sheds light on how rigorous mathematical theories and
practical machine learning approaches can be integrated for developing
computational methods with improved performance.</span>

approach for pixel-wise image segmentation. In this work, we tackle two defects
that hinder their deployment in real-world applications: 1) Predictions lack
uncertainty quantification that may be crucial to many decision-making systems;
2) Large memory storage and computational consumption demanding extensive
hardware resources. To address these issues and improve their practicality we
demonstrate a few-parameter compact Bayesian convolutional architecture, that
achieves a marginal improvement in accuracy in comparison to related work using
significantly fewer parameters and compute operations. The architecture
combines parameter-efficient operations such as separable convolutions,
bilinear interpolation, multi-scale feature propagation and Bayesian inference
for per-pixel uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo Dropout. The best
performing configurations required fewer than 2.5 million parameters on diverse

proprocessed using segmentation techniques to filter out images of closed lung,

select one or multiple sets of a fixed number of slice images for training and
validation. A 3D CNN network with BERT is used to classify this set of selected
slice images. In this network, an embedding feature is also extracted. In cases
where there are more than one set of slice images in a volume, the features of
all sets are extracted and pooled into a global feature vector for the whole
CT-scan volume. A simple multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) network is used to
further classify the aggregated feature vector. The models are trained and
evaluated on the provided training and validation datasets. On the validation

since these might lead to biased performances, threatens the user&#x27;s privacy, or
are valuable for commercial aspects. Current face databases are specifically
constructed for the development of face recognition applications. Consequently,
these databases contain large amount of face images but lack in the number of
attribute annotations and the overall annotation correctness. In this work, we
propose MAADFace, a new face annotations database that is characterized by the
large number of its high-quality attribute annotations. MAADFace is build on
the VGGFace2 database and thus, consists of 3.3M faces of over 9k individuals.
Using a novel annotation transfer-pipeline that allows an accurate
label-transfer from multiple source-datasets to a target-dataset, MAAD-Face
consists of 123.9M attribute annotations of 47 different binary attributes.
Consequently, it provides 15 and 137 times more attribute labels than CelebA
and LFW. Our investigation on the annotation quality by three human evaluators
demonstrated the superiority of the MAAD-Face annotations over existing
databases. Additionally, we make use of the large amount of high-quality
annotations from MAAD-Face to study the viability of soft-biometrics for
recognition, providing insights about which attributes support genuine and
imposter decisions. The MAAD-Face annotations dataset is publicly available.</span>

                                        <span>Semantic segmentation has made tremendous progress in recent years. However,
satisfying performance highly depends on a large number of pixel-level
annotations. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the semi-supervised
segmentation problem where only a small set of labeled data is provided with a
much larger collection of totally unlabeled images. Nevertheless, due to the
limited annotations, models may overly rely on the contexts available in the
training data, which causes poor generalization to the scenes unseen before. A
preferred high-level representation should capture the contextual information
while not losing self-awareness. Therefore, we propose to maintain the
context-aware consistency between features of the same identity but with
different contexts, making the representations robust to the varying
environments. Moreover, we present the Directional Contrastive Loss (DC Loss)
to accomplish the consistency in a pixel-to-pixel manner, only requiring the
feature with lower quality to be aligned towards its counterpart. In addition,
to avoid the false-negative samples and filter the uncertain positive samples,
we put forward two sampling strategies. Extensive experiments show that our
simple yet effective method surpasses current state-of-the-art methods by a
large margin and also generalizes well with extra image-level annotations.</span>

political discussion and decision-making for many years. Shallow clouds play a
significant role in understanding the Earth&#x27;s climate, but they are challenging
to interpret and represent in a climate model. By classifying these cloud
structures, there is a better possibility of understanding the physical
structures of the clouds, which would improve the climate model generation,
resulting in a better prediction of climate change or forecasting weather
update. Clouds organise in many forms, which makes it challenging to build
traditional rule-based algorithms to separate cloud features. In this paper,
classification of cloud organization patterns was performed using a new
scaled-up version of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named as EfficientNet
as the encoder and UNet as decoder where they worked as feature extractor and
reconstructor of fine grained feature map and was used as a classifier, which
will help experts to understand how clouds will shape the future climate. By
using a segmentation model in a classification task, it was shown that with a
good encoder alongside UNet, it is possible to obtain good performance from
this dataset. Dice coefficient has been used for the final evaluation metric,

                                        <span>Accelerating multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a new and
effective solution for fast MR imaging, providing superior performance in
restoring the target modality from its undersampled counterpart with guidance
from an auxiliary modality. However, existing works simply introduce the
auxiliary modality as prior information, lacking in-depth investigations on the
potential mechanisms for fusing two modalities. Further, they usually rely on
the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which focus on local information and
prevent them from fully capturing the long-distance dependencies of global
knowledge. To this end, we propose a multi-modal transformer (MTrans), which is
capable of transferring multi-scale features from the target modality to the
auxiliary modality, for accelerated MR imaging. By restructuring the
transformer architecture, our MTrans gains a powerful ability to capture deep
multi-modal information. More specifically, the target modality and the
auxiliary modality are first split into two branches and then fused using a
multi-modal transformer module. This module is based on an improved multi-head
attention mechanism, named the cross attention module, which absorbs features
from the auxiliary modality that contribute to the target modality. Our
framework provides two appealing benefits: (i) MTrans is the first attempt at
using improved transformers for multi-modal MR imaging, affording more global
information compared with CNN-based methods. (ii) A new cross attention module
is proposed to exploit the useful information in each branch at different
scales. It affords both distinct structural information and subtle pixel-level
information, which supplement the target modality effectively.</span>

                                        <span>Increasing demands for understanding the internal behavior of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have led to remarkable improvements in explanation
methods. Particularly, several class activation mapping (CAM) based methods,
which generate visual explanation maps by a linear combination of activation
maps from CNNs, have been proposed. However, the majority of the methods lack a
clear theoretical basis on how they assign the coefficients of the linear
combination. In this paper, we revisit the intrinsic linearity of CAM with
respect to the activation maps; we construct an explanation model of CNN as a
linear function of binary variables that denote the existence of the
corresponding activation maps. With this approach, the explanation model can be
determined by additive feature attribution methods in an analytic manner. We
then demonstrate the adequacy of SHAP values, which is a unique solution for
the explanation model with a set of desirable properties, as the coefficients
of CAM. Since the exact SHAP values are unattainable, we introduce an efficient
approximation method, LIFT-CAM, based on DeepLIFT. Our proposed LIFT-CAM can
estimate the SHAP values of the activation maps with high speed and accuracy.
Furthermore, it greatly outperforms other previous CAM-based methods in both
qualitative and quantitative aspects.</span>

                                        <span>Image-based 3D object modeling refers to the process of converting raw
optical images to 3D digital representations of the objects. Very often, such
models are desired to be dimensionally true, semantically labeled with
photorealistic appearance (reality-based modeling). Laser scanning was deemed
as the standard (and direct) way to obtaining highly accurate 3D measurements
of objects, while one would have to abide the high acquisition cost and its
unavailability on some of the platforms. Nowadays the image-based methods
backboned by the recently developed advanced dense image matching algorithms
and geo-referencing paradigms, are becoming the dominant approaches, due to its
high flexibility, availability and low cost. The largely automated geometric
processing of images in a 3D object reconstruction workflow, from
ordered/unordered raw imagery to textured meshes, is becoming a critical part
of the reality-based 3D modeling. This article summarizes the overall geometric
processing workflow, with focuses on introducing the state-of-the-art methods
of three major components of geometric processing: 1) geo-referencing; 2) Image
dense matching 3) texture mapping. Finally, we will draw conclusions and share
our outlooks of the topics discussed in this article.</span>

                                        <span>Instance segmentation of images is an important tool for automated scene
understanding. Neural networks are usually trained to optimize their overall
performance in terms of accuracy. Meanwhile, in applications such as automated
driving, an overlooked pedestrian seems more harmful than a falsely detected
one. In this work, we present a false negative detection method for image
sequences based on inconsistencies in time series of tracked instances given
the availability of image sequences in online applications. As the number of
instances can be greatly increased by this algorithm, we apply a false positive
pruning using uncertainty estimates aggregated over instances. To this end,
instance-wise metrics are constructed which characterize uncertainty and
geometry of a given instance or are predicated on depth estimation. The
proposed method serves as a post-processing step applicable to any neural
network that can also be trained on single frames only. In our tests, we obtain
an improved trade-off between false negative and false positive instances by
our fused detection approach in comparison to the use of an ordinary score
value provided by the instance segmentation network during inference.</span>

                                        <span>With recent advances in deep learning, neuroimaging studies increasingly rely
on convolutional networks (ConvNets) to predict diagnosis based on MR images.
To gain a better understanding of how a disease impacts the brain, the studies
visualize the salience maps of the ConvNet highlighting voxels within the brain
majorly contributing to the prediction. However, these salience maps are
generally confounded, i.e., some salient regions are more predictive of
confounding variables (such as age) than the diagnosis. To avoid such
misinterpretation, we propose in this paper an approach that aims to visualize
confounder-free saliency maps that only highlight voxels predictive of the
diagnosis. The approach incorporates univariate statistical tests to identify
confounding effects within the intermediate features learned by ConvNet. The
influence from the subset of confounded features is then removed by a novel
partial back-propagation procedure. We use this two-step approach to visualize
confounder-free saliency maps extracted from synthetic and two real datasets.
These experiments reveal the potential of our visualization in producing
unbiased model-interpretation.</span>

activities for decades. However, most of traditional decoders require
well-founded barcode under a relatively standard condition. While wilder
conditioned barcodes such as underexposed, occluded, blurry, wrinkled and
rotated are commonly captured in reality, those traditional decoders show
weakness of recognizing. Several works attempted to solve those challenging
barcodes, but many limitations still exist. This work aims to solve the
decoding problem using deep convolutional neural network with the possibility
of running on portable devices. Firstly, we proposed a special modification of
inference based on the feature of having checksum and test-time augmentation,
named as Smart Inference (SI) in prediction phase of a trained model. SI
considerably boosts accuracy and reduces the false prediction for trained
models. Secondly, we have created a large practical evaluation dataset of real
captured 1D barcode under various challenging conditions to test our methods
vigorously, which is publicly available for other researchers. The experiments&#x27;
results demonstrated the SI effectiveness with the highest accuracy of 95.85%
which outperformed many existing decoders on the evaluation set. Finally, we
successfully minimized the best model by knowledge distillation to a shallow
model which is shown to have high accuracy (90.85%) with good inference speed
of 34.2 ms per image on a real edge device.</span>

desired visual multimedia. In particular, image generation using deep learning
has been extensively studied across diverse fields. In comparison, video
generation, especially on conditional inputs, remains a challenging and less
explored area. To narrow this gap, we aim to train our model to produce a video
corresponding to a given text description. We propose a novel training
framework, Text-to-Image-to-Video Generative Adversarial Network (TiVGAN),
which evolves frame-by-frame and finally produces a full-length video. In the
first phase, we focus on creating a high-quality single video frame while
learning the relationship between the text and an image. As the steps proceed,
our model is trained gradually on more number of consecutive frames.This
step-by-step learning process helps stabilize the training and enables the
creation of high-resolution video based on conditional text descriptions.

                                        <span>Discriminating small moving objects within complex visual environments is a
significant challenge for autonomous micro robots that are generally limited in
computational power. By exploiting their highly evolved visual systems, flying
insects can effectively detect mates and track prey during rapid pursuits, even
though the small targets equate to only a few pixels in their visual field. The
high degree of sensitivity to small target movement is supported by a class of
specialized neurons called small target motion detectors (STMDs). Existing
STMD-based computational models normally comprise four sequentially arranged
neural layers interconnected via feedforward loops to extract information on
small target motion from raw visual inputs. However, feedback, another
important regulatory circuit for motion perception, has not been investigated
in the STMD pathway and its functional roles for small target motion detection
are not clear. In this paper, we propose an STMD-based neural network with
feedback connection (Feedback STMD), where the network output is temporally
delayed, then fed back to the lower layers to mediate neural responses. We
compare the properties of the model with and without the time-delay feedback
loop, and find it shows preference for high-velocity objects. Extensive
experiments suggest that the Feedback STMD achieves superior detection
performance for fast-moving small targets, while significantly suppressing
background false positive movements which display lower velocities. The
proposed feedback model provides an effective solution in robotic visual
systems for detecting fast-moving small targets that are always salient and
potentially threatening.</span>

                                        <span>Monocular depth prediction plays a crucial role in understanding 3D scene
geometry. Although recent methods have achieved impressive progress in terms of
evaluation metrics such as the pixel-wise relative error, most methods neglect
the geometric constraints in the 3D space. In this work, we show the importance
of the high-order 3D geometric constraints for depth prediction. By designing a
loss term that enforces a simple geometric constraint, namely, virtual normal
directions determined by randomly sampled three points in the reconstructed 3D
space, we significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of monocular depth
estimation. Significantly, the virtual normal loss can not only improve the
performance of learning metric depth, but also disentangle the scale
information and enrich the model with better shape information. Therefore, when
not having access to absolute metric depth training data, we can use virtual
normal to learn a robust affine-invariant depth generated on diverse scenes. In
experiments, We show state-of-the-art results of learning metric depth on NYU
Depth-V2 and KITTI. From the high-quality predicted depth, we are now able to
recover good 3D structures of the scene such as the point cloud and surface
normal directly, eliminating the necessity of relying on additional models as
was previously done. To demonstrate the excellent generalizability of learning
affine-invariant depth on diverse data with the virtual normal loss, we
construct a large-scale and diverse dataset for training affine-invariant
depth, termed Diverse Scene Depth dataset (DiverseDepth), and test on five
datasets with the zero-shot test setting. Code is available at:

                                        <span>Automotive traffic scenes are complex due to the variety of possible
scenarios, objects, and weather conditions that need to be handled. In contrast
to more constrained environments, such as automated underground trains,
automotive perception systems cannot be tailored to a narrow field of specific
tasks but must handle an ever-changing environment with unforeseen events. As
currently no single sensor is able to reliably perceive all relevant activity
in the surroundings, sensor data fusion is applied to perceive as much
information as possible. Data fusion of different sensors and sensor modalities
on a low abstraction level enables the compensation of sensor weaknesses and
misdetections among the sensors before the information-rich sensor data are
compressed and thereby information is lost after a sensor-individual object
detection. This paper develops a low-level sensor fusion network for 3D object
detection, which fuses lidar, camera, and radar data. The fusion network is
trained and evaluated on the nuScenes data set. On the test set, fusion of
radar data increases the resulting AP (Average Precision) detection score by
about 5.1% in comparison to the baseline lidar network. The radar sensor fusion
proves especially beneficial in inclement conditions such as rain and night
scenes. Fusing additional camera data contributes positively only in
conjunction with the radar fusion, which shows that interdependencies of the
sensors are important for the detection result. Additionally, the paper
proposes a novel loss to handle the discontinuity of a simple yaw
representation for object detection. Our updated loss increases the detection
and orientation estimation performance for all sensor input configurations. The
code for this research has been made available on GitHub.</span>

                                        <span>In large technology companies, the requirements for managing and organizing
technical documents created by engineers and managers in supporting relevant
decision making have increased dramatically in recent years, which has led to a
higher demand for more scalable, accurate, and automated document
classification. Prior studies have primarily focused on processing text for
classification and small-scale databases. This paper describes a novel
multimodal deep learning architecture, called TechDoc, for technical document
classification, which utilizes both natural language and descriptive images to
train hierarchical classifiers. The architecture synthesizes convolutional
neural networks and recurrent neural networks through an integrated training
process. We applied the architecture to a large multimodal technical document
database and trained the model for classifying documents based on the
hierarchical International Patent Classification system. Our results show that
the trained neural network presents a greater classification accuracy than
those using a single modality and several earlier text classification methods.
The trained model can potentially be scaled to millions of real-world technical
documents with both text and figures, which is useful for data and knowledge
management in large technology companies and organizations.</span>

                                        <span>The recent vision transformer(i.e.for image classification) learns non-local
attentive interaction of different patch tokens. However, prior arts miss
learning the cross-scale dependencies of different pixels, the semantic
correspondence of different labels, and the consistency of the feature
representations and semantic embeddings, which are critical for biomedical
segmentation. In this paper, we tackle the above issues by proposing a unified
transformer network, termed Multi-Compound Transformer (MCTrans), which
incorporates rich feature learning and semantic structure mining into a unified
framework. Specifically, MCTrans embeds the multi-scale convolutional features
as a sequence of tokens and performs intra- and inter-scale self-attention,
rather than single-scale attention in previous works. In addition, a learnable
proxy embedding is also introduced to model semantic relationship and feature
enhancement by using self-attention and cross-attention, respectively. MCTrans
can be easily plugged into a UNet-like network and attains a significant
improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in biomedical image segmentation
in six standard benchmarks. For example, MCTrans outperforms UNet by 3.64%,
3.71%, 4.34%, 2.8%, 1.88%, 1.57% in Pannuke, CVC-Clinic, CVC-Colon, Etis,
Kavirs, ISIC2018 dataset, respectively. Code is available at

                                        <span>The past few years have witnessed great progress in the domain of face
recognition thanks to advances in deep learning. However, cross pose face
recognition remains a significant challenge. It is difficult for many deep
learning algorithms to narrow the performance gap caused by pose variations;
the main reasons for this relate to the intra-class discrepancy between face
images in different poses and the pose imbalances of training datasets.
Learning pose-robust features by traversing to the feature space of frontal
faces provides an effective and cheap way to alleviate this problem. In this
paper, we present a method for progressively transforming profile face
representations to the canonical pose with an attentive pair-wise loss.
Firstly, to reduce the difficulty of directly transforming the profile face
features into a frontal pose, we propose to learn the feature residual between
the source pose and its nearby pose in a block-byblock fashion, and thus
traversing to the feature space of a smaller pose by adding the learned
residual. Secondly, we propose an attentive pair-wise loss to guide the feature
transformation progressing in the most effective direction. Finally, our
proposed progressive module and attentive pair-wise loss are light-weight and
easy to implement, adding only about 7:5% extra parameters. Evaluations on the
CFP and CPLFW datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Code

                                        <span>Data augmentation is a powerful technique for improving the performance of
the few-shot classification task. It generates more samples as supplements, and
then this task can be transformed into a common supervised learning issue for
solution. However, most mainstream data augmentation based approaches only
consider the single modality information, which leads to the low diversity and
quality of generated features. In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal
data augmentation approach named Dizygotic Conditional Variational AutoEncoder
(DCVAE) for addressing the aforementioned issue. DCVAE conducts feature
synthesis via pairing two Conditional Variational AutoEncoders (CVAEs) with the
same seed but different modality conditions in a dizygotic symbiosis manner.
Subsequently, the generated features of two CVAEs are adaptively combined to
yield the final feature, which can be converted back into its paired conditions
while ensuring these conditions are consistent with the original conditions not
only in representation but also in function. DCVAE essentially provides a new
idea of data augmentation in various multi-modal scenarios by exploiting the
complement of different modality prior information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate our work achieves state-of-the-art performances on
miniImageNet, CIFAR-FS and CUB datasets, and is able to work well in the
partial modality absence case.</span>

contrastively learned representations are more robust against the catastrophic

                                        <span>Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a destructive joint disease identified by joint
stiffness, pain, and functional disability concerning millions of lives across
the globe. It is generally assessed by evaluating physical symptoms, medical
history, and other joint screening tests like radiographs, Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI), and Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Unfortunately, the
conventional methods are very subjective, which forms a barrier in detecting
the disease progression at an early stage. This paper presents a deep
learning-based framework, namely OsteoHRNet, that automatically assesses the
Knee OA severity in terms of Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade classification
from X-rays. As a primary novelty, the proposed approach is built upon one of
the most recent deep models, called the High-Resolution Network (HRNet), to
capture the multi-scale features of knee X-rays. In addition, we have also
incorporated an attention mechanism to filter out the counterproductive
features and boost the performance further. Our proposed model has achieved the
best multiclass accuracy of 71.74% and MAE of 0.311 on the baseline cohort of
the OAI dataset, which is a remarkable gain over the existing best-published
works. We have also employed the Gradient-based Class Activation Maps

picture by sharpening the output. Instead of producing a coarse localization
map that highlights the important predictive regions in the image, the proposed
method outputs the specific shape that most contributes to the model output.
Thus, the proposed method improves the accuracy of saliency maps. The effect
has been achieved by the gradual propagation of the crude map obtained in the
deep layer through all preceding layers with respect to their activations. In
validation tests conducted on a selected set of images, the faithfulness,
interpretability, and applicability of the method are evaluated. The proposed
technique significantly improves the localization detection of the neural
networks attention at low additional computational costs. Furthermore, the
proposed method is applicable to a variety deep neural network models. The code

                                        <span>Interpretability is a critical factor in applying complex deep learning
models to advance the understanding of brain disorders in neuroimaging studies.
To interpret the decision process of a trained classifier, existing techniques
typically rely on saliency maps to quantify the voxel-wise or feature-level
importance for classification through partial derivatives. Despite providing
some level of localization, these maps are not human-understandable from the
neuroscience perspective as they do not inform the specific meaning of the
alteration linked to the brain disorder. Inspired by the image-to-image
translation scheme, we propose to train simulator networks that can warp a
given image to inject or remove patterns of the disease. These networks are
trained such that the classifier produces consistently increased or decreased
prediction logits for the simulated images. Moreover, we propose to couple all
the simulators into a unified model based on conditional convolution. We
applied our approach to interpreting classifiers trained on a synthetic dataset
and two neuroimaging datasets to visualize the effect of the Alzheimer&#x27;s
disease and alcohol use disorder. Compared to the saliency maps generated by
baseline approaches, our simulations and visualizations based on the Jacobian
determinants of the warping field reveal meaningful and understandable patterns
related to the diseases.</span>

                                        <span>Text spotting in natural scene images is of great importance for many image
understanding tasks. It includes two sub-tasks: text detection and recognition.
In this work, we propose a unified network that simultaneously localizes and
recognizes text with a single forward pass, avoiding intermediate processes
such as image cropping and feature re-calculation, word separation, and
character grouping.

In contrast to existing approaches that consider text detection and
recognition as two distinct tasks and tackle them one by one, the proposed
framework settles these two tasks concurrently. The whole framework can be
trained end-to-end and is able to handle text of arbitrary shapes. The
convolutional features are calculated only once and shared by both detection
and recognition modules. Through multi-task training, the learned features
become more discriminate and improve the overall performance. By employing the
$2$D attention model in word recognition, the irregularity of text can be
robustly addressed. It provides the spatial location for each character, which
not only helps local feature extraction in word recognition, but also indicates
an orientation angle to refine text localization. Our proposed method has
achieved state-of-the-art performance on several standard text spotting
benchmarks, including both regular and irregular ones.</span>

capturing the manifold structure of target objects, and accordingly boosts the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. However, most existing methods encode
the location information in an implicit way, e.g. the distance transform maps,
which describe the relative distance from each pixel to the contour boundary,
for the network to learn. These implicit approaches do not fully exploit the
position information (i.e. absolute location) of targets. In this paper, we
propose a novel loss function, namely residual moment (RM) loss, to explicitly
embed the location information of segmentation targets during the training of
deep learning networks. Particularly, motivated by image moments, the
segmentation prediction map and ground-truth map are weighted by coordinate
information. Then our RM loss encourages the networks to maintain the
consistency between the two weighted maps, which promotes the segmentation
networks to easily locate the targets and extract manifold-structure-related
features. We validate the proposed RM loss by conducting extensive experiments
on two publicly available datasets, i.e., 2D optic cup and disk segmentation
and 3D left atrial segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our RM loss, which significantly boosts the accuracy of
segmentation networks.</span>

detected objects in an observed scene. The proposed approach modifies the
recently proposed Convolutional Support Estimator Networks (CSENs). CSENs are
designed to compute a direct mapping for the Support Estimation (SE) task in a
representation-based classification problem. We further propose and demonstrate
that representation-based methods (sparse or collaborative representation) can
be used in well-designed regression problems. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first representation-based method proposed for performing a
regression task by utilizing the modified CSENs; and hence, we name this novel
approach as Representation-based Regression (RbR). The initial version of CSENs
has a proxy mapping stage (i.e., a coarse estimation for the support set) that
is required for the input. In this study, we improve the CSEN model by
proposing Compressive Learning CSEN (CL-CSEN) that has the ability to jointly
optimize the so-called proxy mapping stage along with convolutional layers. The
experimental evaluations using the KITTI 3D Object Detection distance
estimation dataset show that the proposed method can achieve a significantly
improved distance estimation performance over all competing methods. Finally,
the software implementations of the methods are publicly shared at

                                        <span>Background: Transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsies of the prostate
is a routine procedure to establish a prostate cancer diagnosis. However, the
10-12 prostate core biopsies only sample a relatively small volume of the
prostate, and tumour lesions in regions between biopsy cores can be missed,
leading to a well-known low sensitivity to detect clinically relevant cancer.
As a proof-of-principle, we developed and validated a deep convolutional neural
network model to distinguish between morphological patterns in benign prostate
biopsy whole slide images from men with and without established cancer.
Methods: This study included 14,354 hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide
images from benign prostate biopsies from 1,508 men in two groups: men without
an established prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and men with at least one core
biopsy diagnosed with PCa. 80% of the participants were assigned as training
data and used for model optimization (1,211 men), and the remaining 20% (297
men) as a held-out test set used to evaluate model performance. An ensemble of
10 deep convolutional neural network models was optimized for classification of
biopsies from men with and without established cancer. Hyperparameter
optimization and model selection was performed by cross-validation in the
training data . Results: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC-AUC) was estimated as 0.727 (bootstrap 95% CI: 0.708-0.745) on biopsy
level and 0.738 (bootstrap 95% CI: 0.682 - 0.796) on man level. At a
specificity of 0.9 the model had an estimated sensitivity of 0.348. Conclusion:
The developed model has the ability to detect men with risk of missed PCa due
to under-sampling of the prostate. The proposed model has the potential to
reduce the number of false negative cases in routine systematic prostate
biopsies and to indicate men who could benefit from MRI-guided re-biopsy.</span>

                                        <span>Wide field small aperture telescopes (WFSATs) are mainly used to obtain
scientific information of point--like and streak--like celestial objects.
However, qualities of images obtained by WFSATs are seriously affected by the
background noise and variable point spread functions. Developing high speed and
high efficiency data processing method is of great importance for further
scientific research. In recent years, deep neural networks have been proposed
for detection and classification of celestial objects and have shown better
performance than classical methods. In this paper, we further extend abilities
of the deep neural network based astronomical target detection framework to
make it suitable for photometry and astrometry. We add new branches into the
deep neural network to obtain types, magnitudes and positions of different
celestial objects at the same time. Tested with simulated data, we find that
our neural network has better performance in photometry than classical methods.
Because photometry and astrometry are regression algorithms, which would obtain
high accuracy measurements instead of rough classification results, the
accuracy of photometry and astrometry results would be affected by different
observation conditions. To solve this problem, we further propose to use
reference stars to train our deep neural network with transfer learning
strategy when observation conditions change. The photometry framework proposed
in this paper could be used as an end--to--end quick data processing framework
for WFSATs, which can further increase response speed and scientific outputs of
WFSATs.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a new perspective on video understanding by casting the video
recognition problem as an image recognition task. We show that an image
classifier alone can suffice for video understanding without temporal modeling.
Our approach is simple and universal. It composes input frames into a super
image to train an image classifier to fulfill the task of action recognition,
in exactly the same way as classifying an image. We prove the viability of such
an idea by demonstrating strong and promising performance on four public
datasets including Kinetics400, Something-to-something (V2), MiT and Jester,
using a recently developed vision transformer. We also experiment with the
prevalent ResNet image classifiers in computer vision to further validate our
idea. The results on Kinetics400 are comparable to some of the best-performed
CNN approaches based on spatio-temporal modeling. our code and models will be
made available at https://github.com/IBM/sifar-pytorch.</span>

                                        <span>Polygonal meshes are ubiquitous, but have only played a relatively minor role
in the deep learning revolution. State-of-the-art neural generative models for
3D shapes learn implicit functions and generate meshes via expensive
iso-surfacing. We overcome these challenges by employing a classical spatial
data structure from computer graphics, Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), to
facilitate 3D learning. The core operation of BSP involves recursive
subdivision of 3D space to obtain convex sets. By exploiting this property, we
devise BSP-Net, a network that learns to represent a 3D shape via convex
decomposition without supervision. The network is trained to reconstruct a
shape using a set of convexes obtained from a BSP-tree built over a set of
planes, where the planes and convexes are both defined by learned network
weights. BSP-Net directly outputs polygonal meshes from the inferred convexes.
The generated meshes are watertight, compact (i.e., low-poly), and well suited
to represent sharp geometry. We show that the reconstruction quality by BSP-Net
is competitive with those from state-of-the-art methods while using much fewer
primitives. We also explore variations to BSP-Net including using a more
generic decoder for reconstruction, more general primitives than planes, as
well as training a generative model with variational auto-encoders. Code is
available at https://github.com/czq142857/BSP-NET-original.</span>

                                        <span>Perceiving and manipulating 3D articulated objects (e.g., cabinets, doors) in
human environments is an important yet challenging task for future
home-assistant robots. The space of 3D articulated objects is exceptionally
rich in their myriad semantic categories, diverse shape geometry, and
complicated part functionality. Previous works mostly abstract kinematic
structure with estimated joint parameters and part poses as the visual
representations for manipulating 3D articulated objects. In this paper, we
propose object-centric actionable visual priors as a novel
perception-interaction handshaking point that the perception system outputs
more actionable guidance than kinematic structure estimation, by predicting
dense geometry-aware, interaction-aware, and task-aware visual action
affordance and trajectory proposals. We design an interaction-for-perception
framework VAT-Mart to learn such actionable visual representations by
simultaneously training a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy
exploring diverse interaction trajectories and a perception module summarizing
and generalizing the explored knowledge for pointwise predictions among diverse
shapes. Experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the
large-scale PartNet-Mobility dataset in SAPIEN environment and show promising
generalization capabilities to novel test shapes, unseen object categories, and
real-world data. Project page: https://hyperplane-lab.github.io/vat-mart</span>

related videos generated online are increasing at an unprecedentedly fast pace.
To automate sports video editing/highlight generation process, a key task is to
precisely recognize and locate the events in the long untrimmed videos. In this
tech report, we present a two-stage paradigm to detect what and when events
happen in soccer broadcast videos. Specifically, we fine-tune multiple action
recognition models on soccer data to extract high-level semantic features, and
design a transformer based temporal detection module to locate the target
events. This approach achieved the state-of-the-art performance in both two
tasks, i.e., action spotting and replay grounding, in the SoccerNet-v2
Challenge, under CVPR 2021 ActivityNet workshop. Our soccer embedding features
are released at https://github.com/baidu-research/vidpress-sports. By sharing
these features with the broader community, we hope to accelerate the research

abilities of autonomous agents working in the real-world. Yet, solutions so far
have been computationally intensive, with the fastest algorithms running for
more than half a second per video snippet on powerful GPUs. We propose a novel
idea on video architecture learning - Tiny Video Networks - which automatically
designs highly efficient models for video understanding. The tiny video models
run with competitive performance for as low as 37 milliseconds per video on a

                                        <span>Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) is a 3D imaging technique that enables the
systemic study of shape, abundance, and distribution of macromolecular
structures in single cells in near-atomic resolution. However, the systematic
and efficient $\textit{de novo}$ recognition and recovery of macromolecular
structures captured by Cryo-ET are very challenging due to the structural
complexity and imaging limits. Even macromolecules with identical structures
have various appearances due to different orientations and imaging limits, such
as noise and the missing wedge effect. Explicitly disentangling the semantic
features of macromolecules is crucial for performing several downstream
analyses on the macromolecules. This paper has addressed the problem by
proposing a 3D Spatial Variational Autoencoder that explicitly disentangle the
structure, orientation, and shift of macromolecules. Extensive experiments on
both synthesized and real cryo-ET datasets and cross-domain evaluations
demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents Kimera-Multi, the first multi-robot system that (i) is
robust and capable of identifying and rejecting incorrect inter and intra-robot
loop closures resulting from perceptual aliasing, (ii) is fully distributed and
only relies on local (peer-to-peer) communication to achieve distributed
localization and mapping, and (iii) builds a globally consistent
metric-semantic 3D mesh model of the environment in real-time, where faces of
the mesh are annotated with semantic labels. Kimera-Multi is implemented by a
team of robots equipped with visual-inertial sensors. Each robot builds a local
trajectory estimate and a local mesh using Kimera. When communication is
available, robots initiate a distributed place recognition and robust pose
graph optimization protocol based on a novel distributed graduated
non-convexity algorithm. The proposed protocol allows the robots to improve
their local trajectory estimates by leveraging inter-robot loop closures while
being robust to outliers. Finally, each robot uses its improved trajectory
estimate to correct the local mesh using mesh deformation techniques.

We demonstrate Kimera-Multi in photo-realistic simulations, SLAM benchmarking
datasets, and challenging outdoor datasets collected using ground robots. Both
real and simulated experiments involve long trajectories (e.g., up to 800
meters per robot). The experiments show that Kimera-Multi (i) outperforms the
state of the art in terms of robustness and accuracy, (ii) achieves estimation
errors comparable to a centralized SLAM system while being fully distributed,
(iii) is parsimonious in terms of communication bandwidth, (iv) produces
accurate metric-semantic 3D meshes, and (v) is modular and can be also used for
standard 3D reconstruction (i.e., without semantic labels) or for trajectory
estimation (i.e., without reconstructing a 3D mesh).</span>

expansion learning for image classification, which aims at improving the
supervision-stimulation frequency for the samples of the confusing classes.
Class-based expansion learning takes a bottom-up growing strategy in a
class-based expansion optimization fashion, which pays more attention to the
quality of learning the fine-grained classification boundaries for the
preferentially selected classes. Besides, we develop a class confusion
criterion to select the confusing class preferentially for training. In this
way, the classification boundaries of the confusing classes are frequently
stimulated, resulting in a fine-grained form. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on several benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Image matting is an ill-posed problem that aims to estimate the opacity of
foreground pixels in an image. However, most existing deep learning-based
methods still suffer from the coarse-grained details. In general, these
algorithms are incapable of felicitously distinguishing the degree of
exploration between deterministic domains (certain FG and BG pixels) and
undetermined domains (uncertain in-between pixels), or inevitably lose
information in the continuous sampling process, leading to a sub-optimal
result. In this paper, we propose a novel network named Prior-Induced
Information Alignment Matting Network (PIIAMatting), which can efficiently
model the distinction of pixel-wise response maps and the correlation of
layer-wise feature maps. It mainly consists of a Dynamic Gaussian Modulation
mechanism (DGM) and an Information Alignment strategy (IA). Specifically, the
DGM can dynamically acquire a pixel-wise domain response map learned from the
prior distribution. The response map can present the relationship between the
opacity variation and the convergence process during training. On the other
hand, the IA comprises an Information Match Module (IMM) and an Information
Aggregation Module (IAM), jointly scheduled to match and aggregate the adjacent
layer-wise features adaptively. Besides, we also develop a Multi-Scale
Refinement (MSR) module to integrate multi-scale receptive field information at
the refinement stage to recover the fluctuating appearance details. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed
PIIAMatting performs favourably against state-of-the-art image matting methods
on the Alphamatting.com, Composition-1K and Distinctions-646 dataset.</span>

presented, attempting to reconstruct a face from deep templates. Although some
of these approaches work in a black-box setup using only face embeddings,
usually, on the end-user side, only similarity scores are provided. Therefore,
these algorithms are inapplicable in such scenarios. We propose a novel

                                        <span>Powerful deep learning algorithms open an opportunity for solving non-image
Machine Learning (ML) problems by transforming these problems to into the image
recognition problems. The CPC-R algorithm presented in this chapter converts
non-image data into images by visualizing non-image data. Then deep learning
CNN algorithms solve the learning problems on these images. The design of the
CPC-R algorithm allows preserving all high-dimensional information in 2-D
images. The use of pair values mapping instead of single value mapping used in
the alternative approaches allows encoding each n-D point with 2 times fewer
visual elements. The attributes of an n-D point are divided into pairs of its
values and each pair is visualized as 2-D points in the same 2-D Cartesian
coordinates. Next, grey scale or color intensity values are assigned to each
pair to encode the order of pairs. This is resulted in the heatmap image. The
computational experiments with CPC-R are conducted for different CNN
architectures, and methods to optimize the CPC-R images showing that the
combined CPC-R and deep learning CNN algorithms are able to solve non-image ML
problems reaching high accuracy on the benchmark datasets. This chapter expands
our prior work by adding more experiments to test accuracy of classification,
exploring saliency and informativeness of discovered features to test their
interpretability, and generalizing the approach.</span>

form thanks to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Recent studies show that
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform very well to identify skin lesions
from the image but, there is not much work for Lyme disease prediction from EM
lesion images. The main objective of this study is to extensively analyze the
effectiveness of CNNs for diagnosing Lyme disease from images and to find out
the best CNN architecture for the purpose. There is no publicly available EM

                                        <span>Content-independent watermarks and block-wise independency can be considered
as vulnerabilities in semi-fragile watermarking methods. In this paper to
achieve the objectives of semi-fragile watermarking techniques, a method is
proposed to not have the mentioned shortcomings. In the proposed method, the
watermark is generated by relying on image content and a key. Furthermore, the
embedding scheme causes the watermarked blocks to become dependent on each
other, using a key. In the embedding phase, the image is partitioned into
non-overlapping blocks. In order to detect and separate the different types of
attacks more precisely, the proposed method embeds three copies of each
watermark bit into LWT coefficients of each 4x4 block. In the authentication
phase, by voting between the extracted bits the error maps are created; these
maps indicate image authenticity and reveal the modified regions. Also, in
order to automate the authentication, the images are classified into four
categories using seven features. Classification accuracy in the experiments is
97.97 percent. It is noted that our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method is robust against JPEG compression and is competitive with a
state-of-the-art semi-fragile watermarking method, in terms of robustness and
semi-fragility.</span>

classes, the network learns new concepts but gradually forgets the knowledge of
old training. In some real-life applications, we may be interested in learning
new classes without forgetting the capability of previous experience. Such
learning without forgetting problem is often investigated using 2D image
recognition tasks. In this paper, considering the growth of depth camera
technology, we address the same problem for the 3D point cloud object data.
This problem becomes more challenging in the 3D domain than 2D because of the
unavailability of large datasets and powerful pretrained backbone models. We
investigate knowledge distillation techniques on 3D data to reduce catastrophic
forgetting of the previous training. Moreover, we improve the distillation
process by using semantic word vectors of object classes. We observe that
exploring the interrelation of old and new knowledge during training helps to
learn new concepts without forgetting old ones. Experimenting on three 3D point
cloud recognition backbones (PointNet, DGCNN, and PointConv) and synthetic
(ModelNet40, ModelNet10) and real scanned (ScanObjectNN) datasets, we establish
new baseline results on learning without forgetting for 3D data. This research
will instigate many future works in this area.</span>

                                        <span>Many deep learning based methods are designed to remove non-uniform
(spatially variant) motion blur caused by object motion and camera shake
without knowing the blur kernel. Some methods directly output the latent sharp
image in one stage, while others utilize a multi-stage strategy (\eg
multi-scale, multi-patch, or multi-temporal) to gradually restore the sharp
image. However, these methods have the following two main issues: 1) The
computational cost of multi-stage is high; 2) The same convolution kernel is
applied in different regions, which is not an ideal choice for non-uniform
blur. Hence, non-uniform motion deblurring is still a challenging and open
problem. In this paper, we propose a new architecture which consists of
multiple Atrous Spatial Pyramid Deformable Convolution (ASPDC) modules to
deblur an image end-to-end with more flexibility. Multiple ASPDC modules
implicitly learn the pixel-specific motion with different dilation rates in the
same layer to handle movements of different magnitude. To improve the training,
we also propose a reblurring network to map the deblurred output back to the
blurred input, which constrains the solution space. Our experimental results
show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the
benchmark datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Modern magnetic sensor arrays conventionally utilize state of the art low
power magnetometers such as parallel and orthogonal fluxgates. Low power
fluxgates tend to have large Barkhausen jumps that appear as a dc jump in the
fluxgate output. This phenomenon deteriorates the signal fidelity and
effectively increases the internal sensor noise. Even if sensors that are more
prone to dc jumps can be screened during production, the conventional noise
measurement does not always catch the dc jump because of its sparsity.
Moreover, dc jumps persist in almost all the sensor cores although at a slower
but still intolerable rate. Even if dc jumps can be easily detected in a
shielded environment, when deployed in presence of natural noise and clutter,
it can be hard to positively detect them. This work fills this gap and presents
algorithms that distinguish dc jumps embedded in natural magnetic field data.
To improve robustness to noise, we developed two machine learning algorithms
that employ temporal and statistical physical-based features of a pre-acquired
and well-known experimental data set. The first algorithm employs a support
vector machine classifier, while the second is based on a neural network
architecture. We compare these new approaches to a more classical kernel-based
method. To that purpose, the receiver operating characteristic curve is
generated, which allows diagnosis ability of the different classifiers by
comparing their performances across various operation points. The accuracy of
the machine learning-based algorithms over the classic method is highly
emphasized. In addition, high generalization and robustness of the neural
network can be concluded, based on the rapid convergence of the corresponding
receiver operating characteristic curves.</span>

Although both accuracy and speed are required in real-world applications,
recent tracking methods based on deep learning have focused on accuracy and
require substantial running time. This study aims to improve running speed by
performing human detection at a certain frame interval because it accounts for
most of the running time. The question is how to maintain accuracy while
skipping human detection. In this paper, we propose a method that complements
the detection results with optical flow, based on the fact that someone&#x27;s
appearance does not change much between adjacent frames. To maintain the
tracking accuracy, we introduce robust interest point selection within human
regions and a tracking termination metric calculated by the distribution of the
interest points. On the MOT20 dataset in the MOTChallenge, the proposed
SDOF-Tracker achieved the best performance in terms of the total running speed

(COPSE) from a single depth image, without external pose-annotated real-world
training data. While previous works exploit visual cues in RGB(D) images, our
method makes inferences based on the rich geometric information of the object
in the depth channel alone. Essentially, our framework explores such geometric
information by learning the unified 3D Orientation-Consistent Representations
(3D-OCR) module, and further enforced by the property of Geometry-constrained
Reflection Symmetry (GeoReS) module. The magnitude information of object size
and the center point is finally estimated by Mirror-Paired Dimensional
Estimation (MPDE) module. Extensive experiments on the category-level NOCS
benchmark demonstrate that our framework competes with state-of-the-art
approaches that require labeled real-world images. We also deploy our approach
to a physical Baxter robot to perform manipulation tasks on unseen but
category-known instances, and the results further validate the efficacy of our
proposed model. Our videos are available in the supplementary material.</span>

                                        <span>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is an indispensable and widely used module in face
recognition systems. Although high accuracy has been achieved, a FAS system
will never be perfect due to the non-stationary applied environments and the
potential emergence of new types of presentation attacks in real-world
applications. In practice, given a handful of labeled samples from a new
deployment scenario (target domain) and abundant labeled face images in the
existing source domain, the FAS system is expected to perform well in the new
scenario without sacrificing the performance on the original domain. To this
end, we identify and address a more practical problem: Few-Shot Domain
Expansion for Face Anti-Spoofing (FSDE-FAS). This problem is challenging since
with insufficient target domain training samples, the model may suffer from
both overfitting to the target domain and catastrophic forgetting of the source
domain. To address the problem, this paper proposes a Style transfer-based
Augmentation for Semantic Alignment (SASA) framework. We propose to augment the
target data by generating auxiliary samples based on photorealistic style
transfer. With the assistant of the augmented data, we further propose a
carefully designed mechanism to align different domains from both
instance-level and distribution-level, and then stabilize the performance on
the source domain with a less-forgetting constraint. Two benchmarks are
proposed to simulate the FSDE-FAS scenarios, and the experimental results show
that the proposed SASA method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a novel method on refining cross-person gaze prediction task with
eye/face images only by explicitly modelling the person-specific differences.
Specifically, we first assume that we can obtain some initial gaze prediction
results with existing method, which we refer to as InitNet, and then introduce
three modules, the Validity Module (VM), Self-Calibration (SC) and
Person-specific Transform (PT)) Module. By predicting the reliability of
current eye/face images, our VM is able to identify invalid samples, e.g. eye
blinking images, and reduce their effects in our modelling process. Our SC and
PT module then learn to compensate for the differences on valid samples only.
The former models the translation offsets by bridging the gap between initial
predictions and dataset-wise distribution. And the later learns more general
person-specific transformation by incorporating the information from existing
initial predictions of the same person. We validate our ideas on three publicly
available datasets, EVE, XGaze and MPIIGaze and demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms the SOTA methods significantly on all of them, e.g.
respectively 21.7%, 36.0% and 32.9% relative performance improvements. We won
the GAZE 2021 Competition on the EVE dataset. Our code can be found here

                                        <span>Recently, transformer has achieved remarkable performance on a variety of
computer vision applications. Compared with mainstream convolutional neural
networks, vision transformers are often of sophisticated architectures for
extracting powerful feature representations, which are more difficult to be
developed on mobile devices. In this paper, we present an effective
post-training quantization algorithm for reducing the memory storage and
computational costs of vision transformers. Basically, the quantization task
can be regarded as finding the optimal low-bit quantization intervals for
weights and inputs, respectively. To preserve the functionality of the
attention mechanism, we introduce a ranking loss into the conventional
quantization objective that aims to keep the relative order of the
self-attention results after quantization. Moreover, we thoroughly analyze the
relationship between quantization loss of different layers and the feature
diversity, and explore a mixed-precision quantization scheme by exploiting the
nuclear norm of each attention map and output feature. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is verified on several benchmark models and datasets, which
outperforms the state-of-the-art post-training quantization algorithms. For
instance, we can obtain an 81.29\% top-1 accuracy using DeiT-B model on
ImageNet dataset with about 8-bit quantization.</span>

                                        <span>In order to objectively assess new medical imaging technologies via
computer-simulations, it is important to account for all sources of variability
that contribute to image data. One important source of variability that can
significantly limit observer performance is associated with the variability in
the ensemble of objects to-be-imaged. This source of variability can be
described by stochastic object models (SOMs), which are generative models that
can be employed to sample from a distribution of to-be-virtually-imaged
objects. It is generally desirable to establish SOMs from experimental imaging
measurements acquired by use of a well-characterized imaging system, but this
task has remained challenging. Deep generative neural networks, such as
generative adversarial networks (GANs) hold potential for such tasks. To
establish SOMs from imaging measurements, an AmbientGAN has been proposed that
augments a GAN with a measurement operator. However, the original AmbientGAN
could not immediately benefit from modern training procedures and GAN
architectures, which limited its ability to be applied to realistically sized
medical image data. To circumvent this, in this work, a modified AmbientGAN
training strategy is proposed that is suitable for modern progressive or
multi-resolution training approaches such as employed in the Progressive
Growing of GANs and Style-based GANs. AmbientGANs established by use of the
proposed training procedure are systematically validated in a controlled way by
use of computer-simulated measurement data corresponding to a stylized imaging
system. Finally, emulated single-coil experimental magnetic resonance imaging
data are employed to demonstrate the methods under less stylized conditions.</span>

                                        <span>Ultrasound scanning is essential in several medical diagnostic and
therapeutic applications. It is used to visualize and analyze anatomical
features and structures that influence treatment plans. However, it is both
labor intensive, and its effectiveness is operator dependent. Real-time
accurate and robust automatic detection and tracking of anatomical structures
while scanning would significantly impact diagnostic and therapeutic procedures
to be consistent and efficient. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework to automatically detect and track a specific anatomical target
structure in ultrasound scans. Our framework is designed to be accurate and
robust across subjects and imaging devices, to operate in real-time, and to not
require a large training set. It maintains a localization precision and recall
higher than 90% when trained on training sets that are as small as 20% in size
of the original training set. The framework backbone is a weakly trained
segmentation neural network based on U-Net. We tested the framework on two
different ultrasound datasets with the aim to detect and track the Vagus nerve,
where it outperformed current state-of-the-art real-time object detection
networks.</span>

Localization (TAL) have only considered RGB and Flow modalities, leaving the
information-rich audio modality totally unexploited. Audio fusion has been
explored for the related but arguably easier problem of trimmed (clip-level)
action recognition. However, TAL poses a unique set of challenges. In this
paper, we propose simple but effective fusion-based approaches for TAL. To the

consistently improve performance for state of the art video-only TAL

                                        <span>Domain shift is a major challenge for object detectors to generalize well to
real world applications. Emerging techniques of domain adaptation for two-stage
detectors help to tackle this problem. However, two-stage detectors are not the
first choice for industrial applications due to its long time consumption. In
this paper, a novel Domain Adaptive YOLO (DA-YOLO) is proposed to improve
cross-domain performance for one-stage detectors. Image level features
alignment is used to strictly match for local features like texture, and
loosely match for global features like illumination. Multi-scale instance level
features alignment is presented to reduce instance domain shift effectively ,
such as variations in object appearance and viewpoint. A consensus
regularization to these domain classifiers is employed to help the network
generate domain-invariant detections. We evaluate our proposed method on
popular datasets like Cityscapes, KITTI, SIM10K and etc.. The results
demonstrate significant improvement when tested under different cross-domain
scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>During the last decade or so, there has been an insurgence in the deep
learning community to solve health-related issues, particularly breast cancer.
Following the Camelyon-16 challenge in 2016, several researchers have dedicated
their time to build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to help radiologists
and other clinicians diagnose breast cancer. In particular, there has been an
emphasis on Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS); the clinical term for early-stage
breast cancer. Large companies have given their fair share of research into
this subject, among these Google Deepmind who developed a model in 2020 that
has proven to be better than radiologists themselves to diagnose breast cancer
correctly.

We found that among the issues which exist, there is a need for an
explanatory system that goes through the hidden layers of a CNN to highlight
those pixels that contributed to the classification of a mammogram. We then
chose an open-source, reasonably successful project developed by Prof. Shen,
using the CBIS-DDSM image database to run our experiments on. It was later
improved using the Resnet-50 and VGG-16 patch-classifiers, analytically
comparing the outcome of both. The results showed that the Resnet-50 one
converged earlier in the experiments.

Following the research by Montavon and Binder, we used the DeepTaylor
Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) model to highlight those pixels and
regions within a mammogram which contribute most to its classification. This is
represented as a map of those pixels in the original image, which contribute to
the diagnosis and the extent to which they contribute to the final
classification. The most significant advantage of this algorithm is that it
performs exceptionally well with the Resnet-50 patch classifier architecture.</span>

from generating overconfident output distributions. For each training sample
the LS strategy smooths the one-hot encoded training signal by distributing its
distribution mass over the non-ground truth classes. We extend this technique
by considering example pairs, coined PLS. PLS first creates midpoint samples by
averaging random sample pairs and then learns a smoothing distribution during
training for each of these midpoint samples, resulting in midpoints with high
uncertainty labels for training. We empirically show that PLS significantly
outperforms LS, achieving up to 30% of relative classification error reduction.
We also visualize that PLS produces very low winning softmax scores for both in
and out of distribution samples.</span>

                                        <span>The geodatabase (vectorized data) nowadays becomes a rather standard digital
city infrastructure; however, updating geodatabase efficiently and economically
remains a fundamental and practical issue in the geospatial industry. The cost
of building a geodatabase is extremely high and labor intensive, and very often
the maps we use have several months and even years of latency. One solution is
to develop more automated methods for (vectorized) geospatial data generation,
which has been proven a difficult task in the past decades. An alternative
solution is to first detect the differences between the new data and the
existing geospatial data, and then only update the area identified as changes.
The second approach is becoming more favored due to its high practicality and
flexibility. A highly relevant technique is change detection. This article aims
to provide an overview the state-of-the-art change detection methods in the
field of Remote Sensing and Geomatics to support the task of updating
geodatabases. Data used for change detection are highly disparate, we therefore
structure our review intuitively based on the dimension of the data, being 1)
change detection with 2D data; 2) change detection with 3D data. Conclusions
will be drawn based on the reviewed efforts in the field, and we will share our
outlooks of the topic of updating geodatabases.</span>

possible to provide high-quality traffic data for effective transportation
planning, operations, and management. However, deriving reliable traffic
metrics from these camera feeds has been a challenge due to the limitations of
current vehicle detection techniques, as well as the various camera conditions
such as height and resolution. In this work, a quadtree based algorithm is
developed to continuously partition the image extent until only regions with
high detection accuracy are remained. These regions are referred to as the
high-accuracy identification regions (HAIR) in this paper. We demonstrate how
the use of the HAIR can improve the accuracy of traffic density estimates using
images from traffic cameras at different heights and resolutions in Central
Ohio. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm can be used to derive
robust HAIR where vehicle detection accuracy is 41 percent higher than that in
the original image extent. The use of the HAIR also significantly improves the
traffic density estimation with an overall decrease of 49 percent in root mean
squared error.</span>

                                        <span>Learning guarantees often rely on assumptions of i.i.d. data, which will
likely be violated in practice once predictors are deployed to perform
real-world tasks. Domain adaptation approaches thus appeared as a useful
framework yielding extra flexibility in that distinct train and test data
distributions are supported, provided that other assumptions are satisfied such
as covariate shift, which expects the conditional distributions over labels to
be independent of the underlying data distribution. Several approaches were
introduced in order to induce generalization across varying train and test data
sources, and those often rely on the general idea of domain-invariance, in such
a way that the data-generating distributions are to be disregarded by the
prediction model. In this contribution, we tackle the problem of generalizing
across data sources by approaching it from the opposite direction: we consider
a conditional modeling approach in which predictions, in addition to being
dependent on the input data, use information relative to the underlying
data-generating distribution. For instance, the model has an explicit mechanism
to adapt to changing environments and/or new data sources. We argue that such
an approach is more generally applicable than current domain adaptation methods
since it does not require extra assumptions such as covariate shift and further
yields simpler training algorithms that avoid a common source of training
instabilities caused by minimax formulations, often employed in
domain-invariant methods.</span>

raw images or videos) as input, however, practical scenarios may often consist
the situations where part of the visual information becomes inaccessible due to
various reasons e.g., restricted view with fixed camera or intentional vision
block for security concerns. As a step towards the more practical application
scenarios, we introduce a novel task that aims to describe a video using the
natural language dialog between two agents as a supplementary information
source given incomplete visual data. Different from most existing
vision-language tasks where AI systems have full access to images or video
clips, which may reveal sensitive information such as recognizable human faces
or voices, we intentionally limit the visual input for AI systems and seek a
more secure and transparent information medium, i.e., the natural language
dialog, to supplement the missing visual information. Specifically, one of the
intelligent agents - Q-BOT - is given two semantic segmented frames from the
beginning and the end of the video, as well as a finite number of opportunities
to ask relevant natural language questions before describing the unseen video.
A-BOT, the other agent who has access to the entire video, assists Q-BOT to
accomplish the goal by answering the asked questions. We introduce two
different experimental settings with either a generative (i.e., agents generate
questions and answers freely) or a discriminative (i.e., agents select the
questions and answers from candidates) internal dialog generation process. With
the proposed unified QA-Cooperative networks, we experimentally demonstrate the
knowledge transfer process between the two dialog agents and the effectiveness
of using the natural language dialog as a supplement for incomplete implicit
visions.</span>

sensing data (e.g. images) obtained from atmospheric monitoring missions. The
first issue relates the building new public datasets and benchmarks, which are
hot priority of the remote sensing community. The second issue is the
investigation of deep learning methodologies for atmospheric data
classification based on vast amount of data without annotations and with
localized annotated data provided by sparse observing networks at the surface.
The targeted application is air quality assessment and prediction. Air quality
is defined as the pollution level linked with several atmospheric constituents
such as gases and aerosols. There are dependency relationships between the bad
air quality, caused by air pollution, and the public health. The target
application is the development of a fast prediction model for local and
regional air quality assessment and tracking. The results of mining data will
have significant implication for citizen and decision makers by providing a
fast prediction and reliable air quality monitoring system able to cover the
local and regional scale through intelligent extrapolation of sparse

re-identification (Re-ID) has attracted much attention in recent years, by
additionally exploiting the source set. However, due to the differences on
camera styles, illumination and backgrounds, there exists a large gap between
source domain and target domain, introducing a great challenge on cross-domain
matching. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a novel method named
Dual-stream Reciprocal Disentanglement Learning (DRDL), which is quite
efficient in learning domain-invariant features. In DRDL, two encoders are
first constructed for id-related and id-unrelated feature extractions, which
are respectively measured by their associated classifiers. Furthermore,
followed by an adversarial learning strategy, both streams reciprocally and
positively effect each other, so that the id-related features and id-unrelated
features are completely disentangled from a given image, allowing the encoder
to be powerful enough to obtain the discriminative but domain-invariant
features. In contrast to existing approaches, our proposed method is free from

differences across different sensor makes and models. This paper focuses on the
task of mapping between different sensor raw-RGB color spaces. Prior work
addressed this problem using a pairwise calibration to achieve accurate color
mapping. Although being accurate, this approach is less practical as it
requires: (1) capturing pair of images by both camera devices with a color
calibration object placed in each new scene; (2) accurate image alignment or
manual annotation of the color calibration object. This paper aims to tackle
color mapping in the raw space through a more practical setup. Specifically, we
present a semi-supervised raw-to-raw mapping method trained on a small set of
paired images alongside an unpaired set of images captured by each camera
device. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves better
results compared to other domain adaptation alternatives in addition to the
single-calibration solution. We have generated a new dataset of raw images from
two different smartphone cameras as part of this effort. Our dataset includes
unpaired and paired sets for our semi-supervised training and evaluation.</span>

high-resolution, realistic and high-fidelity face exchange. First of all, in
order to ensure sufficient clarity and authenticity, our key idea is to use an
advanced pretrained high-quality random face image generator, i.e. StyleGAN, as
backbone. Secondly, we design ShapeEditor, a two-step encoder, to make the
swapped face integrate the identity and attribute of the input faces. In the
first step, we extract the identity vector of the source image and the
attribute vector of the target image respectively; in the second step, we map
the concatenation of identity vector and attribute vector into the
$\mathcal{W+}$ potential space. In addition, for learning to map into the
latent space of StyleGAN, we propose a set of self-supervised loss functions
with which the training data do not need to be labeled manually. Extensive
experiments on the test dataset show that the results of our method not only
have a great advantage in clarity and authenticity than other state-of-the-art
methods, but also reflect the sufficient integration of identity and attribute.</span>

                                        <span>Pose transfer of human videos aims to generate a high fidelity video of a
target person imitating actions of a source person. A few studies have made
great progress either through image translation with deep latent features or
neural rendering with explicit 3D features. However, both of them rely on large
amounts of training data to generate realistic results, and the performance
degrades on more accessible internet videos due to insufficient training
frames. In this paper, we demonstrate that the dynamic details can be preserved
even trained from short monocular videos. Overall, we propose a neural video
rendering framework coupled with an image-translation-based dynamic details
generation network (D2G-Net), which fully utilizes both the stability of
explicit 3D features and the capacity of learning components. To be specific, a
novel texture representation is presented to encode both the static and
pose-varying appearance characteristics, which is then mapped to the image
space and rendered as a detail-rich frame in the neural rendering stage.
Moreover, we introduce a concise temporal loss in the training stage to
suppress the detail flickering that is made more visible due to high-quality
dynamic details generated by our method. Through extensive comparisons, we
demonstrate that our neural human video renderer is capable of achieving both
clearer dynamic details and more robust performance even on accessible short
videos with only 2k - 4k frames.</span>

learning involves limitations of labelled samples. For the task of
classification, techniques such as meta-learning, zero-shot learning, and
few-shot learning showcase the ability to learn information about novel classes
based on prior knowledge. Recent techniques try to learn a cross-modal mapping
between the semantic space and the image space. However, they tend to ignore
the local and global semantic knowledge. To overcome this problem, we propose a
Multimodal Variational Auto-Encoder (M-VAE) which can learn the shared latent
space of image features and the semantic space. In our approach we concatenate
multimodal data to a single embedding before passing it to the VAE for learning
the latent space. We propose the use of a multi-modal loss during the
reconstruction of the feature embedding through the decoder. Our approach is
capable to correlating modalities and exploit the local and global semantic
knowledge for novel sample predictions. Our experimental results using a MLP
classifier on four benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms
the current state-of-the-art approaches for generalized zero-shot learning.</span>

                                        <span>Image style transfer aims to manipulate the appearance of a source image, or
&quot;content&quot; image, to share similar texture and colors of a target &quot;style&quot; image.
Ideally, the style transfer manipulation should also preserve the semantic
content of the source image. A commonly used approach to assist in transferring
styles is based on Gram matrix optimization. One problem of Gram matrix-based
optimization is that it does not consider the correlation between colors and
their styles. Specifically, certain textures or structures should be associated
with specific colors. This is particularly challenging when the target style
image exhibits multiple style types. In this work, we propose a color-aware
multi-style transfer method that generates aesthetically pleasing results while
preserving the style-color correlation between style and generated images. We
achieve this desired outcome by introducing a simple but efficient modification
to classic Gram matrix-based style transfer optimization. A nice feature of our
method is that it enables the users to manually select the color associations
between the target style and content image for more transfer flexibility. We
validated our method with several qualitative comparisons, including a user
study conducted with 30 participants. In comparison with prior work, our method
is simple, easy to implement, and achieves visually appealing results when
targeting images that have multiple styles. Source code is available at

improved drastically in the past few years. Despite their impressive
performance, object detectors suffer from a lack of interpretability.
Visualization techniques have been developed and widely applied to introspect
the decisions made by other kinds of deep learning models; however, visualizing
object detectors has been underexplored. In this paper, we propose using
inversion as a primary tool to understand modern object detectors and develop
an optimization-based approach to layout inversion, allowing us to generate
synthetic images recognized by trained detectors as containing a desired
configuration of objects. We reveal intriguing properties of detectors by
applying our layout inversion technique to a variety of modern object
detectors, and further investigate them via validation experiments: they rely
on qualitatively different features for classification and regression; they
learn canonical motifs of commonly co-occurring objects; they use diff erent
visual cues to recognize objects of varying sizes. We hope our insights can
help practitioners improve object detectors.</span>

                                        <span>When trained at sufficient scale, auto-regressive language models exhibit the
notable ability to learn a new language task after being prompted with just a
few examples. Here, we present a simple, yet effective, approach for
transferring this few-shot learning ability to a multimodal setting (vision and
language). Using aligned image and caption data, we train a vision encoder to
represent each image as a sequence of continuous embeddings, such that a
pre-trained, frozen language model prompted with this prefix generates the
appropriate caption. The resulting system is a multimodal few-shot learner,
with the surprising ability to learn a variety of new tasks when conditioned on
examples, represented as a sequence of multiple interleaved image and text
embeddings. We demonstrate that it can rapidly learn words for new objects and
novel visual categories, do visual question-answering with only a handful of
examples, and make use of outside knowledge, by measuring a single model on a
variety of established and new benchmarks.</span>

counterpart in deep learning. Earlier works used the steering theorems and
presented convolutional networks equivariant to rigid transformations. In our
work, we propose a steerable feed-forward learning-based approach that consists
of spherical decision surfaces and operates on point clouds. Due to the
inherent geometric 3D structure of our theory, we derive a 3D steerability
constraint for its atomic parts, the hypersphere neurons. Exploiting the
rotational equivariance, we show how the model parameters are fully steerable
at inference time. The proposed spherical filter banks enable to make
equivariant and, after online optimization, invariant class predictions for
known synthetic point sets in unknown orientations.</span>

                                        <span>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been widely used for dimensionality
reduction and feature extraction. Robust PCA (RPCA), under different robust
distance metrics, such as l1-norm and l2, p-norm, can deal with noise or
outliers to some extent. However, real-world data may display structures that
can not be fully captured by these simple functions. In addition, existing
methods treat complex and simple samples equally. By contrast, a learning
pattern typically adopted by human beings is to learn from simple to complex
and less to more. Based on this principle, we propose a novel method called
Self-paced PCA (SPCA) to further reduce the effect of noise and outliers.
Notably, the complexity of each sample is calculated at the beginning of each
iteration in order to integrate samples from simple to more complex into
training. Based on an alternating optimization, SPCA finds an optimal
projection matrix and filters out outliers iteratively. Theoretical analysis is
presented to show the rationality of SPCA. Extensive experiments on popular
data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the state of-the-art
results considerably.</span>

                                        <span>Collaborative inference enables resource-constrained edge devices to make
inferences by uploading inputs (e.g., images) to a server (i.e., cloud) where
the heavy deep learning models run. While this setup works cost-effectively for
successful inferences, it severely underperforms when the model faces input
samples on which the model was not trained (known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
samples). If the edge devices could, at least, detect that an input sample is
an OOD, that could potentially save communication and computation resources by
not uploading those inputs to the server for inference workload. In this paper,
we propose a novel lightweight OOD detection approach that mines important
features from the shallow layers of a pretrained CNN model and detects an input
sample as ID (In-Distribution) or OOD based on a distance function defined on
the reduced feature space. Our technique (a) works on pretrained models without
any retraining of those models, and (b) does not expose itself to any OOD
dataset (all detection parameters are obtained from the ID training dataset).
To this end, we develop EARLIN (EARLy OOD detection for Collaborative
INference) that takes a pretrained model and partitions the model at the OOD
detection layer and deploys the considerably small OOD part on an edge device
and the rest on the cloud. By experimenting using real datasets and a prototype
implementation, we show that our technique achieves better results than other
approaches in terms of overall accuracy and cost when tested against popular
OOD datasets on top of popular deep learning models pretrained on benchmark
datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Highly constrained manipulation tasks continue to be challenging for
autonomous robots as they require high levels of precision, typically less than
1mm, which is often incompatible with what can be achieved by traditional
perception systems. This paper demonstrates that the combination of
state-of-the-art object tracking with passively adaptive mechanical hardware
can be leveraged to complete precision manipulation tasks with tight,
industrially-relevant tolerances (0.25mm). The proposed control method closes
the loop through vision by tracking the relative 6D pose of objects in the
relevant workspace. It adjusts the control reference of both the compliant
manipulator and the hand to complete object insertion tasks via within-hand
manipulation. Contrary to previous efforts for insertion, our method does not
require expensive force sensors, precision manipulators, or time-consuming,
online learning, which is data hungry. Instead, this effort leverages
mechanical compliance and utilizes an object agnostic manipulation model of the
hand learned offline, off-the-shelf motion planning, and an RGBD-based object
tracker trained solely with synthetic data. These features allow the proposed
system to easily generalize and transfer to new tasks and environments. This
paper describes in detail the system components and showcases its efficacy with
extensive experiments involving tight tolerance peg-in-hole insertion tasks of
various geometries as well as open-world constrained placement tasks.</span>

intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the
intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI.
Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or
two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center
of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered,
more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as
opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the
field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning
(EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation
problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a
taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison
of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments,
as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core
challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we
advocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers
real-world deployment.</span>

ResNeXt-56 are severely over-parameterized, necessitating a consequent increase
in the computational resources required for model training which scales
exponentially for increments in model depth. In this paper, we propose an
Entropy-Based Convolutional Layer Estimation (EBCLE) heuristic which is robust
and simple, yet effective in resolving the problem of over-parameterization
with regards to network depth of CNN model. The EBCLE heuristic employs a
priori knowledge of the entropic data distribution of input datasets to
determine an upper bound for convolutional network depth, beyond which identity
transformations are prevalent offering insignificant contributions for
enhancing model performance. Restricting depth redundancies by forcing feature
compression and abstraction restricts over-parameterization while decreasing
training time by 24.99% - 78.59% without degradation in model performance. We
present empirical evidence to emphasize the relative effectiveness of broader,
yet shallower models trained using the EBCLE heuristic, which maintains or
outperforms baseline classification accuracies of narrower yet deeper models.
The EBCLE heuristic is architecturally agnostic and EBCLE based CNN models
restrict depth redundancies resulting in enhanced utilization of the available
computational resources. The proposed EBCLE heuristic is a compelling technique
for researchers to analytically justify their HyperParameter (HP) choices for
CNNs. Empirical validation of the EBCLE heuristic in training CNN models was
established on five benchmarking datasets (ImageNet32, CIFAR-10/100, STL-10,
MNIST) and four network architectures (DenseNet, ResNet, ResNeXt and
EfficientNet B0-B2) with appropriate statistical tests employed to infer any
conclusive claims presented in this paper.</span>

                                        <span>In computer vision, recovering spatial information by filling in masked
regions, e.g., inpainting, has been widely investigated for its usability and
wide applicability to other various applications: image inpainting, image
extrapolation, and environment map estimation. Most of them are studied
separately depending on the applications. Our focus, however, is on
accommodating the opposite task, e.g., image outpainting, which would benefit
the target applications, e.g., image inpainting. Our self-supervision method,
In-N-Out, is summarized as a training approach that leverages the knowledge of
the opposite task into the target model. We empirically show that In-N-Out --
which explores the complementary information -- effectively takes advantage
over the traditional pipelines where only task-specific learning takes place in
training. In experiments, we compare our method to the traditional procedure
and analyze the effectiveness of our method on different applications: image
inpainting, image extrapolation, and environment map estimation. For these
tasks, we demonstrate that In-N-Out consistently improves the performance of
the recent works with In-N-Out self-supervision to their training procedure.
Also, we show that our approach achieves better results than an existing
training approach for outpainting.</span>

                                        <span>The recurrent mechanism has recently been introduced into U-Net in various
medical image segmentation tasks. Existing studies have focused on promoting
network recursion via reusing building blocks. Although network parameters
could be greatly saved, computational costs still increase inevitably in
accordance with the pre-set iteration time. In this work, we study a
multi-scale upgrade of a bi-directional skip connected network and then
automatically discover an efficient architecture by a novel two-phase Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm, namely BiX-NAS. Our proposed method
reduces the network computational cost by sifting out ineffective multi-scale
features at different levels and iterations. We evaluate BiX-NAS on two
segmentation tasks using three different medical image datasets, and the
experimental results show that our BiX-NAS searched architecture achieves the
state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower computational cost.</span>

feature mapping of the last layer to obtain the prediction output. However, it
can be difficulty to settle the optimal network depth and make the middle
layers learn distinguished features. This paper proposes the Interflow
algorithm specially for traditional CNN models. Interflow divides CNNs into
several stages according to the depth and makes predictions by the feature
mappings in each stage. Subsequently, we input these prediction branches into a
well-designed attention module, which learns the weights of these prediction
branches, aggregates them and obtains the final output. Interflow weights and
fuses the features learned in both shallower and deeper layers, making the
feature information at each stage processed reasonably and effectively,
enabling the middle layers to learn more distinguished features, and enhancing
the model representation ability. In addition, Interflow can alleviate gradient
vanishing problem, lower the difficulty of network depth selection, and lighten
possible over-fitting problem by introducing attention mechanism. Besides, it
can avoid network degradation as a byproduct. Compared with the original model,
the CNN model with Interflow achieves higher test accuracy on multiple
benchmark datasets.</span>

classifier on a given input datum. Deep neural networks commonly used for image
classification are deterministic maps from an input image to an output class.
As such, their outcome on a given datum involves no uncertainty, so we must
specify what variability we are referring to when defining, measuring and
interpreting &quot;confidence.&quot; To this end, we introduce the Wellington Posterior,
which is the distribution of outcomes that would have been obtained in response
to data that could have been generated by the same scene that produced the
given image. Since there are infinitely many scenes that could have generated
the given image, the Wellington Posterior requires induction from scenes other
than the one portrayed. We explore alternate methods using data augmentation,
ensembling, and model linearization. Additional alternatives include generative
adversarial networks, conditional prior networks, and supervised single-view
reconstruction. We test these alternatives against the empirical posterior
obtained by inferring the class of temporally adjacent frames in a video. These
developments are only a small step towards assessing the reliability of deep
network classifiers in a manner that is compatible with safety-critical
applications.</span>

associated with image classification using machine learning algorithms, named
the nonuniform defocus removal (NDR) problem. Mathematical analysis of the NDR
problem is done and the so-called defocus removal (DR) algorithm for solving it
is proposed. Global convergence of the DR algorithm is established without
imposing any unverifiable assumption. Numerical results on simulation data show
significant features of DR including solvability, noise robustness,
convergence, model insensitivity and computational efficiency. Physical
relevance of the NDR problem and practicability of the DR algorithm are tested
on experimental data. Back to the application that originally motivated the
investigation of the NDR problem, we show that the DR algorithm can improve the
accuracy of classifying distorted images using convolutional neural networks.
The key difference of this paper compared to most existing works on
single-frame anisoplanatic deconvolution is that the new method does not
require the data image to be decomposable into isoplanatic subregions.
Therefore, solution approaches partitioning the image into isoplanatic zones
are not applicable to the NDR problem and those handling the entire image such
as the DR algorithm need to be developed and analyzed.</span>

for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Concretely, this network contains
two parts that separately named spatial graph reasoning subnetwork (SAGRN) and
spectral graph reasoning subnetwork (SEGRN) to capture the spatial and spectral
graph contexts, respectively. Different from the previous approaches
implementing superpixel segmentation on the original image or attempting to
obtain the category features under the guide of label image, we perform the
superpixel segmentation on intermediate features of the network to adaptively
produce the homogeneous regions to get the effective descriptors. Then, we
adopt a similar idea in spectral part that reasonably aggregating the channels
to generate spectral descriptors for spectral graph contexts capturing. All
graph reasoning procedures in SAGRN and SEGRN are achieved through graph
convolution. To guarantee the global perception ability of the proposed
methods, all adjacent matrices in graph reasoning are obtained with the help of
non-local self-attention mechanism. At last, by combining the extracted spatial
and spectral graph contexts, we obtain the SSGRN to achieve a high accuracy
classification. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on three

                                        <span>In this paper, we leverage the properties of non-Euclidean Geometry to define
the Geodesic distance (GD) on the space of statistical manifolds. The Geodesic
distance is a real and intuitive similarity measure that is a good alternative
to the purely statistical and extensively used Kullback-Leibler divergence
(KLD). Despite the effectiveness of the GD, a closed-form does not exist for
many manifolds, since the geodesic equations are hard to solve. This explains
that the major studies have been content to use numerical approximations.
Nevertheless, most of those do not take account of the manifold properties,
which leads to a loss of information and thus to low performances. We propose
an approximation of the Geodesic distance through a graph-based method. This
latter permits to well represent the structure of the statistical manifold, and
respects its geometrical properties. Our main aim is to compare the graph-based
approximation to the state of the art approximations. Thus, the proposed
approach is evaluated for two statistical manifolds, namely the Weibull
manifold and the Gamma manifold, considering the Content-Based Texture
Retrieval application on different databases.</span>

in the field of high dimensional data classification. In this paper, we present
a novel classification framework using functional data and classwise Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). Our proposed method can be used in high dimensional
time series data which typically suffers from small sample size problem. Our
method extracts a piece wise linear functional feature space and is
particularly suitable for hard classification problems.The proposed framework
converts time series data into functional data and uses classwise functional
PCA for feature extraction followed by classification using a Bayesian linear
classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method by applying it
to both synthetic data sets and real time series data from diverse fields
including but not limited to neuroscience, food science, medical sciences and
chemometrics.</span>

yarn geometrical features in woven composites so that a direct parametrization
of the textile reinforcement is achieved (e.g., FE mesh). Thus, our aim is not
only to perform yarn segmentation from tomographic images but rather to provide
a complete descriptive modeling of the fabric. As such, this direct approach
improves on previous methods that use voxel-wise masks as intermediate
representations followed by re-meshing operations (yarn envelope estimation).
The proposed approach employs two deep neural network architectures (U-Net and
Mask RCNN). First, we train the U-Net to generate synthetic CT images from the
corresponding FE simulations. This allows to generate large quantities of
annotated data without requiring costly manual annotations. This data is then
used to train the Mask R-CNN, which is focused on predicting contour points
around each of the yarns in the image. Experimental results show that our
method is accurate and robust for performing yarn instance segmentation on CT
images, this is further validated by quantitative and qualitative analyses.</span>

domain translation problem between different sensor modalities with unique data
formats. By relying only on the semantics of the scene, our modular generative
framework can, for the first time, synthesize a panoramic color image from a
given full 3D LiDAR point cloud. The framework starts with semantic
segmentation of the point cloud, which is initially projected onto a spherical
surface. The same semantic segmentation is applied to the corresponding camera
image. Next, our new conditional generative model adversarially learns to
translate the predicted LiDAR segment maps to the camera image counterparts.
Finally, generated image segments are processed to render the panoramic scene
images. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation on the SemanticKitti
dataset and show that our proposed framework outperforms other strong baseline
models.

                                        <span>Modern E-commerce websites contain heterogeneous sources of information, such
as numerical ratings, textual reviews and images. These information can be
utilized to assist recommendation. Through textual reviews, a user explicitly
express her affinity towards the item. Previous researchers found that by using
the information extracted from these reviews, we can better profile the users&#x27;
explicit preferences as well as the item features, leading to the improvement
of recommendation performance. However, most of the previous algorithms were
only utilizing the review information for explicit-feedback problem i.e. rating
prediction, and when it comes to implicit-feedback ranking problem such as
top-N recommendation, the usage of review information has not been fully
explored. Seeing this gap, in this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
textual review information for top-N recommendation under E-commerce settings.
We adapt several SOTA review-based rating prediction models for top-N
recommendation tasks and compare them to existing top-N recommendation models
from both performance and efficiency. We find that models utilizing only review
information can not achieve better performances than vanilla implicit-feedback
matrix factorization method. When utilizing review information as a regularizer
or auxiliary information, the performance of implicit-feedback matrix
factorization method can be further improved. However, the optimal model
structure to utilize textual reviews for E-commerce top-N recommendation is yet
to be determined.</span>

                                        <span>Sequential recommendation aims to leverage users&#x27; historical behaviors to
predict their next interaction. Existing works have not yet addressed two main
challenges in sequential recommendation. First, user behaviors in their rich
historical sequences are often implicit and noisy preference signals, they
cannot sufficiently reflect users&#x27; actual preferences. In addition, users&#x27;
dynamic preferences often change rapidly over time, and hence it is difficult
to capture user patterns in their historical sequences. In this work, we
propose a graph neural network model called SURGE (short for SeqUential
Recommendation with Graph neural nEtworks) to address these two issues.
Specifically, SURGE integrates different types of preferences in long-term user
behaviors into clusters in the graph by re-constructing loose item sequences
into tight item-item interest graphs based on metric learning. This helps
explicitly distinguish users&#x27; core interests, by forming dense clusters in the
interest graph. Then, we perform cluster-aware and query-aware graph
convolutional propagation and graph pooling on the constructed graph. It
dynamically fuses and extracts users&#x27; current activated core interests from
noisy user behavior sequences. We conduct extensive experiments on both public
and proprietary industrial datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
significant performance gains of our proposed method compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Further studies on sequence length confirm that our
method can model long behavioral sequences effectively and efficiently.</span>

hampered by the difficulty of gathering enough annotated data for training deep
learning methods, giving rise to a variety of small datasets and associated
dataset-specific methods. Moreover, typical tasks such as classification and
retrieval lack a systematic evaluation on standard benchmarks and training
datasets, which make it hard to identify durable and generalizable scientific
contributions. We aim at unifying remote sensing image retrieval and
classification with a new large-scale training and testing dataset, SF300,
including both vertical and oblique aerial images and made available to the
research community, and an associated fine-tuning method. We additionally

                                        <span>Most sequential recommendation models capture the features of consecutive
items in a user-item interaction history. Though effective, their
representation expressiveness is still hindered by the sparse learning signals.
As a result, the sequential recommender is prone to make inconsistent
predictions. In this paper, we propose a model, \textbf{SSI}, to improve
sequential recommendation consistency with Self-Supervised Imitation.
Precisely, we extract the consistency knowledge by utilizing three
self-supervised pre-training tasks, where temporal consistency and persona
consistency capture user-interaction dynamics in terms of the chronological
order and persona sensitivities, respectively. Furthermore, to provide the
model with a global perspective, global session consistency is introduced by
maximizing the mutual information among global and local interaction sequences.
Finally, to comprehensively take advantage of all three independent aspects of
consistency-enhanced knowledge, we establish an integrated imitation learning
framework. The consistency knowledge is effectively internalized and
transferred to the student model by imitating the conventional prediction logit
as well as the consistency-enhanced item representations. In addition, the
flexible self-supervised imitation framework can also benefit other student
recommenders. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that SSI effectively
outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.</span>

content delivery. The trend now is to create presentations, and then
subsequently deliver the same using various virtual meeting platforms. The time
being spent in such creation of presentations and delivering is what we try to
reduce and eliminate through this paper which aims to use Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules to automate the
process of creating a slides-based presentation from a document, and then use
state-of-the-art voice cloning models to deliver the content in the desired
author&#x27;s voice. We consider a structured document such as a research paper to
be the content that has to be presented. The research paper is first summarized
using BERT summarization techniques and condensed into bullet points that go
into the slides. Tacotron inspired architecture with Encoder, Synthesizer, and
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based vocoder, is used to convey the
contents of the slides in the author&#x27;s voice (or any customized voice). Almost
all learning has now been shifted to online mode, and professionals are now
working from the comfort of their homes. Due to the current situation, teachers
and professionals have shifted to presentations to help them in imparting
information. In this paper, we aim to reduce the considerable amount of time
that is taken in creating a presentation by automating this process and
subsequently delivering this presentation in a customized voice, using a
content delivery mechanism that can clone any voice using a short audio clip.</span>

automation of the working process of the Indian Judiciary System. The manual
working procedures and documentation at any level (from lower to higher court)
of the judiciary system are very complex in nature. The systems produced as a
part of this track would assist the law practitioners. It would be helpful for
common men too. This kind of track also opens the path of research of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in the judicial domain. This track defined two
problems such as Task 1: Identifying relevant prior cases for a given situation
and Task 2: Identifying the most relevant statutes for a given situation. We
tackled both of them. Our proposed approaches are based on BM25 and Doc2Vec. As
per the results declared by the task organizers, we are in 3rd and a modest
position in Task 1 and Task 2 respectively.</span>

                                        <span>Multimodal sentiment analysis benefits various applications such as
human-computer interaction and recommendation systems. It aims to infer the
users&#x27; bipolar ideas using visual, textual, and acoustic signals. Although
researchers affirm the association between cognitive cues and emotional
manifestations, most of the current multimodal approaches in sentiment analysis
disregard user-specific aspects. To tackle this issue, we devise a novel method
to perform multimodal sentiment prediction using cognitive cues, such as
personality. Our framework constructs an adaptive tree by hierarchically
dividing users and trains the LSTM-based submodels, utilizing an
attention-based fusion to transfer cognitive-oriented knowledge within the
tree. Subsequently, the framework consumes the conclusive agglomerative
knowledge from the adaptive tree to predict final sentiments. We also devise a
dynamic dropout method to facilitate data sharing between neighboring nodes,
reducing data sparsity. The empirical results on real-world datasets determine
that our proposed model for sentiment prediction can surpass trending rivals.
Moreover, compared to other ensemble approaches, the proposed transfer-based
algorithm can better utilize the latent cognitive cues and foster the
prediction outcomes. Based on the given extrinsic and intrinsic analysis
results, we note that compared to other theoretical-based techniques, the
proposed hierarchical clustering approach can better group the users within the
adaptive tree.</span>

technical documents created by engineers and managers in supporting relevant
decision making have increased dramatically in recent years, which has led to a
higher demand for more scalable, accurate, and automated document
classification. Prior studies have primarily focused on processing text for
classification and small-scale databases. This paper describes a novel
multimodal deep learning architecture, called TechDoc, for technical document
classification, which utilizes both natural language and descriptive images to
train hierarchical classifiers. The architecture synthesizes convolutional
neural networks and recurrent neural networks through an integrated training
process. We applied the architecture to a large multimodal technical document
database and trained the model for classifying documents based on the
hierarchical International Patent Classification system. Our results show that
the trained neural network presents a greater classification accuracy than
those using a single modality and several earlier text classification methods.
The trained model can potentially be scaled to millions of real-world technical
documents with both text and figures, which is useful for data and knowledge
management in large technology companies and organizations.</span>

                                        <span>One key property in recommender systems is the long-tail distribution in
user-item interactions where most items only have few user feedback. Improving
the recommendation of tail items can promote novelty and bring positive effects
to both users and providers, and thus is a desirable property of recommender
systems. Current novel recommendation studies over-emphasize the importance of
tail items without differentiating the degree of users&#x27; intent on popularity
and often incur a sharp decline of accuracy. Moreover, none of existing methods
has ever taken the extreme case of tail items, i.e., cold-start items without
any interaction, into consideration.

In this work, we first disclose the mechanism that drives a user&#x27;s
interaction towards popular or niche items by disentangling her intent into
conformity influence (popularity) and personal interests (preference). We then
present a unified end-to-end framework to simultaneously optimize accuracy and
novelty targets based on the disentangled intent of popularity and that of
preference. We further develop a new paradigm for novel recommendation of
cold-start items which exploits the self-supervised learning technique to model
the correlation between collaborative features and content features. We conduct
extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets. The results
demonstrate that our proposed model yields significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, novelty, coverage, and
trade-off.</span>

duties of multi-sided recommender systems. Item providers are key stakeholders
in online platforms, and their earnings and plans are influenced by the
exposure their items receive in recommended lists. Prior work showed that
certain minority groups of providers, characterized by a common sensitive
attribute (e.g., gender or race), are being disproportionately affected by
indirect and unintentional discrimination. Our study in this paper handles a
situation where ($i$) the same provider is associated with multiple items of a
list suggested to a user, ($ii$) an item is created by more than one provider
jointly, and ($iii$) predicted user-item relevance scores are biasedly
estimated for items of provider groups. Under this scenario, we assess
disparities in relevance, visibility, and exposure, by simulating diverse
representations of the minority group in the catalog and the interactions.
Based on emerged unfair outcomes, we devise a treatment that combines
observation upsampling and loss regularization, while learning user-item
relevance scores. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our treatment
leads to lower disparate relevance. The resulting recommended lists show fairer
visibility and exposure, higher minority item coverage, and negligible loss in
recommendation utility.</span>

ranking information. However, their outputs are often subjected to bias that
can lead to skewed representation of subjects such as professional occupations
or gender. In our paper, we use a mixed-method approach to investigate presence
of race and gender bias in representation of artificial intelligence (AI) in
image search results coming from six different search engines. Our findings
show that search engines prioritize anthropomorphic images of AI that portray
it as white, whereas non-white images of AI are present only in non-Western
search engines. By contrast, gender representation of AI is more diverse and
less skewed towards a specific gender that can be attributed to higher
awareness about gender bias in search outputs. Our observations indicate both
the the need and the possibility for addressing bias in representation of
societally relevant subjects, such as technological innovation, and emphasize
the importance of designing new approaches for detecting bias in information
retrieval systems.</span>

can enable the use of radiology report information for a variety of critical
healthcare applications. In our work, we present RadGraph, a dataset of
entities and relations in full-text chest X-ray radiology reports based on a
novel information extraction schema we designed to structure radiology reports.
We release a development dataset, which contains board-certified radiologist
annotations for 500 radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR dataset (14,579
entities and 10,889 relations), and a test dataset, which contains two
independent sets of board-certified radiologist annotations for 100 radiology
reports split equally across the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert datasets. Using these
datasets, we train and test a deep learning model, RadGraph Benchmark, that
achieves a micro F1 of 0.82 and 0.73 on relation extraction on the MIMIC-CXR
and CheXpert test sets respectively. Additionally, we release an inference
dataset, which contains annotations automatically generated by RadGraph
Benchmark across 220,763 MIMIC-CXR reports (around 6 million entities and 4
million relations) and 500 CheXpert reports (13,783 entities and 9,908

                                        <span>Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is among the most widely used algorithms
in reinforcement learning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in many
challenging problems. The keys to its success are the reliable policy updates
through the clipping mechanism and the multiple epochs of minibatch updates.
The aim of this research is to give new simple but effective alternatives to
the former. For this, we propose linearly and exponentially decaying clipping
range approaches throughout the training. With these, we would like to provide
higher exploration at the beginning and stronger restrictions at the end of the
learning phase. We investigate their performance in several classical control
and locomotive robotic environments. During the analysis, we found that they
influence the achieved rewards and are effective alternatives to the constant
clipping method in many reinforcement learning tasks.</span>

                                        <span>An in-depth understanding of the particular environment is crucial in
reinforcement learning (RL). To address this challenge, the decision-making
process of a mobile collaborative robotic assistant modeled by the Markov
decision process (MDP) framework is studied in this paper. The optimal
state-action combinations of the MDP are calculated with the non-linear Bellman
optimality equations. This system of equations can be solved with relative ease
by the computational power of Wolfram Mathematica, where the obtained optimal
action-values point to the optimal policy. Unlike other RL algorithms, this
methodology does not approximate the optimal behavior, it gives the exact,
explicit solution, which provides a strong foundation for our study. With this,
we offer new insights into understanding the action selection mechanisms in RL
by presenting various small modifications on the very same schema that lead to
different optimal policies.</span>

                                        <span>Consider a regression problem where the learner is given a large collection
of $d$-dimensional data points, but can only query a small subset of the
real-valued labels. How many queries are needed to obtain a $1+\epsilon$
relative error approximation of the optimum? While this problem has been
extensively studied for least squares regression, little is known for other
losses. An important example is least absolute deviation regression ($\ell_1$
regression) which enjoys superior robustness to outliers compared to least
squares. We develop a new framework for analyzing importance sampling methods
in regression problems, which enables us to show that the query complexity of
least absolute deviation regression is $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ up to logarithmic
factors. We further extend our techniques to show the first bounds on the query
complexity for any $\ell_p$ loss with $p\in(1,2)$. As a key novelty in our
analysis, we introduce the notion of robust uniform convergence, which is a new
approximation guarantee for the empirical loss. While it is inspired by uniform
convergence in statistical learning, our approach additionally incorporates a
correction term to avoid unnecessary variance due to outliers. This can be
viewed as a new connection between statistical learning theory and variance
reduction techniques in stochastic optimization, which should be of independent
interest.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning analysis of longitudinal neuroimaging data is typically
based on supervised learning, which requires a large number of ground-truth
labels to be informative. As ground-truth labels are often missing or expensive
to obtain in neuroscience, we avoid them in our analysis by combing factor
disentanglement with self-supervised learning to identify changes and
consistencies across the multiple MRIs acquired of each individual over time.
Specifically, we propose a new definition of disentanglement by formulating a
multivariate mapping between factors (e.g., brain age) associated with an MRI
and a latent image representation. Then, factors that evolve across
acquisitions of longitudinal sequences are disentangled from that mapping by
self-supervised learning in such a way that changes in a single factor induce
change along one direction in the representation space. We implement this
model, named Longitudinal Self-Supervised Learning (LSSL), via a standard
autoencoding structure with a cosine loss to disentangle brain age from the
image representation. We apply LSSL to two longitudinal neuroimaging studies to
highlight its strength in extracting the brain-age information from MRI and
revealing informative characteristics associated with neurodegenerative and
neuropsychological disorders. Moreover, the representations learned by LSSL
facilitate supervised classification by recording faster convergence and higher
(or similar) prediction accuracy compared to several other representation
learning techniques.</span>

performance in uncertainty estimation and lead to accuracy improvement. In this
work, we focus on a classification problem and investigate the behavior of both
non-calibrated and calibrated negative log-likelihood (CNLL) of a deep ensemble
as a function of the ensemble size and the member network size. We indicate the
conditions under which CNLL follows a power law w.r.t. ensemble size or member
network size, and analyze the dynamics of the parameters of the discovered
power laws. Our important practical finding is that one large network may
perform worse than an ensemble of several medium-size networks with the same
total number of parameters (we call this ensemble a memory split). Using the
detected power law-like dependencies, we can predict (1) the possible gain from
the ensembling of networks with given structure, (2) the optimal memory split
given a memory budget, based on a relatively small number of trained networks.

                                        <span>Signal processing, communications, and control have traditionally relied on
classical statistical modeling techniques. Such model-based methods utilize
mathematical formulations that represent the underlying physics, prior
information and additional domain knowledge. Simple classical models are useful
but sensitive to inaccuracies and may lead to poor performance when real
systems display complex or dynamic behavior. On the other hand, purely
data-driven approaches that are model-agnostic are becoming increasingly
popular as datasets become abundant and the power of modern deep learning
pipelines increases. Deep neural networks (DNNs) use generic architectures
which learn to operate from data, and demonstrate excellent performance,
especially for supervised problems. However, DNNs typically require massive
amounts of data and immense computational resources, limiting their
applicability for some signal processing scenarios. We are interested in hybrid
techniques that combine principled mathematical models with data-driven systems
to benefit from the advantages of both approaches. Such model-based deep
learning methods exploit both partial domain knowledge, via mathematical
structures designed for specific problems, as well as learning from limited
data. In this article we survey the leading approaches for studying and
designing model-based deep learning systems. We divide hybrid
model-based/data-driven systems into categories based on their inference
mechanism. We provide a comprehensive review of the leading approaches for
combining model-based algorithms with deep learning in a systematic manner,
along with concrete guidelines and detailed signal processing oriented examples
from recent literature. Our aim is to facilitate the design and study of future
systems on the intersection of signal processing and machine learning that
incorporate the advantages of both domains.</span>

                                        <span>Graph neural networks have been widely used on modeling graph data, achieving
impressive results on node classification and link prediction tasks. Yet,
obtaining an accurate representation for a graph further requires a pooling
function that maps a set of node representations into a compact form. A simple
sum or average over all node representations considers all node features
equally without consideration of their task relevance, and any structural
dependencies among them. Recently proposed hierarchical graph pooling methods,
on the other hand, may yield the same representation for two different graphs
that are distinguished by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, as they suboptimally
preserve information from the node features. To tackle these limitations of
existing graph pooling methods, we first formulate the graph pooling problem as
a multiset encoding problem with auxiliary information about the graph
structure, and propose a Graph Multiset Transformer (GMT) which is a multi-head
attention based global pooling layer that captures the interaction between
nodes according to their structural dependencies. We show that GMT satisfies
both injectiveness and permutation invariance, such that it is at most as
powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. Moreover, our methods
can be easily extended to the previous node clustering approaches for
hierarchical graph pooling. Our experimental results show that GMT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph
classification benchmarks with high memory and time efficiency, and obtains
even larger performance gain on graph reconstruction and generation tasks.</span>

their convergence rates and ultimate accuracy as a function of the problem
structure. Such instance-specific behavior is not captured by existing global
minimax bounds, which are worst-case in nature. We analyze the problem of
estimating optimal $Q$-value functions for a discounted Markov decision process
with discrete states and actions and identify an instance-dependent functional
that controls the difficulty of estimation in the $\ell_\infty$-norm. Using a
local minimax framework, we show that this functional arises in lower bounds on
the accuracy on any estimation procedure. In the other direction, we establish
the sharpness of our lower bounds, up to factors logarithmic in the state and
action spaces, by analyzing a variance-reduced version of $Q$-learning. Our
theory provides a precise way of distinguishing &quot;easy&quot; problems from &quot;hard&quot;

                                        <span>In this work, we focus on large graph similarity computation problem and
propose a novel &quot;embedding-coarsening-matching&quot; learning framework, which
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in this task and has significant
improvement in time efficiency. Graph similarity computation for metrics such
as Graph Edit Distance (GED) is typically NP-hard, and existing
heuristics-based algorithms usually achieves a unsatisfactory trade-off between
accuracy and efficiency. Recently the development of deep learning techniques
provides a promising solution for this problem by a data-driven approach which
trains a network to encode graphs to their own feature vectors and computes
similarity based on feature vectors. These deep-learning methods can be
classified to two categories, embedding models and matching models. Embedding
models such as GCN-Mean and GCN-Max, which directly map graphs to respective
feature vectors, run faster but the performance is usually poor due to the lack
of interactions across graphs. Matching models such as GMN, whose encoding
process involves interaction across the two graphs, are more accurate but
interaction between whole graphs brings a significant increase in time
consumption (at least quadratic time complexity over number of nodes). Inspired
by large biological molecular identification where the whole molecular is first
mapped to functional groups and then identified based on these functional
groups, our &quot;embedding-coarsening-matching&quot; learning framework first embeds and
coarsens large graphs to coarsened graphs with denser local topology and then
matching mechanism is deployed on the coarsened graphs for the final similarity
scores. Detailed experiments have been conducted and the results demonstrate
the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed framework.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools in learning sophisticated but
fixed mapping rules between inputs and outputs, thereby limiting their
application in more complex and dynamic situations in which the mapping rules
are not kept the same but changing according to different contexts. To lift
such limits, we developed a novel approach involving a learning algorithm,
called orthogonal weights modification (OWM), with the addition of a
context-dependent processing (CDP) module. We demonstrated that with OWM to
overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting, and the CDP module to learn
how to reuse a feature representation and a classifier for different contexts,
a single network can acquire numerous context-dependent mapping rules in an
online and continual manner, with as few as $\sim$10 samples to learn each.
This should enable highly compact systems to gradually learn myriad
regularities of the real world and eventually behave appropriately within it.</span>

                                        <span>As predictive models are increasingly being deployed to make a variety of
consequential decisions, there is a growing emphasis on designing algorithms
that can provide recourse to affected individuals. Existing recourse algorithms
function under the assumption that the underlying predictive model does not
change. However, models are regularly updated in practice for several reasons
including data distribution shifts. In this work, we make the first attempt at
understanding how model updates resulting from data distribution shifts impact
the algorithmic recourses generated by state-of-the-art algorithms. We carry
out a rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis to address the above
question. Our theoretical results establish a lower bound on the probability of
recourse invalidation due to model shifts, and show the existence of a tradeoff
between this invalidation probability and typical notions of &quot;cost&quot; minimized
by modern recourse generation algorithms. We experiment with multiple synthetic
and real world datasets, capturing different kinds of distribution shifts
including temporal shifts, geospatial shifts, and shifts due to data
correction. These experiments demonstrate that model updation due to all the
aforementioned distribution shifts can potentially invalidate recourses
generated by state-of-the-art algorithms. Our findings thus not only expose
previously unknown flaws in the current recourse generation paradigm, but also
pave the way for fundamentally rethinking the design and development of
recourse generation algorithms.</span>

in the local model of differential privacy. Unlike in the non-private
literature, differentially private algorithms for the $k$-means objective incur
both additive and multiplicative errors. Our algorithm significantly reduces
the additive error while keeping the multiplicative error the same as in
previous state-of-the-art results. Specifically, on a database of size $n$, our
algorithm guarantees $O(1)$ multiplicative error and $\approx n^{1/2+a}$
additive error for an arbitrarily small constant $a&gt;0$. All previous algorithms
in the local model had additive error $\approx n^{2/3+a}$. Our techniques
extend to $k$-median clustering.

We show that the additive error we obtain is almost optimal in terms of its
dependency on the database size $n$. Specifically, we give a simple lower bound
showing that every locally-private algorithm for the $k$-means objective must
have additive error at least $\approx\sqrt{n}$.</span>

                                        <span>Object recognition in the real-world requires handling long-tailed or even
open-ended data. An ideal visual system needs to recognize the populated head
visual concepts reliably and meanwhile efficiently learn about emerging new
tail categories with a few training instances. Class-balanced many-shot
learning and few-shot learning tackle one side of this problem, by either
learning strong classifiers for head or learning to learn few-shot classifiers
for the tail. In this paper, we investigate the problem of generalized few-shot
learning (GFSL) -- a model during the deployment is required to learn about
tail categories with few shots and simultaneously classify the head classes. We
propose the ClAssifier SynThesis LEarning (CASTLE), a learning framework that
learns how to synthesize calibrated few-shot classifiers in addition to the
multi-class classifiers of head classes with a shared neural dictionary,
shedding light upon the inductive GFSL. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive
version of CASTLE (ACASTLE) that adapts the head classifiers conditioned on the
incoming tail training examples, yielding a framework that allows effective
backward knowledge transfer. As a consequence, ACASTLE can handle GFSL with
classes from heterogeneous domains effectively. CASTLE and ACASTLE demonstrate
superior performances than existing GFSL algorithms and strong baselines on
MiniImageNet as well as TieredImageNet datasets. More interestingly, they
outperform previous state-of-the-art methods when evaluated with standard
few-shot learning criteria.</span>

                                        <span>Although achieving remarkable progress, it is very difficult to induce a
supervised classifier without any labeled data. Unsupervised domain adaptation
is able to overcome this challenge by transferring knowledge from a labeled
source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Transferability and
discriminability are two key criteria for characterizing the superiority of
feature representations to enable successful domain adaptation. In this paper,
a novel method called \textit{learning TransFerable and Discriminative Features
for unsupervised domain adaptation} (TFDF) is proposed to optimize these two
objectives simultaneously. On the one hand, distribution alignment is performed
to reduce domain discrepancy and learn more transferable representations.
Instead of adopting \textit{Maximum Mean Discrepancy} (MMD) which only captures
the first-order statistical information to measure distribution discrepancy, we
adopt a recently proposed statistic called \textit{Maximum Mean and Covariance
Discrepancy} (MMCD), which can not only capture the first-order statistical
information but also capture the second-order statistical information in the
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). On the other hand, we propose to
explore both local discriminative information via manifold regularization and
global discriminative information via minimizing the proposed \textit{class
confusion} objective to learn more discriminative features, respectively. We
integrate these two objectives into the \textit{Structural Risk Minimization}
(RSM) framework and learn a domain-invariant classifier. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on five real-world datasets and the results verify
the effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

system, which is used to perceive the surrounding world. While making a
prediction, the human brain tends to relate crucial cues from multiple sources
of information. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal fusion module that
learns to emphasize more contributive features across all modalities.
Specifically, the proposed Multimodal Split Attention Fusion (MSAF) module
splits each modality into channel-wise equal feature blocks and creates a joint
representation that is used to generate soft attention for each channel across
the feature blocks. Further, the MSAF module is designed to be compatible with
features of various spatial dimensions and sequence lengths, suitable for both
CNNs and RNNs. Thus, MSAF can be easily added to fuse features of any unimodal
networks and utilize existing pretrained unimodal model weights. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of our fusion module, we design three multimodal networks
with MSAF for emotion recognition, sentiment analysis, and action recognition
tasks. Our approach achieves competitive results in each task and outperforms
other application-specific networks and multimodal fusion benchmarks.</span>

user knowledge and statistical data. The algorithms have two components: a
scoring metric and a search procedure. The scoring metric takes a network
structure, statistical data, and a user&#x27;s prior knowledge, and returns a score
proportional to the posterior probability of the network structure given the
data. The search procedure generates networks for evaluation by the scoring
metric. Previous work has concentrated on metrics for domains containing only
discrete variables, under the assumption that data represents a multinomial
sample. In this paper, we extend this work, developing scoring metrics for
domains containing all continuous variables or a mixture of discrete and
continuous variables, under the assumption that continuous data is sampled from
a multivariate normal distribution. Our work extends traditional statistical
approaches for identifying vanishing regression coefficients in that we
identify two important assumptions, called event equivalence and parameter
modularity, that when combined allow the construction of prior distributions
for multivariate normal parameters from a single prior Bayesian network

                                        <span>We study the asymmetric low-rank factorization problem: \[\min_{\mathbf{U}
\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}, \mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}}
\frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{U}\mathbf{V}^\top -\mathbf{\Sigma}\|_F^2\] where
$\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is a given matrix of size $m \times n$ and rank $d$. This is
a canonical problem that admits two difficulties in optimization: 1)
non-convexity and 2) non-smoothness (due to unbalancedness of $\mathbf{U}$ and
$\mathbf{V}$). This is also a prototype for more complex problems such as
asymmetric matrix sensing and matrix completion. Despite being non-convex and
non-smooth, it has been observed empirically that the randomly initialized
gradient descent algorithm can solve this problem in polynomial time. Existing
theories to explain this phenomenon all require artificial modifications of the
algorithm, such as adding noise in each iteration and adding a balancing
regularizer to balance the $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$.

This paper presents the first proof that shows randomly initialized gradient
descent converges to a global minimum of the asymmetric low-rank factorization
problem with a polynomial rate. For the proof, we develop 1) a new
symmetrization technique to capture the magnitudes of the symmetry and
asymmetry, and 2) a quantitative perturbation analysis to approximate matrix
derivatives. We believe both are useful for other related non-convex problems.</span>

the classical two-dimensional (2D) RadViz that visualizes multivariate data in
the 2D plane by mapping every observation to a point inside the unit circle. We
show that distributing anchor points uniformly on the 3D unit sphere provides
the best visualization with minimal artificial visual correlation for data with
uncorrelated variables. However, anchor points can be placed exactly
equi-distant from each other only for the five Platonic solids. We provide
equi-distant anchor points for these five settings, and approximately
equi-distant anchor points via a Fibonacci grid for the other cases. Our
methodology, implemented in the R package $radviz3d$, makes fully 3D RadViz
possible and is shown to improve clarity of this nonlinear display technique on

constant increase in contribution to the electrical power grids. Solar energy
is one of the most significant contributors to renewable energy and is
dependent on solar irradiation. For the effective management of electrical
power grids, forecasting models that predict solar irradiation, with high
accuracy, are needed. In the current study, Machine Learning techniques such as
Linear Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Genetic Algorithm Optimization
are used to forecast solar irradiation. The data used for training and
validation is recorded from across three different geographical stations in the
United States that are part of the SURFRAD network. A Global Horizontal Index
(GHI) is predicted for the models built and compared. Genetic Algorithm
Optimization is applied to XGB to further improve the accuracy of solar

object detection and image segmentation across various domains such as
healthcare and autonomous driving. At the heart of this performance lies neural
architecture design which relies heavily on domain knowledge and prior
experience on the researchers&#x27; behalf. More recently, this process of finding
the most optimal architectures, given an initial search space of possible
operations, was automated by Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper,
we evaluate the robustness of one such algorithm known as Efficient NAS (ENAS)
against data agnostic poisoning attacks on the original search space with
carefully designed ineffective operations. By evaluating algorithm performance
on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we empirically demonstrate how our novel search space
poisoning (SSP) approach and multiple-instance poisoning attacks exploit design
flaws in the ENAS controller to result in inflated prediction error rates for
child networks. Our results provide insights into the challenges to surmount in
using NAS for more adversarially robust architecture search.</span>

                                        <span>One approach to understanding complex data is to study its shape through the
lens of algebraic topology. While the early development of topological data
analysis focused primarily on static data, in recent years, theoretical and
applied studies have turned to data that varies in time. A time-varying
collection of metric spaces as formed, for example, by a moving school of fish
or flock of birds, can contain a vast amount of information. There is often a
need to simplify or summarize the dynamic behavior. We provide an introduction
to topological summaries of time-varying metric spaces including vineyards
[19], crocker plots [56], and multiparameter rank functions [37]. We then
introduce a new tool to summarize time-varying metric spaces: a crocker stack.
Crocker stacks are convenient for visualization, amenable to machine learning,
and satisfy a desirable continuity property which we prove. We demonstrate the
utility of crocker stacks for a parameter identification task involving an
influential model of biological aggregations [58]. Altogether, we aim to bring
the broader applied mathematics community up-to-date on topological summaries
of time-varying metric spaces.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet-50, DenseNet-40 and
ResNeXt-56 are severely over-parameterized, necessitating a consequent increase
in the computational resources required for model training which scales
exponentially for increments in model depth. In this paper, we propose an
Entropy-Based Convolutional Layer Estimation (EBCLE) heuristic which is robust
and simple, yet effective in resolving the problem of over-parameterization
with regards to network depth of CNN model. The EBCLE heuristic employs a
priori knowledge of the entropic data distribution of input datasets to
determine an upper bound for convolutional network depth, beyond which identity
transformations are prevalent offering insignificant contributions for
enhancing model performance. Restricting depth redundancies by forcing feature
compression and abstraction restricts over-parameterization while decreasing
training time by 24.99% - 78.59% without degradation in model performance. We
present empirical evidence to emphasize the relative effectiveness of broader,
yet shallower models trained using the EBCLE heuristic, which maintains or
outperforms baseline classification accuracies of narrower yet deeper models.
The EBCLE heuristic is architecturally agnostic and EBCLE based CNN models
restrict depth redundancies resulting in enhanced utilization of the available
computational resources. The proposed EBCLE heuristic is a compelling technique
for researchers to analytically justify their HyperParameter (HP) choices for
CNNs. Empirical validation of the EBCLE heuristic in training CNN models was
established on five benchmarking datasets (ImageNet32, CIFAR-10/100, STL-10,
MNIST) and four network architectures (DenseNet, ResNet, ResNeXt and
EfficientNet B0-B2) with appropriate statistical tests employed to infer any
conclusive claims presented in this paper.</span>

                                        <span>Image registration has been widely studied over the past several decades,
with numerous applications in science, engineering and medicine. Most of the
conventional mathematical models for large deformation image registration rely
on prescribed landmarks, which usually require tedious manual labeling and are
prone to error. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in the use
of machine learning for image registration. In this paper, we develop a novel
method for large deformation image registration by a fusion of quasiconformal
theory and convolutional neural network (CNN). More specifically, we propose a
quasiconformal energy model with a novel fidelity term that incorporates the
features extracted using a pre-trained CNN, thereby allowing us to obtain
meaningful registration results without any guidance of prescribed landmarks.
Moreover, unlike many prior image registration methods, the bijectivity of our
method is guaranteed by quasiconformal theory. Experimental results are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. More
broadly, our work sheds light on how rigorous mathematical theories and
practical machine learning approaches can be integrated for developing
computational methods with improved performance.</span>

                                        <span>The recent advent of various forms of Federated Knowledge Distillation (FD)
paves the way for a new generation of robust and communication-efficient
Federated Learning (FL), where mere soft-labels are aggregated, rather than
whole gradients of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) as done in previous FL schemes.
This security-per-design approach in combination with increasingly performant
Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices opens up a new realm of
possibilities to utilize private data from industries as well as from
individuals as input for artificial intelligence model training. Yet in
previous FL systems, lack of trust due to the imbalance of power between
workers and a central authority, the assumption of altruistic worker
participation and the inability to correctly measure and compare contributions
of workers hinder this technology from scaling beyond small groups of already
entrusted entities towards mass adoption. This work aims to mitigate the
aforementioned issues by introducing a novel decentralized federated learning
framework where heavily compressed 1-bit soft-labels, resembling 1-hot label
predictions, are aggregated on a smart contract. In a context where workers&#x27;
contributions are now easily comparable, we modify the Peer Truth Serum for
Crowdsourcing mechanism (PTSC) for FD to reward honest participation based on
peer consistency in an incentive compatible fashion. Due to heavy reductions of
both computational complexity and storage, our framework is a fully
on-blockchain FL system that is feasible on simple smart contracts and
therefore blockchain agnostic. We experimentally test our new framework and
validate its theoretical properties.</span>

we opened several possibilities within the field, applying modern Bayesian
Statistics techniques and developing efficient algorithms, focusing on the

was the development of a emotion-based music recommendation system, its main
contribution is a highly adaptable multivariate model that can be useful
interpreting any database where there is an interest in applying regularization

theoretical statistical analysis can play in the modeling of an algorithm that
is able to understand a well-known database and what can be gained with this

adapting the Mask R-CNN state-of-the-art image processing neural architecture

method learns to solve all 68 kinds of geometric construction problems from the
first six level packs of Euclidea with an average 92% accuracy. When evaluated
on new kinds of problems, the method can solve 31 of the 68 kinds of Euclidea

a novel unsupervised skill discovery method named Information Bottleneck Option

learn visual representations that can be transferred better to unseen tasks
than joint-training methods relying on task-specific supervision. In this
paper, we found that the similar holds in the continual learning con-text:
contrastively learned representations are more robust against the catastrophic
forgetting than jointly trained representations. Based on this novel
observation, we propose a rehearsal-based continual learning algorithm that
focuses on continually learning and maintaining transferable representations.
More specifically, the proposed scheme (1) learns representations using the
contrastive learning objective, and (2) preserves learned representations using
a self-supervised distillation step. We conduct extensive experimental
validations under popular benchmark image classification datasets, where our
method sets the new state-of-the-art performance.</span>

                                        <span>We present a new way of study of Mercer kernels, by corresponding to a
special kernel $K$ a pseudo-differential operator $p({\mathbf x}, D)$ such that
$\mathcal{F} p({\mathbf x}, D)^\dag p({\mathbf x}, D) \mathcal{F}^{-1}$ acts on
smooth functions in the same way as an integral operator associated with $K$
(where $\mathcal{F}$ is the Fourier transform). We show that kernels defined by
pseudo-differential operators are able to approximate uniformly any continuous
Mercer kernel on a compact set.

The symbol $p({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$ encapsulates a lot of useful
information about the structure of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy distance
defined by the kernel $K$. We approximate $p({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$ with
the sum of the first $r$ terms of the Singular Value Decomposition of $p$,
denoted by $p_r({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$. If ordered singular values of the
integral operator associated with $p({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$ die down
rapidly, the MMD distance defined by the new symbol $p_r$ differs from the
initial one only slightly. Moreover, the new MMD distance can be interpreted as
an aggregated result of comparing $r$ local moments of two probability
distributions.

The latter results holds under the condition that right singular vectors of
the integral operator associated with $p$ are uniformly bounded. But even if
this is not satisfied we can still hold that the Hilbert-Schmidt distance
between $p$ and $p_r$ vanishes. Thus, we report an interesting phenomenon: the
MMD distance measures the difference of two probability distributions with
respect to a certain number of local moments, $r^\ast$, and this number
$r^\ast$ depends on the speed with which singular values of $p$ die down.</span>

achieve this property for a class of critical points. These theoretical

Reading Comprehension of Abstract Meaning. Given a fill-in-the-blank-type
question and a corresponding context, the task is to predict the most suitable
word from a list of 5 options. There are three sub-tasks within this task:
Imperceptibility (subtask-I), Non-Specificity (subtask-II), and Intersection
(subtask-III). We use encoders of transformers-based models pre-trained on the
masked language modelling (MLM) task to build our Fill-in-the-blank (FitB)
models. Moreover, to model imperceptibility, we define certain linguistic
features, and to model non-specificity, we leverage information from hypernyms
and hyponyms provided by a lexical database. Specifically, for non-specificity,
we try out augmentation techniques, and other statistical techniques. We also
propose variants, namely Chunk Voting and Max Context, to take care of input
length restrictions for BERT, etc. Additionally, we perform a thorough ablation
study, and use Integrated Gradients to explain our predictions on a few
samples. Our best submissions achieve accuracies of 75.31% and 77.84%, on the

combination of gradient clipping, momentum, and normalized gradient descent
yields convergence to critical points in high-probability with best-known rates
for smooth losses when the gradients only have bounded $\mathfrak{p}$th moments
for some $\mathfrak{p}\in(1,2]$. We then consider the case of second-order
smooth losses, which to our knowledge have not been studied in this setting,
and again obtain high-probability bounds for any $\mathfrak{p}$. Moreover, our
results hold for arbitrary smooth norms, in contrast to the typical SGD
analysis which requires a Hilbert space norm. Further, we show that after a
suitable &quot;burn-in&quot; period, the objective value will monotonically decrease for
every iteration until a critical point is identified, which provides intuition
behind the popular practice of learning rate &quot;warm-up&quot; and also yields a

of learning Nash equilibria in zero-sum stochastic games. We propose a new
Q-learning type algorithm that uses a sequence of entropy-regularized soft
policies to approximate the Nash policy during the Q-function updates. We prove
that under certain conditions, by updating the regularized Q-function, the
algorithm converges to a Nash equilibrium. We also demonstrate the proposed
algorithm&#x27;s ability to transfer previous training experiences, enabling the
agents to adapt quickly to new environments. We provide a dynamic
hyper-parameter scheduling scheme to further expedite convergence. Empirical
results applied to a number of stochastic games verify that the proposed

                                        <span>K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)-based deep learning methods have been applied to
many applications due to their simplicity and geometric interpretability.
However, the robustness of kNN-based classification models has not been
thoroughly explored and kNN attack strategies are underdeveloped. In this
paper, we propose an Adversarial Soft kNN (ASK) loss to both design more
effective kNN attack strategies and to develop better defenses against them.
Our ASK loss approach has two advantages. First, ASK loss can better
approximate the kNN&#x27;s probability of classification error than objectives
proposed in previous works. Second, the ASK loss is interpretable: it preserves
the mutual information between the perturbed input and the kNN of the
unperturbed input. We use the ASK loss to generate a novel attack method called
the ASK-Attack (ASK-Atk), which shows superior attack efficiency and accuracy
degradation relative to previous kNN attacks. Based on the ASK-Atk, we then
derive an ASK-Defense (ASK-Def) method that optimizes the worst-case training
loss induced by ASK-Atk.</span>

                                        <span>With recent advances in deep learning, neuroimaging studies increasingly rely
on convolutional networks (ConvNets) to predict diagnosis based on MR images.
To gain a better understanding of how a disease impacts the brain, the studies
visualize the salience maps of the ConvNet highlighting voxels within the brain
majorly contributing to the prediction. However, these salience maps are
generally confounded, i.e., some salient regions are more predictive of
confounding variables (such as age) than the diagnosis. To avoid such
misinterpretation, we propose in this paper an approach that aims to visualize
confounder-free saliency maps that only highlight voxels predictive of the
diagnosis. The approach incorporates univariate statistical tests to identify
confounding effects within the intermediate features learned by ConvNet. The
influence from the subset of confounded features is then removed by a novel
partial back-propagation procedure. We use this two-step approach to visualize
confounder-free saliency maps extracted from synthetic and two real datasets.
These experiments reveal the potential of our visualization in producing
unbiased model-interpretation.</span>

                                        <span>Powerful deep learning algorithms open an opportunity for solving non-image
Machine Learning (ML) problems by transforming these problems to into the image
recognition problems. The CPC-R algorithm presented in this chapter converts
non-image data into images by visualizing non-image data. Then deep learning
CNN algorithms solve the learning problems on these images. The design of the
CPC-R algorithm allows preserving all high-dimensional information in 2-D
images. The use of pair values mapping instead of single value mapping used in
the alternative approaches allows encoding each n-D point with 2 times fewer
visual elements. The attributes of an n-D point are divided into pairs of its
values and each pair is visualized as 2-D points in the same 2-D Cartesian
coordinates. Next, grey scale or color intensity values are assigned to each
pair to encode the order of pairs. This is resulted in the heatmap image. The
computational experiments with CPC-R are conducted for different CNN
architectures, and methods to optimize the CPC-R images showing that the
combined CPC-R and deep learning CNN algorithms are able to solve non-image ML
problems reaching high accuracy on the benchmark datasets. This chapter expands
our prior work by adding more experiments to test accuracy of classification,
exploring saliency and informativeness of discovered features to test their
interpretability, and generalizing the approach.</span>

which modify input images to improve the classifier&#x27;s performance. In this
work, we combine the idea of STN with Reinforcement Learning (RL). To this end,
we break the affine transformation down into a sequence of simple and discrete
transformations. We formulate the task as a Markovian Decision Process (MDP)
and use RL to solve this sequential decision-making problem. STN architectures
learn the transformation parameters by minimizing the classification error and
backpropagating the gradients through a sub-differentiable sampling module. In
our method, we are not bound to the differentiability of the sampling modules.
Moreover, we have freedom in designing the objective rather than only
minimizing the error; e.g., we can directly set the target as maximizing the
accuracy. We design multiple experiments to verify the effectiveness of our
method using cluttered MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets and show that our
method outperforms STN with a proper definition of MDP components.</span>

routines to the problem of sparse signal recovery from noisy observation. Using
Stochastic Mirror Descent algorithm as a building block, we develop a
multistage procedure for recovery of sparse solutions to Stochastic
Optimization problem under assumption of smoothness and quadratic minoration on
the expected objective. An interesting feature of the proposed algorithm is
linear convergence of the approximate solution during the preliminary phase of
the routine when the component of stochastic error in the gradient observation
which is due to bad initial approximation of the optimal solution is larger
than the &quot;ideal&quot; asymptotic error component owing to observation noise &quot;at the
optimal solution.&quot; We also show how one can straightforwardly enhance
reliability of the corresponding solution by using Median-of-Means like
techniques.

We illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms in application to
classical problems of recovery of sparse and low rank signals in linear
regression framework. We show, under rather weak assumption on the regressor
and noise distributions, how they lead to parameter estimates which obey (up to
factors which are logarithmic in problem dimension and confidence level) the

the wind power forecasting field. However, deep learning-based wind power
forecasting studies have not investigated two aspects. In the first stage,
different learning structures considering multiple inputs and multiple outputs
have not been discussed. In the second stage, the model extrapolation issue has
not been investigated. Therefore, we develop four deep neural networks for the
first stage to learn data features considering the input-and-output structure.
We then explore the model extrapolation issue in the second stage using
different modeling methods. Considering the overfitting issue, we propose a new
moving window-based algorithm using a validation set in the first stage to
update the training data in both stages with two different moving window
processes.Experiments were conducted at three wind farms, and the results
demonstrate that the model with single input multiple output structure obtains
better forecasting accuracy compared to existing models. In addition, the ridge
regression method results in a better ensemble model that can further improve
forecasting accuracy compared to existing machine learning methods. Finally,
the proposed two-stage forecasting algorithm can generate more accurate and
stable results than existing algorithms.</span>

models to advance the understanding of brain disorders in neuroimaging studies.
To interpret the decision process of a trained classifier, existing techniques
typically rely on saliency maps to quantify the voxel-wise or feature-level
importance for classification through partial derivatives. Despite providing
some level of localization, these maps are not human-understandable from the
neuroscience perspective as they do not inform the specific meaning of the
alteration linked to the brain disorder. Inspired by the image-to-image
translation scheme, we propose to train simulator networks that can warp a
given image to inject or remove patterns of the disease. These networks are
trained such that the classifier produces consistently increased or decreased
prediction logits for the simulated images. Moreover, we propose to couple all
the simulators into a unified model based on conditional convolution. We
applied our approach to interpreting classifiers trained on a synthetic dataset
and two neuroimaging datasets to visualize the effect of the Alzheimer&#x27;s
disease and alcohol use disorder. Compared to the saliency maps generated by
baseline approaches, our simulations and visualizations based on the Jacobian
determinants of the warping field reveal meaningful and understandable patterns
related to the diseases.</span>

                                        <span>Researchers currently use a number of approaches to predict and substantiate
information-computation gaps in high-dimensional statistical estimation
problems. A prominent approach is to characterize the limits of restricted
models of computation, which on the one hand yields strong computational lower
bounds for powerful classes of algorithms and on the other hand helps guide the
development of efficient algorithms. In this paper, we study two of the most
popular restricted computational models, the statistical query framework and
low-degree polynomials, in the context of high-dimensional hypothesis testing.
Our main result is that under mild conditions on the testing problem, the two
classes of algorithms are essentially equivalent in power. As corollaries, we
obtain new statistical query lower bounds for sparse PCA, tensor PCA and
several variants of the planted clique problem.</span>

and study the problem of regret minimization, which is central to the analysis
and design of optimal learning algorithms. We present logarithmic
problem-specific regret lower bounds that explicitly depend on the system
parameter (in contrast to previous minimax approaches) and thus, truly quantify
the fundamental limit of performance achievable by any learning algorithm.
Deterministic MDPs can be interpreted as graphs and analyzed in terms of their
cycles, a fact which we leverage in order to identify a class of deterministic
MDPs whose regret lower bound can be determined numerically. We further
exemplify this result on a deterministic line search problem, and a
deterministic MDP with state-dependent rewards, whose regret lower bounds we
can state explicitly. These bounds share similarities with the known
problem-specific bound of the multi-armed bandit problem and suggest that
navigation on a deterministic MDP need not have an effect on the performance of
a learning algorithm.</span>

                                        <span>Training large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs) currently requires a
significant amount of energy, leading to serious environmental impacts. One
promising approach to reduce the energy costs is representing DNNs with
low-precision numbers. While it is common to train DNNs with forward and
backward propagation in low-precision, training directly over low-precision
weights, without keeping a copy of weights in high-precision, still remains to
be an unsolved problem. This is due to complex interactions between learning
algorithms and low-precision number systems. To address this, we jointly design
a low-precision training framework involving a logarithmic number system (LNS)
and a multiplicative weight update training method, termed LNS-Madam. LNS has a
high dynamic range even in a low-bitwidth setting, leading to high energy
efficiency and making it relevant for on-board training in energy-constrained
edge devices. We design LNS to have the flexibility of choosing different bases
for weights and gradients, as they usually require different quantization gaps
and dynamic ranges during training. By drawing the connection between LNS and
multiplicative update, LNS-Madam ensures low quantization error during weight
update, leading to a stable convergence even if the bitwidth is limited.
Compared to using a fixed-point or floating-point number system and training
with popular learning algorithms such as SGD and Adam, our joint design with
LNS and LNS-Madam optimizer achieves better accuracy while requiring smaller
bitwidth. Notably, with only 5-bit for gradients, the proposed training
framework achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision state-of-the-art
models such as ResNet-50 and BERT. After conducting energy estimations by
analyzing the math datapath units during training, the results show that our
design achieves over 60x energy reduction compared to FP32 on BERT models.</span>

equilibria in sequential games such as poker games. However, most regret-based
algorithms, including counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) and its
variants, rely on iterate averaging to achieve convergence. Inspired by recent
advances on last-iterate convergence of optimistic algorithms in zero-sum
normal-form games, we study this phenomenon in sequential games, and provide a
comprehensive study of last-iterate convergence for zero-sum extensive-form
games with perfect recall (EFGs), using various optimistic regret-minimization
algorithms over treeplexes. This includes algorithms using the vanilla entropy
or squared Euclidean norm regularizers, as well as their dilated versions which
admit more efficient implementation. In contrast to CFR, we show that all of
these algorithms enjoy last-iterate convergence, with some of them even
converging exponentially fast. We also provide experiments to further support
our theoretical results.</span>

                                        <span>In most existing learning systems, images are typically viewed as 2D pixel
arrays. However, in another paradigm gaining popularity, a 2D image is
represented as an implicit neural representation (INR) - an MLP that predicts
an RGB pixel value given its (x,y) coordinate. In this paper, we propose two
novel architectural techniques for building INR-based image decoders:
factorized multiplicative modulation and multi-scale INRs, and use them to
build a state-of-the-art continuous image GAN. Previous attempts to adapt INRs
for image generation were limited to MNIST-like datasets and do not scale to
complex real-world data. Our proposed INR-GAN architecture improves the
performance of continuous image generators by several times, greatly reducing
the gap between continuous image GANs and pixel-based ones. Apart from that, we
explore several exciting properties of the INR-based decoders, like
out-of-the-box superresolution, meaningful image-space interpolation,
accelerated inference of low-resolution images, an ability to extrapolate
outside of image boundaries, and strong geometric prior. The project page is

architecture includes two recurrent networks (RNs) followed by a linear
predictor. In this manuscript we perform analysis of a corresponding algorithm
and show that the parameters of the RNs of the well trained predictive network
are not independent of each other. Their dependence can be used to
significantly improve the network effectiveness. The traditional seq2seq
algorithms require short term memory of a size proportional to the predicted
sequence length. This requirement is quite difficult to implement in a
neuroscience context. We present a novel memoryless algorithm for seq2seq
predictive networks and compare it to the traditional one in the context of
time series prediction. We show that the new algorithm is more robust and makes

data from many domains. We introduce a new method to identify topics in a
corpus and represent documents as topic sequences. Discourse Atom Topic
Modeling draws on advances in theoretical machine learning to integrate topic
modeling and word embedding, capitalizing on the distinct capabilities of each.
We first identify a set of vectors (&quot;discourse atoms&quot;) that provide a sparse
representation of an embedding space. Atom vectors can be interpreted as latent
topics: Through a generative model, atoms map onto distributions over words;
one can also infer the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate
our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the U.S. National
Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS summarizes violent death
incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify
225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical
aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured
variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender, and
recent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias
of our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then
compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female
versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of
reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a
flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data.</span>

                                        <span>Normalizing flows are among the most popular paradigms in generative
modeling, especially for images, primarily because we can efficiently evaluate
the likelihood of a data point. This is desirable both for evaluating the fit
of a model, and for ease of training, as maximizing the likelihood can be done
by gradient descent. However, training normalizing flows comes with
difficulties as well: models which produce good samples typically need to be
extremely deep -- which comes with accompanying vanishing/exploding gradient
problems. A very related problem is that they are often poorly conditioned:
since they are parametrized as invertible maps from $\mathbb{R}^d \to
\mathbb{R}^d$, and typical training data like images intuitively is
lower-dimensional, the learned maps often have Jacobians that are close to
being singular.

In our paper, we tackle representational aspects around depth and
conditioning of normalizing flows: both for general invertible architectures,
and for a particular common architecture, affine couplings. We prove that
$\Theta(1)$ affine coupling layers suffice to exactly represent a permutation
or $1 \times 1$ convolution, as used in GLOW, showing that representationally
the choice of partition is not a bottleneck for depth. We also show that
shallow affine coupling networks are universal approximators in Wasserstein
distance if ill-conditioning is allowed, and experimentally investigate related
phenomena involving padding. Finally, we show a depth lower bound for general
flow architectures with few neurons per layer and bounded Lipschitz constant.</span>

                                        <span>In data systems, activities or events are continuously collected in the field
to trace their proper executions. Logging, which means recording sequences of
events, can be used for analyzing system failures and malfunctions, and
identifying the causes and locations of such issues. In our research we focus
on creating an Anomaly detection models for system logs. The task of anomaly
detection is identifying unexpected events in dataset, which differ from the
normal behavior. Anomaly detection models also assist in data systems analysis
tasks.

Modern systems may produce such a large amount of events monitoring every
individual event is not feasible. In such cases, the events are often
aggregated over a fixed period of time, reporting the number of times every
event has occurred in that time period. This aggregation facilitates scaling,
but requires a different approach for anomaly detection. In this research, we
present a thorough analysis of the aggregated data and the relationships
between aggregated events. Based on the initial phase of our research we
present graphs representations of our aggregated dataset, which represent the
different relationships between aggregated instances in the same context.

Using the graph representation, we propose Multiple-graphs autoencoder MGAE,
a novel convolutional graphs-autoencoder model which exploits the relationships
of the aggregated instances in our unique dataset. MGAE outperforms standard
graph-autoencoder models and the different experiments. With our novel MGAE we
present 60% decrease in reconstruction error in comparison to standard graph
autoencoder, which is expressed in reconstructing high-degree relationships.</span>

\citep{qiu2018multivariate,Jammalamadaka2019Predicting} as a generalized
version of many structural time series models, deals with inference and
prediction for multiple correlated time series, where one also has the choice
of using a different candidate pool of contemporaneous predictors for each
target series. The MBSTS model has wide applications and is ideal for feature
selection, time series forecasting, nowcasting, inferring causal impact, and
others. This paper demonstrates how to use the R package \pkg{mbsts} for MBSTS
modeling, establishing a bridge between user-friendly and developer-friendly
functions in package and the corresponding methodology. A simulated dataset and

fuels the demand for automated condition monitoring strategies that can reduce
the operating cost and avoid unplanned downtime. Normal behaviour modelling has
been introduced to detect anomalous deviations from normal operation based on
the turbine&#x27;s SCADA data. A growing number of machine learning models of the
normal behaviour of turbine subsystems are being developed by wind farm
managers to this end. However, these models need to be kept track of, be
maintained and require frequent updates. This research explores multi-target
models as a new approach to capturing a wind turbine&#x27;s normal behaviour. We
present an overview of multi-target regression methods, motivate their
application and benefits in wind turbine condition monitoring, and assess their
performance in a wind farm case study. We find that multi-target models are
advantageous in comparison to single-target modelling in that they can reduce
the cost and effort of practical condition monitoring without compromising on
the accuracy. We also outline some areas of future research.</span>

discovery process. However, measuring progress in the field has been
challenging due to the lack of realistic retrospective benchmarks, and the
large cost of prospective validation. To close this gap, we propose a benchmark
based on docking, a popular computational method for assessing molecule binding
to a protein. Concretely, the goal is to generate drug-like molecules that are
scored highly by SMINA, a popular docking software. We observe that popular
graph-based generative models fail to generate molecules with a high docking
score when trained using a realistically sized training set. This suggests a
limitation of the current incarnation of models for de novo drug design.
Finally, we propose a simplified version of the benchmark based on a simpler
scoring function, and show that the tested models are able to partially solve
it. We release the benchmark as an easy to use package available at
https://github.com/cieplinski-tobiasz/smina-docking-benchmark. We hope that our
benchmark will serve as a stepping stone towards the goal of automatically
generating promising drug candidates.</span>

rhythmic, tonal and timbral features of music. Formally, generating dance
conditioned on a piece of music can be expressed as a problem of modelling a
high-dimensional continuous motion signal, conditioned on an audio signal. In
this work we make two contributions to tackle this problem. First, we present a
novel probabilistic autoregressive architecture that models the distribution
over future poses with a normalizing flow conditioned on previous poses as well
as music context, using a multimodal transformer encoder. Second, we introduce
the currently largest 3D dance-motion dataset, obtained with a variety of
motion-capture technologies, and including both professional and casual
dancers. Using this dataset, we compare our new model against two baselines,
via objective metrics and a user study, and show that both the ability to model
a probability distribution, as well as being able to attend over a large motion

dance that matches the music.</span>

                                        <span>Gaussian process regression is a widely-applied method for function
approximation and uncertainty quantification. The technique has gained
popularity recently in the machine learning community due to its robustness and
interpretability. The mathematical methods we discuss in this paper are an
extension of the Gaussian-process framework. We are proposing advanced kernel
designs that only allow for functions with certain desirable characteristics to
be elements of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that underlies all
kernel methods and serves as the sample space for Gaussian process regression.
These desirable characteristics reflect the underlying physics; two obvious
examples are symmetry and periodicity constraints. In addition, non-stationary
kernel designs can be defined in the same framework to yield flexible
multi-task Gaussian processes. We will show the impact of advanced kernel
designs on Gaussian processes using several synthetic and two scientific data
sets. The results show that including domain knowledge, communicated through
advanced kernel designs, has a significant impact on the accuracy and relevance
of the function approximation.</span>

offers the promise of freeing algorithm designers and programmers from
specifying how those choices should be made; in implementations, the choices
can be realized by optimization techniques and,increasingly, by
machine-learning methods. We study this approach from a programming-language
perspective. We define two small languages that support decision-making
abstractions: one with choices and rewards, and the other additionally with
probabilities. We give both operational and denotational semantics.

In the case of the second language we consider three denotational semantics,
with varying degrees of correlation between possible program values and
expected rewards. The operational semantics combine the usual semantics of
standard constructs with optimization over spaces of possible execution
strategies. The denotational semantics, which are compositional rely on the
selection monad, to handle choice, augmented with an auxiliary monad to handle
other effects, such as rewards or probability.

We establish adequacy theorems that the two semantics coincide in all cases.
We also prove full abstraction at base types, with varying notions of
observation in the probabilistic case corresponding to the various degrees of
correlation. We present axioms for choice combined with rewards and
probability, establishing completeness at base types for the case of rewards
without probability.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we are concerned with differentially private {stochastic
gradient descent (SGD)} algorithms in the setting of stochastic convex
optimization (SCO). Most of the existing work requires the loss to be Lipschitz
continuous and strongly smooth, and the model parameter to be uniformly
bounded. However, these assumptions are restrictive as many popular losses
violate these conditions including the hinge loss for SVM, the absolute loss in
robust regression, and even the least square loss in an unbounded domain. We
significantly relax these restrictive assumptions and establish privacy and
generalization (utility) guarantees for private SGD algorithms using output and
gradient perturbations associated with non-smooth convex losses. Specifically,
the loss function is relaxed to have an $\alpha$-H\&quot;{o}lder continuous gradient
(referred to as $\alpha$-H\&quot;{o}lder smoothness) which instantiates the
Lipschitz continuity ($\alpha&#x3D;0$) and the strong smoothness ($\alpha&#x3D;1$). We
prove that noisy SGD with $\alpha$-H\&quot;older smooth losses using gradient
perturbation can guarantee $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) and
attain optimal excess population risk
$\mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{\sqrt{d\log(1/\delta)}}{n\epsilon}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\Big)$,
up to logarithmic terms, with the gradient complexity $ \mathcal{O}(
n^{2-\alpha\over 1+\alpha}+ n).$ This shows an important trade-off between
$\alpha$-H\&quot;older smoothness of the loss and the computational complexity for
private SGD with statistically optimal performance. In particular, our results
indicate that $\alpha$-H\&quot;older smoothness with $\alpha\ge {1/2}$ is sufficient
to guarantee $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP of noisy SGD algorithms while achieving
optimal excess risk with the linear gradient complexity $\mathcal{O}(n).$</span>

                                        <span>We consider a sequential setting in which a single dataset of individuals is
used to perform adaptively-chosen analyses, while ensuring that the
differential privacy loss of each participant does not exceed a pre-specified
privacy budget. The standard approach to this problem relies on bounding a
worst-case estimate of the privacy loss over all individuals and all possible
values of their data, for every single analysis. Yet, in many scenarios this
approach is overly conservative, especially for &quot;typical&quot; data points which
incur little privacy loss by participation in most of the analyses. In this
work, we give a method for tighter privacy loss accounting based on the value
of a personalized privacy loss estimate for each individual in each analysis.
To implement the accounting method we design a filter for R\&#x27;enyi differential
privacy. A filter is a tool that ensures that the privacy parameter of a
composed sequence of algorithms with adaptively-chosen privacy parameters does
not exceed a pre-specified budget. Our filter is simpler and tighter than the
known filter for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy by Rogers et al. We
apply our results to the analysis of noisy gradient descent and show that
personalized accounting can be practical, easy to implement, and can only make
the privacy-utility tradeoff tighter.</span>

technical documents created by engineers and managers in supporting relevant
decision making have increased dramatically in recent years, which has led to a
higher demand for more scalable, accurate, and automated document
classification. Prior studies have primarily focused on processing text for
classification and small-scale databases. This paper describes a novel
multimodal deep learning architecture, called TechDoc, for technical document
classification, which utilizes both natural language and descriptive images to
train hierarchical classifiers. The architecture synthesizes convolutional
neural networks and recurrent neural networks through an integrated training
process. We applied the architecture to a large multimodal technical document
database and trained the model for classifying documents based on the
hierarchical International Patent Classification system. Our results show that
the trained neural network presents a greater classification accuracy than
those using a single modality and several earlier text classification methods.
The trained model can potentially be scaled to millions of real-world technical
documents with both text and figures, which is useful for data and knowledge
management in large technology companies and organizations.</span>

labeled input data, but DNNs sometimes fail to generalize to test data sampled
from different input distributions. Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA)
proves useful when no input labels are available, and distribution shifts are
observed in the target domain (TD). Experiments are performed on seismic images
of the F3 block 3D dataset from offshore Netherlands (source domain; SD) and
Penobscot 3D survey data from Canada (target domain; TD). Three geological
classes from SD and TD that have similar reflection patterns are considered. In
the present study, an improved deep neural network architecture named
EarthAdaptNet (EAN) is proposed to semantically segment the seismic images. We
specifically use a transposed residual unit to replace the traditional dilated
convolution in the decoder block. The EAN achieved a pixel-level accuracy &gt;84%
and an accuracy of ~70% for the minority classes, showing improved performance
compared to existing architectures. In addition, we introduced the CORAL
(Correlation Alignment) method to the EAN to create an unsupervised deep domain
adaptation network (EAN-DDA) for the classification of seismic reflections
fromF3 and Penobscot. Maximum class accuracy achieved was ~99% for class 2 of
Penobscot with &gt;50% overall accuracy. Taken together, EAN-DDA has the potential
to classify target domain seismic facies classes with high accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Deep equilibrium networks (DEQs) are a new class of models that eschews
traditional depth in favor of finding the fixed point of a single nonlinear
layer. These models have been shown to achieve performance competitive with the
state-of-the-art deep networks while using significantly less memory. Yet they
are also slower, brittle to architectural choices, and introduce potential
instability to the model. In this paper, we propose a regularization scheme for
DEQ models that explicitly regularizes the Jacobian of the fixed-point update
equations to stabilize the learning of equilibrium models. We show that this
regularization adds only minimal computational cost, significantly stabilizes
the fixed-point convergence in both forward and backward passes, and scales
well to high-dimensional, realistic domains (e.g., WikiText-103 language
modeling and ImageNet classification). Using this method, we demonstrate, for
the first time, an implicit-depth model that runs with approximately the same
speed and level of performance as popular conventional deep networks such as
ResNet-101, while still maintaining the constant memory footprint and
architectural simplicity of DEQs. Code is available at

                                        <span>It is well known that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to
adversarial examples, in which great efforts have been made to improve the
robustness. However, such examples are usually imperceptible to humans, and
thus their effect on biological neural circuits is largely unknown. This paper
will investigate the adversarial robustness in a simulated cerebellum, a
well-studied supervised learning system in computational neuroscience.
Specifically, we propose to study three unique characteristics revealed in the
cerebellum: (i) network width; (ii) long-term depression on the parallel
fiber-Purkinje cell synapses; (iii) sparse connectivity in the granule layer,
and hypothesize that they will be beneficial for improving robustness. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to examine the adversarial
robustness in simulated cerebellum models.

The results are negative in the experimental phase -- no significant
improvements in robustness are discovered from the proposed three mechanisms.
Consequently, the cerebellum is expected to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples as the deep neural networks under batch training. Neuroscientists are
encouraged to fool the biological system in experiments with adversarial
attacks.</span>

inspection well-known to be slow, error-prone and operator-dependent. This
issue raises strong demand for automated real-time quality monitoring developed
from data-driven approaches thus alleviating from operator dependence and
adapting to various process uncertainties. Nonetheless, current approaches do
not take into account the streaming nature of sensory information while relying
heavily on hand-crafted features making them application-specific. This paper
proposes the online quality monitoring methodology developed from recently
developed deep learning algorithms for data streams, Neural Networks with
Dynamically Evolved Capacity (NADINE), namely NADINE++. It features the
integration of 1-D and 2-D convolutional layers to extract natural features of
time-series and visual data streams captured from sensors and cameras of the
injection molding machines from our own project. Real-time experiments have
been conducted where the online quality monitoring task is simulated on the fly
under the prequential test-then-train fashion - the prominent data stream
evaluation protocol. Comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques clearly
exhibits the advantage of NADINE++ with 4.68\% improvement on average for the
quality monitoring task in streaming environments. To support the reproducible
research initiative, codes, results of NADINE++ along with supplementary
materials and injection molding dataset are made available in

                                        <span>We consider the $k$-clustering problem with $\ell_p$-norm cost, which
includes $k$-median, $k$-means and $k$-center cost functions, under an
individual notion of fairness proposed by Jung et al. [2020]: given a set of
points $P$ of size $n$, a set of $k$ centers induces a fair clustering if for
every point $v\in P$, $v$ can find a center among its $n/k$ closest neighbors.
Recently, Mahabadi and Vakilian [2020] showed how to get a
$(p^{O(p)},7)$-bicriteria approximation for the problem of fair $k$-clustering
with $\ell_p$-norm cost: every point finds a center within distance at most $7$
times its distance to its $(n/k)$-th closest neighbor and the $\ell_p$-norm
cost of the solution is at most $p^{O(p)}$ times the cost of an optimal fair
solution. In this work, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we present an improved $(16^p
+\varepsilon,3)$-bicriteria approximation for the fair $k$-clustering with
$\ell_p$-norm cost. To achieve our guarantees, we extend the framework of
[Charikar et al., 2002, Swamy, 2016] and devise a $16^p$-approximation
algorithm for the facility location with $\ell_p$-norm cost under matroid
constraint which might be of an independent interest. Besides, our approach
suggests a reduction from our individually fair clustering to a clustering with
a group fairness requirement proposed by Kleindessner et al. [2019], which is
essentially the median matroid problem [Krishnaswamy et al., 2011].</span>

                                        <span>This paper presents novel reconfigurable architectures for reducing the
latency of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are used for detecting
gravitational waves. Gravitational interferometers such as the LIGO detectors
capture cosmic events such as black hole mergers which happen at unknown times
and of varying durations, producing time-series data. We have developed a new
architecture capable of accelerating RNN inference for analyzing time-series
data from LIGO detectors. This architecture is based on optimizing the
initiation intervals (II) in a multi-layer LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
network, by identifying appropriate reuse factors for each layer. A
customizable template for this architecture has been designed, which enables
the generation of low-latency FPGA designs with efficient resource utilization
using high-level synthesis tools. The proposed approach has been evaluated
based on two LSTM models, targeting a ZYNQ 7045 FPGA and a U250 FPGA.
Experimental results show that with balanced II, the number of DSPs can be
reduced up to 42% while achieving the same IIs. When compared to other
FPGA-based LSTM designs, our design can achieve about 4.92 to 12.4 times lower
latency.</span>

                                        <span>Learning guarantees often rely on assumptions of i.i.d. data, which will
likely be violated in practice once predictors are deployed to perform
real-world tasks. Domain adaptation approaches thus appeared as a useful
framework yielding extra flexibility in that distinct train and test data
distributions are supported, provided that other assumptions are satisfied such
as covariate shift, which expects the conditional distributions over labels to
be independent of the underlying data distribution. Several approaches were
introduced in order to induce generalization across varying train and test data
sources, and those often rely on the general idea of domain-invariance, in such
a way that the data-generating distributions are to be disregarded by the
prediction model. In this contribution, we tackle the problem of generalizing
across data sources by approaching it from the opposite direction: we consider
a conditional modeling approach in which predictions, in addition to being
dependent on the input data, use information relative to the underlying
data-generating distribution. For instance, the model has an explicit mechanism
to adapt to changing environments and/or new data sources. We argue that such
an approach is more generally applicable than current domain adaptation methods
since it does not require extra assumptions such as covariate shift and further
yields simpler training algorithms that avoid a common source of training
instabilities caused by minimax formulations, often employed in
domain-invariant methods.</span>

                                        <span>In vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, it is prevalent to assign
the auxiliary task with a surrogate self-supervised loss so as to obtain more
semantic representations and improve sample efficiency. However, abundant
information in self-supervised auxiliary tasks has been disregarded, since the
representation learning part and the decision-making part are separated. To
sufficiently utilize information in the auxiliary task, we present a simple yet
effective idea to employ self-supervised loss as an intrinsic reward, called
Intrinsically Motivated Self-Supervised learning in Reinforcement learning
(IM-SSR). We formally show that the self-supervised loss can be decomposed as
exploration for novel states and robustness improvement from nuisance
elimination. IM-SSR can be effortlessly plugged into any reinforcement learning
with self-supervised auxiliary objectives with nearly no additional cost.
Combined with IM-SSR, the previous underlying algorithms achieve salient
improvements on both sample efficiency and generalization in various
vision-based robotics tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, especially when
the reward signal is sparse.</span>

                                        <span>Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a fundamental role in modeling and
simulating problems across a wide range of disciplines. Recent advances in deep
learning have shown the great potential of physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) to solve PDEs as a basis for data-driven modeling and inverse analysis.
However, the majority of existing PINN methods, based on fully-connected NNs,
pose intrinsic limitations to low-dimensional spatiotemporal parameterizations.
Moreover, since the initial/boundary conditions (I/BCs) are softly imposed via
penalty, the solution quality heavily relies on hyperparameter tuning. To this
end, we propose the novel physics-informed convolutional-recurrent learning
architectures (PhyCRNet and PhyCRNet-s) for solving PDEs without any labeled
data. Specifically, an encoder-decoder convolutional long short-term memory
network is proposed for low-dimensional spatial feature extraction and temporal
evolution learning. The loss function is defined as the aggregated discretized
PDE residuals, while the I/BCs are hard-encoded in the network to ensure
forcible satisfaction (e.g., periodic boundary padding). The networks are
further enhanced by autoregressive and residual connections that explicitly
simulate time marching. The performance of our proposed methods has been
assessed by solving three nonlinear PDEs (e.g., 2D Burgers&#x27; equations, the
$\lambda$-$\omega$ and FitzHugh Nagumo reaction-diffusion equations), and
compared against the start-of-the-art baseline algorithms. The numerical
results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodology in the context
of solution accuracy, extrapolability and generalizability.</span>

                                        <span>This work considers predicting the relational structure of a hypergraph for a
given set of vertices, as common for applications in particle physics,
biological systems and other complex combinatorial problems. A problem arises
from the number of possible multi-way relationships, or hyperedges, scaling in
$\mathcal{O}(2^n)$ for a set of $n$ elements. Simply storing an indicator
tensor for all relationships is already intractable for moderately sized $n$,
prompting previous approaches to restrict the number of vertices a hyperedge
connects. Instead, we propose a recurrent hypergraph neural network that
predicts the incidence matrix by iteratively refining an initial guess of the
solution. We leverage the property that most hypergraphs of interest are
sparsely connected and reduce the memory requirement to $\mathcal{O}(nk)$,
where $k$ is the maximum number of positive edges, i.e., edges that actually
exist. In order to counteract the linearly growing memory cost from training a
lengthening sequence of refinement steps, we further propose an algorithm that
applies backpropagation through time on randomly sampled subsequences. We
empirically show that our method can match an increase in the intrinsic
complexity without a performance decrease and demonstrate superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art models.</span>

with the surprising ability to learn a variety of new tasks when conditioned on

either extractive rationales (i.e., subsets of input features) or free-text
natural language explanations (NLEs) as abstractive justifications. While NLEs
can be more comprehensive than extractive rationales, machine-generated NLEs
have been shown to sometimes lack commonsense knowledge. Here, we show that
commonsense knowledge can act as a bridge between extractive rationales and
NLEs, rendering both types of explanations better. More precisely, we introduce
a unified framework, called RExC (Rationale-Inspired Explanations with
Commonsense), that (1) extracts rationales as a set of features responsible for
machine predictions, (2) expands the extractive rationales using available
commonsense resources, and (3) uses the expanded knowledge to generate natural
language explanations. Our framework surpasses by a large margin the previous
state-of-the-art in generating NLEs across five tasks in both natural language
processing and vision-language understanding, with human annotators
consistently rating the explanations generated by RExC to be more
comprehensive, grounded in commonsense, and overall preferred compared to

learning of arbitrary data, from tree-like structures and text to graphs.
Building on the success of deep learning with prototypes in Euclidean and
hyperspherical spaces, a few recent works have proposed hyperbolic prototypes
for classification. Such approaches enable effective learning in
low-dimensional output spaces and can exploit hierarchical relations amongst
classes, but require privileged information about class labels to position the
hyperbolic prototypes. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Busemann Learning.
The main idea behind our approach is to position prototypes on the ideal
boundary of the Poincare ball, which does not require prior label knowledge. To
be able to compute proximities to ideal prototypes, we introduce the penalised
Busemann loss. We provide theory supporting the use of ideal prototypes and the
proposed loss by proving its equivalence to logistic regression in the
one-dimensional case. Empirically, we show that our approach provides a natural
interpretation of classification confidence, while outperforming recent
hyperspherical and hyperbolic prototype approaches.</span>

                                        <span>As people spend up to 87% of their time indoors, intelligent Heating,
Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings are essential for
maintaining occupant comfort and reducing energy consumption. Those HVAC
systems in modern smart buildings rely on real-time sensor readings, which in
practice often suffer from various faults and could also be vulnerable to
malicious attacks. Such faulty sensor inputs may lead to the violation of
indoor environment requirements (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) and the
increase of energy consumption. While many model-based approaches have been
proposed in the literature for building HVAC control, it is costly to develop
accurate physical models for ensuring their performance and even more
challenging to address the impact of sensor faults. In this work, we present a
novel learning-based framework for sensor fault-tolerant HVAC control, which
includes three deep learning based components for 1) generating temperature
proposals with the consideration of possible sensor faults, 2) selecting one of
the proposals based on the assessment of their accuracy, and 3) applying
reinforcement learning with the selected temperature proposal. Moreover, to
address the challenge of training data insufficiency in building-related tasks,
we propose a model-assisted learning method leveraging an abstract model of
building physical dynamics. Through extensive numerical experiments, we
demonstrate that the proposed fault-tolerant HVAC control framework can
significantly reduce building temperature violations under a variety of sensor
fault patterns while maintaining energy efficiency.</span>

(MOAFL) framework, where multiple learning tasks share edge devices for data
collection and learning models under the coordination of a edge server (ES).
Specially, the model updates for all the tasks are transmitted and
superpositioned concurrently over a non-orthogonal uplink channel via
over-the-air computation, and the aggregation results of all the tasks are
reconstructed at the ES through an extended version of the turbo compressed
sensing algorithm. Both the convergence analysis and numerical results
demonstrate that the MOAFL framework can significantly reduce the uplink

                                        <span>Consider the geometric range space $(X, \mathcal{H}_d)$ where $X \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathcal{H}_d$ is the set of ranges defined by
$d$-dimensional halfspaces. In this setting we consider that $X$ is the
disjoint union of a red and blue set. For each halfspace $h \in \mathcal{H}_d$
define a function $\Phi(h)$ that measures the &quot;difference&quot; between the fraction
of red and fraction of blue points which fall in the range $h$. In this context
the maximum discrepancy problem is to find the $h^* &#x3D; \arg \max_{h \in (X,
\mathcal{H}_d)} \Phi(h)$. We aim to instead find an $\hat{h}$ such that
$\Phi(h^*) - \Phi(\hat{h}) \le \varepsilon$. This is the central problem in
linear classification for machine learning, in spatial scan statistics for
spatial anomaly detection, and shows up in many other areas. We provide a
solution for this problem in $O(|X| + (1/\varepsilon^d) \log^4
(1/\varepsilon))$ time, which improves polynomially over the previous best
solutions. For $d&#x3D;2$ we show that this is nearly tight through conditional
lower bounds. For different classes of $\Phi$ we can either provide a
$\Omega(|X|^{3/2 - o(1)})$ time lower bound for the exact solution with a
reduction to APSP, or an $\Omega(|X| + 1/\varepsilon^{2-o(1)})$ lower bound for
the approximate solution with a reduction to 3SUM.

A key technical result is a $\varepsilon$-approximate halfspace range
counting data structure of size $O(1/\varepsilon^d)$ with $O(\log
(1/\varepsilon))$ query time, which we can build in $O(|X| + (1/\varepsilon^d)
\log^4 (1/\varepsilon))$ time.</span>

such as online advertising, recommendation systems, healthcare, etc. However,
most of the algorithms use flat feature vectors to represent context whereas,
in the real world, there is a varying number of objects and relations among
them to model in the context. For example, in a music recommendation system,
the user context contains what music they listen to, which artists create this
music, the artist albums, etc. Adding richer relational context representations
also introduces a much larger context space making exploration-exploitation
harder. To improve the efficiency of exploration-exploitation knowledge about
the context can be infused to guide the exploration-exploitation strategy.
Relational context representations allow a natural way for humans to specify
knowledge owing to their descriptive nature. We propose an adaptation of
Knowledge Infused Policy Gradients to the Contextual Bandit setting and a novel
Knowledge Infused Policy Gradients Upper Confidence Bound algorithm and perform
an experimental analysis of a simulated music recommendation dataset and
various real-life datasets where expert knowledge can drastically reduce the
total regret and where it cannot.</span>

robots in interactive 3D environments and complex physics-enabled scenarios. We
make comprehensive contributions to all levels of the embodied AI stack - data,
simulation, and benchmark tasks. Specifically, we present: (i) ReplicaCAD: an
artist-authored, annotated, reconfigurable 3D dataset of apartments (matching
real spaces) with articulated objects (e.g. cabinets and drawers that can
open/close); (ii) H2.0: a high-performance physics-enabled 3D simulator with
speeds exceeding 25,000 simulation steps per second (850x real-time) on an
8-GPU node, representing 100x speed-ups over prior work; and, (iii) Home
Assistant Benchmark (HAB): a suite of common tasks for assistive robots (tidy
the house, prepare groceries, set the table) that test a range of mobile
manipulation capabilities. These large-scale engineering contributions allow us
to systematically compare deep reinforcement learning (RL) at scale and
classical sense-plan-act (SPA) pipelines in long-horizon structured tasks, with
an emphasis on generalization to new objects, receptacles, and layouts. We find

when applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to real-world robotics
problems, where agents have an incomplete view of the world. We present graph
convolutional memory (GCM) for solving POMDPs using deep reinforcement
learning. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, GCM embeds
domain-specific priors into the memory recall process via a knowledge graph. By
encapsulating priors in the graph, GCM adapts to specific tasks but remains
applicable to any DRL task. Using graph convolutions, GCM extracts hierarchical
graph features, analogous to image features in a convolutional neural network
(CNN). We show GCM outperforms long short-term memory (LSTM), gated
transformers for reinforcement learning (GTrXL), and differentiable neural
computers (DNCs) on control, long-term non-sequential recall, and 3D navigation

are rarely used as learning models because their function class is considered
to be restricted. This work shows that when trained properly polynomial
functions can be strong learning models. Particularly this work constructs
polynomial feedforward neural networks using the product activation, a new
activation function constructed from multiplications. The new neural network is
a polynomial function and provides accurate control of its polynomial order. It
can be trained by standard training techniques such as batch normalization and
dropout. This new feedforward network covers several previous polynomial models
as special cases. Compared with common feedforward neural networks, the
polynomial feedforward network has closed-form calculations of a few

                                        <span>We study the problems of offline and online contextual optimization with
feedback information, where instead of observing the loss, we observe,
after-the-fact, the optimal action an oracle with full knowledge of the
objective function would have taken. We aim to minimize regret, which is
defined as the difference between our losses and the ones incurred by an
all-knowing oracle. In the offline setting, the decision-maker has information
available from past periods and needs to make one decision, while in the online
setting, the decision-maker optimizes decisions dynamically over time based a
new set of feasible actions and contextual functions in each period. For the
offline setting, we characterize the optimal minimax policy, establishing the
performance that can be achieved as a function of the underlying geometry of
the information induced by the data. In the online setting, we leverage this
geometric characterization to optimize the cumulative regret. We develop an
algorithm that yields the first regret bound for this problem that is
logarithmic in the time horizon.</span>

post-processed. I propose a novel member-by-member post-processing approach
with neural networks. I bridge ideas from ensemble data assimilation with
self-attention, resulting into the self-attentive ensemble transformer. Here,
interactions between ensemble members are represented as additive and dynamic
self-attentive part. As proof-of-concept, global ECMWF ensemble forecasts are
regressed to 2-metre-temperature fields from the ERA5 reanalysis. I demonstrate
that the ensemble transformer can calibrate the ensemble spread and extract
additional information from the ensemble. Furthermore, the ensemble transformer
directly outputs multivariate and spatially-coherent ensemble members.
Therefore, self-attention and the transformer technique can be a missing piece
for a member-by-member post-processing of ensemble data with neural networks.</span>

                                        <span>Broad learning system (BLS) has been proposed for a few years. It
demonstrates an effective learning capability for many classification and
regression problems. However, BLS and its improved versions are mainly used to
deal with unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised learning problems in a
single domain. As far as we know, a little attention is paid to the
cross-domain learning ability of BLS. Therefore, we introduce BLS into the
field of transfer learning and propose a novel algorithm called domain
adaptation broad learning system based on locally linear embedding (DABLS-LLE).
The proposed algorithm can learn a robust classification model by using a small
part of labeled data from the target domain and all labeled data from the
source domain. The proposed algorithm inherits the computational efficiency and
learning capability of BLS. Experiments on benchmark dataset
(Office-Caltech-10) verify the effectiveness of our approach. The results show
that our approach can get better classification accuracy with less running time
than many existing transfer learning approaches. It shows that our approach can
bring a new superiority for BLS.</span>

                                        <span>Recent work has made significant progress in helping users to automate single
data preparation steps, such as string-transformations and table-manipulation
operators (e.g., Join, GroupBy, Pivot, etc.). We in this work propose to
automate multiple such steps end-to-end, by synthesizing complex data pipelines
with both string transformations and table-manipulation operators. We propose a
novel &quot;by-target&quot; paradigm that allows users to easily specify the desired
pipeline, which is a significant departure from the traditional by-example
paradigm. Using by-target, users would provide input tables (e.g., csv or json
files), and point us to a &quot;target table&quot; (e.g., an existing database table or
BI dashboard) to demonstrate how the output from the desired pipeline would
schematically &quot;look like&quot;. While the problem is seemingly underspecified, our
unique insight is that implicit table constraints such as FDs and keys can be
exploited to significantly constrain the space to make the problem tractable.
We develop an Auto-Pipeline system that learns to synthesize pipelines using
reinforcement learning and search. Experiments on large numbers of real
pipelines crawled from GitHub suggest that Auto-Pipeline can successfully
synthesize 60-70% of these complex pipelines (up to 10 steps) in 10-20 seconds
on average.</span>

                                        <span>We study the problem of learning control policies for complex tasks given by
logical specifications. Recent approaches automatically generate a reward
function from a given specification and use a suitable reinforcement learning
algorithm to learn a policy that maximizes the expected reward. These
approaches, however, scale poorly to complex tasks that require high-level
planning. In this work, we develop a compositional learning approach, called
DiRL, that interleaves high-level planning and reinforcement learning. First,
DiRL encodes the specification as an abstract graph; intuitively, vertices and
edges of the graph correspond to regions of the state space and simpler
sub-tasks, respectively. Our approach then incorporates reinforcement learning
to learn neural network policies for each edge (sub-task) within a
Dijkstra-style planning algorithm to compute a high-level plan in the graph. An
evaluation of the proposed approach on a set of challenging control benchmarks
with continuous state and action spaces demonstrates that it outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

gain control over decisions in generic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems
including deep learning neural networks. In contrast to adversarial data
modification, the attack mechanism we consider here involves alterations to the
AI system itself. Such a stealth attack could be conducted by a mischievous,
corrupt or disgruntled member of a software development team. It could also be
made by those wishing to exploit a &quot;democratization of AI&quot; agenda, where
network architectures and trained parameter sets are shared publicly. Building
on work by [Tyukin et al., International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,
2020], we develop a range of new implementable attack strategies with
accompanying analysis, showing that with high probability a stealth attack can
be made transparent, in the sense that system performance is unchanged on a
fixed validation set which is unknown to the attacker, while evoking any
desired output on a trigger input of interest. The attacker only needs to have
estimates of the size of the validation set and the spread of the AI&#x27;s relevant
latent space. In the case of deep learning neural networks, we show that a one
neuron attack is possible - a modification to the weights and bias associated
with a single neuron - revealing a vulnerability arising from
over-parameterization. We illustrate these concepts in a realistic setting.
Guided by the theory and computational results, we also propose strategies to
guard against stealth attacks.</span>

                                        <span>High-resolution manometry (HRM) is the primary procedure used to diagnose
esophageal motility disorders. Its interpretation and classification includes
an initial evaluation of swallow-level outcomes and then derivation of a
study-level diagnosis based on Chicago Classification (CC), using a tree-like
algorithm. This diagnostic approach on motility disordered using HRM was
mirrored using a multi-stage modeling framework developed using a combination
of various machine learning approaches. Specifically, the framework includes
deep-learning models at the swallow-level stage and feature-based machine
learning models at the study-level stage. In the swallow-level stage, three
models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed to predict
swallow type, swallow pressurization, and integrated relaxation pressure (IRP).
At the study-level stage, model selection from families of the
expert-knowledge-based rule models, xgboost models and artificial neural
network(ANN) models were conducted, with the latter two model designed and
augmented with motivation from the export knowledge. A simple model-agnostic
strategy of model balancing motivated by Bayesian principles was utilized,
which gave rise to model averaging weighted by precision scores. The averaged
(blended) models and individual models were compared and evaluated, of which
the best performance on test dataset is 0.81 in top-1 prediction, 0.92 in top-2
predictions. This is the first artificial-intelligence-style model to
automatically predict CC diagnosis of HRM study from raw multi-swallow data.
Moreover, the proposed modeling framework could be easily extended to
multi-modal tasks, such as diagnosis of esophageal patients based on clinical
data from both HRM and functional luminal imaging probe panometry (FLIP).</span>

                                        <span>We propose POLAR, a \textbf{pol}ynomial \textbf{ar}ithmetic framework that
leverages polynomial overapproximations with interval remainders for
bounded-time reachability analysis of neural network-controlled systems
(NNCSs). Compared with existing arithmetic approaches that use standard Taylor
models, our framework uses a novel approach to iteratively overapproximate the
neuron output ranges layer-by-layer with a combination of Bernstein polynomial
interpolation for continuous activation functions and Taylor model arithmetic
for the other operations. This approach can overcome the main drawback in the
standard Taylor model arithmetic, i.e. its inability to handle functions that
cannot be well approximated by Taylor polynomials, and significantly improve
the accuracy and efficiency of reachable states computation for NNCSs. To
further tighten the overapproximation, our method keeps the Taylor model
remainders symbolic under the linear mappings when estimating the output range
of a neural network. We show that POLAR can be seamlessly integrated with
existing Taylor model flowpipe construction techniques, and demonstrate that
POLAR significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art techniques on a
suite of benchmarks.</span>

but it is also creating issues related to the development of fair, accountable,
transparent, and ethical Artificial Intelligence. As the ML models are not
fully comprehensible yet, it is obvious that we still need humans to be part of
algorithmic decision-making processes. In this paper, we consider a ML
framework that may accelerate model learning and improve its interpretability
by incorporating human experts into the model learning loop. We propose a novel
human-in-the-loop ML framework aimed at dealing with learning problems that the
cost of data annotation is high and the lack of appropriate data to model the
association between the target tasks and the input features. With an
application to precision dosing, our experimental results show that the
approach can learn interpretable rules from data and may potentially lower
experts&#x27; workload by replacing data annotation with rule representation
editing. The approach may also help remove algorithmic bias by introducing
experts&#x27; feedback into the iterative model learning process.</span>

in applications with sparsely user-provided labels. Their unique relative
prediction setup offers opportunities for novel attacks, such as targeting
support sets required to categorise unseen test samples, which are not
available in other machine learning setups. In this work, we propose a
detection strategy to identify adversarial support sets, aimed at destroying
the understanding of a few-shot classifier for a certain class. We achieve this
by introducing the concept of self-similarity of a support set and by employing
filtering of supports. Our method is attack-agnostic, and we are the first to
explore adversarial detection for support sets of few-shot classifiers to the
best of our knowledge. Our evaluation of the miniImagenet (MI) and CUB datasets
exhibits good attack detection performance despite conceptual simplicity,
showing high AUROC scores. We show that self-similarity and filtering for
adversarial detection can be paired with other filtering functions,
constituting a generalisable concept.</span>

                                        <span>Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) algorithms have been traditionally
designed with the goal of learning accurate dynamics of the environment. This
introduces a mismatch between the objectives of model-learning and the overall
learning problem of finding an optimal policy. Value-aware model learning, an
alternative model-learning paradigm to maximum likelihood, proposes to inform
model-learning through the value function of the learnt policy. While this
paradigm is theoretically sound, it does not scale beyond toy settings. In this
work, we propose a novel value-aware objective that is an upper bound on the
absolute performance difference of a policy across two models. Further, we
propose a general purpose algorithm that modifies the standard MBRL pipeline --
enabling learning with value aware objectives. Our proposed objective, in
conjunction with this algorithm, is the first successful instantiation of
value-aware MBRL on challenging continuous control environments, outperforming
previous value-aware objectives and with competitive performance w.r.t.

variational quantum algorithm today. We train QAOA one layer at a time to
maximize overlap with an $n$ qubit target state. Doing so we discovered that
such training always saturates -- called \textit{training saturation} -- at
some depth $p^*$, meaning that past a certain depth, overlap can not be
improved by adding subsequent layers. We formulate necessary conditions for
saturation. Numerically, we find layerwise QAOA reaches its maximum overlap at
depth $p^*&#x3D;n$. The addition of coherent dephasing errors to training removes
saturation, recovering robustness to layerwise training. This study sheds new
light on the performance limitations and prospects of QAOA.</span>

patterns. Both sampling and inference are tractable for DPPs, a rare feature
among models with negative dependence that explains their popularity in machine
learning and spatial statistics. Parametric and nonparametric inference methods
have been proposed in the finite case, i.e. when the point patterns live in a
finite ground set. In the continuous case, only parametric methods have been
investigated, while nonparametric maximum likelihood for DPPs -- an
optimization problem over trace-class operators -- has remained an open
question. In this paper, we show that a restricted version of this maximum
likelihood (MLE) problem falls within the scope of a recent representer theorem
for nonnegative functions in an RKHS. This leads to a finite-dimensional
problem, with strong statistical ties to the original MLE. Moreover, we
propose, analyze, and demonstrate a fixed point algorithm to solve this
finite-dimensional problem. Finally, we also provide a controlled estimate of
the correlation kernel of the DPP, thus providing more interpretability.</span>

experiences it absorbs from previous episodes. While regularization techniques
such as LWF, SI, EWC have proven themselves as an effective avenue to overcome
this issue by constraining important parameters of old tasks from changing when
accepting new concepts, these approaches do not exploit common information of
each task which can be shared to existing neurons. As a result, they do not
scale well to large-scale problems since the parameter importance variables
quickly explode. An Inter-Task Synaptic Mapping (ISYANA) is proposed here to
underpin knowledge retention for continual learning. ISYANA combines
task-to-neuron relationship as well as concept-to-concept relationship such
that it prevents a neuron to embrace distinct concepts while merely accepting
relevant concept. Numerical study in the benchmark continual learning problems
has been carried out followed by comparison against prominent continual
learning algorithms. ISYANA exhibits competitive performance compared to state
of the arts. Codes of ISYANA is made available in

its logs. Our own study of a production debugging workflow confirms the
magnitude of this burden. This paper explores whether a machine-learning model
can assist developers in distributed systems debugging. We present Revelio, a
debugging assistant which takes user reports and system logs as input, and
outputs debugging queries that developers can use to find a bug&#x27;s root cause.
The key challenges lie in (1) combining inputs of different types (e.g.,
natural language reports and quantitative logs) and (2) generalizing to unseen
faults. Revelio addresses these by employing deep neural networks to uniformly
embed diverse input sources and potential queries into a high-dimensional
vector space. In addition, it exploits observations from production systems to
factorize query generation into two computationally and statistically simpler
learning tasks. To evaluate Revelio, we built a testbed with multiple
distributed applications and debugging tools. By injecting faults and training
on logs and reports from 800 Mechanical Turkers, we show that Revelio includes
the most helpful query in its predicted list of top-3 relevant queries 96% of
the time. Our developer study confirms the utility of Revelio.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a method to estimate the uncertainty of the outcome of an image
classifier on a given input datum. Deep neural networks commonly used for image
classification are deterministic maps from an input image to an output class.
As such, their outcome on a given datum involves no uncertainty, so we must
specify what variability we are referring to when defining, measuring and
interpreting &quot;confidence.&quot; To this end, we introduce the Wellington Posterior,
which is the distribution of outcomes that would have been obtained in response
to data that could have been generated by the same scene that produced the
given image. Since there are infinitely many scenes that could have generated
the given image, the Wellington Posterior requires induction from scenes other
than the one portrayed. We explore alternate methods using data augmentation,
ensembling, and model linearization. Additional alternatives include generative
adversarial networks, conditional prior networks, and supervised single-view
reconstruction. We test these alternatives against the empirical posterior
obtained by inferring the class of temporally adjacent frames in a video. These
developments are only a small step towards assessing the reliability of deep
network classifiers in a manner that is compatible with safety-critical
applications.</span>

                                        <span>Variation Autoencoder (VAE) has become a powerful tool in modeling the
non-linear generative process of data from a low-dimensional latent space.
Recently, several studies have proposed to use VAE for unsupervised clustering
by using mixture models to capture the multi-modal structure of latent
representations. This strategy, however, is ineffective when there are outlier
data samples whose latent representations are meaningless, yet contaminating
the estimation of key major clusters in the latent space. This exact problem
arises in the context of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) analysis, where
clustering major functional connectivity patterns is often hindered by heavy
noise of rs-fMRI and many minor clusters (rare connectivity patterns) of no
interest to analysis. In this paper we propose a novel generative process, in
which we use a Gaussian-mixture to model a few major clusters in the data, and
use a non-informative uniform distribution to capture the remaining data. We
embed this truncated Gaussian-Mixture model in a Variational AutoEncoder
framework to obtain a general joint clustering and outlier detection approach,
called tGM-VAE. We demonstrated the applicability of tGM-VAE on the MNIST
dataset and further validated it in the context of rs-fMRI connectivity
analysis.</span>

                                        <span>A basic requirement for a mathematical model is often that its solution
(output) shouldn&#x27;t change much if the model&#x27;s parameters (input) are perturbed.
This is important because the exact values of parameters may not be known and
one would like to avoid being mislead by an output obtained using incorrect
values. Thus, it&#x27;s rarely enough to address an application by formulating a
model, solving the resulting optimization problem and presenting the solution
as the answer. One would need to confirm that the model is suitable, i.e.,
&quot;good,&quot; and this can, at least in part, be achieved by considering a family of
optimization problems constructed by perturbing parameters of concern. The
resulting sensitivity analysis uncovers troubling situations with unstable
solutions, which we referred to as &quot;bad&quot; models, and indicates better model
formulations. Embedding an actual problem of interest within a family of
problems is also a primary path to optimality conditions as well as
computationally attractive, alternative problems, which under ideal
circumstances, and when properly tuned, may even furnish the minimum value of
the actual problem. The tuning of these alternative problems turns out to be
intimately tied to finding multipliers in optimality conditions and thus
emerges as a main component of several optimization algorithms. In fact, the
tuning amounts to solving certain dual optimization problems. In this tutorial,
we&#x27;ll discuss the opportunities and insights afforded by this broad
perspective.</span>

to build a coherent statistical inference procedure on persistent diagrams. The

model to each data holder for local training and then aggregates committed
models globally to achieve privacy protection. However, both the dragger issue
of synchronous collaborative learning and the staleness issue of asynchronous
collaborative learning make collaborative learning inefficient in real-world
heterogeneous environments. We propose a novel and efficient collaborative
learning framework named AdaptCL, which generates an adaptive sub-model
dynamically from the global base model for each data holder, without any prior
information about worker capability. All workers (data holders) achieve
approximately identical update time as the fastest worker by equipping them
with capability-adapted pruned models. Thus the training process can be
dramatically accelerated. Besides, we tailor the efficient pruned rate learning
algorithm and pruning approach for AdaptCL. Meanwhile, AdaptCL provides a
mechanism for handling the trade-off between accuracy and time overhead and can
be combined with other techniques to accelerate training further. Empirical
results show that AdaptCL introduces little computing and communication
overhead. AdaptCL achieves time savings of more than 41\% on average and
improves accuracy in a low heterogeneous environment. In a highly heterogeneous
environment, AdaptCL achieves a training speedup of 6.2x with a slight loss of
accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>The mean squared error loss is widely used in many applications, including
auto-encoders, multi-target regression, and matrix factorization, to name a
few. Despite computational advantages due to its differentiability, it is not
robust to outliers. In contrast, l_p norms are known to be robust, but cannot
be optimized via, e.g., stochastic gradient descent, as they are
non-differentiable. We propose an algorithm inspired by so-called model-based
optimization (MBO) [35, 36], which replaces a non-convex objective with a
convex model function and alternates between optimizing the model function and
updating the solution. We apply this to robust regression, proposing SADM, a
stochastic variant of the Online Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(OADM) [50] to solve the inner optimization in MBO. We show that SADM converges
with the rate O(log T/T). Finally, we demonstrate experimentally (a) the
robustness of l_p norms to outliers and (b) the efficiency of our proposed
model-based algorithms in comparison with gradient methods on autoencoders and
multi-target regression.</span>

pointwise residuals. We derive rigorous bounds on the error, incurred by PINNs
in approximating the solutions of a large class of linear parabolic PDEs,
namely Kolmogorov equations that include the heat equation and Black-Scholes
equation of option pricing, as examples. We construct neural networks, whose
PINN residual (generalization error) can be made as small as desired. We also
prove that the total $L^2$-error can be bounded by the generalization error,
which in turn is bounded in terms of the training error, provided that a
sufficient number of randomly chosen training (collocation) points is used.
Moreover, we prove that the size of the PINNs and the number of training
samples only grow polynomially with the underlying dimension, enabling PINNs to
overcome the curse of dimensionality in this context. These results enable us
to provide a comprehensive error analysis for PINNs in approximating Kolmogorov
PDEs.</span>

large memory footprint makes them ill-suited for low-resource platforms such as
connected objects. We explored using reduced-precision floating-point
representations to lower memory consumption and evaluated its effect on
classification performance. We applied the Mondrian Forest implementation
provided by OrpailleCC, a C++ collection of data stream algorithms, to two
canonical datasets in human activity recognition: Recofit and Banos \emph{et
al}. Results show that the precision of floating-point values used by tree
nodes can be reduced from 64 bits to 8 bits with no significant difference in
F1 score. In some cases, reduced precision was shown to improve classification
performance, presumably due to its regularization effect. We conclude that
numerical precision is a relevant hyperparameter in the Mondrian Forest, and
that commonly-used double precision values may not be necessary for optimal
performance. Future work will evaluate the generalizability of these findings
to other data stream classifiers.</span>

morbidity. The prevention of DFU may be achieved by the identification of
patients at risk of DFU and the institution of preventative measures through
education and offloading. Several studies have reported that thermogram images
may help to detect an increase in plantar temperature prior to DFU. However,
the distribution of plantar temperature may be heterogeneous, making it
difficult to quantify and utilize to predict outcomes. We have compared a
machine learning-based scoring technique with feature selection and
optimization techniques and learning classifiers to several state-of-the-art
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on foot thermogram images and propose a
robust solution to identify the diabetic foot. A comparatively shallow CNN
model, MobilenetV2 achieved an F1 score of ~95% for a two-feet thermogram
image-based classification and the AdaBoost Classifier used 10 features and
achieved an F1 score of 97 %. A comparison of the inference time for the
best-performing networks confirmed that the proposed algorithm can be deployed

                                        <span>Supervised learning, while deployed in real-life scenarios, often encounters
instances of unknown classes. Conventional algorithms for training a supervised
learning model do not provide an option to detect such instances, so they
miss-classify such instances with 100% probability. Open Set Recognition (OSR)
and Non-Exhaustive Learning (NEL) are potential solutions to overcome this
problem. Most existing methods of OSR first classify members of existing
classes and then identify instances of new classes. However, many of the
existing methods of OSR only makes a binary decision, i.e., they only identify
the existence of the unknown class. Hence, such methods cannot distinguish test
instances belonging to incremental unseen classes. On the other hand, the
majority of NEL methods often make a parametric assumption over the data
distribution, which either fail to return good results, due to the reason that
real-life complex datasets may not follow a well-known data distribution. In
this paper, we propose a new online non-exhaustive learning model, namely,
Non-Exhaustive Gaussian Mixture Generative Adversarial Networks (NE-GM-GAN) to
address these issues. Our proposed model synthesizes Gaussian mixture based
latent representation over a deep generative model, such as GAN, for
incremental detection of instances of emerging classes in the test data.
Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that
NE-GM-GAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in detecting
instances of novel classes in streaming data.</span>

it requires expertise and experience to identify abnormalities. It is thus
crucial to develop automated models for the detection of abnormalities in EEGs
related to epilepsy. This paper describes the development of a novel class of
compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting abnormal patterns
and electrodes in EEGs for epilepsy. The designed model is inspired by a CNN
developed for brain-computer interfacing called multichannel EEGNet (mEEGNet).
Unlike the EEGNet, the proposed model, mEEGNet, has the same number of
electrode inputs and outputs to detect abnormal patterns. The mEEGNet was
evaluated with a clinical dataset consisting of 29 cases of juvenile and
childhood absence epilepsy labeled by a clinical expert. The labels were given
to paroxysmal discharges visually observed in both ictal (seizure) and
interictal (nonseizure) durations. Results showed that the mEEGNet detected
abnormalities with the area under the curve, F1-values, and sensitivity
equivalent to or higher than those of existing CNNs. Moreover, the number of
parameters is much smaller than other CNN models. To our knowledge, the dataset
of absence epilepsy validated with machine learning through this research is
the largest in the literature.</span>

                                        <span>Most edge AI focuses on prediction tasks on resource-limited edge devices
while the training is done at server machines. However, retraining or
customizing a model is required at edge devices as the model is becoming
outdated due to environmental changes over time. To follow such a concept
drift, a neural-network based on-device learning approach is recently proposed,
so that edge devices train incoming data at runtime to update their model. In
this case, since a training is done at distributed edge devices, the issue is
that only a limited amount of training data can be used for each edge device.
To address this issue, one approach is a cooperative learning or federated
learning, where edge devices exchange their trained results and update their
model by using those collected from the other devices. In this paper, as an
on-device learning algorithm, we focus on OS-ELM (Online Sequential Extreme
Learning Machine) to sequentially train a model based on recent samples and
combine it with autoencoder for anomaly detection. We extend it for an
on-device federated learning so that edge devices can exchange their trained
results and update their model by using those collected from the other edge
devices. This cooperative model update is one-shot while it can be repeatedly
applied to synchronize their model. Our approach is evaluated with anomaly
detection tasks generated from a driving dataset of cars, a human activity
dataset, and MNIST dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed on-device
federated learning can produce a merged model by integrating trained results
from multiple edge devices as accurately as traditional backpropagation based
neural networks and a traditional federated learning approach with lower
computation or communication cost.</span>

graph data. They have wide applications in chemistry and biology, such as
molecular property prediction, reaction prediction and drug-target interaction
prediction. Despite the interest, GNN-based modeling is challenging as it
requires graph data pre-processing and modeling in addition to programming and
deep learning. Here we present DGL-LifeSci, an open-source package for deep
learning on graphs in life science. DGL-LifeSci is a python toolkit based on
RDKit, PyTorch and Deep Graph Library (DGL). DGL-LifeSci allows GNN-based
modeling on custom datasets for molecular property prediction, reaction
prediction and molecule generation. With its command-line interfaces, users can
perform modeling without any background in programming and deep learning. We
test the command-line interfaces using standard benchmarks MoleculeNet, USPTO,
and ZINC. Compared with previous implementations, DGL-LifeSci achieves a speed
up by up to 6x. For modeling flexibility, DGL-LifeSci provides well-optimized
modules for various stages of the modeling pipeline. In addition, DGL-LifeSci

                                        <span>One of the most well-established applications of machine learning is in
deciding what content to show website visitors. When observation data comes
from high-velocity, user-generated data streams, machine learning methods
perform a balancing act between model complexity, training time, and
computational costs. Furthermore, when model freshness is critical, the
training of models becomes time-constrained. Parallelized batch offline
training, although horizontally scalable, is often not time-considerate or
cost-effective. In this paper, we propose Lambda Learner, a new framework for
training models by incremental updates in response to mini-batches from data
streams. We show that the resulting model of our framework closely estimates a
periodically updated model trained on offline data and outperforms it when
model updates are time-sensitive. We provide theoretical proof that the
incremental learning updates improve the loss-function over a stale batch
model. We present a large-scale deployment on the sponsored content platform
for a large social network, serving hundreds of millions of users across
different channels (e.g., desktop, mobile). We address challenges and
complexities from both algorithms and infrastructure perspectives, and
illustrate the system details for computation, storage, and streaming
production of training data.</span>

                                        <span>Dropout is a powerful and widely used technique to regularize the training of
deep neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a simple regularization
strategy upon dropout in model training, namely R-Drop, which forces the output
distributions of different sub models generated by dropout to be consistent
with each other. Specifically, for each training sample, R-Drop minimizes the
bidirectional KL-divergence between the output distributions of two sub models
sampled by dropout. Theoretical analysis reveals that R-Drop reduces the
freedom of the model parameters and complements dropout. Experiments on
$\bf{5}$ widely used deep learning tasks ($\bf{18}$ datasets in total),
including neural machine translation, abstractive summarization, language
understanding, language modeling, and image classification, show that R-Drop is
universally effective. In particular, it yields substantial improvements when
applied to fine-tune large-scale pre-trained models, e.g., ViT, RoBERTa-large,
and BART, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances with the vanilla
Transformer model on WMT14 English$\to$German translation ($\bf{30.91}$ BLEU)
and WMT14 English$\to$French translation ($\bf{43.95}$ BLEU), even surpassing
models trained with extra large-scale data and expert-designed advanced
variants of Transformer models. Our code is available at

high-dimensional inputs, such as images, to obtain models that are provably
robust against adversarial perturbations of the input. We extend this technique
to produce provable robustness for functions that map inputs into an arbitrary
metric space rather than discrete classes. Such functions are used in many
machine learning problems like image reconstruction, dimensionality reduction,
facial recognition, etc. Our robustness certificates guarantee that the change
in the output of the smoothed model as measured by the distance metric remains
small for any norm-bounded perturbation of the input. We can certify robustness
under a variety of different output metrics, such as total variation distance,
Jaccard distance, perceptual metrics, etc. In our experiments, we apply our
procedure to create certifiably robust models with disparate output spaces --
from sets to images -- and show that it yields meaningful certificates without
significantly degrading the performance of the base model. The code for our
experiments is available at: https://github.com/aounon/center-smoothing.</span>

capture a model&#x27;s predictive reasoning by identifying &quot;important&quot; pixels in an
input image. However, the development and adoption of saliency methods are
currently hindered by the lack of access to underlying model reasoning, which
prevents accurate method evaluation. In this work, we design a synthetic
evaluation framework, SMERF, that allows us to perform ground-truth-based
evaluation of saliency methods while controlling the underlying complexity of
model reasoning. Experimental evaluations via SMERF reveal significant
limitations in existing saliency methods, especially given the relative
simplicity of SMERF&#x27;s synthetic evaluation tasks. Moreover, the SMERF
benchmarking suite represents a useful tool in the development of new saliency
methods to potentially overcome these limitations.</span>

highlighted than ever. The task of transferring an input&#x27;s style to another is
accompanied by plenty of challenges (e.g., fluency and content preservation)
that need to be taken care of. In this research, we introduce PGST, a novel
polyglot text style transfer approach in the gender domain, composed of
different constitutive elements. In contrast to prior studies, it is feasible
to apply a style transfer method in multiple languages by fulfilling our
method&#x27;s predefined elements. We have proceeded with a pre-trained word
embedding for token replacement purposes, a character-based token classifier
for gender exchange purposes, and a beam search algorithm for extracting the
most fluent combination. Since different approaches are introduced in our
research, we determine a trade-off value for evaluating different models&#x27;
success in faking our gender identification model with transferred text. To
demonstrate our method&#x27;s multilingual applicability, we applied our method on
both English and Persian corpora and ended up defeating our proposed gender
identification model by 45.6% and 39.2%, respectively. While this research&#x27;s
focus is not limited to a specific language, our obtained evaluation results
are highly competitive in an analogy among English state of the art methods.</span>

sequential decision-making tasks, there has been little research on explaining
their predictions. In this work, we present TimeSHAP, a model-agnostic
recurrent explainer that builds upon KernelSHAP and extends it to the

pruning method that is shown to dramatically decrease both its computational
cost and the variance of its attributions. We use TimeSHAP to explain the
predictions of a real-world bank account takeover fraud detection RNN model,
and draw key insights from its explanations: i) the model identifies important
features and events aligned with what fraud analysts consider cues for account
takeover; ii) positive predicted sequences can be pruned to only 10% of the
original length, as older events have residual attribution values; iii) the
most recent input event of positive predictions only contributes on average to
41% of the model&#x27;s score; iv) notably high attribution to client&#x27;s age,
suggesting a potential discriminatory reasoning, later confirmed as higher
false positive rates for older clients.</span>

                                        <span>Learning efficiently a causal model of the environment is a key challenge of
model-based RL agents operating in POMDPs. We consider here a scenario where
the learning agent has the ability to collect online experiences through direct
interactions with the environment (interventional data), but has also access to
a large collection of offline experiences, obtained by observing another agent
interacting with the environment (observational data). A key ingredient, that
makes this situation non-trivial, is that we allow the observed agent to
interact with the environment based on hidden information, which is not
observed by the learning agent. We then ask the following questions: can the
online and offline experiences be safely combined for learning a causal model ?
And can we expect the offline experiences to improve the agent&#x27;s performances ?
To answer these questions, we import ideas from the well-established causal
framework of do-calculus, and we express model-based reinforcement learning as
a causal inference problem. Then, we propose a general yet simple methodology
for leveraging offline data during learning. In a nutshell, the method relies
on learning a latent-based causal transition model that explains both the
interventional and observational regimes, and then using the recovered latent
variable to infer the standard POMDP transition model via deconfounding. We
prove our method is correct and efficient in the sense that it attains better
generalization guarantees due to the offline data (in the asymptotic case), and
we illustrate its effectiveness empirically on synthetic toy problems. Our
contribution aims at bridging the gap between the fields of reinforcement
learning and causality.</span>

                                        <span>Most sequential recommendation models capture the features of consecutive
items in a user-item interaction history. Though effective, their
representation expressiveness is still hindered by the sparse learning signals.
As a result, the sequential recommender is prone to make inconsistent
predictions. In this paper, we propose a model, \textbf{SSI}, to improve
sequential recommendation consistency with Self-Supervised Imitation.
Precisely, we extract the consistency knowledge by utilizing three
self-supervised pre-training tasks, where temporal consistency and persona
consistency capture user-interaction dynamics in terms of the chronological
order and persona sensitivities, respectively. Furthermore, to provide the
model with a global perspective, global session consistency is introduced by
maximizing the mutual information among global and local interaction sequences.
Finally, to comprehensively take advantage of all three independent aspects of
consistency-enhanced knowledge, we establish an integrated imitation learning
framework. The consistency knowledge is effectively internalized and
transferred to the student model by imitating the conventional prediction logit
as well as the consistency-enhanced item representations. In addition, the
flexible self-supervised imitation framework can also benefit other student
recommenders. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that SSI effectively
outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.</span>

                                        <span>A major obstacle to achieving global convergence in distributed and federated
learning is the misalignment of gradients across clients, or mini-batches due
to heterogeneity and stochasticity of the distributed data. One way to
alleviate this problem is to encourage the alignment of gradients across
different clients throughout training. Our analysis reveals that this goal can
be accomplished by utilizing the right optimization method that replicates the
implicit regularization effect of SGD, leading to gradient alignment as well as
improvements in test accuracies. Since the existence of this regularization in
SGD completely relies on the sequential use of different mini-batches during
training, it is inherently absent when training with large mini-batches. To
obtain the generalization benefits of this regularization while increasing
parallelism, we propose a novel GradAlign algorithm that induces the same
implicit regularization while allowing the use of arbitrarily large batches in
each update. We experimentally validate the benefit of our algorithm in
different distributed and federated learning settings.</span>

                                        <span>Learning and reasoning over graphs is increasingly done by means of
probabilistic models, e.g. exponential random graph models, graph embedding
models, and graph neural networks. When graphs are modeling relations between
people, however, they will inevitably reflect biases, prejudices, and other
forms of inequity and inequality. An important challenge is thus to design
accurate graph modeling approaches while guaranteeing fairness according to the
specific notion of fairness that the problem requires. Yet, past work on the
topic remains scarce, is limited to debiasing specific graph modeling methods,
and often aims to ensure fairness in an indirect manner.

We propose a generic approach applicable to most probabilistic graph modeling
approaches. Specifically, we first define the class of fair graph models
corresponding to a chosen set of fairness criteria. Given this, we propose a
fairness regularizer defined as the KL-divergence between the graph model and
its I-projection onto the set of fair models. We demonstrate that using this
fairness regularizer in combination with existing graph modeling approaches
efficiently trades-off fairness with accuracy, whereas the state-of-the-art
models can only make this trade-off for the fairness criterion that they were
specifically designed for.</span>

                                        <span>Polygonal meshes are ubiquitous, but have only played a relatively minor role
in the deep learning revolution. State-of-the-art neural generative models for
3D shapes learn implicit functions and generate meshes via expensive
iso-surfacing. We overcome these challenges by employing a classical spatial
data structure from computer graphics, Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), to
facilitate 3D learning. The core operation of BSP involves recursive
subdivision of 3D space to obtain convex sets. By exploiting this property, we
devise BSP-Net, a network that learns to represent a 3D shape via convex
decomposition without supervision. The network is trained to reconstruct a
shape using a set of convexes obtained from a BSP-tree built over a set of
planes, where the planes and convexes are both defined by learned network
weights. BSP-Net directly outputs polygonal meshes from the inferred convexes.
The generated meshes are watertight, compact (i.e., low-poly), and well suited
to represent sharp geometry. We show that the reconstruction quality by BSP-Net
is competitive with those from state-of-the-art methods while using much fewer
primitives. We also explore variations to BSP-Net including using a more
generic decoder for reconstruction, more general primitives than planes, as
well as training a generative model with variational auto-encoders. Code is
available at https://github.com/czq142857/BSP-NET-original.</span>

(DR), a frequent complication of diabetes that can lead to visual impairment
and blindness. Adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) provides
real-time retinal images with resolution down to 2 $\mu m$ and thus allows
detection of the morphologies of individual MAs, a potential marker that might
dictate MA pathology and affect the progression of DR. In contrast to the
numerous automatic models developed for assessing the number of MAs on fundus
photographs, currently there is no high throughput image protocol available for
automatic analysis of AOSLO photographs. To address this urgency, we introduce
AOSLO-net, a deep neural network framework with customized training policies to
automatically segment MAs from AOSLO images. We evaluate the performance of
AOSLO-net using 87 DR AOSLO images and our results demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation model both in

make decisions over time under uncertainty. An enormous body of work has
accumulated over the years, covered in several books and surveys. This book
provides a more introductory, textbook-like treatment of the subject. Each
chapter tackles a particular line of work, providing a self-contained,
teachable technical introduction and a brief review of the further
developments; many of the chapters conclude with exercises.

The book is structured as follows. The first four chapters are on IID
rewards, from the basic model to impossibility results to Bayesian priors to
Lipschitz rewards. The next three chapters cover adversarial rewards, from the
full-feedback version to adversarial bandits to extensions with linear rewards
and combinatorially structured actions. Chapter 8 is on contextual bandits, a
middle ground between IID and adversarial bandits in which the change in reward
distributions is completely explained by observable contexts. The last three
chapters cover connections to economics, from learning in repeated games to
bandits with supply/budget constraints to exploration in the presence of
incentives. The appendix provides sufficient background on concentration and
KL-divergence.

The chapters on &quot;bandits with similarity information&quot;, &quot;bandits with
knapsacks&quot; and &quot;bandits and agents&quot; can also be consumed as standalone surveys
on the respective topics.</span>

                                        <span>During the last decade or so, there has been an insurgence in the deep
learning community to solve health-related issues, particularly breast cancer.
Following the Camelyon-16 challenge in 2016, several researchers have dedicated
their time to build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to help radiologists
and other clinicians diagnose breast cancer. In particular, there has been an
emphasis on Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS); the clinical term for early-stage
breast cancer. Large companies have given their fair share of research into
this subject, among these Google Deepmind who developed a model in 2020 that
has proven to be better than radiologists themselves to diagnose breast cancer
correctly.

We found that among the issues which exist, there is a need for an
explanatory system that goes through the hidden layers of a CNN to highlight
those pixels that contributed to the classification of a mammogram. We then
chose an open-source, reasonably successful project developed by Prof. Shen,
using the CBIS-DDSM image database to run our experiments on. It was later
improved using the Resnet-50 and VGG-16 patch-classifiers, analytically
comparing the outcome of both. The results showed that the Resnet-50 one
converged earlier in the experiments.

Following the research by Montavon and Binder, we used the DeepTaylor
Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) model to highlight those pixels and
regions within a mammogram which contribute most to its classification. This is
represented as a map of those pixels in the original image, which contribute to
the diagnosis and the extent to which they contribute to the final
classification. The most significant advantage of this algorithm is that it
performs exceptionally well with the Resnet-50 patch classifier architecture.</span>

                                        <span>Toxicity detection of text has been a popular NLP task in the recent years.
In SemEval-2021 Task-5 Toxic Spans Detection, the focus is on detecting toxic
spans within passages. Most state-of-the-art span detection approaches employ
various techniques, each of which can be broadly classified into Token
Classification or Span Prediction approaches. In our paper, we explore simple
versions of both of these approaches and their performance on the task.
Specifically, we use BERT-based models -- BERT, RoBERTa, and SpanBERT for both
approaches. We also combine these approaches and modify them to bring
improvements for Toxic Spans prediction. To this end, we investigate results on
four hybrid approaches -- Multi-Span, Span+Token, LSTM-CRF, and a combination
of predicted offsets using union/intersection. Additionally, we perform a
thorough ablative analysis and analyze our observed results. Our best
submission -- a combination of SpanBERT Span Predictor and RoBERTa Token
Classifier predictions -- achieves an F1 score of 0.6753 on the test set. Our
best post-eval F1 score is 0.6895 on intersection of predicted offsets from
top-3 RoBERTa Token Classification checkpoints. These approaches improve the
performance by 3% on average than those of the shared baseline models -- RNNSL
and SpaCy NER.</span>

by mobile users. However, this popular service can be abused by executing
illegal activities and influencing security risks. Nowadays, many automatic
machine learning (AutoML) tools exist which can help domain experts and lay
users to build high-quality ML models with little or no machine learning
knowledge. In this work, a classification performance comparison was conducted
between three automatic ML tools for SMS spam message filtering. These tools
are mljar-supervised AutoML, H2O AutoML, and Tree-based Pipeline Optimization
Tool (TPOT) AutoML. Experimental results showed that ensemble models achieved
the best classification performance. The Stacked Ensemble model, which was
built using H2O AutoML, achieved the best performance in terms of Log Loss
(0.8370), true positive (1088/1116), and true negative (281/287) metrics. There
is a 19.05\% improvement in Log Loss with respect to TPOT AutoML and 5.56\%
improvement with respect to mljar-supervised AutoML. The satisfactory filtering
performance achieved with AutoML tools provides a potential application for
AutoML tools to automatically determine the best ML model that can perform best

                                        <span>Attention mechanism has shown enormous potential for single image
super-resolution (SISR). However, existing works only proposed some attention
mechanism for a specific network. A universal attention mechanism for SISR,
which could further improve the performance of networks without attention and
provide a baseline for networks with attention, is still lacking. To fit this
gap, we propose a lightweight and efficient Balanced Attention Mechanism (BAM),
which consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and Maxpool Spatial
Attention Module (MSAM) in parallel. The information extraction mechanism of
ACAM and MSAM effectively filters redundant information, making the overall
structure of BAM very lightweight. Owing to the parallel structure, during the
gradient backpropagation process of BAM, ACAM and MSAM not only conduct
self-optimization, but also mutual optimization so as to generate more balanced
attention information. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we
applied it to 12 state-ofthe-art SISR networks. The results on 4 benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BAM can efficiently improve the networks&#x27;
performance, and for those with attention, the substitution with BAM further
reduces the amount of parameters and increase the inference speed. Moreover,
ablation experiments were conducted to prove the minimalism of BAM.</span>

                                        <span>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a computational technique to estimate
the power loads&#x27; appliance-by-appliance from the whole consumption measured by
a single meter. In this paper, we propose a conditional density estimation
model, based on deep neural networks, that joins a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder with a Conditional Invertible Normalizing Flow model to estimate
the individual appliance&#x27;s power demand. The resulting model is called Prior
Flow Variational Autoencoder or, for simplicity PFVAE. Thus, instead of having
one model per appliance, the resulting model is responsible for estimating the
power demand, appliance-by-appliance, at once. We train and evaluate our
proposed model in a publicly available dataset composed of power demand
measures from a poultry feed factory located in Brazil. The proposed model&#x27;s
quality is evaluated by comparing the obtained normalized disaggregation error
(NDE) and signal aggregated error (SAE) with the previous work values on the
same dataset. Our proposal achieves highly competitive results, and for six of
the eight machines belonging to the dataset, we observe consistent improvements
that go from 28% up to 81% in NDE and from 27% up to 86% in SAE.</span>

intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the
intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI.
Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or
two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center
of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered,
more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as
opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the
field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning
(EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation
problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a
taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison
of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments,
as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core
challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we

real-world deployment.</span>

                                        <span>Kernel mean embeddings are a popular tool that consists in representing
probability measures by their infinite-dimensional mean embeddings in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space. When the kernel is characteristic, mean
embeddings can be used to define a distance between probability measures, known
as the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). A well-known advantage of mean
embeddings and MMD is their low computational cost and low sample complexity.
However, kernel mean embeddings have had limited applications to problems that
consist in optimizing distributions, due to the difficulty of characterizing
which Hilbert space vectors correspond to a probability distribution. In this
note, we propose to leverage the kernel sums-of-squares parameterization of
positive functions of Marteau-Ferey et al. [2020] to fit distributions in the
MMD geometry. First, we show that when the kernel is characteristic,
distributions with a kernel sum-of-squares density are dense. Then, we provide
algorithms to optimize such distributions in the finite-sample setting, which
we illustrate in a density fitting numerical experiment.</span>

feed-forward artificial neural networks. The core of our results is the
construction of neural-network layers that efficiently perform tensor
contractions, and that use commonly adopted non-linear activation functions.
The resulting deep networks feature a number of edges that closely matches the
contraction complexity of the tensor networks to be approximated. In the
context of many-body quantum states, this result establishes that
neural-network states have strictly the same or higher expressive power than
practically usable variational tensor networks. As an example, we show that all
matrix product states can be efficiently written as neural-network states with
a number of edges polynomial in the bond dimension and depth logarithmic in the
system size. The opposite instead does not hold true, and our results imply
that there exist quantum states that are not efficiently expressible in terms
of matrix product states or practically usable PEPS, but that are instead
efficiently expressible with neural network states.</span>

                                        <span>Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks -- slight
but carefully constructed perturbations of the inputs which can drastically
impair the network&#x27;s performance. Many defense methods have been proposed for
improving robustness of deep networks by training them on adversarially
perturbed inputs. However, these models often remain vulnerable to new types of
attacks not seen during training, and even to slightly stronger versions of
previously seen attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
adversarial robustness, which builds upon the insights from the domain
adaptation field. Our method, called Adversarial Feature Desensitization (AFD),
aims at learning features that are invariant towards adversarial perturbations
of the inputs. This is achieved through a game where we learn features that are
both predictive and robust (insensitive to adversarial attacks), i.e. cannot be
used to discriminate between natural and adversarial data. Empirical results on
several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
against a wide range of attack types and attack strengths.</span>

                                        <span>Fabrication process variations can significantly influence the performance
and yield of nano-scale electronic and photonic circuits. Stochastic spectral
methods have achieved great success in quantifying the impact of process
variations, but they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Recently,
low-rank tensor methods have been developed to mitigate this issue, but two
fundamental challenges remain open: how to automatically determine the tensor
rank and how to adaptively pick the informative simulation samples. This paper
proposes a novel tensor regression method to address these two challenges. We
use a $\ell_{q}/ \ell_{2}$ group-sparsity regularization to determine the
tensor rank. The resulting optimization problem can be efficiently solved via
an alternating minimization solver. We also propose a two-stage adaptive
sampling method to reduce the simulation cost. Our method considers both
exploration and exploitation via the estimated Voronoi cell volume and
nonlinearity measurement respectively. The proposed model is verified with
synthetic and some realistic circuit benchmarks, on which our method can well
capture the uncertainty caused by 19 to 100 random variables with only 100 to
600 simulation samples.</span>

diagnosis of medical conditions such as depression, using a collection of a
person&#x27;s utterances. Depression is a serious medical illness that can have
adverse effects on how one feels, thinks, and acts, which can lead to emotional
and physical problems. Due to the sensitive nature of such data, privacy
measures need to be taken for handling and training models with such data. In
this work, we study the effects that the application of Differential Privacy
(DP) has, in both a centralized and a Federated Learning (FL) setup, on
training contextualized language models (BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa and DistilBERT).
We offer insights on how to privately train NLP models and what architectures
and setups provide more desirable privacy utility trade-offs. We envisage this
work to be used in future healthcare and mental health studies to keep medical
history private. Therefore, we provide an open-source implementation of this

                                        <span>Swimming organisms can escape their predators by creating and harnessing
unsteady flow fields through their body motions. Stochastic optimization and
flow simulations have identified escape patterns that are consistent with those
observed in natural larval swimmers. However, these patterns have been limited
by the specification of a particular cost function and depend on a prescribed
functional form of the body motion. Here, we deploy reinforcement learning to
discover swimmer escape patterns for larval fish under energy constraints. The
identified patterns include the C-start mechanism, in addition to more
energetically efficient escapes. We find that maximizing distance with limited
energy requires swimming via short bursts of accelerating motion interlinked
with phases of gliding. The present, data efficient, reinforcement learning
algorithm results in an array of patterns that reveal practical flow
optimization principles for efficient swimming and the methodology can be
transferred to the control of aquatic robotic devices operating under energy
constraints.</span>

$\textit{in-distribution}$ [ID], in which the train and test tasks are sampled
$\textit{iid}$ from the same underlying task distribution, and
$\textit{out-of-distribution}$ [OOD], in which they are not. While most
meta-learning theory and some FSL applications follow the ID setting, we
identify that most existing few-shot classification benchmarks instead reflect
OOD evaluation, as they use disjoint sets of train (base) and test (novel)
classes for task generation. This discrepancy is problematic because -- as we
show on numerous benchmarks -- meta-learning methods that perform better on
existing OOD datasets may perform significantly worse in the ID setting. In
addition, in the OOD setting, even though current FSL benchmarks seem
befitting, our study highlights concerns in 1) reliably performing model
selection for a given meta-learning method, and 2) consistently comparing the
performance of different methods. To address these concerns, we provide
suggestions on how to construct FSL benchmarks to allow for ID evaluation as
well as more reliable OOD evaluation. Our work aims to inform the meta-learning
community about the importance and distinction of ID vs. OOD evaluation, as

                                        <span>Machine learning (ML) methods are ubiquitous in wireless communication
systems and have proven powerful for applications including radio-frequency
(RF) fingerprinting, automatic modulation classification, and cognitive radio.
However, the large size of ML models can make them difficult to implement on
edge devices for latency-sensitive downstream tasks. In wireless communication
systems, ML data processing at a sub-millisecond scale will enable real-time
network monitoring to improve security and prevent infiltration. In addition,
compact and integratable hardware platforms which can implement ML models at
the chip scale will find much broader application to wireless communication
networks. Toward real-time wireless signal classification at the edge, we
propose a novel compact deep network that consists of a
photonic-hardware-inspired recurrent neural network model in combination with a
simplified convolutional classifier, and we demonstrate its application to the
identification of RF emitters by their random transmissions. With the proposed
model, we achieve 96.32% classification accuracy over a set of 30 identical
ZigBee devices when using 50 times fewer training parameters than an existing
state-of-the-art CNN classifier. Thanks to the large reduction in network size,
we demonstrate real-time RF fingerprinting with 0.219 ms latency using a
small-scale FPGA board, the PYNQ-Z1.</span>

optimization of queueing systems. In recent years, techniques from supervised
learning, bandit learning and reinforcement learning have been applied to
queueing systems supported by increasing role of information in decision
making. We present observations and new results that help rationalize the
application of these areas to queueing systems.

We prove that the MaxWeight and BackPressure policies are an application of
Blackwell&#x27;s Approachability Theorem. This connects queueing theoretic results
with adversarial learning. We then discuss the requirements of statistical
learning for service parameter estimation. As an example, we show how queue
size regret can be bounded when applying a perceptron algorithm to classify
service. Next, we discuss the role of state information in improved decision
making. Here we contrast the roles of epistemic information (information on
uncertain parameters) and aleatoric information (information on an uncertain
state). Finally we review recent advances in the theory of reinforcement
learning and queueing, as well as, provide discussion on current research
challenges.</span>

                                        <span>Adversarial training (AT) is currently one of the most successful methods to
obtain the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks. However, the
phenomenon of robust overfitting, i.e., the robustness starts to decrease
significantly during AT, has been problematic, not only making practitioners
consider a bag of tricks for a successful training, e.g., early stopping, but
also incurring a significant generalization gap in the robustness. In this
paper, we propose an effective regularization technique that prevents robust
overfitting by optimizing an auxiliary &#x27;consistency&#x27; regularization loss during
AT. Specifically, it forces the predictive distributions after attacking from
two different augmentations of the same instance to be similar with each other.
Our experimental results demonstrate that such a simple regularization
technique brings significant improvements in the test robust accuracy of a wide
range of AT methods. More remarkably, we also show that our method could
significantly help the model to generalize its robustness against unseen
adversaries, e.g., other types or larger perturbations compared to those used
during training. Code is available at

is robust to causal interventions on unobserved variables, when noisy proxies
of those variables are available. Our approach takes the form of a
regularization term that trades off between in-distribution performance and
robustness to interventions. Under the assumption of a linear structural causal
model, we show that a single proxy can be used to create estimators that are
prediction optimal under interventions of bounded strength. This strength
depends on the magnitude of the measurement noise in the proxy, which is, in
general, not identifiable. In the case of two proxy variables, we propose a
modified estimator that is prediction optimal under interventions up to a known
strength. We further show how to extend these estimators to scenarios where
additional information about the &quot;test time&quot; intervention is available during
training. We evaluate our theoretical findings in synthetic experiments and
using real data of hourly pollution levels across several cities in China.</span>

                                        <span>During online decision making in Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB), one needs to
conduct inference on the true mean reward of each arm based on data collected
so far at each step. However, since the arms are adaptively selected--thereby
yielding non-iid data--conducting inference accurately is not straightforward.
In particular, sample averaging, which is used in the family of UCB and
Thompson sampling (TS) algorithms, does not provide a good choice as it suffers
from bias and a lack of good statistical properties (e.g. asymptotic
normality). Our thesis in this paper is that more sophisticated inference
schemes that take into account the adaptive nature of the sequentially
collected data can unlock further performance gains, even though both UCB and
TS type algorithms are optimal in the worst case. In particular, we propose a
variant of TS-style algorithms--which we call doubly adaptive TS--that
leverages recent advances in causal inference and adaptively reweights the
terms of a doubly robust estimator on the true mean reward of each arm. Through
20 synthetic domain experiments and a semi-synthetic experiment based on data
from an A/B test of a web service, we demonstrate that using an adaptive
inferential scheme (while still retaining the exploration efficacy of TS)
provides clear benefits in online decision making: the proposed DATS algorithm
has superior empirical performance to existing baselines (UCB and TS) in terms
of regret and sample complexity in identifying the best arm. In addition, we
also provide a finite-time regret bound of doubly adaptive TS that matches (up
to log factors) those of UCB and TS algorithms, thereby establishing that its
improved practical benefits do not come at the expense of worst-case
suboptimality.</span>

                                        <span>Self-supervised learning on graph-structured data has drawn recent interest
for learning generalizable, transferable and robust representations from
unlabeled graphs. Among many, graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) has emerged
with promising representation learning performance. Unfortunately, unlike its
counterpart on image data, the effectiveness of GraphCL hinges on ad-hoc data
augmentations, which have to be manually picked per dataset, by either rules of
thumb or trial-and-errors, owing to the diverse nature of graph data. That
significantly limits the more general applicability of GraphCL. Aiming to fill
in this crucial gap, this paper proposes a unified bi-level optimization
framework to automatically, adaptively and dynamically select data
augmentations when performing GraphCL on specific graph data. The general
framework, dubbed JOint Augmentation Optimization (JOAO), is instantiated as
min-max optimization. The selections of augmentations made by JOAO are shown to
be in general aligned with previous &quot;best practices&quot; observed from handcrafted
tuning: yet now being automated, more flexible and versatile. Moreover, we
propose a new augmentation-aware projection head mechanism, which will route
output features through different projection heads corresponding to different
augmentations chosen at each training step. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that JOAO performs on par with or sometimes better than the state-of-the-art
competitors including GraphCL, on multiple graph datasets of various scales and
types, yet without resorting to any laborious dataset-specific tuning on
augmentation selection. We release the code at

their gripper and tactile sensing is often necessary in tasks that involve
contact-rich motion. In this work, we leverage surprise from mismatches in
touch feedback to guide exploration in hard sparse-reward reinforcement
learning tasks. Our approach, Touch-based Curiosity (ToC), learns what visible
objects interactions are supposed to &quot;feel&quot; like. We encourage exploration by
rewarding interactions where the expectation and the experience don&#x27;t match. In
our proposed method, an initial task-independent exploration phase is followed
by an on-task learning phase, in which the original interactions are relabeled
with on-task rewards. We test our approach on a range of touch-intensive robot
arm tasks (e.g. pushing objects, opening doors), which we also release as part
of this work. Across multiple experiments in a simulated setting, we
demonstrate that our method is able to learn these difficult tasks through
sparse reward and curiosity alone. We compare our cross-modal approach to
single-modality (touch- or vision-only) approaches as well as other

                                        <span>In representation learning on the graph-structured data, under heterophily
(or low homophily), many popular GNNs may fail to capture long-range
dependencies, which leads to their performance degradation. To solve the
above-mentioned issue, we propose a graph convolutional networks with structure
learning (GCN-SL), and furthermore, the proposed approach can be applied to
node classification. The proposed GCN-SL contains two improvements:
corresponding to node features and edges, respectively. In the aspect of node
features, we propose an efficient-spectral-clustering (ESC) and an ESC with
anchors (ESC-ANCH) algorithms to efficiently aggregate feature representations
from all similar nodes. In the aspect of edges, we build a re-connected
adjacency matrix by using a special data preprocessing technique and similarity
learning, and the re-connected adjacency matrix can be optimized directly along
with GCN-SL parameters. Considering that the original adjacency matrix may
provide misleading information for aggregation in GCN, especially the graphs
being with a low level of homophily. The proposed GCN-SL can aggregate feature
representations from nearby nodes via re-connected adjacency matrix and is
applied to graphs with various levels of homophily. Experimental results on a
wide range of benchmark datasets illustrate that the proposed GCN-SL
outperforms the stateof-the-art GNN counterparts.</span>

                                        <span>The widespread significance of Android IoT devices is due to its flexibility
and hardware support features which revolutionized the digital world by
introducing exciting applications almost in all walks of daily life, such as
healthcare, smart cities, smart environments, safety, remote sensing, and many
more. Such versatile applicability gives incentive for more malware attacks. In
this paper, we propose a framework which continuously aggregates multiple user
trained models on non-overlapping data into single model. Specifically for
malware detection task, (i) we propose a novel user (local) neural network
(LNN) which trains on local distribution and (ii) then to assure the model
authenticity and quality, we propose a novel smart contract which enable
aggregation process over blokchain platform. The LNN model analyzes various
static and dynamic features of both malware and benign whereas the smart
contract verifies the malicious applications both for uploading and downloading
processes in the network using stored aggregated features of local models. In
this way, the proposed model not only improves malware detection accuracy using
decentralized model network but also model efficacy with blockchain. We
evaluate our approach with three state-of-the-art models and performed deep
analyses of extracted features of the relative model.</span>

single neural network for developing a neural vocoder capable of generating
high-quality synthetic speech waveforms while retaining flexibility of the
source-filter model to control their voice characteristics. Our proposed
network called unified source-filter generative adversarial networks (uSFGAN)
is developed by factorizing quasi-periodic parallel WaveGAN (QPPWG), one of the
neural vocoders based on a single neural network, into a source excitation
generation network and a vocal tract resonance filtering network by
additionally implementing a regularization loss. Moreover, inspired by neural
source filter (NSF), only a sinusoidal waveform is additionally used as the
simplest clue to generate a periodic source excitation waveform while
minimizing the effect of approximations in the source filter model. The
experimental results demonstrate that uSFGAN outperforms conventional neural
vocoders, such as QPPWG and NSF in both speech quality and pitch

                                        <span>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been widely used for dimensionality
reduction and feature extraction. Robust PCA (RPCA), under different robust
distance metrics, such as l1-norm and l2, p-norm, can deal with noise or
outliers to some extent. However, real-world data may display structures that
can not be fully captured by these simple functions. In addition, existing
methods treat complex and simple samples equally. By contrast, a learning
pattern typically adopted by human beings is to learn from simple to complex
and less to more. Based on this principle, we propose a novel method called
Self-paced PCA (SPCA) to further reduce the effect of noise and outliers.
Notably, the complexity of each sample is calculated at the beginning of each
iteration in order to integrate samples from simple to more complex into
training. Based on an alternating optimization, SPCA finds an optimal
projection matrix and filters out outliers iteratively. Theoretical analysis is
presented to show the rationality of SPCA. Extensive experiments on popular
data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the state of-the-art
results considerably.</span>

                                        <span>Learning decent representations from unlabeled time-series data with temporal
dynamics is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised
Time-Series representation learning framework via Temporal and Contextual
Contrasting (TS-TCC), to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data.
First, the raw time-series data are transformed into two different yet
correlated views by using weak and strong augmentations. Second, we propose a
novel temporal contrasting module to learn robust temporal representations by
designing a tough cross-view prediction task. Last, to further learn
discriminative representations, we propose a contextual contrasting module
built upon the contexts from the temporal contrasting module. It attempts to
maximize the similarity among different contexts of the same sample while
minimizing similarity among contexts of different samples. Experiments have
been carried out on three real-world time-series datasets. The results manifest
that training a linear classifier on top of the features learned by our
proposed TS-TCC performs comparably with the supervised training. Additionally,
our proposed TS-TCC shows high efficiency in few-labeled data and transfer
learning scenarios. The code is publicly available at

processing large amounts of data for business and other applications, it would
be helpful to consider how these areas of research can complement each other.
To understand how they can be paired, we provide an overview of machine
learning foundations and development cycle. We then examine how conceptual
modeling can be applied to machine learning and propose a framework for
incorporating conceptual modeling into data science projects. The framework is
illustrated by applying it to a healthcare application. For the inverse
pairing, machine learning can impact conceptual modeling through text and rule
mining, as well as knowledge graphs. The pairing of conceptual modeling and

can enable the use of radiology report information for a variety of critical
healthcare applications. In our work, we present RadGraph, a dataset of
entities and relations in full-text chest X-ray radiology reports based on a
novel information extraction schema we designed to structure radiology reports.
We release a development dataset, which contains board-certified radiologist
annotations for 500 radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR dataset (14,579
entities and 10,889 relations), and a test dataset, which contains two
independent sets of board-certified radiologist annotations for 100 radiology
reports split equally across the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert datasets. Using these
datasets, we train and test a deep learning model, RadGraph Benchmark, that
achieves a micro F1 of 0.82 and 0.73 on relation extraction on the MIMIC-CXR
and CheXpert test sets respectively. Additionally, we release an inference
dataset, which contains annotations automatically generated by RadGraph
Benchmark across 220,763 MIMIC-CXR reports (around 6 million entities and 4
million relations) and 500 CheXpert reports (13,783 entities and 9,908
relations) with mappings to associated chest radiographs. Our freely available
dataset can facilitate a wide range of research in medical natural language
processing, as well as computer vision and multi-modal learning when linked to
chest radiographs.</span>

                                        <span>We present a novel multi-view training framework and CNN architecture for
combining information from multiple overlapping satellite images and noisy
training labels derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to semantically label
buildings and roads across large geographic regions (100 km$^2$). Our approach
to multi-view semantic segmentation yields a 4-7% improvement in the per-class
IoU scores compared to the traditional approaches that use the views
independently of one another. A unique (and, perhaps, surprising) property of
our system is that modifications that are added to the tail-end of the CNN for
learning from the multi-view data can be discarded at the time of inference
with a relatively small penalty in the overall performance. This implies that
the benefits of training using multiple views are absorbed by all the layers of
the network. Additionally, our approach only adds a small overhead in terms of
the GPU-memory consumption even when training with as many as 32 views per
scene. The system we present is end-to-end automated, which facilitates
comparing the classifiers trained directly on true orthophotos vis-a-vis first
training them on the off-nadir images and subsequently translating the
predicted labels to geographical coordinates. With no human supervision, our
IoU scores for the buildings and roads classes are 0.8 and 0.64 respectively
which are better than state-of-the-art approaches that use OSM labels and that
are not completely automated.</span>

can be greatly improved by utilizing a useful set of skills. However, the
design of robot skills can often be intractable in real-world applications due
to the prohibitive amount of effort and expertise that it requires. In this
work, we introduce Skill Learning In Diversified Environments (SLIDE), a method
to discover generalizable skills via automated generation of a diverse set of
tasks. As opposed to prior work on unsupervised discovery of skills which
incentivizes the skills to produce different outcomes in the same environment,
our method pairs each skill with a unique task produced by a trainable task
generator. To encourage generalizable skills to emerge, our method trains each
skill to specialize in the paired task and maximizes the diversity of the
generated tasks. A task discriminator defined on the robot behaviors in the
generated tasks is jointly trained to estimate the evidence lower bound of the
diversity objective. The learned skills can then be composed in a hierarchical
reinforcement learning algorithm to solve unseen target tasks. We demonstrate
that the proposed method can effectively learn a variety of robot skills in two
tabletop manipulation domains. Our results suggest that the learned skills can
effectively improve the robot&#x27;s performance in various unseen target tasks
compared to existing reinforcement learning and skill learning methods.</span>

generalization of both the classical Mallows model of ranking distributions and
the extensively studied model of noisy pairwise comparisons. Our selective
Mallows model outputs a noisy ranking on any given subset of alternatives,
based on an underlying Mallows distribution. Assuming a sequence of subsets
where each pair of alternatives appears frequently enough, we obtain strong
asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of
learning the underlying complete ranking and the (identities and the) ranking
of the top-k alternatives from selective Mallows rankings. Moreover, building

inherent geometric 3D structure of our theory, we derive a 3D steerability
constraint for its atomic parts, the hypersphere neurons. Exploiting the
rotational equivariance, we show how the model parameters are fully steerable
at inference time. The proposed spherical filter banks enable to make
equivariant and, after online optimization, invariant class predictions for
known synthetic point sets in unknown orientations.</span>

                                        <span>Random forest (RF) is one of the most popular methods for estimating
regression functions. The local nature of the RF algorithm, based on intra-node
means and variances, is ideal when errors are i.i.d. For dependent error
processes like time series and spatial settings where data in all the nodes
will be correlated, operating locally ignores this dependence. Also, RF will
involve resampling of correlated data, violating the principles of bootstrap.
Theoretically, consistency of RF has been established for i.i.d. errors, but
little is known about the case of dependent errors.

We propose RF-GLS, a novel extension of RF for dependent error processes in
the same way Generalized Least Squares (GLS) fundamentally extends Ordinary
Least Squares (OLS) for linear models under dependence. The key to this
extension is the equivalent representation of the local decision-making in a
regression tree as a global OLS optimization which is then replaced with a GLS
loss to create a GLS-style regression tree. This also synergistically addresses
the resampling issue, as the use of GLS loss amounts to resampling uncorrelated
contrasts (pre-whitened data) instead of the correlated data. For spatial
settings, RF-GLS can be used in conjunction with Gaussian Process correlated
errors to generate kriging predictions at new locations. RF becomes a special
case of RF-GLS with an identity working covariance matrix.

We establish consistency of RF-GLS under beta- (absolutely regular) mixing
error processes and show that this general result subsumes important cases like
autoregressive time series and spatial Matern Gaussian Processes. As a
byproduct, we also establish consistency of RF for beta-mixing processes, which
to our knowledge, is the first such result for RF under dependence.

We empirically demonstrate the improvement achieved by RF-GLS over RF for
both estimation and prediction under dependence.</span>

                                        <span>Estimating mutual information is an important statistics and machine learning
problem. To estimate the mutual information from data, a common practice is
preparing a set of paired samples $\{(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{y}_i)\}_{i&#x3D;1}^n
\stackrel{\mathrm{i.i.d.}}{\sim} p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$. However, in many
situations, it is difficult to obtain a large number of data pairs. To address
this problem, we propose the semi-supervised Squared-loss Mutual Information
(SMI) estimation method using a small number of paired samples and the
available unpaired ones. We first represent SMI through the density ratio
function, where the expectation is approximated by the samples from marginals
and its assignment parameters. The objective is formulated using the optimal
transport problem and quadratic programming. Then, we introduce the
Least-Squares Mutual Information with Sinkhorn (LSMI-Sinkhorn) algorithm for
efficient optimization. Through experiments, we first demonstrate that the
proposed method can estimate the SMI without a large number of paired samples.
Then, we show the effectiveness of the proposed LSMI-Sinkhorn algorithm on
various types of machine learning problems such as image matching and photo
album summarization. Code can be found at

matches the lower bound asymptotically. We demonstrate that contextual

                                        <span>Sparse coding is a class of unsupervised methods for learning a sparse
representation of the input data in the form of a linear combination of a
dictionary and a sparse code. This learning framework has led to
state-of-the-art results in various image and video processing tasks. However,
classical methods learn the dictionary and the sparse code based on alternative
optimizations, usually without theoretical guarantees for either optimality or
convergence due to non-convexity of the problem. Recent works on sparse coding
with a complete dictionary provide strong theoretical guarantees thanks to the
development of the non-convex optimization. However, initial non-convex
approaches learn the dictionary in the sparse coding problem sequentially in an
atom-by-atom manner, which leads to a long execution time. More recent works
seek to directly learn the entire dictionary at once, which substantially
reduces the execution time. However, the associated recovery performance is
degraded with a finite number of data samples. In this paper, we propose an
efficient sparse coding scheme with a two-stage optimization. The proposed
scheme leverages the global and local Riemannian geometry of the two-stage
optimization problem and facilitates fast implementation for superb dictionary
recovery performance by a finite number of samples without atom-by-atom
calculation. We further prove that, with high probability, the proposed scheme
can exactly recover any atom in the target dictionary with a finite number of
samples if it is adopted to recover one atom of the dictionary. An application
on wireless sensor data compression is also proposed. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world data verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposed scheme.</span>

                                        <span>Continuous-depth neural models, where the derivative of the model&#x27;s hidden
state is defined by a neural network, have enabled strong sequential data
processing capabilities. However, these models rely on advanced numerical
differential equation (DE) solvers resulting in a significant overhead both in
terms of computational cost and model complexity. In this paper, we present a
new family of models, termed Closed-form Continuous-depth (CfC) networks, that
are simple to describe and at least one order of magnitude faster while
exhibiting equally strong modeling abilities compared to their ODE-based
counterparts. The models are hereby derived from the analytical closed-form
solution of an expressive subset of time-continuous models, thus alleviating
the need for complex DE solvers all together. In our experimental evaluations,
we demonstrate that CfC networks outperform advanced, recurrent models over a
diverse set of time-series prediction tasks, including those with long-term
dependencies and irregularly sampled data. We believe our findings open new
opportunities to train and deploy rich, continuous neural models in
resource-constrained settings, which demand both performance and efficiency.</span>

detection algorithms to monitor their behavior over time. As a machine learning
algorithm learns from a continuous, possibly evolving, stream of data, it is
desirable and often critical to supplement it with a companion change detection
algorithm to facilitate its monitoring and control. We present a generic
score-based change detection method that can detect a change in any number of
components of a machine learning model trained via empirical risk minimization.
This proposed statistical hypothesis test can be readily implemented for such
models designed within a differentiable programming framework. We establish the

related videos generated online are increasing at an unprecedentedly fast pace.
To automate sports video editing/highlight generation process, a key task is to
precisely recognize and locate the events in the long untrimmed videos. In this
tech report, we present a two-stage paradigm to detect what and when events
happen in soccer broadcast videos. Specifically, we fine-tune multiple action
recognition models on soccer data to extract high-level semantic features, and
design a transformer based temporal detection module to locate the target
events. This approach achieved the state-of-the-art performance in both two
tasks, i.e., action spotting and replay grounding, in the SoccerNet-v2
Challenge, under CVPR 2021 ActivityNet workshop. Our soccer embedding features
are released at https://github.com/baidu-research/vidpress-sports. By sharing
these features with the broader community, we hope to accelerate the research
into soccer video understanding.</span>

                                        <span>In order to objectively assess new medical imaging technologies via
computer-simulations, it is important to account for all sources of variability
that contribute to image data. One important source of variability that can
significantly limit observer performance is associated with the variability in
the ensemble of objects to-be-imaged. This source of variability can be
described by stochastic object models (SOMs), which are generative models that
can be employed to sample from a distribution of to-be-virtually-imaged
objects. It is generally desirable to establish SOMs from experimental imaging
measurements acquired by use of a well-characterized imaging system, but this
task has remained challenging. Deep generative neural networks, such as
generative adversarial networks (GANs) hold potential for such tasks. To
establish SOMs from imaging measurements, an AmbientGAN has been proposed that
augments a GAN with a measurement operator. However, the original AmbientGAN
could not immediately benefit from modern training procedures and GAN
architectures, which limited its ability to be applied to realistically sized
medical image data. To circumvent this, in this work, a modified AmbientGAN
training strategy is proposed that is suitable for modern progressive or
multi-resolution training approaches such as employed in the Progressive
Growing of GANs and Style-based GANs. AmbientGANs established by use of the
proposed training procedure are systematically validated in a controlled way by
use of computer-simulated measurement data corresponding to a stylized imaging
system. Finally, emulated single-coil experimental magnetic resonance imaging
data are employed to demonstrate the methods under less stylized conditions.</span>

capturing the manifold structure of target objects, and accordingly boosts the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. However, most existing methods encode
the location information in an implicit way, e.g. the distance transform maps,
which describe the relative distance from each pixel to the contour boundary,
for the network to learn. These implicit approaches do not fully exploit the
position information (i.e. absolute location) of targets. In this paper, we
propose a novel loss function, namely residual moment (RM) loss, to explicitly
embed the location information of segmentation targets during the training of
deep learning networks. Particularly, motivated by image moments, the
segmentation prediction map and ground-truth map are weighted by coordinate
information. Then our RM loss encourages the networks to maintain the
consistency between the two weighted maps, which promotes the segmentation
networks to easily locate the targets and extract manifold-structure-related
features. We validate the proposed RM loss by conducting extensive experiments
on two publicly available datasets, i.e., 2D optic cup and disk segmentation
and 3D left atrial segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our RM loss, which significantly boosts the accuracy of
segmentation networks.</span>

                                        <span>Like many other domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), there are specific
tasks in the field of AI in Education (AIEd) for which labels are scarce and
expensive, such as predicting exam score or review correctness. A common way of
circumventing label-scarce problems is pre-training a model to learn
representations of the contents of learning items. However, such methods fail
to utilize the full range of student interaction data available and do not
model student learning behavior. To this end, we propose Assessment Modeling, a
class of fundamental pre-training tasks for general interactive educational
systems. An assessment is a feature of student-system interactions which can
serve as a pedagogical evaluation. Examples include the correctness and
timeliness of a student&#x27;s answer. Assessment Modeling is the prediction of
assessments conditioned on the surrounding context of interactions. Although it
is natural to pre-train on interactive features available in large amounts,
limiting the prediction targets to assessments focuses the tasks&#x27; relevance to
the label-scarce educational problems and reduces less-relevant noise. While
the effectiveness of different combinations of assessments is open for

tensor CUR decompositions for low multilinear rank tensors. We also present
theoretical error bounds of the tensor CUR approximations when (adversarial or

sufficient for tensor CUR approximations if the tensor has an incoherent

The study of CL for sequential patterns revolves around trained recurrent

Networks (ESNs), where the recurrent component is kept fixed. We provide the
first evaluation of catastrophic forgetting in ESNs and we highlight the

                                        <span>The important recent book by G. Schurz appreciates that the no-free-lunch
theorems (NFL) have major implications for the problem of (meta) induction.
Here I review the NFL theorems, emphasizing that they do not only concern the
case where there is a uniform prior -- they prove that there are &quot;as many
priors&quot; (loosely speaking) for which any induction algorithm $A$
out-generalizes some induction algorithm $B$ as vice-versa. Importantly though,
in addition to the NFL theorems, there are many \textit{free lunch} theorems.
In particular, the NFL theorems can only be used to compare the
\textit{marginal} expected performance of an induction algorithm $A$ with the
marginal expected performance of an induction algorithm $B$. There is a rich
set of free lunches which instead concern the statistical correlations among
the generalization errors of induction algorithms. As I describe, the
meta-induction algorithms that Schurz advocate as a &quot;solution to Hume&#x27;s
problem&quot; are just an example of such a free lunch based on correlations among
the generalization errors of induction algorithms. I end by pointing out that
the prior that Schurz advocates, which is uniform over bit frequencies rather
than bit patterns, is contradicted by thousands of experiments in statistical
physics and by the great success of the maximum entropy procedure in inductive
inference.</span>

                                        <span>In many important graph data processing applications the acquired information
includes both node features and observations of the graph topology. Graph
neural networks (GNNs) are designed to exploit both sources of evidence but
they do not optimally trade-off their utility and integrate them in a manner
that is also universal. Here, universality refers to independence on homophily
or heterophily graph assumptions. We address these issues by introducing a new
Generalized PageRank (GPR) GNN architecture that adaptively learns the GPR
weights so as to jointly optimize node feature and topological information
extraction, regardless of the extent to which the node labels are homophilic or
heterophilic. Learned GPR weights automatically adjust to the node label
pattern, irrelevant on the type of initialization, and thereby guarantee
excellent learning performance for label patterns that are usually hard to
handle. Furthermore, they allow one to avoid feature over-smoothing, a process
which renders feature information nondiscriminative, without requiring the
network to be shallow. Our accompanying theoretical analysis of the GPR-GNN
method is facilitated by novel synthetic benchmark datasets generated by the
so-called contextual stochastic block model. We also compare the performance of
our GNN architecture with that of several state-of-the-art GNNs on the problem
of node-classification, using well-known benchmark homophilic and heterophilic
datasets. The results demonstrate that GPR-GNN offers significant performance
improvement compared to existing techniques on both synthetic and benchmark
data.</span>

(conditionally quasi-randomly assigned instruments) since the algorithms make
decisions based only on observable input variables. We use this observation to
develop a treatment-effect estimator for a class of stochastic and
deterministic decision-making algorithms. Our estimator is shown to be
consistent and asymptotically normal for well-defined causal effects. A key
special case of our estimator is a multidimensional regression discontinuity
design. We apply our estimator to evaluate the effect of the Coronavirus Aid,

(KGs) have been applied to find answers to conjunctive queries (CQs) over
incomplete KGs. However, the current methods only focus on inductive reasoning,
i.e. answering CQs by predicting facts based on patterns learned from the data,
and lack the ability of deductive reasoning by applying external domain
knowledge. Such (expert or commonsense) domain knowledge is an invaluable
resource which can be used to advance machine intelligence. To address this
shortcoming, we introduce a neural-symbolic method for ontology-mediated CQ
answering over incomplete KGs that operates in the embedding space. More
specifically, we propose various data augmentation strategies to generate
training queries using query-rewriting based methods and then exploit a novel
loss function for training the model. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our training strategies and the new loss function, i.e., our
method significantly outperforms the baseline in the settings that require both

that has stemmed more so in recent times with an increase in demand for virtual
content delivery due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All educational institutions,
workplaces, research centers, etc. are trying to bridge the gap of
communication during these socially distanced times with the use of online
content delivery. The trend now is to create presentations, and then
subsequently deliver the same using various virtual meeting platforms. The time
being spent in such creation of presentations and delivering is what we try to
reduce and eliminate through this paper which aims to use Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules to automate the
process of creating a slides-based presentation from a document, and then use
state-of-the-art voice cloning models to deliver the content in the desired
author&#x27;s voice. We consider a structured document such as a research paper to
be the content that has to be presented. The research paper is first summarized
using BERT summarization techniques and condensed into bullet points that go
into the slides. Tacotron inspired architecture with Encoder, Synthesizer, and
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based vocoder, is used to convey the
contents of the slides in the author&#x27;s voice (or any customized voice). Almost
all learning has now been shifted to online mode, and professionals are now
working from the comfort of their homes. Due to the current situation, teachers
and professionals have shifted to presentations to help them in imparting
information. In this paper, we aim to reduce the considerable amount of time
that is taken in creating a presentation by automating this process and
subsequently delivering this presentation in a customized voice, using a
content delivery mechanism that can clone any voice using a short audio clip.</span>

the LS strategy smooths the one-hot encoded training signal by distributing its
distribution mass over the non-ground truth classes. We extend this technique
by considering example pairs, coined PLS. PLS first creates midpoint samples by
averaging random sample pairs and then learns a smoothing distribution during
training for each of these midpoint samples, resulting in midpoints with high
uncertainty labels for training. We empirically show that PLS significantly
outperforms LS, achieving up to 30% of relative classification error reduction.
We also visualize that PLS produces very low winning softmax scores for both in
and out of distribution samples.</span>

autonomous driving development platform developed for self-driving vehicles. We
show that CondenseNeXt is remarkably efficient in terms of FLOPs, designed for
ARM-based embedded computing platforms with limited computational resources and

three benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10 (4.79% top-1 error), CIFAR-100

                                        <span>We consider the problem of interpretable network representation learning for
samples of network-valued data. We propose the Principal Component Analysis for
Networks (PCAN) algorithm to identify statistically meaningful low-dimensional
representations of a network sample via subgraph count statistics. The PCAN
procedure provides an interpretable framework for which one can readily
visualize, explore, and formulate predictive models for network samples. We
furthermore introduce a fast sampling-based algorithm, sPCAN, which is
significantly more computationally efficient than its counterpart, but still
enjoys advantages of interpretability. We investigate the relationship between
these two methods and analyze their large-sample properties under the common
regime where the sample of networks is a collection of kernel-based random
graphs. We show that under this regime, the embeddings of the sPCAN method
enjoy a central limit theorem and moreover that the population level embeddings
of PCAN and sPCAN are equivalent. We assess PCAN&#x27;s ability to visualize,
cluster, and classify observations in network samples arising in nature,
including functional connectivity network samples and dynamic networks
describing the political co-voting habits of the U.S. Senate. Our analyses
reveal that our proposed algorithm provides informative and discriminatory
features describing the networks in each sample. The PCAN and sPCAN methods
build on the current literature of network representation learning and set the
stage for a new line of research in interpretable learning on network-valued
data. Publicly available software for the PCAN and sPCAN methods are available

                                        <span>Multimodal sentiment analysis benefits various applications such as
human-computer interaction and recommendation systems. It aims to infer the
users&#x27; bipolar ideas using visual, textual, and acoustic signals. Although
researchers affirm the association between cognitive cues and emotional
manifestations, most of the current multimodal approaches in sentiment analysis
disregard user-specific aspects. To tackle this issue, we devise a novel method
to perform multimodal sentiment prediction using cognitive cues, such as
personality. Our framework constructs an adaptive tree by hierarchically
dividing users and trains the LSTM-based submodels, utilizing an
attention-based fusion to transfer cognitive-oriented knowledge within the
tree. Subsequently, the framework consumes the conclusive agglomerative
knowledge from the adaptive tree to predict final sentiments. We also devise a
dynamic dropout method to facilitate data sharing between neighboring nodes,
reducing data sparsity. The empirical results on real-world datasets determine
that our proposed model for sentiment prediction can surpass trending rivals.
Moreover, compared to other ensemble approaches, the proposed transfer-based
algorithm can better utilize the latent cognitive cues and foster the
prediction outcomes. Based on the given extrinsic and intrinsic analysis
results, we note that compared to other theoretical-based techniques, the
proposed hierarchical clustering approach can better group the users within the
adaptive tree.</span>

                                        <span>Modern magnetic sensor arrays conventionally utilize state of the art low
power magnetometers such as parallel and orthogonal fluxgates. Low power
fluxgates tend to have large Barkhausen jumps that appear as a dc jump in the
fluxgate output. This phenomenon deteriorates the signal fidelity and
effectively increases the internal sensor noise. Even if sensors that are more
prone to dc jumps can be screened during production, the conventional noise
measurement does not always catch the dc jump because of its sparsity.
Moreover, dc jumps persist in almost all the sensor cores although at a slower
but still intolerable rate. Even if dc jumps can be easily detected in a
shielded environment, when deployed in presence of natural noise and clutter,
it can be hard to positively detect them. This work fills this gap and presents
algorithms that distinguish dc jumps embedded in natural magnetic field data.
To improve robustness to noise, we developed two machine learning algorithms
that employ temporal and statistical physical-based features of a pre-acquired
and well-known experimental data set. The first algorithm employs a support
vector machine classifier, while the second is based on a neural network
architecture. We compare these new approaches to a more classical kernel-based
method. To that purpose, the receiver operating characteristic curve is
generated, which allows diagnosis ability of the different classifiers by
comparing their performances across various operation points. The accuracy of
the machine learning-based algorithms over the classic method is highly
emphasized. In addition, high generalization and robustness of the neural
network can be concluded, based on the rapid convergence of the corresponding
receiver operating characteristic curves.</span>

for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Concretely, this network contains
two parts that separately named spatial graph reasoning subnetwork (SAGRN) and
spectral graph reasoning subnetwork (SEGRN) to capture the spatial and spectral
graph contexts, respectively. Different from the previous approaches
implementing superpixel segmentation on the original image or attempting to

superpixel segmentation on intermediate features of the network to adaptively
produce the homogeneous regions to get the effective descriptors. Then, we
adopt a similar idea in spectral part that reasonably aggregating the channels
to generate spectral descriptors for spectral graph contexts capturing. All
graph reasoning procedures in SAGRN and SEGRN are achieved through graph
convolution. To guarantee the global perception ability of the proposed
methods, all adjacent matrices in graph reasoning are obtained with the help of
non-local self-attention mechanism. At last, by combining the extracted spatial

                                        <span>Content-independent watermarks and block-wise independency can be considered
as vulnerabilities in semi-fragile watermarking methods. In this paper to
achieve the objectives of semi-fragile watermarking techniques, a method is
proposed to not have the mentioned shortcomings. In the proposed method, the
watermark is generated by relying on image content and a key. Furthermore, the
embedding scheme causes the watermarked blocks to become dependent on each
other, using a key. In the embedding phase, the image is partitioned into
non-overlapping blocks. In order to detect and separate the different types of
attacks more precisely, the proposed method embeds three copies of each
watermark bit into LWT coefficients of each 4x4 block. In the authentication
phase, by voting between the extracted bits the error maps are created; these
maps indicate image authenticity and reveal the modified regions. Also, in
order to automate the authentication, the images are classified into four
categories using seven features. Classification accuracy in the experiments is
97.97 percent. It is noted that our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method is robust against JPEG compression and is competitive with a
state-of-the-art semi-fragile watermarking method, in terms of robustness and
semi-fragility.</span>

                                        <span>Multimodal sentiment analysis benefits various applications such as
human-computer interaction and recommendation systems. It aims to infer the
users&#x27; bipolar ideas using visual, textual, and acoustic signals. Although
researchers affirm the association between cognitive cues and emotional
manifestations, most of the current multimodal approaches in sentiment analysis
disregard user-specific aspects. To tackle this issue, we devise a novel method
to perform multimodal sentiment prediction using cognitive cues, such as
personality. Our framework constructs an adaptive tree by hierarchically
dividing users and trains the LSTM-based submodels, utilizing an
attention-based fusion to transfer cognitive-oriented knowledge within the
tree. Subsequently, the framework consumes the conclusive agglomerative
knowledge from the adaptive tree to predict final sentiments. We also devise a
dynamic dropout method to facilitate data sharing between neighboring nodes,
reducing data sparsity. The empirical results on real-world datasets determine
that our proposed model for sentiment prediction can surpass trending rivals.
Moreover, compared to other ensemble approaches, the proposed transfer-based
algorithm can better utilize the latent cognitive cues and foster the
prediction outcomes. Based on the given extrinsic and intrinsic analysis
results, we note that compared to other theoretical-based techniques, the
proposed hierarchical clustering approach can better group the users within the
adaptive tree.</span>

Localization (TAL) have only considered RGB and Flow modalities, leaving the
information-rich audio modality totally unexploited. Audio fusion has been
explored for the related but arguably easier problem of trimmed (clip-level)
action recognition. However, TAL poses a unique set of challenges. In this
paper, we propose simple but effective fusion-based approaches for TAL. To the
best of our knowledge, our work is the first to jointly consider audio and
video modalities for supervised TAL. We experimentally show that our schemes
consistently improve performance for state of the art video-only TAL
approaches. Specifically, they help achieve new state of the art performance on
large-scale benchmark datasets - ActivityNet-1.3 (52.73 mAP@0.5) and THUMOS14
(57.18 mAP@0.5). Our experiments include ablations involving multiple fusion
schemes, modality combinations and TAL architectures. Our code, models and

                                        <span>In this paper, we address the text-to-audio grounding issue, namely,
grounding the segments of the sound event described by a natural language query
in the untrimmed audio. This is a newly proposed but challenging audio-language
task, since it requires to not only precisely localize all the on- and off-sets
of the desired segments in the audio, but to perform comprehensive acoustic and
linguistic understandings and reason the multimodal interactions between the
audio and query. To tackle those problems, the existing method treats the query
holistically as a single unit by a global query representation, which fails to
highlight the keywords that contain rich semantics. Besides, this method has
not fully exploited interactions between the query and audio. Moreover, since
the audio and queries are arbitrary and variable in length, many meaningless
parts of them are not filtered out in this method, which hinders the grounding
of the desired segments.

To this end, we propose a novel Query Graph with Cross-gating Attention
(QGCA) model, which models the comprehensive relations between the words in
query through a novel query graph. Besides, to capture the fine-grained
interactions between audio and query, a cross-modal attention module that
assigns higher weights to the keywords is introduced to generate the
snippet-specific query representations. Finally, we also design a cross-gating
module to emphasize the crucial parts as well as weaken the irrelevant ones in
the audio and query. We extensively evaluate the proposed QGCA model on the
public Audiogrounding dataset with significant improvements over several
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, further ablation study shows the consistent
effectiveness of different modules in the proposed QGCA model.</span>

                                        <span>Nowadays, most existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) models 1) are
developed for synthetically-distorted images and often generalize poorly to
authentic ones; 2) heavily rely on human ratings, which are prohibitively
labor-expensive to collect. Here, we propose an $opinion$-$free$ BIQA method
that learns from synthetically-distorted images and multiple agents to assess
the perceptual quality of authentically-distorted ones captured in the wild
without relying on human labels. Specifically, we first assemble a large number
of image pairs from synthetically-distorted images and use a set of
full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) models to assign pseudo-binary
labels of each pair indicating which image has higher quality as the
supervisory signal. We then train a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
BIQA model to rank the perceptual quality, optimized for consistency with the
binary labels. Since there exists domain shift between the synthetically- and
authentically-distorted images, an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) module
is introduced to alleviate this issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed $opinion$-$free$ BIQA model, yielding
state-of-the-art performance in terms of correlation with human opinion scores,
as well as gMAD competition. Codes will be made publicly available upon
acceptance.</span>

viewer perceptions about behaviors detrimental to health. They have potential
to inform public health at scale, however, immersive story design is still in
early stages and largely devoid of best practices. This paper presents a focus
group study with 147 viewers of an immersive story about binge drinking
experienced through VR headsets and mobile phones. The objective of the study
is to identify aspects of immersive story design that influence attitudes
towards the health issue exhibited, and to understand how health information is
consumed in immersive stories. Findings emphasize the need for an immersive
story to provide reasoning behind character engagement in the focal health
behavior, to show the main character clearly engaging in the behavior, and to
enable viewers to experience escalating symptoms of the behavior before the
penultimate health consequence. Findings also show how the design of supporting
characters can inadvertently distract viewers and lead them to justify the
detrimental behavior being exhibited. The paper concludes with design
considerations for enabling immersive stories to better inform public
perception of health issues.</span>

continuous technological arms race between generating higher quality content,
transmitting larger file sizes and supporting network infrastructure. Adding to
this is the recent COVID-19 pandemic fueled surge in the use of video
conferencing tools. Since videos take up substantial bandwidth (~100 Kbps to
few Mbps), improved video compression can have a substantial impact on network
performance for live and pre-recorded content, providing broader access to
multimedia content worldwide. In this work, we present a novel video
compression pipeline, called Txt2Vid, which substantially reduces data
transmission rates by compressing webcam videos (&quot;talking-head videos&quot;) to a
text transcript. The text is transmitted and decoded into a realistic
reconstruction of the original video using recent advances in deep learning
based voice cloning and lip syncing models. Our generative pipeline achieves
two to three orders of magnitude reduction in the bitrate as compared to the
standard audio-video codecs (encoders-decoders), while maintaining equivalent
Quality-of-Experience based on a subjective evaluation by users (n&#x3D;242) in an
online study. The code for this work is available at

                                        <span>Cued Speech (CS) is a communication system for deaf people or hearing
impaired people, in which a speaker uses it to aid a lipreader in phonetic
level by clarifying potentially ambiguous mouth movements with hand shape and
positions. Feature extraction of multi-modal CS is a key step in CS
recognition. Recent supervised deep learning based methods suffer from noisy CS
data annotations especially for hand shape modality. In this work, we first
propose a self-supervised contrastive learning method to learn the feature
representation of image without using labels. Secondly, a small amount of
manually annotated CS data are used to fine-tune the first module. Thirdly, we
present a module, which combines Bi-LSTM and self-attention networks to further
learn sequential features with temporal and contextual information. Besides, to
enlarge the volume and the diversity of the current limited CS datasets, we
build a new British English dataset containing 5 native CS speakers. Evaluation
results on both French and British English datasets show that our model
achieves over 90% accuracy in hand shape recognition. Significant improvements
of 8.75% (for French) and 10.09% (for British English) are achieved in CS
phoneme recognition correctness compared with the state-of-the-art.</span>

                                        <span>Automatic chat summarization can help people quickly grasp important
information from numerous chat messages. Unlike conventional documents, chat
logs usually have fragmented and evolving topics. In addition, these logs
contain a quantity of elliptical and interrogative sentences, which make the
chat summarization highly context dependent. In this work, we propose a novel
unsupervised framework called RankAE to perform chat summarization without
employing manually labeled data. RankAE consists of a topic-oriented ranking
strategy that selects topic utterances according to centrality and diversity
simultaneously, as well as a denoising auto-encoder that is carefully designed
to generate succinct but context-informative summaries based on the selected
utterances. To evaluate the proposed method, we collect a large-scale dataset
of chat logs from a customer service environment and build an annotated set
only for model evaluation. Experimental results show that RankAE significantly
outperforms other unsupervised methods and is able to generate high-quality
summaries in terms of relevance and topic coverage.</span>

                                        <span>Previous works on neural text-to-speech (TTS) have been addressed on limited
speed in training and inference time, robustness for difficult synthesis
conditions, expressiveness, and controllability. Although several approaches
resolve some limitations, there has been no attempt to solve all weaknesses at
once. In this paper, we propose STYLER, an expressive and controllable TTS
framework with high-speed and robust synthesis. Our novel audio-text aligning
method called Mel Calibrator and excluding autoregressive decoding enable rapid
training and inference and robust synthesis on unseen data. Also, disentangled
style factor modeling under supervision enlarges the controllability in
synthesizing process leading to expressive TTS. On top of it, a novel noise
modeling pipeline using domain adversarial training and Residual Decoding
empowers noise-robust style transfer, decomposing the noise without any
additional label. Various experiments demonstrate that STYLER is more effective
in speed and robustness than expressive TTS with autoregressive decoding and
more expressive and controllable than reading style non-autoregressive TTS.
Synthesis samples and experiment results are provided via our demo page, and
code is available publicly.</span>

                                        <span>Fake news travels at unprecedented speeds, reaches global audiences and puts
users and communities at great risk via social media platforms. Deep learning
based models show good performance when trained on large amounts of labeled
data on events of interest, whereas the performance of models tends to degrade
on other events due to domain shift. Therefore, significant challenges are
posed for existing detection approaches to detect fake news on emergent events,
where large-scale labeled datasets are difficult to obtain. Moreover, adding
the knowledge from newly emergent events requires to build a new model from
scratch or continue to fine-tune the model, which can be challenging,
expensive, and unrealistic for real-world settings. In order to address those
challenges, we propose an end-to-end fake news detection framework named
MetaFEND, which is able to learn quickly to detect fake news on emergent events
with a few verified posts. Specifically, the proposed model integrates
meta-learning and neural process methods together to enjoy the benefits of
these approaches. In particular, a label embedding module and a hard attention
mechanism are proposed to enhance the effectiveness by handling categorical
information and trimming irrelevant posts. Extensive experiments are conducted
on multimedia datasets collected from Twitter and Weibo. The experimental
results show our proposed MetaFEND model can detect fake news on never-seen
events effectively and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

by using dataset and function descriptions while significantly decreasing
computation time from minutes to milliseconds by using a zero-shot approach.
Given a new dataset and a well-defined machine learning task, humans begin by
reading a description of the dataset and documentation for the algorithms to be
used. This work is the first to use these textual descriptions, which we call
privileged information, for AutoML. We use a pre-trained Transformer model to
process the privileged text and demonstrate that using this information
improves AutoML performance. Thus, our approach leverages the progress of
unsupervised representation learning in natural language processing to provide
a significant boost to AutoML. We demonstrate that using only textual
descriptions of the data and functions achieves reasonable classification
performance, and adding textual descriptions to data meta-features improves
classification across tabular datasets. To achieve zero-shot AutoML we train a
graph neural network with these description embeddings and the data
meta-features. Each node represents a training dataset, which we use to predict
the best machine learning pipeline for a new test dataset in a zero-shot
fashion. Our zero-shot approach rapidly predicts a high-quality pipeline for a
supervised learning task and dataset. In contrast, most AutoML systems require
tens or hundreds of pipeline evaluations. We show that zero-shot AutoML reduces
running and prediction times from minutes to milliseconds, consistently across
datasets. By speeding up AutoML by orders of magnitude this work demonstrates
real-time AutoML.</span>

                                        <span>Pretraining large neural language models, such as BERT, has led to impressive
gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, most
pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web.
A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by
starting from general-domain language models. In this paper, we challenge this
assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as
biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial
gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To
facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP
benchmark from publicly-available datasets. Our experiments show that
domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of
biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board.
Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for
pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common
practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging
schemes in named entity recognition (NER). To help accelerate research in
biomedical NLP, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and
task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our
BLURB benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding &amp; Reasoning
Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/BLURB.</span>

context. We assess the ability of both static and contextualized models to
adequately represent different lexical-semantic relations, such as homonymy and
synonymy. To do so, we created a new multilingual dataset that allows us to
perform a controlled evaluation of several factors such as the impact of the
surrounding context or the overlap between words, conveying the same or
different senses. A systematic assessment on four scenarios shows that the best
monolingual models based on Transformers can adequately disambiguate homonyms
in context. However, as they rely heavily on context, these models fail at
representing words with different senses when occurring in similar sentences.
Experiments are performed in Galician, Portuguese, English, and Spanish, and
both the dataset (with more than 3,000 evaluation items) and new models are

                                        <span>Much recent effort has been invested in non-autoregressive neural machine
translation, which appears to be an efficient alternative to state-of-the-art
autoregressive machine translation on modern GPUs. In contrast to the latter,
where generation is sequential, the former allows generation to be parallelized
across target token positions. Some of the latest non-autoregressive models
have achieved impressive translation quality-speed tradeoffs compared to
autoregressive baselines. In this work, we reexamine this tradeoff and argue
that autoregressive baselines can be substantially sped up without loss in
accuracy. Specifically, we study autoregressive models with encoders and
decoders of varied depths. Our extensive experiments show that given a
sufficiently deep encoder, a single-layer autoregressive decoder can
substantially outperform strong non-autoregressive models with comparable
inference speed. We show that the speed disadvantage for autoregressive
baselines compared to non-autoregressive methods has been overestimated in
three aspects: suboptimal layer allocation, insufficient speed measurement, and
lack of knowledge distillation. Our results establish a new protocol for future
research toward fast, accurate machine translation. Our code is available at

which is to maximize inter-class variance and minimize intra-class variance.
Supervised metric learning can be categorized into entity-based learning and
proxy-based learning. Most of the existing metric learning objectives like
Contrastive, Triplet, Prototypical, GE2E, etc all belong to the former
division, the performance of which is either highly dependent on sample mining
strategy or restricted by insufficient label information in the mini-batch.
Proxy-based losses mitigate both shortcomings, however, fine-grained
connections among entities are either not or indirectly leveraged. This paper
proposes a Masked Proxy (MP) loss which directly incorporates both proxy-based
relationships and pair-based relationships. We further propose Multinomial
Masked Proxy (MMP) loss to leverage the hardness of speaker pairs. These
methods have been applied to evaluate on VoxCeleb test set and reach
state-of-the-art Equal Error Rate(EER).</span>

replacements are sampled from a generator trained with masked language
modeling. Despite the compelling performance, ELECTRA suffers from the
following two issues. First, there is no direct feedback loop from
discriminator to generator, which renders replacement sampling inefficient.
Second, the generator&#x27;s prediction tends to be over-confident along with
training, making replacements biased to correct tokens. In this paper, we
propose two methods to improve replacement sampling for ELECTRA pre-training.
Specifically, we augment sampling with a hardness prediction mechanism, so that
the generator can encourage the discriminator to learn what it has not
acquired. We also prove that efficient sampling reduces the training variance
of the discriminator. Moreover, we propose to use a focal loss for the
generator in order to relieve oversampling of correct tokens as replacements.
Experimental results show that our method improves ELECTRA pre-training on
various downstream tasks.</span>

data and keywords over the years. This searching and indexing works well when
user/reader already knows about that particular creative textual artefact or
document. This indexing and search hardly takes into account interest and
emotional makeup of readers and its mapping to books. When a person is looking
for a literary textual artefact, he/she might be looking for not only
information but also to seek the joy of reading. In case of literary artefacts,
progression of emotions across the key events could prove to be the key for
indexing and searching. In this paper, we establish clusters among literary
artefacts based on computational relationships among sentiment progressions
using intelligent text analysis. We have created a database of 1076 English
titles + 20 Marathi titles and also used database
this http URL with 16559 titles and their
summaries. We have proposed Sentiment Progression based Indexing for searching
and recommending books. This can be used to create personalized clusters of
book titles of interest to readers. The analysis clearly suggests better
searching and indexing when we are targeting book lovers looking for a

large amount of parameters but constant computation cost, and thus it has
become a trend in model scaling. Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring
quality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this
work, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe
that load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,
contrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely
activated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can
significantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step
forward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits
experts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This
strategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,
and our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is
more effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$
trillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in
comparison with the recent SOTAs on $2048$ TPU cores. The proposed giant model
achieves substantial speedup in convergence over the same-size baseline.</span>

(NMT), the core of which lies in the encoder-decoder architecture. Inspired by
the recent progress of large-scale pre-trained language models on machine
translation in a limited scenario, we firstly demonstrate that a single
language model (LM4MT) can achieve comparable performance with strong
encoder-decoder NMT models on standard machine translation benchmarks, using
the same training data and similar amount of model parameters. LM4MT can also
easily utilize source-side texts as additional supervision. Though modeling the
source- and target-language texts with the same mechanism, LM4MT can provide
unified representations for both source and target sentences, which can better
transfer knowledge across languages. Extensive experiments on pivot-based and
zero-shot translation tasks show that LM4MT can outperform the encoder-decoder
NMT model by a large margin.</span>

efficiency by automatically creating summaries for long spoken dialogues in
which customers and agents try to address issues about specific topics. In this
work, we focus on topic-oriented dialogue summarization, which generates highly
abstractive summaries that preserve the main ideas from dialogues. In spoken
dialogues, abundant dialogue noise and common semantics could obscure the
underlying informative content, making the general topic modeling approaches
difficult to apply. In addition, for customer service, role-specific
information matters and is an indispensable part of a summary. To effectively
perform topic modeling on dialogues and capture multi-role information, in this
work we propose a novel topic-augmented two-stage dialogue summarizer (TDS)
jointly with a saliency-aware neural topic model (SATM) for topic-oriented
summarization of customer service dialogues. Comprehensive studies on a
real-world Chinese customer service dataset demonstrated the superiority of our
method against several strong baselines.</span>

understanding (NLU) tasks, there is a gap between these pretrained encoders and
natural language generation (NLG). NLG tasks are often based on the
encoder-decoder framework, where the pretrained encoders can only benefit part
of it. To reduce this gap, we introduce DeltaLM, a pretrained multilingual
encoder-decoder model that regards the decoder as the task layer of
off-the-shelf pretrained encoders. Specifically, we augment the pretrained
multilingual encoder with a decoder and pre-train it in a self-supervised way.
To take advantage of both the large-scale monolingual data and bilingual data,
we adopt the span corruption and translation span corruption as the
pre-training tasks. Experiments show that DeltaLM outperforms various strong
baselines on both natural language generation and translation tasks, including
machine translation, abstractive text summarization, data-to-text, and question
generation.</span>

formalized as a &#x27;situation description system&#x27;: a probabilistic model which
takes utterance understanding to be the mental process of describing one or

insights from different types of generative models to capture the interplay of
local and global contexts and their joint influence upon the lexical

                                        <span>In Neural Machine Translation (and, more generally, conditional language
modeling), the generation of a target token is influenced by two types of
context: the source and the prefix of the target sequence. While many attempts
to understand the internal workings of NMT models have been made, none of them
explicitly evaluates relative source and target contributions to a generation
decision. We argue that this relative contribution can be evaluated by adopting
a variant of Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Its underlying
&#x27;conservation principle&#x27; makes relevance propagation unique: differently from
other methods, it evaluates not an abstract quantity reflecting token
importance, but the proportion of each token&#x27;s influence. We extend LRP to the
Transformer and conduct an analysis of NMT models which explicitly evaluates
the source and target relative contributions to the generation process. We
analyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of
prefixes, when varying the training objective or the amount of training data,
and during the training process. We find that models trained with more data
tend to rely on source information more and to have more sharp token
contributions; the training process is non-monotonic with several stages of
different nature.</span>

words, without apparent detriment to understanding. We offer a novel
explanation for skipping: readers optimize a tradeoff between performing a
language-related task and fixating as few words as possible. We propose a
neural architecture that combines an attention module (deciding whether to skip
words) and a task module (memorizing the input). We show that our model
predicts human skipping behavior, while also modeling reading times well, even
though it skips 40% of the input. A key prediction of our model is that
different reading tasks should result in different skipping behaviors. We
confirm this prediction in an eye-tracking experiment in which participants
answers questions about a text. We are able to capture these experimental
results using the our model, replacing the memorization module with a task
module that performs neural question answering.</span>

Often these topics are correlated or associated with locations from where these
Tweet posts are made. For example, restaurant owners may need to know where
their target customers eat with respect to the sentiment of the posts made
related to food, policy planners may need to analyze citizens&#x27; opinion on
relevant issues such as crime, safety, congestion, etc. with respect to
specific parts of the city, or county or state. As promising as this is, less
than $1\%$ of the crawled Tweet posts come with geolocation tags. That makes
accurate prediction of Tweet posts for the non geo-tagged tweets very critical
to analyze data in various domains. In this research, we utilized millions of
Twitter posts and end-users domain expertise to build a set of deep neural

predicts the geolocation of non geo-tagged Tweet posts at various level of

synthesis system is to synthesize natural and expressive speech from the output
layer of the neural network without much attention given to the hidden layers.
However, by learning useful latent representation, the system can be used for
many more practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the use of
quantized vectors to model the latent linguistic embedding and compare it with
the continuous counterpart. By enforcing different policies over the latent
spaces in the training, we are able to obtain a latent linguistic embedding
that takes on different properties while having a similar performance in terms
of quality and speaker similarity. Our experiments show that the voice cloning
system built with vector quantization has only a small degradation in terms of
perceptive evaluations, but has a discrete latent space that is useful for
reducing the representation bit-rate, which is desirable for data transferring,
or limiting the information leaking, which is important for speaker
anonymization and other tasks of that nature.</span>

                                        <span>Ambiguity is a characteristic of natural language, which makes expression
ideas flexible. However, in a domain that requires accurate statements, it
becomes a barrier. Specifically, a single word can have many meanings and
multiple words can have the same meaning. When translating a text into a
foreign language, the translator needs to determine the exact meaning of each
element in the original sentence to produce the correct translation sentence.
From that observation, in this paper, we propose ParaLaw Nets, a pretrained
model family using sentence-level cross-lingual information to reduce ambiguity
and increase the performance in legal text processing. This approach achieved
the best result in the Question Answering task of COLIEE-2021.</span>

has been seen as critical to recent successes in few-shot learning. In this
work, we show that finetuning LMs in the few-shot setting can considerably
reduce the need for prompt engineering. In fact, one can use null prompts,
prompts that contain neither task-specific templates nor training examples, and
achieve competitive accuracy to manually-tuned prompts across a wide range of
tasks. While finetuning LMs does introduce new parameters for each downstream
task, we show that this memory overhead can be substantially reduced:
finetuning only the bias terms can achieve comparable or better accuracy than
standard finetuning while only updating 0.1% of the parameters. All in all, we
recommend finetuning LMs for few-shot learning as it is more accurate, robust
to different prompts, and can be made nearly as efficient as using frozen LMs.</span>

                                        <span>Large pre-trained models have achieved great success in many natural language
processing tasks. However, when they are applied in specific domains, these
models suffer from domain shift and bring challenges in fine-tuning and online
serving for latency and capacity constraints. In this paper, we present a
general approach to developing small, fast and effective pre-trained models for
specific domains. This is achieved by adapting the off-the-shelf general
pre-trained models and performing task-agnostic knowledge distillation in
target domains. Specifically, we propose domain-specific vocabulary expansion
in the adaptation stage and employ corpus level occurrence probability to
choose the size of incremental vocabulary automatically. Then we systematically
explore different strategies to compress the large pre-trained models for
specific domains. We conduct our experiments in the biomedical and computer
science domain. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
better performance over the BERT BASE model in domain-specific tasks while 3.3x
smaller and 5.1x faster than BERT BASE. The code and pre-trained models are
available at https://aka.ms/adalm.</span>

                                        <span>This article introduces byteSteady -- a fast model for classification using
byte-level n-gram embeddings. byteSteady assumes that each input comes as a
sequence of bytes. A representation vector is produced using the averaged
embedding vectors of byte-level n-grams, with a pre-defined set of n. The
hashing trick is used to reduce the number of embedding vectors. This input
representation vector is then fed into a linear classifier. A straightforward
application of byteSteady is text classification. We also apply byteSteady to
one type of non-language data -- DNA sequences for gene classification. For
both problems we achieved competitive classification results against strong
baselines, suggesting that byteSteady can be applied to both language and
non-language data. Furthermore, we find that simple compression using Huffman
coding does not significantly impact the results, which offers an
accuracy-speed trade-off previously unexplored in machine learning.</span>

prominent case in point is the explosion of the biomedical literature on
COVID-19, which swelled to hundreds of thousands of papers in a matter of
months. In general, biomedical literature expands by two papers every minute,
totalling over a million new papers every year. Search in the biomedical realm,
and many other vertical domains is challenging due to the scarcity of direct
supervision from click logs. Self-supervised learning has emerged as a
promising direction to overcome the annotation bottleneck. We propose a general
approach for vertical search based on domain-specific pretraining and present a
case study for the biomedical domain. Despite being substantially simpler and
not using any relevance labels for training or development, our method performs
comparably or better than the best systems in the official TREC-COVID
evaluation, a COVID-related biomedical search competition. Using distributed
computing in modern cloud infrastructure, our system can scale to tens of

consistently exhibit known human social biases. Although many methods for
debiasing exist, almost all fixate on completely eliminating biased information
from the embeddings and often diminish training set size in the process. In
this paper, we present a simple yet effective method for debiasing GloVe word
embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) which works by incorporating explicit
information about training set bias rather than removing biased data outright.
Our method runs quickly and efficiently with the help of a fast bias gradient
approximation method from Brunet et al. (2019). As our approach is akin to the
notion of &#x27;source criticism&#x27; in the humanities, we term our method
Source-Critical GloVe (SC-GloVe). We show that SC-GloVe reduces the effect size

Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Despite all the notable advancements,
current KGQA systems only focus on answer generation techniques and not on
answer verbalization. However, in real-world scenarios (e.g., voice assistants
such as Alexa, Siri, etc.), users prefer verbalized answers instead of a
generated response. This paper addresses the task of answer verbalization for
(complex) question answering over knowledge graphs. In this context, we propose
a multi-task-based answer verbalization framework: VOGUE (Verbalization thrOuGh
mUlti-task lEarning). The VOGUE framework attempts to generate a verbalized
answer using a hybrid approach through a multi-task learning paradigm. Our
framework can generate results based on using questions and queries as inputs
concurrently. VOGUE comprises four modules that are trained simultaneously
through multi-task learning. We evaluate our framework on existing datasets for

                                        <span>Deep neural networks have amply demonstrated their prowess but estimating the
reliability of their predictions remains challenging. Deep Ensembles are widely
considered as being one of the best methods for generating uncertainty
estimates but are very expensive to train and evaluate. MC-Dropout is another
popular alternative, which is less expensive, but also less reliable. Our
central intuition is that there is a continuous spectrum of ensemble-like
models of which MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles are extreme examples. The first
uses an effectively infinite number of highly correlated models while the
second relies on a finite number of independent models.

To combine the benefits of both, we introduce Masksembles. Instead of
randomly dropping parts of the network as in MC-dropout, Masksemble relies on a
fixed number of binary masks, which are parameterized in a way that allows to
change correlations between individual models. Namely, by controlling the
overlap between the masks and their density one can choose the optimal
configuration for the task at hand. This leads to a simple and easy to
implement method with performance on par with Ensembles at a fraction of the
cost. We experimentally validate Masksembles on two widely used datasets,
CIFAR10 and ImageNet.</span>

                                        <span>Slimmable neural networks provide a flexible trade-off front between
prediction error and computational requirement (such as the number of
floating-point operations or FLOPs) with the same storage requirement as a
single model. They are useful for reducing maintenance overhead for deploying
models to devices with different memory constraints and are useful for
optimizing the efficiency of a system with many CNNs. However, existing
slimmable network approaches either do not optimize layer-wise widths or
optimize the shared-weights and layer-wise widths independently, thereby
leaving significant room for improvement by joint width and weight
optimization. In this work, we propose a general framework to enable joint
optimization for both width configurations and weights of slimmable networks.
Our framework subsumes conventional and NAS-based slimmable methods as special
cases and provides flexibility to improve over existing methods. From a
practical standpoint, we propose Joslim, an algorithm that jointly optimizes
both the widths and weights for slimmable nets, which outperforms existing
methods for optimizing slimmable networks across various networks, datasets,
and objectives. Quantitatively, improvements up to 1.7% and 8% in top-1
accuracy on the ImageNet dataset can be attained for MobileNetV2 considering
FLOPs and memory footprint, respectively. Our results highlight the potential
of optimizing the channel counts for different layers jointly with the weights
for slimmable networks. Code available at https://github.com/cmu-enyac/Joslim.</span>

found their way into the image processing literature in the course of the last
decades, being used to construct robust and efficient denoising filters for
multivariate images such as colour images but also matrix-valued images. Based
on the similarities between image and geometric data as results of the sampling
of continuous physical quantities, it can be expected that the understanding of
multivariate median filters for images provides a starting point for the
development of shape processing techniques. This paper presents an overview of
multivariate median concepts relevant for image and shape processing. It
focusses on their mathematical principles and discusses important properties

                                        <span>Quantitative MR imaging is increasingly favoured for its richer information
content and standardised measures. However, computing quantitative parameter
maps, such as those encoding longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), apparent
transverse relaxation rate (R2*) or magnetisation-transfer saturation (MTsat),
involves inverting a highly non-linear function. Many methods for deriving
parameter maps assume perfect measurements and do not consider how noise is
propagated through the estimation procedure, resulting in needlessly noisy
maps. Instead, we propose a probabilistic generative (forward) model of the
entire dataset, which is formulated and inverted to jointly recover (log)
parameter maps with a well-defined probabilistic interpretation (e.g., maximum
likelihood or maximum a posteriori). The second order optimisation we propose
for model fitting achieves rapid and stable convergence thanks to a novel
approximate Hessian. We demonstrate the utility of our flexible framework in
the context of recovering more accurate maps from data acquired using the
popular multi-parameter mapping protocol. We also show how to incorporate a
joint total variation prior to further decrease the noise in the maps, noting
that the probabilistic formulation allows the uncertainty on the recovered
parameter maps to be estimated. Our implementation uses a PyTorch backend and
benefits from GPU acceleration. It is available at

                                        <span>Late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE MRI) is commonly
used to visualize and quantify left atrial (LA) scars. The position and extent
of scars provide important information of the pathophysiology and progression
of atrial fibrillation (AF). Hence, LA scar segmentation and quantification
from LGE MRI can be useful in computer-assisted diagnosis and treatment
stratification of AF patients. Since manual delineation can be time-consuming
and subject to intra- and inter-expert variability, automating this computing
is highly desired, which nevertheless is still challenging and
under-researched.

This paper aims to provide a systematic review on computing methods for LA
cavity, wall, scar and ablation gap segmentation and quantification from LGE
MRI, and the related literature for AF studies. Specifically, we first
summarize AF-related imaging techniques, particularly LGE MRI. Then, we review
the methodologies of the four computing tasks in detail, and summarize the
validation strategies applied in each task. Finally, the possible future
developments are outlined, with a brief survey on the potential clinical
applications of the aforementioned methods. The review shows that the research
into this topic is still in early stages. Although several methods have been
proposed, especially for LA segmentation, there is still large scope for
further algorithmic developments due to performance issues related to the high
variability of enhancement appearance and differences in image acquisition.</span>

this work, we improve the original Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVTv1) by adding
three improvement designs, which include (1) locally continuous features with
convolutions, (2) position encodings with zero paddings, and (3) linear
complexity attention layers with average pooling. With these simple
modifications, our PVTv2 significantly improves PVTv1 on classification,
detection, and segmentation. Moreover, PVTv2 achieves much better performance
than recent works, including Swin Transformer, under ImageNet-1K pre-training.

                                        <span>The recent research explosion around implicit neural representations, such as
NeRF, shows that there is immense potential for implicitly storing high-quality
scene and lighting information in compact neural networks. However, one major
limitation preventing the use of NeRF in real-time rendering applications is
the prohibitive computational cost of excessive network evaluations along each
view ray, requiring dozens of petaFLOPS. In this work, we bring compact neural
representations closer to practical rendering of synthetic content in real-time
applications, such as games and virtual reality. We show that the number of
samples required for each view ray can be significantly reduced when samples
are placed around surfaces in the scene without compromising image quality. To
this end, we propose a depth oracle network that predicts ray sample locations
for each view ray with a single network evaluation. We show that using a
classification network around logarithmically discretized and spherically
warped depth values is essential to encode surface locations rather than
directly estimating depth. The combination of these techniques leads to DONeRF,
our compact dual network design with a depth oracle network as its first step
and a locally sampled shading network for ray accumulation. With DONeRF, we
reduce the inference costs by up to 48x compared to NeRF when conditioning on
available ground truth depth information. Compared to concurrent acceleration
methods for raymarching-based neural representations, DONeRF does not require
additional memory for explicit caching or acceleration structures, and can
render interactively (20 frames per second) on a single GPU.</span>

vector machines with the nonparallel hyperplanes to two types of frameworks.
The first type constructs the hyperplanes separately. It solves a series of
small optimization problems to obtain a series of hyperplanes, but is hard to
measure the loss of each sample. The other type constructs all the hyperplanes
simultaneously, and it solves one big optimization problem with the ascertained
loss of each sample. We give the characteristics of each framework and compare
them carefully. In addition, based on the second framework, we construct a
max-min distance-based nonparallel support vector machine for multiclass
classification problem, called NSVM. It constructs hyperplanes with large
distance margin by solving an optimization problem. Experimental results on
benchmark data sets show the advantages of our NSVM.</span>

                                        <span>Reconstructing magnetic resonance (MR) images from undersampled data is a
challenging problem due to various artifacts introduced by the under-sampling
operation. Recent deep learning-based methods for MR image reconstruction
usually leverage a generic auto-encoder architecture which captures low-level
features at the initial layers and high-level features at the deeper layers.
Such networks focus much on global features which may not be optimal to
reconstruct the fully-sampled image. In this paper, we propose an
Over-and-Under Complete Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (OUCR), which
consists of an overcomplete and an undercomplete Convolutional Recurrent Neural
Network(CRNN). The overcomplete branch gives special attention in learning
local structures by restraining the receptive field of the network. Combining
it with the undercomplete branch leads to a network which focuses more on
low-level features without losing out on the global structures. Extensive
experiments on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
significant improvements over the compressed sensing and popular deep
learning-based methods with less number of trainable parameters.</span>

measurements remains a holy grail of imaging science. Deep learning methods
have shown promise in learning object priors or constraints to improve the
conditioning of an ill-posed imaging inverse problem. In this study, a
framework for estimating an object of interest that is semantically related to
a known prior image, is proposed. An optimization problem is formulated in the
disentangled latent space of a style-based generative model, and semantically
meaningful constraints are imposed using the disentangled latent representation
of the prior image. Stable recovery from incomplete measurements with the help
of a prior image is theoretically analyzed. Numerical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our approach as compared to related methods are
presented.</span>

                                        <span>In current clinical practice, noisy and artifact-ridden weekly cone-beam
computed tomography (CBCT) images are only used for patient setup during
radiotherapy. Treatment planning is done once at the beginning of the treatment
using high-quality planning CT (pCT) images and manual contours for
organs-at-risk (OARs) structures. If the quality of the weekly CBCT images can
be improved while simultaneously segmenting OAR structures, this can provide
critical information for adapting radiotherapy mid-treatment as well as for
deriving biomarkers for treatment response. Using a novel physics-based data
augmentation strategy, we synthesize a large dataset of perfectly/inherently
registered planning CT and synthetic-CBCT pairs for locally advanced lung
cancer patient cohort, which are then used in a multitask 3D deep learning
framework to simultaneously segment and translate real weekly CBCT images to
high-quality planning CT-like images. We compared the synthetic CT and OAR
segmentations generated by the model to real planning CT and manual OAR
segmentations and showed promising results. The real week 1 (baseline) CBCT
images which had an average MAE of 162.77 HU compared to pCT images are
translated to synthetic CT images that exhibit a drastically improved average
MAE of 29.31 HU and average structural similarity of 92% with the pCT images.
The average DICE scores of the 3D organs-at-risk segmentations are: lungs 0.96,
heart 0.88, spinal cord 0.83 and esophagus 0.66. This approach could allow
clinicians to adjust treatment plans using only the routine low-quality CBCT
images, potentially improving patient outcomes. Our code, data, and pre-trained
models will be made available via our physics-based data augmentation library,

                                        <span>Confounding bias is a crucial problem when applying machine learning to
practice, especially in clinical practice. We consider the problem of learning
representations independent to multiple biases. In literature, this is mostly
solved by purging the bias information from learned representations. We however
expect this strategy to harm the diversity of information in the
representation, and thus limiting its prospective usage (e.g., interpretation).
Therefore, we propose to mitigate the bias while keeping almost all information
in the latent representations, which enables us to observe and interpret them
as well. To achieve this, we project latent features onto a learned vector
direction, and enforce the independence between biases and projected features
rather than all learned features. To interpret the mapping between projected
features and input data, we propose projection-wise disentangling: a sampling
and reconstruction along the learned vector direction. The proposed method was
evaluated on the analysis of 3D facial shape and patient characteristics
(N&#x3D;5011). Experiments showed that this conceptually simple method achieved
state-of-the-art fair prediction performance and interpretability, showing its
great potential for clinical applications.</span>

                                        <span>Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and their variants have been
widely used in large scale face recognition(FR) recently. Existing methods have
achieved good performance on many FR benchmarks. However, most of them suffer
from two major problems. First, these methods converge quite slowly since they
optimize the loss functions in a high-dimensional and sparse Gaussian Sphere.
Second, the high dimensionality of features, despite the powerful descriptive
ability, brings difficulty to the optimization, which may lead to a sub-optimal
local optimum. To address these problems, we propose a simple yet efficient
training mechanism called MultiFace, where we approximate the original
high-dimensional features by the ensemble of low-dimensional features. The
proposed mechanism is also generic and can be easily applied to many advanced
FR models. Moreover, it brings the benefits of good interpretability to FR
models via the clustering effect. In detail, the ensemble of these
low-dimensional features can capture complementary yet discriminative
information, which can increase the intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can
accelerate 2-3 times with the softmax loss and 1.2-1.5 times with Arcface or
Cosface, while achieving state-of-the-art performances in several benchmark
datasets. Especially, the significant improvements on large-scale
datasets(e.g., IJB and MageFace) demonstrate the flexibility of our new
training mechanism.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in whole slide imaging (WSI) technology have led to the
development of a myriad of computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI)
based diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive algorithms. Computational
Pathology (CPath) offers an integrated solution to utilize information embedded
in pathology WSIs beyond what we obtain through visual assessment. For
automated analysis of WSIs and validation of machine learning (ML) models,
annotations at the slide, tissue and cellular levels are required. The
annotation of important visual constructs in pathology images is an important
component of CPath projects. Improper annotations can result in algorithms
which are hard to interpret and can potentially produce inaccurate and
inconsistent results. Despite the crucial role of annotations in CPath
projects, there are no well-defined guidelines or best practices on how
annotations should be carried out. In this paper, we address this shortcoming
by presenting the experience and best practices acquired during the execution
of a large-scale annotation exercise involving a multidisciplinary team of
pathologists, ML experts and researchers as part of the Pathology image data
Lake for Analytics, Knowledge and Education (PathLAKE) consortium. We present a
real-world case study along with examples of different types of annotations,
diagnostic algorithm, annotation data dictionary and annotation constructs. The
analyses reported in this work highlight best practice recommendations that can
be used as annotation guidelines over the lifecycle of a CPath project.</span>

                                        <span>Document image classification remains a popular research area because it can
be commercialized in many enterprise applications across different industries.
Recent advancements in large pre-trained computer vision and language models
and graph neural networks has lent document image classification many tools.
However using large pre-trained models usually requires substantial computing
resources which could defeat the cost-saving advantages of automatic document
image classification. In the paper we propose an efficient document image
classification framework that uses graph convolution neural networks and
incorporates textual, visual and layout information of the document. We have
rigorously benchmarked our proposed algorithm against several state-of-art
vision and language models on both publicly available dataset and a real-life
insurance document classification dataset. Empirical results on both publicly
available and real-world data show that our methods achieve near SOTA
performance yet require much less computing resources and time for model
training and inference. This results in solutions than offer better cost
advantages, especially in scalable deployment for enterprise applications. The
results showed that our algorithm can achieve classification performance quite
close to SOTA. We also provide comprehensive comparisons of computing
resources, model sizes, train and inference time between our proposed methods
and baselines. In addition we delineate the cost per image using our method and
other baselines.</span>

Variational AutoEncoders (VAE). Our work is motivated by recent studies
empowering VAEs to reach state of the art generative results on complex image
datasets. These very deep VAE architectures, as well as VAEs using more complex
output distributions, highlight a tendency to haphazardly produce high training
gradients as well as NaN losses. The empirical fixes proposed to train them
despite their limitations are neither fully theoretically grounded nor
generally sufficient in practice. Building on this, we localize the source of
the problem at the interface between the model&#x27;s neural networks and their
output probabilistic distributions. We explain a common source of instability
stemming from an incautious formulation of the encoded Normal distribution&#x27;s
variance, and apply the same approach on other, less obvious sources. We show
that by implementing small changes to the way we parameterize the Normal
distributions on which they rely, VAEs can securely be trained.</span>

                                        <span>Generating high-fidelity talking head video by fitting with the input audio
sequence is a challenging problem that receives considerable attentions
recently. In this paper, we address this problem with the aid of neural scene
representation networks. Our method is completely different from existing
methods that rely on intermediate representations like 2D landmarks or 3D face
models to bridge the gap between audio input and video output. Specifically,
the feature of input audio signal is directly fed into a conditional implicit
function to generate a dynamic neural radiance field, from which a
high-fidelity talking-head video corresponding to the audio signal is
synthesized using volume rendering. Another advantage of our framework is that
not only the head (with hair) region is synthesized as previous methods did,
but also the upper body is generated via two individual neural radiance fields.
Experimental results demonstrate that our novel framework can (1) produce
high-fidelity and natural results, and (2) support free adjustment of audio
signals, viewing directions, and background images.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper we undertake the task of text-based video moment retrieval from
a corpus of videos. To train the model, text-moment paired datasets were used
to learn the correct correspondences. In typical training methods, ground-truth
text-moment pairs are used as positive pairs, whereas other pairs are regarded
as negative pairs. However, aside from the ground-truth pairs, some text-moment
pairs should be regarded as positive. In this case, one text annotation can be
positive for many video moments. Conversely, one video moment can be
corresponded to many text annotations. Thus, there are many-to-many
correspondences between the text annotations and video moments. Based on these
correspondences, we can form potentially relevant pairs, which are not given as
ground truth yet are not negative; effectively incorporating such relevant
pairs into training can improve the retrieval performance. The text query
should describe what is happening in a video moment. Hence, different video
moments annotated with similar texts, which contain a similar action, are
likely to hold the similar action, thus these pairs can be considered as
potentially relevant pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel training method
that takes advantage of potentially relevant pairs, which are detected based on
linguistic analysis about text annotation. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets revealed that our method improves the retrieval performance both
quantitatively and qualitatively.</span>

                                        <span>The performance of image recognition like human pose detection, trained with
simulated images would usually get worse due to the divergence between real and
simulated data. To make the distribution of a simulated image close to that of
real one, there are several works applying GAN-based image-to-image
transformation methods, e.g., SimGAN and CycleGAN. However, these methods would
not be sensitive enough to the various change in pose and shape of subjects,
especially when the training data are imbalanced, e.g., some particular poses
and shapes are minor in the training data. To overcome this problem, we propose
to introduce the label information of subjects, e.g., pose and type of objects
in the training of CycleGAN, and lead it to obtain label-wise transforamtion
models. We evaluate our proposed method called Label-CycleGAN, through
experiments on the digit image transformation from SVHN to MNIST and the
surveillance camera image transformation from simulated to real images.</span>

                                        <span>We consider a category-level perception problem, where one is given 3D sensor
data picturing an object of a given category (e.g. a car), and has to
reconstruct the pose and shape of the object despite intra-class variability
(i.e. different car models have different shapes). We consider an active shape
model, where -- for an object category -- we are given a library of potential
CAD models describing objects in that category, and we adopt a standard
formulation where pose and shape estimation are formulated as a non-convex
optimization. Our first contribution is to provide the first certifiably
optimal solver for pose and shape estimation. In particular, we show that
rotation estimation can be decoupled from the estimation of the object
translation and shape, and we demonstrate that (i) the optimal object rotation
can be computed via a tight (small-size) semidefinite relaxation, and (ii) the
translation and shape parameters can be computed in closed-form given the
rotation. Our second contribution is to add an outlier rejection layer to our
solver, hence making it robust to a large number of misdetections. Towards this
goal, we wrap our optimal solver in a robust estimation scheme based on
graduated non-convexity. To further enhance robustness to outliers, we also
develop the first graph-theoretic formulation to prune outliers in
category-level perception, which removes outliers via convex hull and maximum
clique computations; the resulting approach is robust to 70%-90% outliers. Our
third contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation. Besides providing
an ablation study on a simulated dataset and on the PASCAL3D+ dataset, we
combine our solver with a deep-learned keypoint detector, and show that the
resulting approach improves over the state of the art in vehicle pose
estimation in the ApolloScape datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, bladder cancer has been significantly increased in terms of
incidence and mortality. Currently, two subtypes are known based on tumour
growth: non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).
In this work, we focus on the MIBC subtype because it is of the worst prognosis
and can spread to adjacent organs. We present a self-learning framework to
grade bladder cancer from histological images stained via immunohistochemical
techniques. Specifically, we propose a novel Deep Convolutional Embedded
Attention Clustering (DCEAC) which allows classifying histological patches into
different severity levels of the disease, according to the patterns established
in the literature. The proposed DCEAC model follows a two-step fully
unsupervised learning methodology to discern between non-tumour, mild and
infiltrative patterns from high-resolution samples of 512x512 pixels. Our
system outperforms previous clustering-based methods by including a
convolutional attention module, which allows refining the features of the
latent space before the classification stage. The proposed network exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches by 2-3% across different metrics, achieving a final
average accuracy of 0.9034 in a multi-class scenario. Furthermore, the reported
class activation maps evidence that our model is able to learn by itself the
same patterns that clinicians consider relevant, without incurring prior
annotation steps. This fact supposes a breakthrough in muscle-invasive bladder
cancer grading which bridges the gap with respect to train the model on
labelled data.</span>

                                        <span>Point cloud upsampling using deep learning has been paid various efforts in
the past few years. Recent supervised deep learning methods are restricted to
the size of training data and is limited in terms of covering all shapes of
point clouds. Besides, the acquisition of such amount of data is unrealistic,
and the network generally performs less powerful than expected on unseen
records. In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach to upsample point
clouds internally referred as &quot;Zero Shot&quot; Point Cloud Upsampling (ZSPU) at
holistic level. Our approach is solely based on the internal information
provided by a particular point cloud without patching in both self-training and
testing phases. This single-stream design significantly reduces the training
time of the upsampling task, by learning the relation between low-resolution
(LR) point clouds and their high (original) resolution (HR) counterparts. This
association will provide super-resolution (SR) outputs when original point
clouds are loaded as input. We demonstrate competitive performance on benchmark
point cloud datasets when compared to other upsampling methods. Furthermore,
ZSPU achieves superior qualitative results on shapes with complex local details
or high curvatures.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, transformers have shown great superiority in solving computer
vision tasks by modeling images as a sequence of manually-split patches with
self-attention mechanism. However, current architectures of vision transformers
(ViTs) are simply inherited from natural language processing (NLP) tasks and
have not been sufficiently investigated and optimized. In this paper, we make a
further step by examining the intrinsic structure of transformers for vision
tasks and propose an architecture search method, dubbed ViTAS, to search for
the optimal architecture with similar hardware budgets. Concretely, we design a
new effective yet efficient weight sharing paradigm for ViTs, such that
architectures with different token embedding, sequence size, number of heads,
width, and depth can be derived from a single super-transformer. Moreover, to
cater for the variance of distinct architectures, we introduce \textit{private}
class token and self-attention maps in the super-transformer. In addition, to
adapt the searching for different budgets, we propose to search the sampling
probability of identity operation. Experimental results show that our ViTAS
attains excellent results compared to existing pure transformer architectures.
For example, with $1.3$G FLOPs budget, our searched architecture achieves
$74.7\%$ top-$1$ accuracy on ImageNet and is $2.5\%$ superior than the current
baseline ViT architecture. Code is available at

                                        <span>Cross-modal retrieval aims to enable flexible retrieval experience by
combining multimedia data such as image, video, text, and audio. One core of
unsupervised approaches is to dig the correlations among different object
representations to complete satisfied retrieval performance without requiring
expensive labels. In this paper, we propose a Graph Pattern Loss based
Diversified Attention Network(GPLDAN) for unsupervised cross-modal retrieval to
deeply analyze correlations among representations. First, we propose a
diversified attention feature projector by considering the interaction between
different representations to generate multiple representations of an instance.
Then, we design a novel graph pattern loss to explore the correlations among
different representations, in this graph all possible distances between
different representations are considered. In addition, a modality classifier is
added to explicitly declare the corresponding modalities of features before
fusion and guide the network to enhance discrimination ability. We test GPLDAN
on four public datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art cross-modal
retrieval methods, the experimental results demonstrate the performance and
competitiveness of GPLDAN.</span>

                                        <span>Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide and Optical
Coherence Tomography (OCT) is the quintessential imaging technique for its
detection. Unlike most of the state-of-the-art studies focused on glaucoma
detection, in this paper, we propose, for the first time, a novel framework for
glaucoma grading using raw circumpapillary B-scans. In particular, we set out a
new OCT-based hybrid network which combines hand-driven and deep learning
algorithms. An OCT-specific descriptor is proposed to extract hand-crafted
features related to the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). In parallel, an
innovative CNN is developed using skip-connections to include tailored residual
and attention modules to refine the automatic features of the latent space. The
proposed architecture is used as a backbone to conduct a novel few-shot
learning based on static and dynamic prototypical networks. The k-shot paradigm
is redefined giving rise to a supervised end-to-end system which provides
substantial improvements discriminating between healthy, early and advanced
glaucoma samples. The training and evaluation processes of the dynamic
prototypical network are addressed from two fused databases acquired via
Heidelberg Spectralis system. Validation and testing results reach a
categorical accuracy of 0.9459 and 0.8788 for glaucoma grading, respectively.
Besides, the high performance reported by the proposed model for glaucoma
detection deserves a special mention. The findings from the class activation
maps are directly in line with the clinicians&#x27; opinion since the heatmaps
pointed out the RNFL as the most relevant structure for glaucoma diagnosis.</span>

                                        <span>Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) aims to learn multi-modal representations
from image-text pairs and serves for downstream vision-language tasks in a
fine-tuning fashion. The dominant VLP models adopt a CNN-Transformer
architecture, which embeds images with a CNN, and then aligns images and text
with a Transformer. Visual relationship between visual contents plays an
important role in image understanding and is the basic for inter-modal
alignment learning. However, CNNs have limitations in visual relation learning
due to local receptive field&#x27;s weakness in modeling long-range dependencies.
Thus the two objectives of learning visual relation and inter-modal alignment
are encapsulated in the same Transformer network. Such design might restrict
the inter-modal alignment learning in the Transformer by ignoring the
specialized characteristic of each objective. To tackle this, we propose a
fully Transformer visual embedding for VLP to better learn visual relation and
further promote inter-modal alignment. Specifically, we propose a metric named
Inter-Modality Flow (IMF) to measure the interaction between vision and
language modalities (i.e., inter-modality). We also design a novel masking
optimization mechanism named Masked Feature Regression (MFR) in Transformer to
further promote the inter-modality learning. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study to explore the benefit of Transformer for visual feature
learning in VLP. We verify our method on a wide range of vision-language tasks,
including Visual Question Answering (VQA), Visual Entailment and Visual
Reasoning. Our approach not only outperforms the state-of-the-art VLP
performance, but also shows benefits on the IMF metric.</span>

creation from monocular videos. Our approach extends neural radiance fields
(NeRF) to the dynamic scenes with human movements via introducing explicit
pose-guided deformation while learning the scene representation network. In
particular, we estimate the human pose for each frame and learn a constant
canonical space for the detailed human template, which enables natural shape
deformation from the observation space to the canonical space under the
explicit control of the pose parameters. To compensate for inaccurate pose
estimation, we introduce the pose refinement strategy that updates the initial
pose during the learning process, which not only helps to learn more accurate
human reconstruction but also accelerates the convergence. In experiments we
show that the proposed approach achieves 1) implicit human geometry and
appearance reconstruction with high-quality details, 2) photo-realistic
rendering of the human from arbitrary views, and 3) animation of the human with
arbitrary poses.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in image synthesis enables one to translate images by
learning the mapping between a source domain and a target domain. Existing
methods tend to learn the distributions by training a model on a variety of
datasets, with results evaluated largely in a subjective manner. Relatively few
works in this area, however, study the potential use of semantic image
translation methods for image recognition tasks. In this paper, we explore the
use of Single Image Texture Translation (SITT) for data augmentation. We first
propose a lightweight model for translating texture to images based on a single
input of source texture, allowing for fast training and testing. Based on SITT,
we then explore the use of augmented data in long-tailed and few-shot image
classification tasks. We find the proposed method is capable of translating
input data into a target domain, leading to consistent improved image
recognition performance. Finally, we examine how SITT and related image
translation methods can provide a basis for a data-efficient, augmentation
engineering approach to model training.</span>

autonomous driving systems. Safe, high speed driving needs larger detection
ranges, which are enabled by new LiDARs. These larger detection ranges require
more efficient and accurate detection models. Towards this goal, we propose
Range Sparse Net (RSN), a simple, efficient, and accurate 3D object detector in
order to tackle real time 3D object detection in this extended detection
regime. RSN predicts foreground points from range images and applies sparse
convolutions on the selected foreground points to detect objects. The
lightweight 2D convolutions on dense range images results in significantly
fewer selected foreground points, thus enabling the later sparse convolutions
in RSN to efficiently operate. Combining features from the range image further
enhance detection accuracy. RSN runs at more than 60 frames per second on a
150m x 150m detection region on Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) while being more
accurate than previously published detectors. As of 11/2020, RSN is ranked
first in the WOD leaderboard based on the APH/LEVEL 1 metrics for LiDAR-based
pedestrian and vehicle detection, while being several times faster than
alternatives.</span>

                                        <span>The detection of nuclei and cells in histology images is of great value in
both clinical practice and pathological studies. However, multiple reasons such
as morphological variations of nuclei or cells make it a challenging task where
conventional object detection methods cannot obtain satisfactory performance in
many cases. A detection task consists of two sub-tasks, classification and
localization. Under the condition of dense object detection, classification is
a key to boost the detection performance. Considering this, we propose
similarity based region proposal networks (SRPN) for nuclei and cells detection
in histology images. In particular, a customized convolution layer termed as
embedding layer is designed for network building. The embedding layer is added
into the region proposal networks, enabling the networks to learn
discriminative features based on similarity learning. Features obtained by
similarity learning can significantly boost the classification performance
compared to conventional methods. SRPN can be easily integrated into standard
convolutional neural networks architectures such as the Faster R-CNN and
RetinaNet. We test the proposed approach on tasks of multi-organ nuclei
detection and signet ring cells detection in histological images. Experimental
results show that networks applying similarity learning achieved superior
performance on both tasks when compared to their counterparts. In particular,
the proposed SRPN achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MoNuSeg benchmark
for nuclei segmentation and detection while compared to previous methods, and
on the signet ring cell detection benchmark when compared with baselines. The

                                        <span>Recent studies have shown that neural network (NN) based image classifiers
are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, which poses a threat to
security-sensitive image recognition task. Prior work has shown that JPEG
compression can combat the drop in classification accuracy on adversarial
examples to some extent. But, as the compression ratio increases, traditional
JPEG compression is insufficient to defend those attacks but can cause an
abrupt accuracy decline to the benign images. In this paper, with the aim of
fully filtering the adversarial perturbations, we firstly make modifications to
traditional JPEG compression algorithm which becomes more favorable for NN.
Specifically, based on an analysis of the frequency coefficient, we design a
NN-favored quantization table for compression. Considering compression as a
data augmentation strategy, we then combine our model-agnostic preprocess with
noisy training. We fine-tune the pre-trained model by training with images
encoded at different compression levels, thus generating multiple classifiers.
Finally, since lower (higher) compression ratio can remove both perturbations
and original features slightly (aggressively), we use these trained multiple
models for model ensemble. The majority vote of the ensemble of models is
adopted as final predictions. Experiments results show our method can improve
defense efficiency while maintaining original accuracy.</span>

it has mostly focused on synthesizing visually realistic images. In this paper,
motivated by multi-task learning of shareable feature representations, we
consider a novel problem of learning a shared generative model that is useful
across various visual perception tasks. Correspondingly, we propose a general
multi-task oriented generative modeling (MGM) framework, by coupling a
discriminative multi-task network with a generative network. While it is
challenging to synthesize both RGB images and pixel-level annotations in
multi-task scenarios, our framework enables us to use synthesized images paired
with only weak annotations (i.e., image-level scene labels) to facilitate
multiple visual tasks. Experimental evaluation on challenging multi-task
benchmarks, including NYUv2 and Taskonomy, demonstrates that our MGM framework
improves the performance of all the tasks by large margins, consistently
outperforming state-of-the-art multi-task approaches.</span>

for image generation, called NP-DRAW, which sequentially draws on a latent
canvas in a part-by-part fashion and then decodes the image from the canvas.
Our key contributions are as follows. 1) We propose a non-parametric prior
distribution over the appearance of image parts so that the latent variable
&#x60;&#x60;what-to-draw&#x27;&#x27; per step becomes a categorical random variable. This improves
the expressiveness and greatly eases the learning compared to Gaussians used in
the literature. 2) We model the sequential dependency structure of parts via a
Transformer, which is more powerful and easier to train compared to RNNs used
in the literature. 3) We propose an effective heuristic parsing algorithm to
pre-train the prior. Experiments on MNIST, Omniglot, CIFAR-10, and CelebA show
that our method significantly outperforms previous structured image models like
DRAW and AIR and is competitive to other generic generative models. Moreover,
we show that our model&#x27;s inherent compositionality and interpretability bring
significant benefits in the low-data learning regime and latent space editing.

registration of non-rigid 3D point clouds. The proposed approach is data-driven
and adopts for the first time the transformer architecture in the registration
task. Our method is general and applies to different settings. Given a fixed
template with some desired properties (e.g. skinning weights or other animation
cues), we can register raw acquired data to it, thereby transferring all the
template properties to the input geometry. Alternatively, given a pair of
shapes, our method can register the first onto the second (or vice-versa),
obtaining a high-quality dense correspondence between the two. In both
contexts, the quality of our results enables us to target real applications
such as texture transfer and shape interpolation. Furthermore, we also show
that including an estimation of the underlying density of the surface eases the
learning process. By exploiting the potential of this architecture, we can
train our model requiring only a sparse set of ground truth correspondences
($10\sim20\%$ of the total points). The proposed model and the analysis that we
perform pave the way for future exploration of transformer-based architectures
for registration and matching applications. Qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods

algorithms based on deep neural networks reach performance levels that are
competitive with human medical experts. To alleviate the challenges of small
dataset sizes, these systems often rely on pretraining. In this work, we aim to
assess the broader implications of these approaches. For diabetic retinopathy
grading as exemplary use case, we compare the impact of different training
procedures including recently established self-supervised pretraining methods
based on contrastive learning. To this end, we investigate different aspects
such as quantitative performance, statistics of the learned feature
representations, interpretability and robustness to image distortions. Our
results indicate that models initialized from ImageNet pretraining report a
significant increase in performance, generalization and robustness to image
distortions. In particular, self-supervised models show further benefits to
supervised models. Self-supervised models with initialization from ImageNet
pretraining not only report higher performance, they also reduce overfitting to
large lesions along with improvements in taking into account minute lesions
indicative of the progression of the disease. Understanding the effects of
pretraining in a broader sense that goes beyond simple performance comparisons
is of crucial importance for the broader medical imaging community beyond the

                                        <span>3D object detection is vital for many robotics applications. For tasks where
a 2D perspective range image exists, we propose to learn a 3D representation
directly from this range image view. To this end, we designed a 2D
convolutional network architecture that carries the 3D spherical coordinates of
each pixel throughout the network. Its layers can consume any arbitrary
convolution kernel in place of the default inner product kernel and exploit the
underlying local geometry around each pixel. We outline four such kernels: a
dense kernel according to the bag-of-words paradigm, and three graph kernels
inspired by recent graph neural network advances: the Transformer, the
PointNet, and the Edge Convolution. We also explore cross-modality fusion with
the camera image, facilitated by operating in the perspective range image view.
Our method performs competitively on the Waymo Open Dataset and improves the
state-of-the-art AP for pedestrian detection from 69.7% to 75.5%. It is also
efficient in that our smallest model, which still outperforms the popular
PointPillars in quality, requires 180 times fewer FLOPS and model parameters</span>

                                        <span>Semantic image synthesis is a process for generating photorealistic images
from a single semantic mask. To enrich the diversity of multimodal image
synthesis, previous methods have controlled the global appearance of an output
image by learning a single latent space. However, a single latent code is often
insufficient for capturing various object styles because object appearance
depends on multiple factors. To handle individual factors that determine object
styles, we propose a class- and layer-wise extension to the variational
autoencoder (VAE) framework that allows flexible control over each object class
at the local to global levels by learning multiple latent spaces. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our method generates images that are both plausible and
more diverse compared to state-of-the-art methods via extensive experiments
with real and synthetic datasets inthree different domains. We also show that
our method enables a wide range of applications in image synthesis and editing
tasks.</span>

                                        <span>The paper presents a new approach to multiview video coding using Screen
Content Coding. It is assumed that for a time instant the frames corresponding
to all views are packed into a single frame, i.e. the frame-compatible approach
to multiview coding is applied. For such coding scenario, the paper
demonstrates that Screen Content Coding can be efficiently used for multiview
video coding. Two approaches are considered: the first using standard HEVC
Screen Content Coding, and the second using Advanced Screen Content Coding. The
latter is the original proposal of the authors that exploits quarter-pel motion
vectors and other nonstandard extensions of HEVC Screen Content Coding. The
experimental results demonstrate that multiview video coding even using
standard HEVC Screen Content Coding is much more efficient than simulcast HEVC
coding. The proposed Advanced Screen Content Coding provides virtually the same
coding efficiency as MV-HEVC, which is the state-of-the-art multiview video
compression technique. The authors suggest that Advanced Screen Content Coding
can be efficiently used within the new Versatile Video Coding (VVC) technology.
Nevertheless a reference multiview extension of VVC does not exist yet,
therefore, for VVC-based coding, the experimental comparisons are left for
future work.</span>

full realistic synthetic scenes is extremely cumbersome and expensive due to
the difficulty in modeling the thermal properties of the materials of the

the employment of a generative model, and study how to best combine our

                                        <span>Model-based eye tracking has been a dominant approach for eye gaze tracking
because of its ability to generalize to different subjects, without the need of
any training data and eye gaze annotations. Model-based eye tracking, however,
is susceptible to eye feature detection errors, in particular for eye tracking
in the wild. To address this issue, we propose a Bayesian framework for
model-based eye tracking. The proposed system consists of a cascade-Bayesian
Convolutional Neural Network (c-BCNN) to capture the probabilistic
relationships between eye appearance and its landmarks, and a geometric eye
model to estimate eye gaze from the eye landmarks. Given a testing eye image,
the Bayesian framework can generate, through Bayesian inference, the eye gaze
distribution without explicit landmark detection and model training, based on
which it not only estimates the most likely eye gaze but also its uncertainty.
Furthermore, with Bayesian inference instead of point-based inference, our
model can not only generalize better to different sub-jects, head poses, and
environments but also is robust to image noise and landmark detection errors.
Finally, with the estimated gaze uncertainty, we can construct a cascade
architecture that allows us to progressively improve gaze estimation accuracy.
Compared to state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based methods, the
proposed Bayesian framework demonstrates significant improvement in
generalization capability across several benchmark datasets and in accuracy and
robustness under challenging real-world conditions.</span>

properties of human intelligence. Decision-making systems that can perform
these types of reasoning have the potential to be more generalizable and
interpretable. Simulations have helped advance the state-of-the-art in this
domain, by providing the ability to systematically vary parameters (e.g.,
confounders) and generate examples of the outcomes in the case of
counterfactual scenarios. However, simulating complex temporal causal events in
multi-agent scenarios, such as those that exist in driving and vehicle
navigation, is challenging. To help address this, we present a high-fidelity
simulation environment that is designed for developing algorithms for causal
discovery and counterfactual reasoning in the safety-critical context. A core
component of our work is to introduce \textit{agency}, such that it is simple
to define and create complex scenarios using high-level definitions. The
vehicles then operate with agency to complete these objectives, meaning
low-level behaviors need only be controlled if necessary. We perform
experiments with three state-of-the-art methods to create baselines and
highlight the affordances of this environment. Finally, we highlight challenges

                                        <span>Previous methods for skeleton-based gesture recognition mostly arrange the
skeleton sequence into a pseudo picture or spatial-temporal graph and apply
deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
for feature extraction. Although achieving superior results, these methods have
inherent limitations in dynamically capturing local features of interactive
hand parts, and the computing efficiency still remains a serious issue. In this
work, the self-attention mechanism is introduced to alleviate this problem.
Considering the hierarchical structure of hand joints, we propose an efficient
hierarchical self-attention network (HAN) for skeleton-based gesture
recognition, which is based on pure self-attention without any CNN, RNN or GCN
operators. Specifically, the joint self-attention module is used to capture
spatial features of fingers, the finger self-attention module is designed to
aggregate features of the whole hand. In terms of temporal features, the
temporal self-attention module is utilized to capture the temporal dynamics of
the fingers and the entire hand. Finally, these features are fused by the
fusion self-attention module for gesture classification. Experiments show that
our method achieves competitive results on three gesture recognition datasets
with much lower computational complexity.</span>

                                        <span>Physics perception very often faces the problem that only limited data or
partial measurements on the scene are available. In this work, we propose a
strategy to learn the full state of sloshing liquids from measurements of the
free surface. Our approach is based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) that
project the limited information available to a reduced-order manifold so as to
not only reconstruct the unknown information, but also to be capable of
performing fluid reasoning about future scenarios in real time. To obtain
physically consistent predictions, we train deep neural networks on the
reduced-order manifold that, through the employ of inductive biases, ensure the
fulfillment of the principles of thermodynamics. RNNs learn from history the
required hidden information to correlate the limited information with the
latent space where the simulation occurs. Finally, a decoder returns data back
to the high-dimensional manifold, so as to provide the user with insightful
information in the form of augmented reality. This algorithm is connected to a
computer vision system to test the performance of the proposed methodology with
real information, resulting in a system capable of understanding and predicting
future states of the observed fluid in real-time.</span>

                                        <span>Previous blind or No Reference (NR) video quality assessment (VQA) models
largely rely on features drawn from natural scene statistics (NSS), but under
the assumption that the image statistics are stationary in the spatial domain.
Several of these models are quite successful on standard pictures. However, in
Virtual Reality (VR) applications, foveated video compression is regaining
attention, and the concept of space-variant quality assessment is of interest,
given the availability of increasingly high spatial and temporal resolution
contents and practical ways of measuring gaze direction. Distortions from
foveated video compression increase with increased eccentricity, implying that
the natural scene statistics are space-variant. Towards advancing the
development of foveated compression / streaming algorithms, we have devised a
no-reference (NR) foveated video quality assessment model, called FOVQA, which
is based on new models of space-variant natural scene statistics (NSS) and
natural video statistics (NVS). Specifically, we deploy a space-variant
generalized Gaussian distribution (SV-GGD) model and a space-variant
asynchronous generalized Gaussian distribution (SV-AGGD) model of mean
subtracted contrast normalized (MSCN) coefficients and products of neighboring
MSCN coefficients, respectively. We devise a foveated video quality predictor
that extracts radial basis features, and other features that capture
perceptually annoying rapid quality fall-offs. We find that FOVQA achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the new 2D LIVE-FBT-FCVR database, as
compared with other leading FIQA / VQA models. we have made our implementation
of FOVQA available at: this http URL</span>

                                        <span>The application of infrared hyperspectral imagery to geological problems is
becoming more popular as data become more accessible and cost-effective.
Clustering and classifying spectrally similar materials is often a first step
in applications ranging from economic mineral exploration on Earth to planetary
exploration on Mars. Semi-manual classification guided by expertly developed
spectral parameters can be time consuming and biased, while supervised methods
require abundant labeled data and can be difficult to generalize. Here we
develop a fully unsupervised workflow for feature extraction and clustering
informed by both expert spectral geologist input and quantitative metrics. Our
pipeline uses a lightweight autoencoder followed by Gaussian mixture modeling
to map the spectral diversity within any image. We validate the performance of
our pipeline at submillimeter-scale with expert-labelled data from the Oman
ophiolite drill core and evaluate performance at meters-scale with partially
classified orbital data of Jezero Crater on Mars (the landing site for the
Perseverance rover). We additionally examine the effects of various
preprocessing techniques used in traditional analysis of hyperspectral imagery.
This pipeline provides a fast and accurate clustering map of similar geological
materials and consistently identifies and separates major mineral classes in
both laboratory imagery and remote sensing imagery. We refer to our pipeline as
&quot;Generalized Pipeline for Spectroscopic Unsupervised clustering of Minerals
(GyPSUM).&quot;</span>

                                        <span>Advanced machine learning techniques have been used in remote sensing (RS)
applications such as crop mapping and yield prediction, but remain
under-utilized for tracking crop progress. In this study, we demonstrate the
use of agronomic knowledge of crop growth drivers in a Long Short-Term
Memory-based, Domain-guided neural network (DgNN) for in-season crop progress
estimation. The DgNN uses a branched structure and attention to separate
independent crop growth drivers and capture their varying importance throughout
the growing season. The DgNN is implemented for corn, using RS data in Iowa for
the period 2003-2019, with USDA crop progress reports used as ground truth.
State-wide DgNN performance shows significant improvement over sequential and
dense-only NN structures, and a widely-used Hidden Markov Model method. The
DgNN had a 3.5% higher Nash-Sutfliffe efficiency over all growth stages and 33%
more weeks with highest cosine similarity than the other NNs during test years.
The DgNN and Sequential NN were more robust during periods of abnormal crop
progress, though estimating the Silking-Grainfill transition was difficult for
all methods. Finally, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
visualizations of layer activations showed how LSTM-based NNs separate crop
growth time-series differently from a dense-only structure. Results from this
study exhibit both the viability of NNs in crop growth stage estimation (CGSE)
and the benefits of using domain knowledge. The DgNN methodology presented here
can be extended to provide near-real time CGSE of other crops.</span>

                                        <span>Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire has frequently been used for
efficient depression preliminary screening. However, the uncontrollable
self-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively
answering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically,
facial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered
evaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered
evaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to
evidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding
question-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the
SDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical
framework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on
the questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a
hierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern
exploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for
question-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term
FE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of
each video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative
information and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity.
Then, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire
scores for final depression detection. Our thorough evaluations also show the
validity of fusing SDS evaluation and its video recording, and the superiority
of our framework to the conventional state-of-the-art temporal modeling
methods.</span>

                                        <span>Generalising deep models to new data from new centres (termed here domains)
remains a challenge. This is largely attributed to shifts in data statistics
(domain shifts) between source and unseen domains. Recently, gradient-based
meta-learning approaches where the training data are split into meta-train and
meta-test sets to simulate and handle the domain shifts during training have
shown improved generalisation performance. However, the current fully
supervised meta-learning approaches are not scalable for medical image
segmentation, where large effort is required to create pixel-wise annotations.
Meanwhile, in a low data regime, the simulated domain shifts may not
approximate the true domain shifts well across source and unseen domains. To
address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised meta-learning
framework with disentanglement. We explicitly model the representations related
to domain shifts. Disentangling the representations and combining them to
reconstruct the input image allows unlabeled data to be used to better
approximate the true domain shifts for meta-learning. Hence, the model can
achieve better generalisation performance, especially when there is a limited
amount of labeled data. Experiments show that the proposed method is robust on
different segmentation tasks and achieves state-of-the-art generalisation
performance on two public benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>How far can we go with textual representations for understanding pictures? In
image understanding, it is essential to use concise but detailed image
representations. Deep visual features extracted by vision models, such as
Faster R-CNN, are prevailing used in multiple tasks, and especially in visual
question answering (VQA). However, conventional deep visual features may
struggle to convey all the details in an image as we humans do. Meanwhile, with
recent language models&#x27; progress, descriptive text may be an alternative to
this problem. This paper delves into the effectiveness of textual
representations for image understanding in the specific context of VQA. We
propose to take description-question pairs as input, instead of deep visual
features, and fed them into a language-only Transformer model, simplifying the
process and the computational cost. We also experiment with data augmentation
techniques to increase the diversity in the training set and avoid learning
statistical bias. Extensive evaluations have shown that textual representations
require only about a hundred words to compete with deep visual features on both
VQA 2.0 and VQA-CP v2.</span>

methods in the last few decades, current navigation agents struggle at
long-term semantic navigation tasks. In the first part of the thesis, we
discuss our work on short-term navigation using end-to-end reinforcement
learning to tackle challenges such as obstacle avoidance, semantic perception,
language grounding, and reasoning. In the second part, we present a new class
of navigation methods based on modular learning and structured explicit map
representations, which leverage the strengths of both classical and end-to-end
learning methods, to tackle long-term navigation tasks. We show that these
methods are able to effectively tackle challenges such as localization,
mapping, long-term planning, exploration and learning semantic priors. These
modular learning methods are capable of long-term spatial and semantic
understanding and achieve state-of-the-art results on various navigation tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Conventional saliency prediction models typically learn a deterministic
mapping from images to the corresponding ground truth saliency maps. In this
paper, we study the saliency prediction problem from the perspective of
generative models by learning a conditional probability distribution over
saliency maps given an image, and treating the prediction as a sampling
process. Specifically, we propose a generative cooperative saliency prediction
framework based on the generative cooperative networks, where a conditional
latent variable model and a conditional energy-based model are jointly trained
to predict saliency in a cooperative manner. We call our model the SalCoopNets.
The latent variable model serves as a fast but coarse predictor to efficiently
produce an initial prediction, which is then refined by the iterative Langevin
revision of the energy-based model that serves as a fine predictor. Such a
coarse-to-fine cooperative saliency prediction strategy offers the best of both
worlds. Moreover, we generalize our framework to the scenario of weakly
supervised saliency prediction, where saliency annotation of training images is
partially observed, by proposing a cooperative learning while recovering
strategy. Lastly, we show that the learned energy function can serve as a
refinement module that can refine the results of other pre-trained saliency
prediction models. Experimental results show that our generative model can
achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our code is publicly available at:

                                        <span>Video Question Answering (Video QA) is a powerful testbed to develop new AI
capabilities. This task necessitates learning to reason about objects,
relations, and events across visual and linguistic domains in space-time.
High-level reasoning demands lifting from associative visual pattern
recognition to symbol-like manipulation over objects, their behavior and
interactions. Toward reaching this goal we propose an object-oriented reasoning
approach in that video is abstracted as a dynamic stream of interacting
objects. At each stage of the video event flow, these objects interact with
each other, and their interactions are reasoned about with respect to the query
and under the overall context of a video. This mechanism is materialized into a
family of general-purpose neural units and their multi-level architecture
called Hierarchical Object-oriented Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (HOSTR) networks.
This neural model maintains the objects&#x27; consistent lifelines in the form of a
hierarchically nested spatio-temporal graph. Within this graph, the dynamic
interactive object-oriented representations are built up along the video
sequence, hierarchically abstracted in a bottom-up manner, and converge toward
the key information for the correct answer. The method is evaluated on multiple
major Video QA datasets and establishes new state-of-the-arts in these tasks.
Analysis into the model&#x27;s behavior indicates that object-oriented reasoning is
a reliable, interpretable and efficient approach to Video QA.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we address the problem of high performance and computationally
efficient content-based video retrieval in large-scale datasets. Current
methods typically propose either: (i) fine-grained approaches employing
spatio-temporal representations and similarity calculations, achieving high
performance at a high computational cost or (ii) coarse-grained approaches
representing/indexing videos as global vectors, where the spatio-temporal
structure is lost, providing low performance but also having low computational
cost. In this work, we propose a Knowledge Distillation framework, which we
call Distill-and-Select (DnS), that starting from a well-performing
fine-grained Teacher Network learns: a) Student Networks at different retrieval
performance and computational efficiency trade-offs and b) a Selection Network
that at test time rapidly directs samples to the appropriate student to
maintain both high retrieval performance and high computational efficiency. We
train several students with different architectures and arrive at different
trade-offs of performance and efficiency, i.e., speed and storage requirements,
including fine-grained students that store index videos using binary
representations. Importantly, the proposed scheme allows Knowledge Distillation
in large, unlabelled datasets -- this leads to good students. We evaluate DnS
on five public datasets on three different video retrieval tasks and
demonstrate a) that our students achieve state-of-the-art performance in
several cases and b) that our DnS framework provides an excellent trade-off
between retrieval performance, computational speed, and storage space. In
specific configurations, our method achieves similar mAP with the teacher but
is 20 times faster and requires 240 times less storage space. Our collected
dataset and implementation are publicly available:

                                        <span>One-class learning is the classic problem of fitting a model to the data for
which annotations are available only for a single class. In this paper, we
explore novel objectives for one-class learning, which we collectively refer to
as Generalized One-class Discriminative Subspaces (GODS). Our key idea is to
learn a pair of complementary classifiers to flexibly bound the one-class data
distribution, where the data belongs to the positive half-space of one of the
classifiers in the complementary pair and to the negative half-space of the
other. To avoid redundancy while allowing non-linearity in the classifier
decision surfaces, we propose to design each classifier as an orthonormal frame
and seek to learn these frames via jointly optimizing for two conflicting
objectives, namely: i) to minimize the distance between the two frames, and ii)
to maximize the margin between the frames and the data. The learned orthonormal
frames will thus characterize a piecewise linear decision surface that allows
for efficient inference, while our objectives seek to bound the data within a
minimal volume that maximizes the decision margin, thereby robustly capturing
the data distribution. We explore several variants of our formulation under
different constraints on the constituent classifiers, including kernelized
feature maps. We demonstrate the empirical benefits of our approach via
experiments on data from several applications in computer vision, such as
anomaly detection in video sequences, human poses, and human activities. We
also explore the generality and effectiveness of GODS for non-vision tasks via
experiments on several UCI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.</span>

allows interactive free-viewpoint navigation. Our method allows illumination to
be changed synthetically, while coherently rendering cast shadows and complex
glossy materials. We start with multiple images of the scene and a 3D mesh
obtained by multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction. We assume that lighting is
well-explained as the sum of a view-independent diffuse component and a
view-dependent glossy term concentrated around the mirror reflection direction.
We design a convolutional network around input feature maps that facilitate
learning of an implicit representation of scene materials and illumination,
enabling both relighting and free-viewpoint navigation. We generate these input
maps by exploiting the best elements of both image-based and physically-based
rendering. We sample the input views to estimate diffuse scene irradiance, and
compute the new illumination caused by user-specified light sources using path
tracing. To facilitate the network&#x27;s understanding of materials and synthesize
plausible glossy reflections, we reproject the views and compute mirror images.
We train the network on a synthetic dataset where each scene is also
reconstructed with MVS. We show results of our algorithm relighting real indoor
scenes and performing free-viewpoint navigation with complex and realistic
glossy reflections, which so far remained out of reach for view-synthesis
techniques.</span>

depending on multiple local clients, while keeping the training data
decentralized in order to preserve data privacy. However, standard FL methods
ignore the noisy client issue, which may harm the overall performance of the
aggregated model. In this paper, we first analyze the noisy client statement,
and then model noisy clients with different noise distributions (e.g.,
Bernoulli and truncated Gaussian distributions). To learn with noisy clients,
we propose a simple yet effective FL framework, named Federated Noisy Client
Learning (Fed-NCL), which is a plug-and-play algorithm and contains two main
components: a data quality measurement (DQM) to dynamically quantify the data
quality of each participating client, and a noise robust aggregation (NRA) to
adaptively aggregate the local models of each client by jointly considering the
amount of local training data and the data quality of each client. Our Fed-NCL
can be easily applied in any standard FL workflow to handle the noisy client
issue. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our algorithm
boosts the performances of different state-of-the-art systems with noisy

                                        <span>Retrieval is a crucial stage in web search that identifies a small set of
query-relevant candidates from a billion-scale corpus. Discovering more
semantically-related candidates in the retrieval stage is very promising to
expose more high-quality results to the end users. However, it still remains
non-trivial challenges of building and deploying effective retrieval models for
semantic matching in real search engine. In this paper, we describe the
retrieval system that we developed and deployed in Baidu Search. The system
exploits the recent state-of-the-art Chinese pretrained language model, namely
Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration (ERNIE), which
facilitates the system with expressive semantic matching. In particular, we
developed an ERNIE-based retrieval model, which is equipped with 1) expressive
Transformer-based semantic encoders, and 2) a comprehensive multi-stage
training paradigm. More importantly, we present a practical system workflow for
deploying the model in web-scale retrieval. Eventually, the system is fully
deployed into production, where rigorous offline and online experiments were
conducted. The results show that the system can perform high-quality candidate
retrieval, especially for those tail queries with uncommon demands. Overall,
the new retrieval system facilitated by pretrained language model (i.e., ERNIE)
can largely improve the usability and applicability of our search engine.</span>

                                        <span>Session-based recommendation aims at predicting the next item given a
sequence of previous items consumed in the session, e.g., on e-commerce or
multimedia streaming services. Specifically, session data exhibits some unique
characteristics, i.e., session consistency and sequential dependency over items
within the session, repeated item consumption, and session timeliness. In this
paper, we propose simple-yet-effective linear models for considering the
holistic aspects of the sessions. The comprehensive nature of our models helps
improve the quality of session-based recommendation. More importantly, it
provides a generalized framework for reflecting different perspectives of
session data. Furthermore, since our models can be solved by closed-form
solutions, they are highly scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed linear models show competitive or state-of-the-art performance in
various metrics on several real-world datasets.</span>

data and keywords over the years. This searching and indexing works well when
user/reader already knows about that particular creative textual artefact or
document. This indexing and search hardly takes into account interest and
emotional makeup of readers and its mapping to books. When a person is looking
for a literary textual artefact, he/she might be looking for not only
information but also to seek the joy of reading. In case of literary artefacts,
progression of emotions across the key events could prove to be the key for
indexing and searching. In this paper, we establish clusters among literary
artefacts based on computational relationships among sentiment progressions
using intelligent text analysis. We have created a database of 1076 English
titles + 20 Marathi titles and also used database
this http URL with 16559 titles and their
summaries. We have proposed Sentiment Progression based Indexing for searching
and recommending books. This can be used to create personalized clusters of
book titles of interest to readers. The analysis clearly suggests better
searching and indexing when we are targeting book lovers looking for a
particular type of book or creative artefact. This indexing and searching can
find many real-life applications for recommending books.</span>

document-to-query relevance is estimated through predicting the matching score.
Drawing from the rich literature of classical generative retrieval models, we
introduce and formalize the paradigm of deep generative retrieval models
defined via the cumulative probabilities of generating query terms. This
paradigm offers a grounded probabilistic view on relevance estimation while
still enabling the use of modern neural architectures. In contrast to the
matching paradigm, the probabilistic nature of generative rankers readily
offers a fine-grained measure of uncertainty. We adopt several current neural
generative models in our framework and introduce a novel generative ranker
(T-PGN), which combines the encoding capacity of Transformers with the Pointer
Generator Network model. We conduct an extensive set of evaluation experiments
on passage retrieval, leveraging the MS MARCO Passage Re-ranking and TREC Deep
Learning 2019 Passage Re-ranking collections. Our results show the
significantly higher performance of the T-PGN model when compared with other
generative models. Lastly, we demonstrate that exploiting the uncertainty
information of deep generative rankers opens new perspectives to
query/collection understanding, and significantly improves the cut-off
prediction task.</span>

users and communities at great risk via social media platforms. Deep learning
based models show good performance when trained on large amounts of labeled
data on events of interest, whereas the performance of models tends to degrade
on other events due to domain shift. Therefore, significant challenges are
posed for existing detection approaches to detect fake news on emergent events,
where large-scale labeled datasets are difficult to obtain. Moreover, adding
the knowledge from newly emergent events requires to build a new model from
scratch or continue to fine-tune the model, which can be challenging,
expensive, and unrealistic for real-world settings. In order to address those
challenges, we propose an end-to-end fake news detection framework named
MetaFEND, which is able to learn quickly to detect fake news on emergent events
with a few verified posts. Specifically, the proposed model integrates
meta-learning and neural process methods together to enjoy the benefits of
these approaches. In particular, a label embedding module and a hard attention
mechanism are proposed to enhance the effectiveness by handling categorical
information and trimming irrelevant posts. Extensive experiments are conducted
on multimedia datasets collected from Twitter and Weibo. The experimental
results show our proposed MetaFEND model can detect fake news on never-seen
events effectively and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

satisfying users&#x27; information demands. More recently, neural rankers fine-tuned
from pre-trained language models (PLMs) establish state-of-the-art ranking
effectiveness. However, it is nontrivial to directly apply these PLM-based
rankers to the large-scale web search system due to the following challenging
issues:(1) the prohibitively expensive computations of massive neural PLMs,
especially for long texts in the web-document, prohibit their deployments in an
online ranking system that demands extremely low latency;(2) the discrepancy
between existing ranking-agnostic pre-training objectives and the ad-hoc
retrieval scenarios that demand comprehensive relevance modeling is another
main barrier for improving the online ranking system;(3) a real-world search
engine typically involves a committee of ranking components, and thus the
compatibility of the individually fine-tuned ranking model is critical for a
cooperative ranking system. In this work, we contribute a series of
successfully applied techniques in tackling these exposed issues when deploying
the state-of-the-art Chinese pre-trained language model, i.e., ERNIE, in the
online search engine system. We first articulate a novel practice to
cost-efficiently summarize the web document and contextualize the resultant
summary content with the query using a cheap yet powerful Pyramid-ERNIE
architecture. Then we endow an innovative paradigm to finely exploit the
large-scale noisy and biased post-click behavioral data for relevance-oriented
pre-training. We also propose a human-anchored fine-tuning strategy tailored
for the online ranking system, aiming to stabilize the ranking signals across
various online components. Extensive offline and online experimental results
show that the proposed techniques significantly boost the search engine&#x27;s
performance.</span>

discrimination possibly caused by traditional recommenders. In Interactive
Recommender Systems (IRS), user preferences and the system&#x27;s fairness status
are constantly changing over time. Existing fairness-aware recommenders mainly
consider fairness in static settings. Directly applying existing methods to IRS
will result in poor recommendation. To resolve this problem, we propose a
reinforcement learning based framework, FairRec, to dynamically maintain a
long-term balance between accuracy and fairness in IRS. User preferences and
the system&#x27;s fairness status are jointly compressed into the state

news feeds are streamingly updated, where each chunk of documents is
incorporated with smoothly evolving yet dependent topics. Such digital texts
have attracted extensive research on dynamic topic modeling to infer hidden
evolving topics and their temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing
approaches focus on single-topic-thread evolution and ignore the fact that a
current topic may be coupled with multiple relevant prior topics. In addition,
these approaches also incur the intractable inference problem when inferring
latent parameters, resulting in a high computational cost and performance
degradation. In this work, we assume that a current topic evolves from all
prior topics with corresponding coupling weights, forming the
multi-topic-thread evolution. Our method models the dependencies between
evolving topics and thoroughly encodes their complex multi-couplings across
time steps. To conquer the intractable inference challenge, a new solution with
a set of novel data augmentation techniques is proposed, which successfully
discomposes the multi-couplings between evolving topics. A fully conjugate
model is thus obtained to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency of the
inference technique. A novel Gibbs sampler with a backward-forward filter
algorithm efficiently learns latent timeevolving parameters in a closed-form.
In addition, the latent Indian Buffet Process (IBP) compound distribution is
exploited to automatically infer the overall topic number and customize the
sparse topic proportions for each sequential document without bias. The
proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets against
the competitive baselines, demonstrating its superiority over the baselines in
terms of the low per-word perplexity, high coherent topics, and better document
time prediction.</span>

                                        <span>Spreadsheet table detection is the task of detecting all tables on a given
sheet and locating their respective ranges. Automatic table detection is a key
enabling technique and an initial step in spreadsheet data intelligence.
However, the detection task is challenged by the diversity of table structures
and table layouts on the spreadsheet. Considering the analogy between a cell
matrix as spreadsheet and a pixel matrix as image, and encouraged by the
successful application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in computer
vision, we have developed TableSense, a novel end-to-end framework for
spreadsheet table detection. First, we devise an effective cell featurization
scheme to better leverage the rich information in each cell; second, we develop
an enhanced convolutional neural network model for table detection to meet the
domain-specific requirement on precise table boundary detection; third, we
propose an effective uncertainty metric to guide an active learning based smart
sampling algorithm, which enables the efficient build-up of a training dataset
with 22,176 tables on 10,220 sheets with broad coverage of diverse table
structures and layouts. Our evaluation shows that TableSense is highly
effective with 91.3\% recall and 86.5\% precision in EoB-2 metric, a
significant improvement over both the current detection algorithm that are used
in commodity spreadsheet tools and state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks in computer vision.</span>

                                        <span>Information overload is a prevalent challenge in many high-value domains. A
prominent case in point is the explosion of the biomedical literature on
COVID-19, which swelled to hundreds of thousands of papers in a matter of
months. In general, biomedical literature expands by two papers every minute,
totalling over a million new papers every year. Search in the biomedical realm,
and many other vertical domains is challenging due to the scarcity of direct
supervision from click logs. Self-supervised learning has emerged as a
promising direction to overcome the annotation bottleneck. We propose a general
approach for vertical search based on domain-specific pretraining and present a
case study for the biomedical domain. Despite being substantially simpler and
not using any relevance labels for training or development, our method performs
comparably or better than the best systems in the official TREC-COVID
evaluation, a COVID-related biomedical search competition. Using distributed
computing in modern cloud infrastructure, our system can scale to tens of
millions of articles on PubMed and has been deployed as Microsoft Biomedical
Search, a new search experience for biomedical literature:

                                        <span>In this paper, we address the problem of high performance and computationally
efficient content-based video retrieval in large-scale datasets. Current
methods typically propose either: (i) fine-grained approaches employing
spatio-temporal representations and similarity calculations, achieving high
performance at a high computational cost or (ii) coarse-grained approaches
representing/indexing videos as global vectors, where the spatio-temporal
structure is lost, providing low performance but also having low computational
cost. In this work, we propose a Knowledge Distillation framework, which we
call Distill-and-Select (DnS), that starting from a well-performing
fine-grained Teacher Network learns: a) Student Networks at different retrieval
performance and computational efficiency trade-offs and b) a Selection Network
that at test time rapidly directs samples to the appropriate student to
maintain both high retrieval performance and high computational efficiency. We
train several students with different architectures and arrive at different
trade-offs of performance and efficiency, i.e., speed and storage requirements,
including fine-grained students that store index videos using binary
representations. Importantly, the proposed scheme allows Knowledge Distillation
in large, unlabelled datasets -- this leads to good students. We evaluate DnS
on five public datasets on three different video retrieval tasks and
demonstrate a) that our students achieve state-of-the-art performance in
several cases and b) that our DnS framework provides an excellent trade-off
between retrieval performance, computational speed, and storage space. In
specific configurations, our method achieves similar mAP with the teacher but
is 20 times faster and requires 240 times less storage space. Our collected
dataset and implementation are publicly available:

deep ReLU networks for smooth functions in terms of both width and depth
simultaneously. To that end, we first prove that multivariate polynomials can
be approximated by deep ReLU networks of width $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and depth
$\mathcal{O}(L)$ with an approximation error $\mathcal{O}(N^{-L})$. Through
local Taylor expansions and their deep ReLU network approximations, we show
that deep ReLU networks of width $\mathcal{O}(N\ln N)$ and depth
$\mathcal{O}(L\ln L)$ can approximate $f\in C^s([0,1]^d)$ with a nearly optimal
approximation error $\mathcal{O}(\|f\|_{C^s([0,1]^d)}N^{-2s/d}L^{-2s/d})$. Our
estimate is non-asymptotic in the sense that it is valid for arbitrary width
and depth specified by $N\in\mathbb{N}^+$ and $L\in\mathbb{N}^+$, respectively.</span>

implementations, training, and evaluation has made fair and thorough
comparisons difficult. In order to assess the reproducibility of previously
published results, we re-implemented and evaluated 21 interaction models in the
PyKEEN software package. Here, we outline which results could be reproduced
with their reported hyper-parameters, which could only be reproduced with
alternate hyper-parameters, and which could not be reproduced at all as well as
provide insight as to why this might be the case.

We then performed a large-scale benchmarking on four datasets with several
thousands of experiments and 24,804 GPU hours of computation time. We present
insights gained as to best practices, best configurations for each model, and
where improvements could be made over previously published best configurations.
Our results highlight that the combination of model architecture, training
approach, loss function, and the explicit modeling of inverse relations is
crucial for a model&#x27;s performances, and not only determined by the model
architecture. We provide evidence that several architectures can obtain results
competitive to the state-of-the-art when configured carefully. We have made all

                                        <span>Our goal is to perform out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, i.e., to detect
when a robot is operating in environments that are drawn from a different
distribution than the environments used to train the robot. We leverage
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes theory in order to train a policy
with a guaranteed bound on performance on the training distribution. Our key
idea for OOD detection then relies on the following intuition: violation of the
performance bound on test environments provides evidence that the robot is
operating OOD. We formalize this via statistical techniques based on p-values
and concentration inequalities. The resulting approach (i) provides guaranteed
confidence bounds on OOD detection, and (ii) is task-driven and sensitive only
to changes that impact the robot&#x27;s performance. We demonstrate our approach on
a simulated example of grasping objects with unfamiliar poses or shapes. We
also present both simulation and hardware experiments for a drone performing
vision-based obstacle avoidance in unfamiliar environments (including wind
disturbances and different obstacle densities). Our examples demonstrate that
we can perform task-driven OOD detection within just a handful of trials.
Comparisons with baselines also demonstrate the advantages of our approach in
terms of providing statistical guarantees and being insensitive to
task-irrelevant distribution shifts.</span>

                                        <span>Stochastic nested optimization, including stochastic compositional, min-max
and bilevel optimization, is gaining popularity in many machine learning
applications. While the three problems share the nested structure, existing
works often treat them separately, and thus develop problem-specific algorithms
and their analyses. Among various exciting developments, simple SGD-type
updates (potentially on multiple variables) are still prevalent in solving this
class of nested problems, but they are believed to have slower convergence rate
compared to that of the non-nested problems. This paper unifies several
SGD-type updates for stochastic nested problems into a single SGD approach that
we term ALternating Stochastic gradient dEscenT (ALSET) method. By leveraging
the hidden smoothness of the problem, this paper presents a tighter analysis of
ALSET for stochastic nested problems. Under the new analysis, to achieve an
$\epsilon$-stationary point of the nested problem, it requires ${\cal
O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples. Under certain regularity conditions, applying our
results to stochastic compositional, min-max and reinforcement learning
problems either improves or matches the best-known sample complexity in the
respective cases. Our results explain why simple SGD-type algorithms in

                                        <span>A high efficiency hardware integration of neural networks benefits from
realizing nonlinearity, network connectivity and learning fully in a physical
substrate. Multiple systems have recently implemented some or all of these
operations, yet the focus was placed on addressing technological challenges.
Fundamental questions regarding learning in hardware neural networks remain
largely unexplored. Noise in particular is unavoidable in such architectures,
and here we investigate its interaction with a learning algorithm using an
opto-electronic recurrent neural network. We find that noise strongly modifies
the system&#x27;s path during convergence, and surprisingly fully decorrelates the
final readout weight matrices. This highlights the importance of understanding
architecture, noise and learning algorithm as interacting players, and
therefore identifies the need for mathematical tools for noisy, analogue system
optimization.</span>

on -- and is a stronger version of -- the observation in Nakkiran &amp; Bansal &#x27;20,

                                        <span>Mean field games (MFG) and mean field control problems (MFC) are frameworks
to study Nash equilibria or social optima in games with a continuum of agents.
These problems can be used to approximate competitive or cooperative games with
a large finite number of agents and have found a broad range of applications,
in particular in economics. In recent years, the question of learning in MFG
and MFC has garnered interest, both as a way to compute solutions and as a way
to model how large populations of learners converge to an equilibrium. Of
particular interest is the setting where the agents do not know the model,
which leads to the development of reinforcement learning (RL) methods. After
reviewing the literature on this topic, we present a two timescale approach
with RL for MFG and MFC, which relies on a unified Q-learning algorithm. The
main novelty of this method is to simultaneously update an action-value
function and a distribution but with different rates, in a model-free fashion.
Depending on the ratio of the two learning rates, the algorithm learns either
the MFG or the MFC solution. To illustrate this method, we apply it to a mean
field problem of accumulated consumption in finite horizon with HARA utility
function, and to a trader&#x27;s optimal liquidation problem.</span>

The assessment of the impact of lockdown on air quality focused on four

factors were obtained using global satellite observations. The level of the
employed prevention measures is employed using the Oxford COVID-19 Government

                                        <span>Temporally and spatially dependent uncertain parameters are regularly
encountered in engineering applications. Commonly these uncertainties are
accounted for using random fields and processes which require knowledge about
the appearing probability distributions functions which is not readily
available. In these cases non-probabilistic approaches such as interval
analysis and fuzzy set theory are helpful uncertainty measures. Partial
differential equations involving fuzzy and interval fields are traditionally
solved using the finite element method where the input fields are sampled using
some basis function expansion methods. This approach however is problematic, as
it is reliant on knowledge about the spatial correlation fields. In this work
we utilize physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve interval and fuzzy
partial differential equations. The resulting network structures termed
interval physics-informed neural networks (iPINNs) and fuzzy physics-informed
neural networks (fPINNs) show promising results for obtaining bounded solutions
of equations involving spatially uncertain parameter fields. In contrast to
finite element approaches, no correlation length specification of the input
fields as well as no averaging via Monte-Carlo simulations are necessary. In
fact, information about the input interval fields is obtained directly as a
byproduct of the presented solution scheme. Furthermore, all major advantages
of PINNs are retained, i.e. meshfree nature of the scheme, and ease of inverse
problem set-up.</span>

where the reward distribution changes if a collision occurs on the arm.
Existing literature always assumes a zero reward for involved players if
collision happens, but for applications such as cognitive radio, the more
realistic scenario is that collision reduces the mean reward but not
necessarily to zero. We focus on the more practical no-sensing setting where
players do not perceive collisions directly, and propose the Error-Correction
Collision Communication (EC3) algorithm that models implicit communication as a
reliable communication over noisy channel problem, for which random coding
error exponent is used to establish the optimal regret that no communication
protocol can beat. Finally, optimizing the tradeoff between code length and
decoding error rate leads to a regret that approaches the centralized MP-MAB
regret, which represents a natural lower bound. Experiments with practical
error-correction codes on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
the superiority of EC3. In particular, the results show that the choice of
coding schemes has a profound impact on the regret performance.</span>

automatically on a daily basis by mutation engines that transform the code of a
malicious program while retaining its functionality, in order to evade
signature-based detection. These automatic processes have greatly increased the
number of malware variants, deeming their fully-manual analysis impossible.
Malware classification is the task of determining to which family a new
malicious variant belongs. Variants of the same malware family show similar
behavioral patterns. Thus, classifying newly discovered malicious programs and
applications helps assess the risks they pose. Moreover, malware classification
facilitates determining which of the newly discovered variants should undergo
manual analysis by a security expert, in order to determine whether they belong
to a new family (e.g., one whose members exploit a zero-day vulnerability) or
are simply the result of a concept drift within a known malicious family. This
motivated intense research in recent years on devising high-accuracy automatic
tools for malware classification. In this work, we present DAEMON - a novel
dataset-agnostic malware classifier. A key property of DAEMON is that the type
of features it uses and the manner in which they are mined facilitate
understanding the distinctive behavior of malware families, making its
classification decisions explainable. We&#x27;ve optimized DAEMON using a
large-scale dataset of x86 binaries, belonging to a mix of several malware
families targeting computers running Windows. We then re-trained it and applied
it, without any algorithmic change, feature re-engineering or parameter tuning,
to two other large-scale datasets of malicious Android applications consisting
of numerous malware families. DAEMON obtained highly accurate classification
results on all datasets, establishing that it is also platform-agnostic.</span>

learning of state observers that are: robust to modeling error, computationally
tractable to design, and capable of operating with guaranteed performance. In
this paper, a modular design methodology is formulated, that consists of three
design phases: (i) an initial robust observer design that enables one to learn
the dynamics without allowing the state estimation error to diverge (hence,
safe); (ii) a learning phase wherein the unmodeled components are estimated
using Bayesian optimization and Gaussian processes; and, (iii) a re-design
phase that leverages the learned dynamics to improve convergence rate of the
state estimation error. The potential of our proposed learning-based observer
is demonstrated on a benchmark nonlinear system. Additionally, certificates of
guaranteed estimation performance are provided.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in image synthesis enables one to translate images by
learning the mapping between a source domain and a target domain. Existing
methods tend to learn the distributions by training a model on a variety of
datasets, with results evaluated largely in a subjective manner. Relatively few
works in this area, however, study the potential use of semantic image
translation methods for image recognition tasks. In this paper, we explore the
use of Single Image Texture Translation (SITT) for data augmentation. We first
propose a lightweight model for translating texture to images based on a single
input of source texture, allowing for fast training and testing. Based on SITT,
we then explore the use of augmented data in long-tailed and few-shot image
classification tasks. We find the proposed method is capable of translating
input data into a target domain, leading to consistent improved image
recognition performance. Finally, we examine how SITT and related image
translation methods can provide a basis for a data-efficient, augmentation
engineering approach to model training.</span>

Identifying the disease-causing mutations from millions of genetic variants
within an individual patient is a challenging problem. Computational methods
which can prioritize disease-causing mutations have, therefore, enormous
applications. It is well-known that genes function through a complex regulatory
network. However, existing variant effect prediction models only consider a
variant in isolation. In contrast, we propose VEGN, which models variant effect
prediction using a graph neural network (GNN) that operates on a heterogeneous
graph with genes and variants. The graph is created by assigning variants to
genes and connecting genes with an gene-gene interaction network. In this
context, we explore an approach where a gene-gene graph is given and another
where VEGN learns the gene-gene graph and therefore operates both on given and
learnt edges. The graph neural network is trained to aggregate information
between genes, and between genes and variants. Variants can exchange
information via the genes they connect to. This approach improves the
performance of existing state-of-the-art models.</span>

a large number of papers innovating on the subject are published. However,
while most of these publications provide incremental improvements to existing
algorithms, they tend to be presented as new optimizers rather than composable
algorithms. Thus, many worthwhile improvements are rarely seen out of their
initial publication. Taking advantage of this untapped potential, we introduce
Ranger21, a new optimizer which combines AdamW with eight components, carefully
selected after reviewing and testing ideas from the literature. We found that
the resulting optimizer provides significantly improved validation accuracy and
training speed, smoother training curves, and is even able to train a ResNet50

require model simplifications, or use overly conservative surrogate models.
Neural networks can circumvent these limitations but are faced with high

uncertainty over weights and activations, and are trained using Bayesian
inference. Since these probabilistic layers are designed to be drop-in
replacement of their deterministic counter parts, Bayesian neural networks
provide a direct and natural way to extend conventional deep neural networks to
support probabilistic deep learning. However, it is nontrivial to understand,
design and train Bayesian neural networks due to their complexities. We discuss
the essentials of Bayesian neural networks including duality (deep neural
networks, probabilistic models), approximate Bayesian inference, Bayesian
priors, Bayesian posteriors, and deep variational learning. We use TensorFlow
Probability APIs and code examples for illustration. The main problem with
Bayesian neural networks is that the architecture of deep neural networks makes
it quite redundant, and costly, to account for uncertainty for a large number
of successive layers. Hybrid Bayesian neural networks, which use few
probabilistic layers judicially positioned in the networks, provide a practical
solution.</span>

of energy-based models that define a joint density over data and latent

have similar use cases as variational autoencoders, in the sense that they
learn an unsupervised mapping from data to latent variables. However, these

Federated Learning (FL). Recently, there has been a line of work on
incorporating the formal privacy notion of differential privacy with FL. To
guarantee the client-level differential privacy in FL algorithms, the clients&#x27;
transmitted model updates have to be clipped before adding privacy noise. Such
clipping operation is substantially different from its counterpart of gradient
clipping in the centralized differentially private SGD and has not been
well-understood. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate that the
clipped FedAvg can perform surprisingly well even with substantial data
heterogeneity when training neural networks, which is partly because the
clients&#x27; updates become similar for several popular deep architectures. Based
on this key observation, we provide the convergence analysis of a differential
private (DP) FedAvg algorithm and highlight the relationship between clipping
bias and the distribution of the clients&#x27; updates. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that rigorously investigates theoretical and
empirical issues regarding the clipping operation in FL algorithms.</span>

neural network that directly maps the outputs of a linear acoustic echo
canceler to the desired signal in the spectral domain. This system embeds a
design parameter that allows a tunable tradeoff between the desired-signal
distortion and residual echo suppression in double-talk scenarios. The system
employs 136 thousand parameters, and requires 1.6 Giga floating-point
operations per second and 10 Mega-bytes of memory. The implementation satisfies
both the timing requirements of the AEC challenge and the computational and
memory limitations of on-device applications. Experiments are conducted with
161~h of data from the AEC challenge database and from real independent
recordings. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed system in real-life
conditions and compare it with two competing methods regarding echo suppression
and desired-signal distortion, generalization to various environments, and
robustness to high echo levels.</span>

by using dataset and function descriptions while significantly decreasing
computation time from minutes to milliseconds by using a zero-shot approach.
Given a new dataset and a well-defined machine learning task, humans begin by
reading a description of the dataset and documentation for the algorithms to be
used. This work is the first to use these textual descriptions, which we call
privileged information, for AutoML. We use a pre-trained Transformer model to
process the privileged text and demonstrate that using this information
improves AutoML performance. Thus, our approach leverages the progress of
unsupervised representation learning in natural language processing to provide
a significant boost to AutoML. We demonstrate that using only textual
descriptions of the data and functions achieves reasonable classification
performance, and adding textual descriptions to data meta-features improves
classification across tabular datasets. To achieve zero-shot AutoML we train a
graph neural network with these description embeddings and the data
meta-features. Each node represents a training dataset, which we use to predict
the best machine learning pipeline for a new test dataset in a zero-shot
fashion. Our zero-shot approach rapidly predicts a high-quality pipeline for a
supervised learning task and dataset. In contrast, most AutoML systems require
tens or hundreds of pipeline evaluations. We show that zero-shot AutoML reduces
running and prediction times from minutes to milliseconds, consistently across
datasets. By speeding up AutoML by orders of magnitude this work demonstrates
real-time AutoML.</span>

                                        <span>The abundant sequential documents such as online archival, social media and
news feeds are streamingly updated, where each chunk of documents is
incorporated with smoothly evolving yet dependent topics. Such digital texts
have attracted extensive research on dynamic topic modeling to infer hidden
evolving topics and their temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing
approaches focus on single-topic-thread evolution and ignore the fact that a
current topic may be coupled with multiple relevant prior topics. In addition,
these approaches also incur the intractable inference problem when inferring
latent parameters, resulting in a high computational cost and performance
degradation. In this work, we assume that a current topic evolves from all
prior topics with corresponding coupling weights, forming the
multi-topic-thread evolution. Our method models the dependencies between
evolving topics and thoroughly encodes their complex multi-couplings across
time steps. To conquer the intractable inference challenge, a new solution with
a set of novel data augmentation techniques is proposed, which successfully
discomposes the multi-couplings between evolving topics. A fully conjugate
model is thus obtained to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency of the
inference technique. A novel Gibbs sampler with a backward-forward filter
algorithm efficiently learns latent timeevolving parameters in a closed-form.
In addition, the latent Indian Buffet Process (IBP) compound distribution is
exploited to automatically infer the overall topic number and customize the
sparse topic proportions for each sequential document without bias. The
proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets against
the competitive baselines, demonstrating its superiority over the baselines in
terms of the low per-word perplexity, high coherent topics, and better document
time prediction.</span>

                                        <span>Building classifiers on multiple domains is a practical problem in the real
life. Instead of building classifiers one by one, multi-domain learning (MDL)
simultaneously builds classifiers on multiple domains. MDL utilizes the
information shared among the domains to improve the performance. As a
supervised learning problem, the labeling effort is still high in MDL problems.
Usually, this high labeling cost issue could be relieved by using active
learning. Thus, it is natural to utilize active learning to reduce the labeling
effort in MDL, and we refer this setting as multi-domain active learning
(MDAL). However, there are only few works which are built on this setting. And
when the researches have to face this problem, there is no off-the-shelf
solutions. Under this circumstance, combining the current multi-domain learning
models and single-domain active learning strategies might be a preliminary
solution for MDAL problem. To find out the potential of this preliminary
solution, a comparative study over 5 models and 4 selection strategies is made
in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work provides
the formal definition of MDAL. Besides, this is the first comparative work for
MDAL problem. From the results, the Multinomial Adversarial Networks (MAN)
model with a simple best vs second best (BvSB) uncertainty strategy shows its
superiority in most cases. We take this combination as our off-the-shelf
recommendation for the MDAL problem.</span>

hold great promise for engineering challenges ranging from gas separations to
catalysis, a lack of understanding of how to improve their stability limits
their use in practice. To overcome this limitation, we extract thousands of
published reports of the key aspects of MOF stability necessary for their
practical application: the ability to withstand high temperatures without
degrading and the capacity to be activated by removal of solvent molecules.
From nearly 4,000 manuscripts, we use natural language processing and automated
image analysis to obtain over 2,000 solvent-removal stability measures and
3,000 thermal degradation temperatures. We analyze the relationships between
stability properties and the chemical and geometric structures in this set to
identify limits of prior heuristics derived from smaller sets of MOFs. By
training predictive machine learning (ML, i.e., Gaussian process and artificial
neural network) models to encode the structure-property relationships with
graph- and pore-structure-based representations, we are able to make
predictions of stability orders of magnitude faster than conventional
physics-based modeling or experiment. Interpretation of important features in
ML models provides insights that we use to identify strategies to engineer
increased stability into typically unstable 3d-containing MOFs that are
frequently targeted for catalytic applications. We expect our approach to
accelerate the time to discovery of stable, practical MOF materials for a wide
range of applications.</span>

                                        <span>Time series forecasting based on deep architectures has been gaining
popularity in recent years due to their ability to model complex non-linear
temporal dynamics. The recurrent neural network is one such model capable of
handling variable-length input and output. In this paper, we leverage recent
advances in deep generative models and the concept of state space models to
propose a stochastic adaptation of the recurrent neural network for
multistep-ahead time series forecasting, which is trained with stochastic
gradient variational Bayes. In our model design, the transition function of the
recurrent neural network, which determines the evolution of the hidden states,
is stochastic rather than deterministic as in a regular recurrent neural
network; this is achieved by incorporating a latent random variable into the
transition process which captures the stochasticity of the temporal dynamics.
Our model preserves the architectural workings of a recurrent neural network
for which all relevant information is encapsulated in its hidden states, and
this flexibility allows our model to be easily integrated into any deep
architecture for sequential modelling. We test our model on a wide range of
datasets from finance to healthcare; results show that the stochastic recurrent
neural network consistently outperforms its deterministic counterpart.</span>

                                        <span>Various incremental learning (IL) approaches have been proposed to help deep
learning models learn new tasks/classes continuously without forgetting what
was learned previously (i.e., avoid catastrophic forgetting). With the growing
number of deployed audio sensing applications that need to dynamically
incorporate new tasks and changing input distribution from users, the ability
of IL on-device becomes essential for both efficiency and user privacy.

However, prior works suffer from high computational costs and storage demands
which hinders the deployment of IL on-device. In this work, to overcome these
limitations, we develop an end-to-end and on-device IL framework, FastICARL,
that incorporates an exemplar-based IL and quantization in the context of
audio-based applications. We first employ k-nearest-neighbor to reduce the
latency of IL. Then, we jointly utilize a quantization technique to decrease
the storage requirements of IL. We implement FastICARL on two types of mobile
devices and demonstrate that FastICARL remarkably decreases the IL time up to
78-92% and the storage requirements by 2-4 times without sacrificing its
performance. FastICARL enables complete on-device IL, ensuring user privacy as
the user data does not need to leave the device.</span>

                                        <span>We address the problem of inferring descriptions of system behavior using
Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) from a finite set of positive and negative
examples. Most of the existing approaches for solving such a task rely on
predefined templates for guiding the structure of the inferred formula. The
approaches that can infer arbitrary LTL formulas, on the other hand, are not
robust to noise in the data. To alleviate such limitations, we devise two
algorithms for inferring concise LTL formulas even in the presence of noise.
Our first algorithm infers minimal LTL formulas by reducing the inference
problem to a problem in maximum satisfiability and then using off-the-shelf
MaxSAT solvers to find a solution. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to incorporate the usage of MaxSAT solvers for inferring formulas in LTL.
Our second learning algorithm relies on the first algorithm to derive a
decision tree over LTL formulas based on a decision tree learning algorithm. We
have implemented both our algorithms and verified that our algorithms are
efficient in extracting concise LTL descriptions even in the presence of noise.</span>

networks (NNs), and their choice plays a predominant role in the performance of
a NN. In this work, we are particularly interested in the estimation of
flexible activation functions using tensor-based solutions, where the AFs are
expressed as a weighted sum of predefined basis functions. To do so, we propose
a new learning algorithm which solves a constrained coupled matrix-tensor
factorization (CMTF) problem. This technique fuses the first and zeroth order
information of the NN, where the first-order information is contained in a
Jacobian tensor, following a constrained canonical polyadic decomposition
(CPD). The proposed algorithm can handle different decomposition bases. The
goal of this method is to compress large pretrained NN models, by replacing
subnetworks, {\em i.e.,} one or multiple layers of the original network, by a
new flexible layer. The approach is applied to a pretrained convolutional

                                        <span>Structured stochastic multi-armed bandits provide accelerated regret rates
over the standard unstructured bandit problems. Most structured bandits,
however, assume the knowledge of the structural parameter such as Lipschitz
continuity, which is often not available. To cope with the latent structural
parameter, we consider a transfer learning setting in which an agent must learn
to transfer the structural information from the prior tasks to the next task,
which is inspired by practical problems such as rate adaptation in wireless
link. We propose a novel framework to provably and accurately estimate the
Lipschitz constant based on previous tasks and fully exploit it for the new
task at hand. We analyze the efficiency of the proposed framework in two folds:
(i) the sample complexity of our estimator matches with the
information-theoretic fundamental limit; and (ii) our regret bound on the new
task is close to that of the oracle algorithm with the full knowledge of the
Lipschitz constant under mild assumptions. Our analysis reveals a set of useful
insights on transfer learning for latent Lipschitzconstants such as the
fundamental challenge a learner faces. Our numerical evaluations confirm our
theoretical findings and show the superiority of the proposed framework
compared to baselines.</span>

wherein one must repeatedly make an appropriate choice from a set of
alternatives. Expert judgements, whether human or artificial, can help in
taking correct decisions, especially when exploration of alternative solutions
is costly. As expert opinions might deviate, the problem of finding the right
alternative can be approached as a collective decision making problem (CDM).
Current state-of-the-art approaches to solve CDM are limited by the quality of
the best expert in the group, and perform poorly if experts are not qualified
or if they are overly biased, thus potentially derailing the decision-making
process. In this paper, we propose a new algorithmic approach based on
contextual multi-armed bandit problems (CMAB) to identify and counteract such
biased expertises. We explore homogeneous, heterogeneous and polarised expert
groups and show that this approach is able to effectively exploit the
collective expertise, irrespective of whether the provided advice is directly
conducive to good performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods,
especially when the quality of the provided expertise degrades. Our novel
CMAB-inspired approach achieves a higher final performance and does so while
converging more rapidly than previous adaptive algorithms, especially when
heterogeneous expertise is readily available.</span>

employ some deep learning algorithms for detecting the presence of a specific
sound of interest. In this paper, we evaluate deep learning-based AED systems
against evasion attacks through adversarial examples. We run multiple security
critical AED tasks, implemented as CNNs classifiers, and then generate audio
adversarial examples using two different types of noise, namely background and
white noise, that can be used by the adversary to evade detection. We also
examine the robustness of existing third-party AED capable devices, such as
Nest devices manufactured by Google, which run their own black-box deep
learning models.

We show that an adversary can focus on audio adversarial inputs to cause AED
systems to misclassify, similarly to what has been previously done by works
focusing on adversarial examples from the image domain. We then, seek to
improve classifiers&#x27; robustness through countermeasures to the attacks. We
employ adversarial training and a custom denoising technique. We show that
these countermeasures, when applied to audio input, can be successful, either
in isolation or in combination, generating relevant increases of nearly fifty
percent in the performance of the classifiers when these are under attack.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, a mechanistic data-driven approach is proposed to accelerate
structural topology optimization, employing an in-house developed finite
element convolutional neural network (FE-CNN). Our approach can be divided into
two stages: offline training, and online optimization. During offline training,
a mapping function is built between high and low resolution representations of
a given design domain. The mapping is expressed by a FE-CNN, which targets a
common objective function value (e.g., structural compliance) across design
domains of differing resolutions. During online optimization, an arbitrary
design domain of high resolution is reduced to low resolution through the
trained mapping function. The original high-resolution domain is thus designed
by computations performed on only the low-resolution version, followed by an
inverse mapping back to the high-resolution domain. Numerical examples
demonstrate that this approach can accelerate optimization by up to an order of
magnitude in computational time. Our proposed approach therefore shows great
potential to overcome the curse-of-dimensionality incurred by density-based
structural topology optimization. The limitation of our present approach is
also discussed.</span>

(PPMM) algorithm for nonconvex tuning-free robust regression problems. The
basic idea is to apply the proximal majorization-minimization algorithm to
solve the nonconvex problem with the inner subproblems solved by a sparse
semismooth Newton (SSN) method based proximal point algorithm (PPA). We must
emphasize that the main difficulty in the design of the algorithm lies in how
to overcome the singular difficulty of the inner subproblem. Furthermore, we
also prove that the PPMM algorithm converges to a d-stationary point. Due to
the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property of the problem, we present the
convergence rate of the PPMM algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that

                                        <span>Self-supervised learning of graph neural networks (GNN) is in great need
because of the widespread label scarcity issue in real-world graph/network
data. Graph contrastive learning (GCL), by training GNNs to maximize the
correspondence between the representations of the same graph in its different
augmented forms, may yield robust and transferable GNNs even without using
labels. However, GNNs trained by traditional GCL often risk capturing redundant
graph features and thus may be brittle and provide sub-par performance in
downstream tasks. Here, we propose a novel principle, termed adversarial-GCL
(AD-GCL), which enables GNNs to avoid capturing redundant information during
the training by optimizing adversarial graph augmentation strategies used in
GCL. We pair AD-GCL with theoretical explanations and design a practical
instantiation based on trainable edge-dropping graph augmentation. We
experimentally validate AD-GCL by comparing with the state-of-the-art GCL
methods and achieve performance gains of up-to $14\%$ in unsupervised, $6\%$ in
transfer, and $3\%$ in semi-supervised learning settings overall with 18
different benchmark datasets for the tasks of molecule property regression and
classification, and social network classification.</span>

                                        <span>While multifidelity modeling provides a cost-effective way to conduct
uncertainty quantification with computationally expensive models, much greater
efficiency can be achieved by adaptively deciding the number of required
high-fidelity (HF) simulations, depending on the type and complexity of the
problem and the desired accuracy in the results. We propose a framework for
active learning with multifidelity modeling emphasizing the efficient
estimation of rare events. Our framework works by fusing a low-fidelity (LF)
prediction with an HF-inferred correction, filtering the corrected LF
prediction to decide whether to call the high-fidelity model, and for enhanced
subsequent accuracy, adapting the correction for the LF prediction after every
HF model call. The framework does not make any assumptions as to the LF model
type or its correlations with the HF model. In addition, for improved
robustness when estimating smaller failure probabilities, we propose using
dynamic active learning functions that decide when to call the HF model. We
demonstrate our framework using several academic case studies and two finite
element (FE) model case studies: estimating Navier-Stokes velocities using the
Stokes approximation and estimating stresses in a transversely isotropic model
subjected to displacements via a coarsely meshed isotropic model. Across these
case studies, not only did the proposed framework estimate the failure
probabilities accurately, but compared with either Monte Carlo or a standard
variance reduction method, it also required only a small fraction of the calls
to the HF model.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, bladder cancer has been significantly increased in terms of
incidence and mortality. Currently, two subtypes are known based on tumour
growth: non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).
In this work, we focus on the MIBC subtype because it is of the worst prognosis
and can spread to adjacent organs. We present a self-learning framework to
grade bladder cancer from histological images stained via immunohistochemical
techniques. Specifically, we propose a novel Deep Convolutional Embedded
Attention Clustering (DCEAC) which allows classifying histological patches into
different severity levels of the disease, according to the patterns established
in the literature. The proposed DCEAC model follows a two-step fully
unsupervised learning methodology to discern between non-tumour, mild and
infiltrative patterns from high-resolution samples of 512x512 pixels. Our
system outperforms previous clustering-based methods by including a
convolutional attention module, which allows refining the features of the
latent space before the classification stage. The proposed network exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches by 2-3% across different metrics, achieving a final
average accuracy of 0.9034 in a multi-class scenario. Furthermore, the reported
class activation maps evidence that our model is able to learn by itself the
same patterns that clinicians consider relevant, without incurring prior
annotation steps. This fact supposes a breakthrough in muscle-invasive bladder
cancer grading which bridges the gap with respect to train the model on
labelled data.</span>

minimizAtioN framework for non-smooth non-convex optimization problems. To the
best of our knowledge, TITAN is the first framework of block-coordinate update
method that relies on the majorization-minimization framework while embedding
inertial force to each step of the block updates. The inertial force is
obtained via an extrapolation operator that subsumes heavy-ball and
Nesterov-type accelerations for block proximal gradient methods as special
cases. By choosing various surrogate functions, such as proximal, Lipschitz
gradient, Bregman, quadratic, and composite surrogate functions, and by varying
the extrapolation operator, TITAN produces a rich set of inertial
block-coordinate update methods. We study sub-sequential convergence as well as
global convergence for the generated sequence of TITAN. We illustrate the
effectiveness of TITAN on two important machine learning problems, namely
sparse non-negative matrix factorization and matrix completion.</span>

sensitive to the search&#x27;s initial conditions. The absence of guarantees of
performance and robustness hinders trustworthiness. In this paper, we take a
disciplined approach towards counterfactual explanations for tree ensembles. We
advocate for a model-based search aiming at &quot;optimal&quot; explanations and propose
efficient mixed-integer programming approaches. We show that isolation forests
can be modeled within our framework to focus the search on plausible
explanations with a low outlier score. We provide comprehensive coverage of
additional constraints that model important objectives, heterogeneous data
types, structural constraints on the feature space, along with resource and
actionability restrictions. Our experimental analyses demonstrate that the
proposed search approach requires a computational effort that is orders of
magnitude smaller than previous mathematical programming algorithms. It scales
up to large data sets and tree ensembles, where it provides, within seconds,
systematic explanations grounded on well-defined models solved to optimality.</span>

                                        <span>Data augmentation is a key element of deep learning pipelines, as it informs
the network during training about transformations of the input data that keep
the label unchanged. Manually finding adequate augmentation methods and
parameters for a given pipeline is however rapidly cumbersome. In particular,
while intuition can guide this decision for images, the design and choice of
augmentation policies remains unclear for more complex types of data, such as
neuroscience signals. Moreover, label independent strategies might not be
suitable for such structured data and class-dependent augmentations might be
necessary. This idea has been surprisingly unexplored in the literature, while
it is quite intuitive: changing the color of a car image does not change the
object class to be predicted, but doing the same to the picture of an orange
does. This paper aims to increase the generalization power added through
class-wise data augmentation. Yet, as seeking transformations depending on the
class largely increases the complexity of the task, using gradient-free
optimization techniques as done by most existing automatic approaches becomes
intractable for real-world datasets. For this reason we propose to use
differentiable data augmentation amenable to gradient-based learning. EEG
signals are a perfect example of data for which good augmentation policies are
mostly unknown. In this work, we demonstrate the relevance of our approach on
the clinically relevant sleep staging classification task, for which we also
propose differentiable transformations.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks have recently shown great success in the task of blind
source separation, both under monaural and binaural settings. Although these
methods were shown to produce high-quality separations, they were mainly
applied under offline settings, in which the model has access to the full input
signal while separating the signal. In this study, we convert a non-causal
state-of-the-art separation model into a causal and real-time model and
evaluate its performance under both online and offline settings. We compare the
performance of the proposed model to several baseline methods under anechoic,
noisy, and noisy-reverberant recording conditions while exploring both monaural
and binaural inputs and outputs. Our findings shed light on the relative
difference between causal and non-causal models when performing separation. Our
stateful implementation for online separation leads to a minor drop in
performance compared to the offline model; 0.8dB for monaural inputs and 0.3dB
for binaural inputs while reaching a real-time factor of 0.65. Samples can be

                                        <span>Adversarial robustness has emerged as a desirable property for neural
networks. Prior work shows that robust networks perform well in some
out-of-distribution generalization tasks, such as transfer learning and outlier
detection. We uncover a different kind of out-of-distribution generalization
property of such networks, and find that they also do well in a task that we
call nearest category generalization (NCG) - given an out-of-distribution
input, they tend to predict the same label as that of the closest training
example. We empirically show that this happens even when the
out-of-distribution inputs lie outside the robustness radius of the training
data, which suggests that these networks may generalize better along unseen
directions on the natural image manifold than arbitrary unseen directions. We
examine how performance changes when we change the robustness regions during
training. We then design experiments to investigate the connection between
out-of-distribution detection and nearest category generalization. Taken
together, our work provides evidence that robust neural networks may resemble
nearest neighbor classifiers in their behavior on out-of-distribution data. The

                                        <span>Human mobility drives major societal phenomena including epidemics,
economies, and innovation. Historically, mobility was constrained by geographic
distance, however, in the globalizing world, language, culture, and history are
increasingly important. We propose using the neural embedding model word2vec
for studying mobility and capturing its complexity. Word2ec is shown to be
mathematically equivalent to the gravity model of mobility, and using three
human trajectory datasets, we demonstrate that it encodes nuanced relationships
between locations into a vector-space, providing a measure of effective
distance that outperforms baselines. Focusing on the case of scientific
mobility, we show that embeddings uncover cultural, linguistic, and
hierarchical relationships at multiple levels of granularity. Connecting neural
embeddings to the gravity model opens up new avenues for the study of mobility.</span>

allows loss functions to depend on past decisions and thus captures temporal
effects of learning problems. In this paper, we introduce dynamic policy regret
as the performance measure to design algorithms robust to non-stationary
environments, which competes algorithms&#x27; decisions with a sequence of changing
comparators. We propose a novel algorithm for OCO with memory that provably
enjoys an optimal dynamic policy regret. The key technical challenge is how to
control the switching cost, the cumulative movements of player&#x27;s decisions,
which is neatly addressed by a novel decomposition of dynamic policy regret and
an appropriate meta-expert structure. Furthermore, we apply the results to the
problem of online non-stochastic control, i.e., controlling a linear dynamical
system with adversarial disturbance and convex loss functions. We derive a
novel gradient-based controller with dynamic policy regret guarantees, which is
the first controller competitive to a sequence of changing policies.</span>

large amount of parameters but constant computation cost, and thus it has
become a trend in model scaling. Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring
quality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this
work, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe
that load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,
contrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely
activated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can
significantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step
forward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits
experts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This
strategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,
and our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is
more effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$
trillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in
comparison with the recent SOTAs on $2048$ TPU cores. The proposed giant model
achieves substantial speedup in convergence over the same-size baseline.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a transformer-based procedure for the efficient
registration of non-rigid 3D point clouds. The proposed approach is data-driven
and adopts for the first time the transformer architecture in the registration
task. Our method is general and applies to different settings. Given a fixed
template with some desired properties (e.g. skinning weights or other animation
cues), we can register raw acquired data to it, thereby transferring all the
template properties to the input geometry. Alternatively, given a pair of
shapes, our method can register the first onto the second (or vice-versa),
obtaining a high-quality dense correspondence between the two. In both
contexts, the quality of our results enables us to target real applications
such as texture transfer and shape interpolation. Furthermore, we also show
that including an estimation of the underlying density of the surface eases the
learning process. By exploiting the potential of this architecture, we can
train our model requiring only a sparse set of ground truth correspondences
($10\sim20\%$ of the total points). The proposed model and the analysis that we
perform pave the way for future exploration of transformer-based architectures
for registration and matching applications. Qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods
for deformable and unordered 3D data registration on different datasets and
scenarios.</span>

have shown promise in learning object priors or constraints to improve the

almost exclusively relied on real-valued networks. It was recently observed,
however, that complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) exhibit superior
performance in applications in which the input is naturally complex-valued,
such as MRI fingerprinting. While the mathematical theory of real-valued
networks has, by now, reached some level of maturity, this is far from true for
complex-valued networks. In this paper, we analyze the expressivity of
complex-valued networks by providing explicit quantitative error bounds for
approximating $C^n$ functions on compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}^d$ by
complex-valued neural networks that employ the modReLU activation function,
given by $\sigma(z) &#x3D; \mathrm{ReLU}(|z| - 1) \, \mathrm{sgn} (z)$, which is one
of the most popular complex activation functions used in practice. We show that
the derived approximation rates are optimal (up to log factors) in the class of
modReLU networks with weights of moderate growth.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a new quantum state reconstruction method that combines ideas from
compressed sensing, non-convex optimization, and acceleration methods. The
algorithm, called Momentum-Inspired Factored Gradient Descent (\texttt{MiFGD}),
extends the applicability of quantum tomography for larger systems. Despite
being a non-convex method, \texttt{MiFGD} converges \emph{provably} to the true
density matrix at a linear rate, in the absence of experimental and statistical
noise, and under common assumptions. With this manuscript, we present the
method, prove its convergence property and provide Frobenius norm bound
guarantees with respect to the true density matrix. From a practical point of
view, we benchmark the algorithm performance with respect to other existing
methods, in both synthetic and real experiments performed on an IBM&#x27;s quantum
processing unit. We find that the proposed algorithm performs orders of
magnitude faster than state of the art approaches, with the same or better
accuracy. In both synthetic and real experiments, we observed accurate and
robust reconstruction, despite experimental and statistical noise in the
tomographic data. Finally, we provide a ready-to-use code for state tomography
of multi-qubit systems.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks have amply demonstrated their prowess but estimating the
reliability of their predictions remains challenging. Deep Ensembles are widely
considered as being one of the best methods for generating uncertainty
estimates but are very expensive to train and evaluate. MC-Dropout is another
popular alternative, which is less expensive, but also less reliable. Our
central intuition is that there is a continuous spectrum of ensemble-like
models of which MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles are extreme examples. The first
uses an effectively infinite number of highly correlated models while the
second relies on a finite number of independent models.

To combine the benefits of both, we introduce Masksembles. Instead of
randomly dropping parts of the network as in MC-dropout, Masksemble relies on a
fixed number of binary masks, which are parameterized in a way that allows to
change correlations between individual models. Namely, by controlling the
overlap between the masks and their density one can choose the optimal
configuration for the task at hand. This leads to a simple and easy to
implement method with performance on par with Ensembles at a fraction of the
cost. We experimentally validate Masksembles on two widely used datasets,
CIFAR10 and ImageNet.</span>

                                        <span>Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is essential for understanding
customer&#x27;s power consumption patterns and may find wide applications like
carbon emission reduction and energy conservation. The training of NILM models
requires massive load data containing different types of appliances. However,
inadequate load data and the risk of power consumer privacy breaches may be
encountered by local data owners during the NILM model training. To prevent
such potential risks, a novel NILM method named Fed-NILM which is based on
Federated Learning (FL) is proposed in this paper. In Fed-NILM, local model
parameters instead of local load data are shared among multiple data owners.
The global model is obtained by weighted averaging the parameters. Experiments
based on two measured load datasets are conducted to explore the generalization
ability of Fed-NILM. Besides, a comparison of Fed-NILM with locally-trained
NILMs and the centrally-trained NILM is conducted. The experimental results
show that Fed-NILM has superior performance in scalability and convergence.
Fed-NILM outperforms locally-trained NILMs operated by local data owners and
approximates the centrally-trained NILM which is trained on the entire load
dataset without privacy protection. The proposed Fed-NILM significantly
improves the co-modeling capabilities of local data owners while protecting
power consumers&#x27; privacy.</span>

                                        <span>Following the great success of Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs), in many research domains in 2010s, several ML-based approaches
were proposed for detection in large inverse linear problems, e.g., massive
MIMO systems. The main motivation behind is that the complexity of Maximum
A-Posteriori (MAP) detection grows exponentially with system dimensions.
Instead of using DNNs, essentially being a black-box, we take a slightly
different approach and introduce a probabilistic Continuous relaxation of
disCrete variables to MAP detection. Enabling close approximation and
continuous optimization, we derive an iterative detection algorithm: Concrete
MAP Detection (CMD). Furthermore, extending CMD by the idea of deep unfolding
into CMDNet, we allow for (online) optimization of a small number of parameters
to different working points while limiting complexity. In contrast to recent
DNN-based approaches, we select the optimization criterion and output of CMDNet
based on information theory and are thus able to learn approximate
probabilities of the individual optimal detector. This is crucial for soft
decoding in today&#x27;s communication systems. Numerical simulation results in MIMO
systems reveal CMDNet to feature a promising accuracy complexity trade-off
compared to State of the Art. Notably, we demonstrate CMDNet&#x27;s soft outputs to
be reliable for decoders.</span>

                                        <span>Projection algorithms such as t-SNE or UMAP are useful for the visualization
of high dimensional data, but depend on hyperparameters which must be tuned
carefully. Unfortunately, iteratively recomputing projections to find the
optimal hyperparameter value is computationally intensive and unintuitive due
to the stochastic nature of these methods. In this paper we propose HyperNP, a
scalable method that allows for real-time interactive hyperparameter
exploration of projection methods by training neural network approximations.
HyperNP can be trained on a fraction of the total data instances and
hyperparameter configurations and can compute projections for new data and
hyperparameters at interactive speeds. HyperNP is compact in size and fast to
compute, thus allowing it to be embedded in lightweight visualization systems
such as web browsers. We evaluate the performance of the HyperNP across three
datasets in terms of performance and speed. The results suggest that HyperNP is
accurate, scalable, interactive, and appropriate for use in real-world
settings.</span>

and learning from them is a long-standing goal in machine learning research.
However, existing self-supervised generative models approximating an ELBO are
not able to fulfill all desired requirements of multimodal models: their
posterior approximation functions lead to a trade-off between the semantic
coherence and the ability to learn the joint data distribution. We propose a
new, generalized ELBO formulation for multimodal data that overcomes these
limitations. The new objective encompasses two previous methods as special
cases and combines their benefits without compromises. In extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method compared to
state-of-the-art models in self-supervised, generative learning tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems learn generalised, interpretable
rules in a data-efficient manner utilising existing background knowledge.
However, current ILP systems require training examples to be specified in a
structured logical format. Neural networks learn from unstructured data,
although their learned models may be difficult to interpret and are vulnerable
to data perturbations at run-time. This paper introduces a hybrid
neural-symbolic learning framework, called NSL, that learns interpretable rules
from labelled unstructured data. NSL combines pre-trained neural networks for
feature extraction with FastLAS, a state-of-the-art ILP system for rule
learning under the answer set semantics. Features extracted by the neural
components define the structured context of labelled examples and the
confidence of the neural predictions determines the level of noise of the
examples. Using the scoring function of FastLAS, NSL searches for short,
interpretable rules that generalise over such noisy examples. We evaluate our
framework on propositional and first-order classification tasks using the MNIST
dataset as raw data. Specifically, we demonstrate that NSL is able to learn
robust rules from perturbed MNIST data and achieve comparable or superior
accuracy when compared to neural network and random forest baselines whilst
being more general and interpretable.</span>

adaptive behaviour in fields ranging from machine learning, to biology, to
economics. While many approaches have been taken, one approach to solving this
trade-off has been to equip or propose that agents possess an intrinsic
&#x27;exploratory drive&#x27; which is often implemented in terms of maximizing the
agents information gain about the world -- an approach which has been widely
studied in machine learning and cognitive science. In this paper we
mathematically investigate the nature and meaning of such approaches and
demonstrate that this combination of utility maximizing and information-seeking
behaviour arises from the minimization of an entirely difference class of
objectives we call divergence objectives. We propose a dichotomy in the
objective functions underlying adaptive behaviour between \emph{evidence}
objectives, which correspond to well-known reward or utility maximizing
objectives in the literature, and \emph{divergence} objectives which instead
seek to minimize the divergence between the agent&#x27;s expected and desired
futures, and argue that this new class of divergence objectives could form the
mathematical foundation for a much richer understanding of the exploratory
components of adaptive and intelligent action, beyond simply greedy utility
maximization.</span>

                                        <span>Family history is a major risk factor for many types of cancer. Mendelian
risk prediction models translate family histories into cancer risk predictions
based on knowledge of cancer susceptibility genes. These models are widely used
in clinical practice to help identify high-risk individuals. Mendelian models
leverage the entire family history, but they rely on many assumptions about
cancer susceptibility genes that are either unrealistic or challenging to
validate due to low mutation prevalence. Training more flexible models, such as
neural networks, on large databases of pedigrees can potentially lead to
accuracy gains. In this paper, we develop a framework to apply neural networks
to family history data and investigate their ability to learn inherited
susceptibility to cancer. While there is an extensive literature on neural
networks and their state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, there is little
work applying them to family history data. We propose adaptations of
fully-connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks to pedigrees.
In data simulated under Mendelian inheritance, we demonstrate that our proposed
neural network models are able to achieve nearly optimal prediction
performance. Moreover, when the observed family history includes misreported
cancer diagnoses, neural networks are able to outperform the Mendelian BRCAPRO
model embedding the correct inheritance laws. Using a large dataset of over
200,000 family histories, the Risk Service cohort, we train prediction models
for future risk of breast cancer. We validate the models using data from the
Cancer Genetics Network.</span>

                                        <span>Slimmable neural networks provide a flexible trade-off front between
prediction error and computational requirement (such as the number of
floating-point operations or FLOPs) with the same storage requirement as a
single model. They are useful for reducing maintenance overhead for deploying
models to devices with different memory constraints and are useful for
optimizing the efficiency of a system with many CNNs. However, existing
slimmable network approaches either do not optimize layer-wise widths or
optimize the shared-weights and layer-wise widths independently, thereby
leaving significant room for improvement by joint width and weight
optimization. In this work, we propose a general framework to enable joint
optimization for both width configurations and weights of slimmable networks.
Our framework subsumes conventional and NAS-based slimmable methods as special
cases and provides flexibility to improve over existing methods. From a
practical standpoint, we propose Joslim, an algorithm that jointly optimizes
both the widths and weights for slimmable nets, which outperforms existing
methods for optimizing slimmable networks across various networks, datasets,
and objectives. Quantitatively, improvements up to 1.7% and 8% in top-1
accuracy on the ImageNet dataset can be attained for MobileNetV2 considering
FLOPs and memory footprint, respectively. Our results highlight the potential
of optimizing the channel counts for different layers jointly with the weights
for slimmable networks. Code available at https://github.com/cmu-enyac/Joslim.</span>

                                        <span>Graphs have been widely used in data mining and machine learning due to their
unique representation of real-world objects and their interactions. As graphs
are getting bigger and bigger nowadays, it is common to see their subgraphs
separately collected and stored in multiple local systems. Therefore, it is
natural to consider the subgraph federated learning setting, where each local
system holding a small subgraph that may be biased from the distribution of the
whole graph. Hence, the subgraph federated learning aims to collaboratively
train a powerful and generalizable graph mining model without directly sharing
their graph data. In this work, towards the novel yet realistic setting of
subgraph federated learning, we propose two major techniques: (1) FedSage,
which trains a GraphSage model based on FedAvg to integrate node features, link
structures, and task labels on multiple local subgraphs; (2) FedSage+, which
trains a missing neighbor generator along FedSage to deal with missing links
across local subgraphs. Empirical results on four real-world graph datasets
with synthesized subgraph federated learning settings demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed techniques. At the same time,
consistent theoretical implications are made towards their generalization
ability on the global graphs.</span>

                                        <span>Inspired by a new coded computation algorithm for invertible functions, we
propose Coded-InvNet a new approach to design resilient prediction serving
systems that can gracefully handle stragglers or node failures. Coded-InvNet
leverages recent findings in the deep learning literature such as invertible
neural networks, Manifold Mixup, and domain translation algorithms, identifying
interesting research directions that span across machine learning and systems.
Our experimental results show that Coded-InvNet can outperform existing
approaches, especially when the compute resource overhead is as low as 10%. For
instance, without knowing which of the ten workers is going to fail, our
algorithm can design a backup task so that it can correctly recover the missing
prediction result with an accuracy of 85.9%, significantly outperforming the
previous SOTA by 32.5%.</span>

                                        <span>We study the problem of recovering an unknown signal $\boldsymbol x$ given
measurements obtained from a generalized linear model with a Gaussian sensing
matrix. Two popular solutions are based on a linear estimator $\hat{\boldsymbol
x}^{\rm L}$ and a spectral estimator $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s}$. The former
is a data-dependent linear combination of the columns of the measurement
matrix, and its analysis is quite simple. The latter is the principal
eigenvector of a data-dependent matrix, and a recent line of work has studied
its performance. In this paper, we show how to optimally combine
$\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s}$. At the heart
of our analysis is the exact characterization of the joint empirical
distribution of $(\boldsymbol x, \hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}, \hat{\boldsymbol
x}^{\rm s})$ in the high-dimensional limit. This allows us to compute the
Bayes-optimal combination of $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}$ and
$\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s}$, given the limiting distribution of the signal
$\boldsymbol x$. When the distribution of the signal is Gaussian, then the
Bayes-optimal combination has the form $\theta\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm
L}+\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s}$ and we derive the optimal combination
coefficient. In order to establish the limiting distribution of $(\boldsymbol
x, \hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}, \hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s})$, we design and
analyze an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm whose iterates give
$\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm L}$ and approach $\hat{\boldsymbol x}^{\rm s}$.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the improvement of the proposed combination
with respect to the two methods considered separately.</span>

analysis reveals crucial information for understanding the underlying
processes. Among the many time series learning tasks of great importance, we
here focus on semi-supervised learning based on a graph representation of the
data. Two main aspects are involved in this task. A suitable distance measure
to evaluate the similarities between time series, and a learning method to make
predictions based on these distances. However, the relationship between the two
aspects has never been studied systematically in the context of graph-based
learning. We describe four different distance measures, including (Soft) DTW
and MPDist, a distance measure based on the Matrix Profile, as well as four
successful semi-supervised learning methods, including the graph Allen--Cahn
method and a Graph Convolutional Neural Network. We then compare the
performance of the algorithms on binary classification data sets. In our
findings we compare the chosen graph-based methods using all distance measures
and observe that the results vary strongly with respect to the accuracy. As
predicted by the &#x60;&#x60;no free lunch&#x27;&#x27; theorem, no clear best combination to employ
in all cases is found. Our study provides a reproducible framework for future
work in the direction of semi-supervised learning for time series with a focus

may not fully exploit the feature structure. In this paper, we incorporate the
grouping effect into MF and propose a novel method called Robust Matrix
Factorization with Grouping effect (GRMF). The grouping effect is a
generalization of the sparsity effect, which conducts denoising by clustering
similar values around multiple centers instead of just around 0. Compared with
existing algorithms, the proposed GRMF can automatically learn the grouping
structure and sparsity in MF without prior knowledge, by introducing a
naturally adjustable non-convex regularization to achieve simultaneous sparsity
and grouping effect. Specifically, GRMF uses an efficient alternating
minimization framework to perform MF, in which the original non-convex problem
is first converted into a convex problem through Difference-of-Convex (DC)
programming, and then solved by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM). In addition, GRMF can be easily extended to the Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) settings. Extensive experiments have been conducted using
real-world data sets with outliers and contaminated noise, where the
experimental results show that GRMF has promoted performance and robustness,
compared to five benchmark algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Recent years have witnessed fast growth in outdoor location-based services.
While GPS is considered a ubiquitous localization system, it is not supported
by low-end phones, requires direct line of sight to the satellites, and can
drain the phone battery quickly.

In this paper, we propose DeepLoc: a deep learning-based outdoor localization
system that obtains GPS-like localization accuracy without its limitations. In
particular, DeepLoc leverages the ubiquitous cellular signals received from the
different cell towers heard by the mobile device as hints to localize it. To do
that, crowd-sensed geo-tagged received signal strength information coming from
different cell towers is used to train a deep model that is used to infer the
user&#x27;s position. As part of DeepLoc design, we introduce modules to address a
number of practical challenges including scaling the data collection to large
areas, handling the inherent noise in the cellular signal and geo-tagged data,
as well as providing enough data that is required for deep learning models with
low-overhead.

We implemented DeepLoc on different Android devices. Evaluation results in
realistic urban and rural environments show that DeepLoc can achieve a median
localization accuracy within 18.8m in urban areas and within 15.7m in rural
areas. This accuracy outperforms the state-of-the-art cellular-based systems by
more than 470% and comes with 330% savings in power compared to the GPS. This
highlights the promise of DeepLoc as a ubiquitous accurate and low-overhead
localization system.</span>

Vision-based Graph Aggregation and Inference (VGAI). This multi-agent
decentralized learning-to-control framework maps raw visual observations to
agent actions, aided by local communication among neighboring agents. Our
framework is implemented by a cascade of a convolutional and a graph neural
network (CNN / GNN), addressing agent-level visual perception and feature
learning, as well as swarm-level communication, local information aggregation
and agent action inference, respectively. By jointly training the CNN and GNN,
image features and communication messages are learned in conjunction to better
address the specific task. We use imitation learning to train the VGAI
controller in an offline phase, relying on a centralized expert controller.
This results in a learned VGAI controller that can be deployed in a distributed
manner for online execution. Additionally, the controller exhibits good scaling
properties, with training in smaller teams and application in larger teams.
Through a multi-agent flocking application, we demonstrate that VGAI yields
performance comparable to or better than other decentralized controllers, using
only the visual input modality and without accessing precise location or motion
state information.</span>

information (MI) between multiple views of an underlying context. E.g., we can
derive multiple views of a given image by applying data augmentation, or we can
split a sequence into views comprising the past and future of some step in the
sequence. Contrastive lower bounds on MI are easy to optimize, but have a
strong underestimation bias when estimating large amounts of MI. We propose
decomposing the full MI estimation problem into a sum of smaller estimation
problems by splitting one of the views into progressively more informed
subviews and by applying the chain rule on MI between the decomposed views.
This expression contains a sum of unconditional and conditional MI terms, each
measuring modest chunks of the total MI, which facilitates approximation via
contrastive bounds. To maximize the sum, we formulate a contrastive lower bound
on the conditional MI which can be approximated efficiently. We refer to our
general approach as Decomposed Estimation of Mutual Information (DEMI). We show
that DEMI can capture a larger amount of MI than standard non-decomposed
contrastive bounds in a synthetic setting, and learns better representations in
a vision domain and for dialogue generation.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) appear to be state-of-the-art
algorithms for analyzing non-euclidean graph data. By applying deep-learning to
extract high-level representations from graph structures, GNNs achieve
extraordinary accuracy and great generalization ability in various tasks.
However, with the ever-increasing graph sizes, more and more complicated GNN
layers, and higher feature dimensions, the computational complexity of GNNs
grows exponentially. How to inference GNNs in real time has become a
challenging problem, especially for some resource-limited edge-computing
platforms.

To tackle this challenge, we propose BlockGNN, a software-hardware co-design
approach to realize efficient GNN acceleration. At the algorithm level, we
propose to leverage block-circulant weight matrices to greatly reduce the
complexity of various GNN models. At the hardware design level, we propose a
pipelined CirCore architecture, which supports efficient block-circulant
matrices computation. Basing on CirCore, we present a novel BlockGNN
accelerator to compute various GNNs with low latency. Moreover, to determine
the optimal configurations for diverse deployed tasks, we also introduce a
performance and resource model that helps choose the optimal hardware
parameters automatically. Comprehensive experiments on the ZC706 FPGA platform
demonstrate that on various GNN tasks, BlockGNN achieves up to $8.3\times$
speedup compared to the baseline HyGCN architecture and $111.9\times$ energy
reduction compared to the Intel Xeon CPU platform.</span>

often trained with anechoic data. However, real acoustic environments are
generally reverberant, which causes the performance to significantly
deteriorate. To mitigate this mismatch between training data and real data, we
simulate an augmented training set that contains nearly five million
utterances. This extension comprises of anechoic utterances and their
reverberant modifications, generated by convolutions of the anechoic utterances
with a variety of room impulse responses (RIRs). We consider five different
models to generate RIRs, and five different VADs that are trained with the
augmented training set. We test all trained systems in three different real
reverberant environments. Experimental results show $20\%$ increase on average
in accuracy, precision and recall for all detectors and response models,
compared to anechoic training. Furthermore, one of the RIR models consistently
yields better performance than the other models, for all the tested VADs.
Additionally, one of the VADs consistently outperformed the other VADs in all
experiments.</span>

                                        <span>High-impedance faults (HIF) are difficult to detect because of their low
current amplitude and highly diverse characteristics. In recent years, machine
learning (ML) has been gaining popularity in HIF detection because ML
techniques learn patterns from data and successfully detect HIFs. However, as
these methods are based on supervised learning, they fail to reliably detect
any scenario, fault or non-fault, not present in the training data.
Consequently, this paper takes advantage of unsupervised learning and proposes
a convolutional autoencoder framework for HIF detection (CAE-HIFD). Contrary to
the conventional autoencoders that learn from normal behavior, the
convolutional autoencoder (CAE) in CAE-HIFD learns only from the HIF signals
eliminating the need for presence of diverse non-HIF scenarios in the CAE
training. CAE distinguishes HIFs from non-HIF operating conditions by employing
cross-correlation. To discriminate HIFs from transient disturbances such as
capacitor or load switching, CAE-HIFD uses kurtosis, a statistical measure of
the probability distribution shape. The performance evaluation studies
conducted using the IEEE 13-node test feeder indicate that the CAE-HIFD
reliably detects HIFs, outperforms the state-of-the-art HIF detection
techniques, and is robust against noise.</span>

                                        <span>Inferential (or soft) sensors are used in industry to infer the values of
imprecisely and rarely measured (or completely unmeasured) variables from
variables measured online (e.g., pressures, temperatures). The main challenge,
akin to classical model overfitting, in designing an effective inferential
sensor is the selection of a correct structure of the sensor. The sensor
structure is represented by the number of inputs to the sensor, which
correspond to the variables measured online and their (simple) combinations.
This work is focused on the design of inferential sensors for product
composition of an industrial distillation column in two oil refinery units, a
Fluid Catalytic Cracking unit and a Vacuum Gasoil Hydrogenation unit. As the
first design step, we use several well-known data pre-treatment (gross error
detection) methods and compare the ability of these approaches to indicate
systematic errors and outliers in the available industrial data. We then study
effectiveness of various methods for design of the inferential sensors taking
into account the complexity and accuracy of the resulting model. The
effectiveness analysis indicates that the improvements achieved over the
current inferential sensors are up to 19 %.</span>

simultaneously, and it solves one big optimization problem with the ascertained

consistently exhibit known human social biases. Although many methods for
debiasing exist, almost all fixate on completely eliminating biased information
from the embeddings and often diminish training set size in the process. In
this paper, we present a simple yet effective method for debiasing GloVe word
embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) which works by incorporating explicit
information about training set bias rather than removing biased data outright.
Our method runs quickly and efficiently with the help of a fast bias gradient
approximation method from Brunet et al. (2019). As our approach is akin to the
notion of &#x27;source criticism&#x27; in the humanities, we term our method
Source-Critical GloVe (SC-GloVe). We show that SC-GloVe reduces the effect size

the echo path from the far-end signal to the near-end microphone in two parts.
Inspired by the physical behavior of modern hands-free devices, we first
introduce a novel neural network architecture that is specifically designed to
model the nonlinear distortions these devices induce between receiving and
playing the far-end signal. To account for variations between devices, we
construct this network with trainable memory length and nonlinear activation
functions that are not parameterized in advance, but are rather optimized
during the training stage using the training data. Second, the network is
succeeded by a standard adaptive linear filter that constantly tracks the echo
path between the loudspeaker output and the microphone. During training, the
network and filter are jointly optimized to learn the network parameters. This
system requires 17 thousand parameters that consume 500 Million floating-point
operations per second and 40 Kilo-bytes of memory. It also satisfies hands-free
communication timing requirements on a standard neural processor, which renders
it adequate for embedding on hands-free communication devices. Using 280 hours
of real and synthetic data, experiments show advantageous performance compared

of quasars from the recently completed extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). The sample contains $343708$ objects in the
redshift range $0.8&lt;z&lt;2.2$ and $72667$ objects with redshifts $2.2&lt;z&lt;3.5$,
covering an effective area of $4699~{\rm deg}^{2}$. We develop a neural
network-based approach to mitigate spurious fluctuations in the density field
caused by spatial variations in the quality of the imaging data used to select
targets for follow-up spectroscopy. Simulations are used with the same angular
and radial distributions as the real data to estimate covariance matrices,
perform error analyses, and assess residual systematic uncertainties. We
measure the mean density contrast and cross-correlations of the eBOSS quasars
against maps of potential sources of imaging systematics to address algorithm
effectiveness, finding that the neural network-based approach outperforms
standard linear regression. Stellar density is one of the most important
sources of spurious fluctuations, and a new template constructed using data
from the Gaia spacecraft provides the best match to the observed quasar
clustering. The end-product from this work is a new value-added quasar
catalogue with the improved weights to correct for nonlinear imaging systematic
effects, which will be made public. Our quasar catalogue is used to measure the
local-type primordial non-Gaussianity in our companion paper, Mueller et al. in
preparation.</span>

                                        <span>Although the optimization objectives for learning neural networks are highly
non-convex, gradient-based methods have been wildly successful at learning
neural networks in practice. This juxtaposition has led to a number of recent
studies on provable guarantees for neural networks trained by gradient descent.
Unfortunately, the techniques in these works are often highly specific to the
problem studied in each setting, relying on different assumptions on the
distribution, optimization parameters, and network architectures, making it
difficult to generalize across different settings. In this work, we propose a
unified non-convex optimization framework for the analysis of neural network
training. We introduce the notions of proxy convexity and proxy
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequalities, which are satisfied if the original
objective function induces a proxy objective function that is implicitly
minimized when using gradient methods. We show that stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) on objectives satisfying proxy convexity or the proxy PL inequality leads
to efficient guarantees for proxy objective functions. We further show that
many existing guarantees for neural networks trained by gradient descent can be
unified through proxy convexity and proxy PL inequalities.</span>

and stationary noises, which often occur in real life scenarios. We exploit
unique spatial patterns of speech and non-speech audio frames by independently
learning their underlying geometric structure. This process is done through a
deep encoder-decoder based neural network architecture. This structure involves
an encoder that maps spectral features with temporal information to their
low-dimensional representations, which are generated by applying the diffusion
maps method. The encoder feeds a decoder that maps the embedded data back into
the high-dimensional space. A deep neural network, which is trained to separate
speech from non-speech frames, is obtained by concatenating the decoder to the
encoder, resembling the known Diffusion nets architecture. Experimental results
show enhanced performance compared to competing voice activity detection
methods. The improvement is achieved in both accuracy, robustness and
generalization ability. Our model performs in a real-time manner and can be
integrated into audio-based communication systems. We also present a batch
algorithm which obtains an even higher accuracy for off-line applications.</span>

challenge is that the isotropic noise typically added for privacy dominates the
signal in gradient geometry for high-dimensional problems; approaches to this
that effectively optimize over lower-dimensional subspaces simply ignore the
actual problems that varying gradient geometries introduce. In contrast, we
study non-isotropic clipping and noise addition, developing a principled

                                        <span>Temporal graph signals are multivariate time series with individual
components associated with nodes of a fixed graph structure. Data of this kind
arises in many domains including activity of social network users, sensor
network readings over time, and time course gene expression within the
interaction network of a model organism. Traditional matrix decomposition
methods applied to such data fall short of exploiting structural regularities
encoded in the underlying graph and also in the temporal patterns of the
signal. How can we take into account such structure to obtain a succinct and
interpretable representation of temporal graph signals?

We propose a general, dictionary-based framework for temporal graph signal
decomposition (TGSD). The key idea is to learn a low-rank, joint encoding of
the data via a combination of graph and time dictionaries. We propose a highly
scalable decomposition algorithm for both complete and incomplete data, and
demonstrate its advantage for matrix decomposition, imputation of missing
values, temporal interpolation, clustering, period estimation, and rank
estimation in synthetic and real-world data ranging from traffic patterns to
social media activity. Our framework achieves 28% reduction in RMSE compared to
baselines for temporal interpolation when as many as 75% of the observations
are missing. It scales best among baselines taking under 20 seconds on 3.5
million data points and produces the most parsimonious models. To the best of
our knowledge, TGSD is the first framework to jointly model graph signals by
temporal and graph dictionaries.</span>

                                        <span>Regularization plays a vital role in machine learning optimization. One novel
regularization method called flooding makes the training loss fluctuate around
the flooding level. It intends to make the model continue to random walk until
it comes to a flat loss landscape to enhance generalization. However, the
hyper-parameter flooding level of the flooding method fails to be selected
properly and uniformly. We propose a novel method called Jitter to improve it.
Jitter is essentially a kind of random loss function. Before training, we
randomly sample the Jitter Point from a specific probability distribution. The
flooding level should be replaced by Jitter point to obtain a new target
function and train the model accordingly. As Jitter point acting as a random
factor, we actually add some randomness to the loss function, which is
consistent with the fact that there exists innumerable random behaviors in the
learning process of the machine learning model and is supposed to make the
model more robust. In addition, Jitter performs random walk randomly which
divides the loss curve into small intervals and then flipping them over,
ideally making the loss curve much flatter and enhancing generalization
ability. Moreover, Jitter can be a domain-, task-, and model-independent
regularization method and train the model effectively after the training error
reduces to zero. Our experimental results show that Jitter method can improve
model performance more significantly than the previous flooding method and make
the test loss curve descend twice.</span>

controllable inductive biases by using an intermediary set of latent variables.
This allows us to overcome the limitations of the standard Gaussian prior
assumption. In particular, it allows us to impose desired properties like
sparsity or clustering on learned representations, and incorporate prior
information into the learned model. Our approach, which we refer to as the
Intermediary Latent Space VAE (InteL-VAE), is based around controlling the
stochasticity of the encoding process with the intermediary latent variables,
before deterministically mapping them forward to our target latent
representation, from which reconstruction is performed. This allows us to
maintain all the advantages of the traditional VAE framework, while
incorporating desired prior information, inductive biases, and even topological
information through the latent mapping. We show that this, in turn, allows
InteL-VAEs to learn both better generative models and representations.</span>

                                        <span>We propose a theoretical approach towards the training numerical stability of
Variational AutoEncoders (VAE). Our work is motivated by recent studies
empowering VAEs to reach state of the art generative results on complex image
datasets. These very deep VAE architectures, as well as VAEs using more complex
output distributions, highlight a tendency to haphazardly produce high training
gradients as well as NaN losses. The empirical fixes proposed to train them
despite their limitations are neither fully theoretically grounded nor
generally sufficient in practice. Building on this, we localize the source of
the problem at the interface between the model&#x27;s neural networks and their
output probabilistic distributions. We explain a common source of instability
stemming from an incautious formulation of the encoded Normal distribution&#x27;s
variance, and apply the same approach on other, less obvious sources. We show
that by implementing small changes to the way we parameterize the Normal
distributions on which they rely, VAEs can securely be trained.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in whole slide imaging (WSI) technology have led to the
development of a myriad of computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI)
based diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive algorithms. Computational
Pathology (CPath) offers an integrated solution to utilize information embedded
in pathology WSIs beyond what we obtain through visual assessment. For
automated analysis of WSIs and validation of machine learning (ML) models,
annotations at the slide, tissue and cellular levels are required. The
annotation of important visual constructs in pathology images is an important
component of CPath projects. Improper annotations can result in algorithms
which are hard to interpret and can potentially produce inaccurate and
inconsistent results. Despite the crucial role of annotations in CPath
projects, there are no well-defined guidelines or best practices on how
annotations should be carried out. In this paper, we address this shortcoming
by presenting the experience and best practices acquired during the execution
of a large-scale annotation exercise involving a multidisciplinary team of
pathologists, ML experts and researchers as part of the Pathology image data
Lake for Analytics, Knowledge and Education (PathLAKE) consortium. We present a
real-world case study along with examples of different types of annotations,
diagnostic algorithm, annotation data dictionary and annotation constructs. The
analyses reported in this work highlight best practice recommendations that can
be used as annotation guidelines over the lifecycle of a CPath project.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate modeling of boundary conditions is crucial in computational physics.
The ever increasing use of neural networks as surrogates for physics-related
problems calls for an improved understanding of boundary condition treatment,
and its influence on the network accuracy. In this paper, several strategies to
impose boundary conditions (namely padding, improved spatial context, and
explicit encoding of physical boundaries) are investigated in the context of
fully convolutional networks applied to recurrent tasks. These strategies are
evaluated on two spatio-temporal evolving problems modeled by partial
differential equations: the 2D propagation of acoustic waves (hyperbolic PDE)
and the heat equation (parabolic PDE). Results reveal a high sensitivity of
both accuracy and stability on the boundary implementation in such recurrent
tasks. It is then demonstrated that the choice of the optimal padding strategy
is directly linked to the data semantics. Furthermore, the inclusion of
additional input spatial context or explicit physics-based rules allows a
better handling of boundaries in particular for large number of recurrences,
resulting in more robust and stable neural networks, while facilitating the
design and versatility of such networks.</span>

                                        <span>Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide and Optical
Coherence Tomography (OCT) is the quintessential imaging technique for its
detection. Unlike most of the state-of-the-art studies focused on glaucoma
detection, in this paper, we propose, for the first time, a novel framework for
glaucoma grading using raw circumpapillary B-scans. In particular, we set out a
new OCT-based hybrid network which combines hand-driven and deep learning
algorithms. An OCT-specific descriptor is proposed to extract hand-crafted
features related to the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). In parallel, an
innovative CNN is developed using skip-connections to include tailored residual
and attention modules to refine the automatic features of the latent space. The
proposed architecture is used as a backbone to conduct a novel few-shot
learning based on static and dynamic prototypical networks. The k-shot paradigm
is redefined giving rise to a supervised end-to-end system which provides
substantial improvements discriminating between healthy, early and advanced
glaucoma samples. The training and evaluation processes of the dynamic
prototypical network are addressed from two fused databases acquired via
Heidelberg Spectralis system. Validation and testing results reach a
categorical accuracy of 0.9459 and 0.8788 for glaucoma grading, respectively.
Besides, the high performance reported by the proposed model for glaucoma
detection deserves a special mention. The findings from the class activation
maps are directly in line with the clinicians&#x27; opinion since the heatmaps
pointed out the RNFL as the most relevant structure for glaucoma diagnosis.</span>

                                        <span>Deep learning based molecular graph generation and optimization has recently
been attracting attention due to its great potential for de novo drug design.
On the one hand, recent models are able to efficiently learn a given graph
distribution, and many approaches have proven very effective to produce a
molecule that maximizes a given score. On the other hand, it was shown by
previous studies that generated optimized molecules are often unrealistic, even
with the inclusion of mechanics to enforce similarity to a dataset of real drug
molecules. In this work we use a hybrid approach, where the dataset
distribution is learned using an autoregressive model while the score
optimization is done using the Metropolis algorithm, biased toward the learned
distribution. We show that the resulting method, that we call learned realism
sampling (LRS), produces empirically more realistic molecules and outperforms
all recent baselines in the task of molecule optimization with similarity
constraints.</span>

mixture of two isotropic distributions satisfying concentration and
anti-concentration properties enjoyed by log-concave distributions among
others. We show that there exists a universal constant $C_{\mathrm{err}}&gt;0$
such that if a pseudolabeler $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{\mathrm{pl}}$ can achieve
classification error at most $C_{\mathrm{err}}$, then for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$,
an iterative self-training algorithm initialized at $\boldsymbol{\beta}_0 :&#x3D;
\boldsymbol{\beta}_{\mathrm{pl}}$ using pseudolabels $\hat y &#x3D;
\mathrm{sgn}(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta}_t, \mathbf{x}\rangle)$ and using at
most $\tilde O(d/\varepsilon^2)$ unlabeled examples suffices to learn the
Bayes-optimal classifier up to $\varepsilon$ error, where $d$ is the ambient
dimension. That is, self-training converts weak learners to strong learners
using only unlabeled examples. We additionally show that by running gradient
descent on the logistic loss one can obtain a pseudolabeler
$\boldsymbol{\beta}_{\mathrm{pl}}$ with classification error $C_{\mathrm{err}}$
using only $O(d)$ labeled examples (i.e., independent of $\varepsilon$).
Together our results imply that mixture models can be learned to within
$\varepsilon$ of the Bayes-optimal accuracy using at most $O(d)$ labeled
examples and $\tilde O(d/\varepsilon^2)$ unlabeled examples by way of a

Classification based on Purpose competition. The goal of the competition is to
classify a citation in a scientific article based on its purpose. This task is
important because it could potentially lead to more comprehensive ways of
summarizing the purpose and uses of scientific articles, but it is also
difficult, mainly due to the limited amount of available training data in which
the purposes of each citation have been hand-labeled, along with the
subjectivity of these labels. Our entry in the competition is a multi-task
model that combines multiple modules designed to handle the problem from
different perspectives, including hand-generated linguistic features, TF-IDF
features, and an LSTM-with-attention model. We also provide an ablation study
and feature analysis whose insights could lead to future work.</span>

                                        <span>While predictive policing has become increasingly common in assisting with
decisions in the criminal justice system, the use of these results is still
controversial. Some software based on deep learning lacks accuracy (e.g., in
F-1), and many decision processes are not transparent causing doubt about
decision bias, such as perceived racial, age, and gender disparities. This
paper addresses bias issues with post-hoc explanations to provide a trustable
prediction of whether a person will receive future criminal charges given one&#x27;s
previous criminal records by learning temporal behavior patterns over twenty
years. Bi-LSTM relieves the vanishing gradient problem, and attentional
mechanisms allows learning and interpretation of feature importance. Our
approach shows consistent and reliable prediction precision and recall on a
real-life dataset. Our analysis of the importance of each input feature shows
the critical causal impact on decision-making, suggesting that criminal
histories are statistically significant factors, while identifiers, such as
race, gender, and age, are not. Finally, our algorithm indicates that a suspect
tends to gradually rather than suddenly increase crime severity level over
time.</span>

                                        <span>The phenomenon of adversarial examples in deep learning models has caused
substantial concern over their reliability. While many deep neural networks
have shown impressive performance in terms of predictive accuracy, it has been
shown that in many instances an imperceptible perturbation can falsely flip the
network&#x27;s prediction. Most research has then focused on developing defenses
against adversarial attacks or learning under a worst-case adversarial loss. In
this work, we take a step back and aim to provide a framework for determining
whether a model&#x27;s label change under small perturbation is justified (and when
it is not). We carefully argue that adversarial robustness should be defined as
a locally adaptive measure complying with the underlying distribution. We then
suggest a definition for an adaptive robust loss, derive an empirical version
of it, and develop a resulting data-augmentation framework. We prove that our
adaptive data-augmentation maintains consistency of 1-nearest neighbor
classification under deterministic labels and provide illustrative empirical
evaluations.</span>

parameterised collection of fast-to-run toy environments in \textit{OpenAI Gym}
by varying these dimensions and propose to use these for the initial design and
development of agents. We also provide wrappers that inject these dimensions
into complex environments from \textit{Atari} and \textit{Mujoco} to allow for

there exist many practically relevant instances of hypergraph datasets. To
enable efficient processing of hypergraph-structured data, several hypergraph
neural network platforms have been proposed for learning hypergraph properties
and structure, with a special focus on node classification. However, almost all
existing methods use heuristic propagation rules and offer suboptimal
performance on many datasets. We propose AllSet, a new hypergraph neural
network paradigm that represents a highly general framework for (hyper)graph
neural networks and for the first time implements hypergraph neural network
layers as compositions of two multiset functions that can be efficiently
learned for each task and each dataset. Furthermore, AllSet draws on new
connections between hypergraph neural networks and recent advances in deep
learning of multiset functions. In particular, the proposed architecture
utilizes Deep Sets and Set Transformer architectures that allow for significant
modeling flexibility and offer high expressive power. To evaluate the
performance of AllSet, we conduct the most extensive experiments to date
involving ten known benchmarking datasets and three newly curated datasets that
represent significant challenges for hypergraph node classification. The
results demonstrate that AllSet has the unique ability to consistently either
match or outperform all other hypergraph neural networks across the tested
datasets. Our implementation and dataset will be released upon acceptance.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning has emerged as an important paradigm for training machine
learning models in different domains. For graph-level tasks such as graph
classification, graphs can also be regarded as a special type of data samples,
which can be collected and stored in separate local systems. Similar to other
domains, multiple local systems, each holding a small set of graphs, may
benefit from collaboratively training a powerful graph mining model, such as
the popular graph neural networks (GNNs). To provide more motivation towards
such endeavors, we analyze real-world graphs from different domains to confirm
that they indeed share certain graph properties that are statistically
significant compared with random graphs. However, we also find that different
sets of graphs, even from the same domain or same dataset, are non-IID
regarding both graph structures and node features. To handle this, we propose a
graph clustering federated learning (GCFL) framework that dynamically finds
clusters of local systems based on the gradients of GNNs, and theoretically
justify that such clusters can reduce the structure and feature heterogeneity
among graphs owned by the local systems. Moreover, we observe the gradients of
GNNs to be rather fluctuating in GCFL which impedes high-quality clustering,
and design a gradient sequence-based clustering mechanism based on dynamic time
warping (GCFL+). Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the problem of online classification under a privacy constraint.
In this setting a learner observes sequentially a stream of labelled examples
$(x_t, y_t)$, for $1 \leq t \leq T$, and returns at each iteration $t$ a
hypothesis $h_t$ which is used to predict the label of each new example $x_t$.
The learner&#x27;s performance is measured by her regret against a known hypothesis
class $\mathcal{H}$. We require that the algorithm satisfies the following
privacy constraint: the sequence $h_1, \ldots, h_T$ of hypotheses output by the
algorithm needs to be an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private function
of the whole input sequence $(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_T, y_T)$. We provide the
first non-trivial regret bound for the realizable setting. Specifically, we
show that if the class $\mathcal{H}$ has constant Littlestone dimension then,
given an oblivious sequence of labelled examples, there is a private learner
that makes in expectation at most $O(\log T)$ mistakes -- comparable to the
optimal mistake bound in the non-private case, up to a logarithmic factor.
Moreover, for general values of the Littlestone dimension $d$, the same mistake
bound holds but with a doubly-exponential in $d$ factor. A recent line of work
has demonstrated a strong connection between classes that are online learnable
and those that are differentially-private learnable. Our results strengthen
this connection and show that an online learning algorithm can in fact be
directly privatized (in the realizable setting). We also discuss an adaptive
setting and provide a sublinear regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$.</span>

                                        <span>The fundamental task of classification given a limited number of training
data samples is considered for physical systems with known parametric
statistical models. The standalone learning-based and statistical model-based
classifiers face major challenges towards the fulfillment of the classification
task using a small training set. Specifically, classifiers that solely rely on
the physics-based statistical models usually suffer from their inability to
properly tune the underlying unobservable parameters, which leads to a
mismatched representation of the system&#x27;s behaviors. Learning-based
classifiers, on the other hand, typically rely on a large number of training
data from the underlying physical process, which might not be feasible in most
practical scenarios. In this paper, a hybrid classification method -- termed
HyPhyLearn -- is proposed that exploits both the physics-based statistical
models and the learning-based classifiers. The proposed solution is based on
the conjecture that HyPhyLearn would alleviate the challenges associated with
the individual approaches of learning-based and statistical model-based
classifiers by fusing their respective strengths. The proposed hybrid approach
first estimates the unobservable model parameters using the available
(suboptimal) statistical estimation procedures, and subsequently use the
physics-based statistical models to generate synthetic data. Then, the training
data samples are incorporated with the synthetic data in a learning-based
classifier that is based on domain-adversarial training of neural networks.
Specifically, in order to address the mismatch problem, the classifier learns a
mapping from the training data and the synthetic data to a common feature
space. Simultaneously, the classifier is trained to find discriminative
features within this space in order to fulfill the classification task.</span>

functionalities to a user. Such automation is enabled by the &#x60;Turing-complete&#x27;
nature of the programming language (Solidity) in which SCs are written. This
also opens up different vulnerabilities and bugs in SCs that malicious actors
exploit to carry out malicious or illegal activities on the cryptocurrency
platform. In this work, we study the correlation between malicious activities
and the vulnerabilities present in SCs and find that some malicious activities
are correlated with certain types of vulnerabilities. We then develop and study
the feasibility of a scoring mechanism that corresponds to the severity of the
vulnerabilities present in SCs to determine if it is a relevant feature to
identify suspicious SCs. We analyze the utility of severity score towards
detection of suspicious SCs using unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms
across different temporal granularities and identify behavioral changes. In our
experiments with on-chain SCs, we were able to find a total of 1094 benign SCs
across different granularities which behave similar to malicious SCs, with the

                                        <span>Pretraining large neural language models, such as BERT, has led to impressive
gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, most
pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web.
A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by
starting from general-domain language models. In this paper, we challenge this
assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as
biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial
gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To
facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP
benchmark from publicly-available datasets. Our experiments show that
domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of
biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board.
Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for
pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common
practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging
schemes in named entity recognition (NER). To help accelerate research in
biomedical NLP, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and
task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our
BLURB benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding &amp; Reasoning
Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/BLURB.</span>

order to learn successful policies for perception-based mobile navigation.
However, gathering such datasets with a single robot can be prohibitively
expensive. Collecting data with multiple different robotic platforms with
possibly different dynamics is a more scalable approach to large-scale data
collection. But how can deep reinforcement learning algorithms leverage such
heterogeneous datasets? In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning
algorithm with hierarchically integrated models (HInt). At training time, HInt
learns separate perception and dynamics models, and at test time, HInt
integrates the two models in a hierarchical manner and plans actions with the
integrated model. This method of planning with hierarchically integrated models
allows the algorithm to train on datasets gathered by a variety of different
platforms, while respecting the physical capabilities of the deployment robot
at test time. Our mobile navigation experiments show that HInt outperforms
conventional hierarchical policies and single-source approaches.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, transformers have shown great superiority in solving computer
vision tasks by modeling images as a sequence of manually-split patches with
self-attention mechanism. However, current architectures of vision transformers
(ViTs) are simply inherited from natural language processing (NLP) tasks and
have not been sufficiently investigated and optimized. In this paper, we make a
further step by examining the intrinsic structure of transformers for vision
tasks and propose an architecture search method, dubbed ViTAS, to search for
the optimal architecture with similar hardware budgets. Concretely, we design a
new effective yet efficient weight sharing paradigm for ViTs, such that
architectures with different token embedding, sequence size, number of heads,
width, and depth can be derived from a single super-transformer. Moreover, to
cater for the variance of distinct architectures, we introduce \textit{private}
class token and self-attention maps in the super-transformer. In addition, to
adapt the searching for different budgets, we propose to search the sampling
probability of identity operation. Experimental results show that our ViTAS
attains excellent results compared to existing pure transformer architectures.
For example, with $1.3$G FLOPs budget, our searched architecture achieves
$74.7\%$ top-$1$ accuracy on ImageNet and is $2.5\%$ superior than the current
baseline ViT architecture. Code is available at

                                        <span>Advanced machine learning techniques have been used in remote sensing (RS)
applications such as crop mapping and yield prediction, but remain
under-utilized for tracking crop progress. In this study, we demonstrate the
use of agronomic knowledge of crop growth drivers in a Long Short-Term
Memory-based, Domain-guided neural network (DgNN) for in-season crop progress
estimation. The DgNN uses a branched structure and attention to separate
independent crop growth drivers and capture their varying importance throughout
the growing season. The DgNN is implemented for corn, using RS data in Iowa for
the period 2003-2019, with USDA crop progress reports used as ground truth.
State-wide DgNN performance shows significant improvement over sequential and
dense-only NN structures, and a widely-used Hidden Markov Model method. The
DgNN had a 3.5% higher Nash-Sutfliffe efficiency over all growth stages and 33%
more weeks with highest cosine similarity than the other NNs during test years.
The DgNN and Sequential NN were more robust during periods of abnormal crop
progress, though estimating the Silking-Grainfill transition was difficult for
all methods. Finally, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
visualizations of layer activations showed how LSTM-based NNs separate crop
growth time-series differently from a dense-only structure. Results from this
study exhibit both the viability of NNs in crop growth stage estimation (CGSE)
and the benefits of using domain knowledge. The DgNN methodology presented here
can be extended to provide near-real time CGSE of other crops.</span>

availability/perception (IAP) of alternatives and proposes a variational
autoencoder (VAE) approach for choice set generation and implicit perception of
alternatives. Specifically, the cross-nested logit (CNL) model with IAP is
derived as an example of IAP-GEV models. The VAE approach is adapted to model
the choice set generation process, in which the likelihood of perceiving chosen
alternatives in the choice set is maximized. The VAE approach for route choice
set generation is exemplified using a real dataset. IAP- CNL model estimated
has the best performance in terms of goodness-of-fit and prediction
performance, compared to multinomial logit models and conventional choice set
generation methods.</span>

                                        <span>We present a new second-order oracle bound for the expected risk of a
weighted majority vote. The bound is based on a novel parametric form of the
Chebyshev-Cantelli inequality (a.k.a.\ one-sided Chebyshev&#x27;s), which is
amenable to efficient minimization. The new form resolves the optimization
challenge faced by prior oracle bounds based on the Chebyshev-Cantelli
inequality, the C-bounds [Germain et al., 2015], and, at the same time, it
improves on the oracle bound based on second order Markov&#x27;s inequality
introduced by Masegosa et al. [2020]. We also derive the PAC-Bayes-Bennett
inequality, which we use for empirical estimation of the oracle bound. The
PAC-Bayes-Bennett inequality improves on the PAC-Bayes-Bernstein inequality by
Seldin et al. [2012]. We provide an empirical evaluation demonstrating that the
new bounds can improve on the work by Masegosa et al. [2020]. Both the
parametric form of the Chebyshev-Cantelli inequality and the PAC-Bayes-Bennett
inequality may be of independent interest for the study of concentration of

Verification (SV). In the proposed structure, the frame-level multi-task

on frame-level features in the main network for speaker classifier, with the
corresponding posterior probability for the phoneme distribution in the
auxiliary subnet. Further, the introduction of Squeeze and Excitation
(SE-block) performs dynamic channel-wise feature recalibration, which improves
the representational ability. The proposed method exploits speaker
idiosyncrasies associated with pass-phrases, and is further improved by the

                                        <span>Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire has frequently been used for
efficient depression preliminary screening. However, the uncontrollable
self-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively
answering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically,
facial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered
evaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered
evaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to
evidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding
question-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the
SDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical
framework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on
the questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a
hierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern
exploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for
question-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term
FE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of
each video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative
information and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity.
Then, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire
scores for final depression detection. Our thorough evaluations also show the
validity of fusing SDS evaluation and its video recording, and the superiority
of our framework to the conventional state-of-the-art temporal modeling
methods.</span>

properties of human intelligence. Decision-making systems that can perform
these types of reasoning have the potential to be more generalizable and
interpretable. Simulations have helped advance the state-of-the-art in this
domain, by providing the ability to systematically vary parameters (e.g.,
confounders) and generate examples of the outcomes in the case of
counterfactual scenarios. However, simulating complex temporal causal events in
multi-agent scenarios, such as those that exist in driving and vehicle
navigation, is challenging. To help address this, we present a high-fidelity
simulation environment that is designed for developing algorithms for causal
discovery and counterfactual reasoning in the safety-critical context. A core
component of our work is to introduce \textit{agency}, such that it is simple
to define and create complex scenarios using high-level definitions. The
vehicles then operate with agency to complete these objectives, meaning
low-level behaviors need only be controlled if necessary. We perform
experiments with three state-of-the-art methods to create baselines and
highlight the affordances of this environment. Finally, we highlight challenges

                                        <span>Binary matrix factorisation is an essential tool for identifying discrete
patterns in binary data. In this paper we consider the rank-k binary matrix
factorisation problem (k-BMF) under Boolean arithmetic: we are given an n x m
binary matrix X with possibly missing entries and need to find two binary
matrices A and B of dimension n x k and k x m respectively, which minimise the
distance between X and the Boolean product of A and B in the squared Frobenius
distance. We present a compact and two exponential size integer programs (IPs)
for k-BMF and show that the compact IP has a weak LP relaxation, while the
exponential size LPs have a stronger equivalent LP relaxation. We introduce a
new objective function, which differs from the traditional squared Frobenius
objective in attributing a weight to zero entries of the input matrix that is
proportional to the number of times the zero is erroneously covered in a rank-k
factorisation. For one of the exponential size IPs we describe a computational
approach based on column generation. Experimental results on synthetic and real
word datasets suggest that our integer programming approach is competitive
against available methods for k-BMF and provides accurate low-error
factorisations.</span>

                                        <span>One-class learning is the classic problem of fitting a model to the data for
which annotations are available only for a single class. In this paper, we
explore novel objectives for one-class learning, which we collectively refer to
as Generalized One-class Discriminative Subspaces (GODS). Our key idea is to
learn a pair of complementary classifiers to flexibly bound the one-class data
distribution, where the data belongs to the positive half-space of one of the
classifiers in the complementary pair and to the negative half-space of the
other. To avoid redundancy while allowing non-linearity in the classifier
decision surfaces, we propose to design each classifier as an orthonormal frame
and seek to learn these frames via jointly optimizing for two conflicting
objectives, namely: i) to minimize the distance between the two frames, and ii)
to maximize the margin between the frames and the data. The learned orthonormal
frames will thus characterize a piecewise linear decision surface that allows
for efficient inference, while our objectives seek to bound the data within a
minimal volume that maximizes the decision margin, thereby robustly capturing
the data distribution. We explore several variants of our formulation under
different constraints on the constituent classifiers, including kernelized
feature maps. We demonstrate the empirical benefits of our approach via
experiments on data from several applications in computer vision, such as
anomaly detection in video sequences, human poses, and human activities. We
also explore the generality and effectiveness of GODS for non-vision tasks via
experiments on several UCI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.</span>

                                        <span>Prompting language models (LMs) with training examples and task descriptions
has been seen as critical to recent successes in few-shot learning. In this
work, we show that finetuning LMs in the few-shot setting can considerably
reduce the need for prompt engineering. In fact, one can use null prompts,
prompts that contain neither task-specific templates nor training examples, and
achieve competitive accuracy to manually-tuned prompts across a wide range of
tasks. While finetuning LMs does introduce new parameters for each downstream
task, we show that this memory overhead can be substantially reduced:
finetuning only the bias terms can achieve comparable or better accuracy than
standard finetuning while only updating 0.1% of the parameters. All in all, we
recommend finetuning LMs for few-shot learning as it is more accurate, robust
to different prompts, and can be made nearly as efficient as using frozen LMs.</span>

media, counter hate speech generation is considered as an automatic way to
tackle this challenge. The counter hate speeches are supposed to appear as a
third voice to educate people and keep the social red lines bold without
limiting the freedom of speech principles. The counter hate speech generation
is based on the optimistic assumption that, any attempt to intervene the hate
speeches in social media can play a positive role in this context. Beyond that,
previous works ignored to investigate the sequence of comments before and after
counter speech. To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to
measure the counter hate speech impact from statistical point of view. In this
paper, we take the first step in this direction by measuring the counter hate
speech impact on the next comments in terms of Google Perspective Scores.
Furthermore, our experiments show that, counter hate speech can cause negative
impacts, a phenomena which is called aggression in social media.</span>

them a potentially interesting tool for interpretable machine learning. It has
been noted recently that their mechanics are closely related to neural

algorithm to simultaneously learn the structure of argumentative classification
models. To obtain a well interpretable model, the fitness function balances
sparseness and accuracy of the classifier. We discuss our algorithm and present

                                        <span>Statistical testing is widespread and critical for a variety of scientific
disciplines. The advent of machine learning and the increase of computing power
has increased the interest in the analysis and statistical testing of
multidimensional data. We extend the powerful Kolmogorov-Smirnov two sample
test to a high dimensional form in a similar manner to Fasano (Fasano, 1987).
We call our result the d-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (ddKS) and provide
three novel contributions therewith: we develop an analytical equation for the
significance of a given ddKS score, we provide an algorithm for computation of
ddKS on modern computing hardware that is of constant time complexity for small
sample sizes and dimensions, and we provide two approximate calculations of
ddKS: one that reduces the time complexity to linear at larger sample sizes,
and another that reduces the time complexity to linear with increasing
dimension. We perform power analysis of ddKS and its approximations on a corpus
of datasets and compare to other common high dimensional two sample tests and
distances: Hotelling&#x27;s T^2 test and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our ddKS test
performs well for all datasets, dimensions, and sizes tested, whereas the other
tests and distances fail to reject the null hypothesis on at least one dataset.
We therefore conclude that ddKS is a powerful multidimensional two sample test
for general use, and can be calculated in a fast and efficient manner using our
parallel or approximate methods. Open source implementations of all methods
described in this work are located at https://github.com/pnnl/ddks.</span>

                                        <span>Machine learning for building energy prediction has exploded in popularity in
recent years, yet understanding its limitations and potential for improvement
are lacking. The ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) Kaggle competition
was the largest building energy meter machine learning competition ever held
with 4,370 participants who submitted 39,403 predictions. The test data set
included two years of hourly electricity, hot water, chilled water, and steam
readings from 2,380 meters in 1,448 buildings at 16 locations. This paper
analyzes the various sources and types of residual model error from an
aggregation of the competition&#x27;s top 50 solutions. This analysis reveals the
limitations for machine learning using the standard model inputs of historical
meter, weather, and basic building metadata. The types of error are classified
according to the amount of time errors occur in each instance, abrupt versus
gradual behavior, the magnitude of error, and whether the error existed on
single buildings or several buildings at once from a single location. The
results show machine learning models have errors within a range of
acceptability on 79.1% of the test data. Lower magnitude model errors occur in
16.1% of the test data. These discrepancies can likely be addressed through
additional training data sources or innovations in machine learning. Higher
magnitude errors occur in 4.8% of the test data and are unlikely to be
accurately predicted regardless of innovation. There is a diversity of error
behavior depending on the energy meter type (electricity prediction models have

                                        <span>Many modern time-series datasets contain large numbers of output response
variables sampled for prolonged periods of time. For example, in neuroscience,
the activities of 100s-1000&#x27;s of neurons are recorded during behaviors and in
response to sensory stimuli. Multi-output Gaussian process models leverage the
nonparametric nature of Gaussian processes to capture structure across multiple
outputs. However, this class of models typically assumes that the correlations
between the output response variables are invariant in the input space.
Stochastic linear mixing models (SLMM) assume the mixture coefficients depend
on input, making them more flexible and effective to capture complex output
dependence. However, currently, the inference for SLMMs is intractable for
large datasets, making them inapplicable to several modern time-series
problems. In this paper, we propose a new regression framework, the orthogonal
stochastic linear mixing model (OSLMM) that introduces an orthogonal constraint
amongst the mixing coefficients. This constraint reduces the computational
burden of inference while retaining the capability to handle complex output
dependence. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo inference procedures for both
SLMM and OSLMM and demonstrate superior model scalability and reduced
prediction error of OSLMM compared with state-of-the-art methods on several
real-world applications. In neurophysiology recordings, we use the inferred
latent functions for compact visualization of population responses to auditory
stimuli, and demonstrate superior results compared to a competing method
(GPFA). Together, these results demonstrate that OSLMM will be useful for the
analysis of diverse, large-scale time-series datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Multifidelity simulation methodologies are often used in an attempt to
judiciously combine low-fidelity and high-fidelity simulation results in an
accuracy-increasing, cost-saving way. Candidates for this approach are
simulation methodologies for which there are fidelity differences connected
with significant computational cost differences. Physics-informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) are candidates for these types of approaches due to the
significant difference in training times required when different fidelities
(expressed in terms of architecture width and depth as well as optimization
criteria) are employed. In this paper, we propose a particular multifidelity
approach applied to PINNs that exploits low-rank structure. We demonstrate that
width, depth, and optimization criteria can be used as parameters related to
model fidelity, and show numerical justification of cost differences in
training due to fidelity parameter choices. We test our multifidelity scheme on
various canonical forward PDE models that have been presented in the emerging
PINNs literature.</span>

depending on multiple local clients, while keeping the training data
decentralized in order to preserve data privacy. However, standard FL methods
ignore the noisy client issue, which may harm the overall performance of the
aggregated model. In this paper, we first analyze the noisy client statement,
and then model noisy clients with different noise distributions (e.g.,
Bernoulli and truncated Gaussian distributions). To learn with noisy clients,
we propose a simple yet effective FL framework, named Federated Noisy Client
Learning (Fed-NCL), which is a plug-and-play algorithm and contains two main
components: a data quality measurement (DQM) to dynamically quantify the data
quality of each participating client, and a noise robust aggregation (NRA) to
adaptively aggregate the local models of each client by jointly considering the
amount of local training data and the data quality of each client. Our Fed-NCL
can be easily applied in any standard FL workflow to handle the noisy client
issue. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our algorithm
boosts the performances of different state-of-the-art systems with noisy

                                        <span>Physics perception very often faces the problem that only limited data or
partial measurements on the scene are available. In this work, we propose a
strategy to learn the full state of sloshing liquids from measurements of the
free surface. Our approach is based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) that
project the limited information available to a reduced-order manifold so as to
not only reconstruct the unknown information, but also to be capable of
performing fluid reasoning about future scenarios in real time. To obtain
physically consistent predictions, we train deep neural networks on the
reduced-order manifold that, through the employ of inductive biases, ensure the
fulfillment of the principles of thermodynamics. RNNs learn from history the
required hidden information to correlate the limited information with the
latent space where the simulation occurs. Finally, a decoder returns data back
to the high-dimensional manifold, so as to provide the user with insightful
information in the form of augmented reality. This algorithm is connected to a
computer vision system to test the performance of the proposed methodology with
real information, resulting in a system capable of understanding and predicting
future states of the observed fluid in real-time.</span>

byte-level n-gram embeddings. byteSteady assumes that each input comes as a
sequence of bytes. A representation vector is produced using the averaged
embedding vectors of byte-level n-grams, with a pre-defined set of n. The
hashing trick is used to reduce the number of embedding vectors. This input
representation vector is then fed into a linear classifier. A straightforward
application of byteSteady is text classification. We also apply byteSteady to
one type of non-language data -- DNA sequences for gene classification. For
both problems we achieved competitive classification results against strong
baselines, suggesting that byteSteady can be applied to both language and
non-language data. Furthermore, we find that simple compression using Huffman
coding does not significantly impact the results, which offers an
accuracy-speed trade-off previously unexplored in machine learning.</span>

called Post Selection Using Test Sets (PSUTS). Consequently, the popular
error-backprop methodology in deep learning lacks an acceptable generalization
power. All AI methods fall into two broad schools, connectionist and symbolic.
The PSUTS fall into two kinds, machine PSUTS and human PSUTS. The connectionist
school received criticisms for its &quot;scruffiness&quot; due to a huge number of
network parameters and now the worse machine PSUTS; but the seemingly &quot;clean&quot;
symbolic school seems more brittle because of a weaker generalization power
using human PSUTS. This paper formally defines what PSUTS is, analyzes why
error-backprop methods with random initial weights suffer from severe local
minima, why PSUTS violates well-established research ethics, and how every
paper that used PSUTS should have at least transparently reported PSUTS. For
improved transparency in future publications, this paper proposes a new
standard for performance evaluation of AI, called developmental errors for all
networks trained, along with Three Learning Conditions: (1) an incremental
learning architecture, (2) a training experience and (3) a limited amount of
computational resources. Developmental Networks avoid PSUTS and are not
&quot;scruffy&quot; because they drive Emergent Turing Machines and are optimal in the
sense of maximum-likelihood across lifetime.</span>

$d$-dimensional (sub)Gaussian distributions with unknown covariance.
Informally, given $n \gtrsim d/\alpha^2$ samples from such a distribution with
mean $\mu$ and covariance $\Sigma$, our estimators output $\tilde\mu$ such that
$\| \tilde\mu - \mu \|_{\Sigma} \leq \alpha$, where $\| \cdot \|_{\Sigma}$ is
the Mahalanobis distance. All previous estimators with the same guarantee
either require strong a priori bounds on the covariance matrix or require
$\Omega(d^{3/2})$ samples.

Each of our estimators is based on a simple, general approach to designing
differentially private mechanisms, but with novel technical steps to make the
estimator private and sample-efficient. Our first estimator samples a point
with approximately maximum Tukey depth using the exponential mechanism, but
restricted to the set of points of large Tukey depth. Proving that this
mechanism is private requires a novel analysis. Our second estimator perturbs
the empirical mean of the data set with noise calibrated to the empirical
covariance, without releasing the covariance itself. Its sample complexity
guarantees hold more generally for subgaussian distributions, albeit with a
slightly worse dependence on the privacy parameter. For both estimators,
careful preprocessing of the data is required to satisfy differential privacy.</span>

                                        <span>Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system for the deaf or hearing
impaired people. It combines lip movements with hand cues to obtain a complete
phonetic repertoire. Current deep learning based methods on automatic CS
recognition suffer from a common problem, which is the data scarcity. Until
now, there are only two public single speaker datasets for French (238
sentences) and British English (97 sentences). In this work, we propose a
cross-modal knowledge distillation method with teacher-student structure, which
transfers audio speech information to CS to overcome the limited data problem.
Firstly, we pretrain a teacher model for CS recognition with a large amount of
open source audio speech data, and simultaneously pretrain the feature
extractors for lips and hands using CS data. Then, we distill the knowledge
from teacher model to the student model with frame-level and sequence-level
distillation strategies. Importantly, for frame-level, we exploit multi-task
learning to weigh losses automatically, to obtain the balance coefficient.
Besides, we establish a five-speaker British English CS dataset for the first

                                        <span>In this paper, we address the problem of high performance and computationally
efficient content-based video retrieval in large-scale datasets. Current
methods typically propose either: (i) fine-grained approaches employing
spatio-temporal representations and similarity calculations, achieving high
performance at a high computational cost or (ii) coarse-grained approaches
representing/indexing videos as global vectors, where the spatio-temporal
structure is lost, providing low performance but also having low computational
cost. In this work, we propose a Knowledge Distillation framework, which we
call Distill-and-Select (DnS), that starting from a well-performing
fine-grained Teacher Network learns: a) Student Networks at different retrieval
performance and computational efficiency trade-offs and b) a Selection Network
that at test time rapidly directs samples to the appropriate student to
maintain both high retrieval performance and high computational efficiency. We
train several students with different architectures and arrive at different
trade-offs of performance and efficiency, i.e., speed and storage requirements,
including fine-grained students that store index videos using binary
representations. Importantly, the proposed scheme allows Knowledge Distillation
in large, unlabelled datasets -- this leads to good students. We evaluate DnS
on five public datasets on three different video retrieval tasks and
demonstrate a) that our students achieve state-of-the-art performance in
several cases and b) that our DnS framework provides an excellent trade-off
between retrieval performance, computational speed, and storage space. In
specific configurations, our method achieves similar mAP with the teacher but
is 20 times faster and requires 240 times less storage space. Our collected
dataset and implementation are publicly available:

                                        <span>Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire has frequently been used for
efficient depression preliminary screening. However, the uncontrollable
self-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively
answering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically,
facial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered
evaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered
evaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to
evidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding
question-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the
SDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical
framework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on
the questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a
hierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern
exploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for
question-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term
FE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of
each video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative
information and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity.
Then, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire
scores for final depression detection. Our thorough evaluations also show the
validity of fusing SDS evaluation and its video recording, and the superiority
of our framework to the conventional state-of-the-art temporal modeling
methods.</span>

                                        <span>Much of the delivery of University education is now by synchronous or
asynchronous video. For students, one of the challenges is managing the sheer
volume of such video material as video presentations of taught material are
difficult to abbreviate and summarise because they do not have highlights which
stand out. Apart from video bookmarks there are no tools available to determine
which parts of video content should be replayed at revision time or just before
examinations. We have developed and deployed a digital library for managing
video learning material which has many dozens of hours of short-form video
content from a range of taught courses for hundreds of students at
undergraduate level. Through a web browser we allow students to access and play
these videos and we log their anonymised playback usage. From these logs we
score to each segment of each video based on the amount of playback it receives
from across all students, whether the segment has been re-wound and re-played
in the same student session, whether the on-screen window is the window in
focus on the student&#x27;s desktop/laptop, and speed of playback. We also
incorporate negative scoring if a video segment is skipped or fast-forward, and
overarching all this we include a decay function based on recency of playback,
so the most recent days of playback contribute more to the video segment
scores. For each video in the library we present a usage-based graph which
allows students to see which parts of each video attract the most playback from
their peers, which helps them select material at revision time. Usage of the
system is fully anonymised and GDPR-compliant.</span>

                                        <span>The paper presents a new approach to multiview video coding using Screen
Content Coding. It is assumed that for a time instant the frames corresponding
to all views are packed into a single frame, i.e. the frame-compatible approach
to multiview coding is applied. For such coding scenario, the paper
demonstrates that Screen Content Coding can be efficiently used for multiview
video coding. Two approaches are considered: the first using standard HEVC
Screen Content Coding, and the second using Advanced Screen Content Coding. The
latter is the original proposal of the authors that exploits quarter-pel motion
vectors and other nonstandard extensions of HEVC Screen Content Coding. The
experimental results demonstrate that multiview video coding even using
standard HEVC Screen Content Coding is much more efficient than simulcast HEVC
coding. The proposed Advanced Screen Content Coding provides virtually the same
coding efficiency as MV-HEVC, which is the state-of-the-art multiview video
compression technique. The authors suggest that Advanced Screen Content Coding
can be efficiently used within the new Versatile Video Coding (VVC) technology.
Nevertheless a reference multiview extension of VVC does not exist yet,
therefore, for VVC-based coding, the experimental comparisons are left for
future work.</span>

over a knowledge graph. For this task, we propose LASAGNE (muLti-task semAntic
parSing with trAnsformer and Graph atteNtion nEtworks). It is the first
approach, which employs a transformer architecture extended with Graph
Attention Networks for multi-task neural semantic parsing. LASAGNE uses a
transformer model for generating the base logical forms, while the Graph
Attention model is used to exploit correlations between (entity) types and
predicates to produce node representations. LASAGNE also includes a novel
entity recognition module which detects, links, and ranks all relevant entities
in the question context. We evaluate LASAGNE on a standard dataset for complex
sequential question answering, on which it outperforms existing baseline
averages on all question types. Specifically, we show that LASAGNE improves the
F1-score on eight out of ten question types; in some cases, the increase in
F1-score is more than 20% compared to the state of the art.</span>

                                        <span>In spoken conversational question answering (SCQA), the answer to the
corresponding question is generated by retrieving and then analyzing a fixed
spoken document, including multi-part conversations. Most SCQA systems have
considered only retrieving information from ordered utterances. However, the
sequential order of dialogue is important to build a robust spoken
conversational question answering system, and the changes of utterances order
may severely result in low-quality and incoherent corpora. To this end, we
introduce a self-supervised learning approach, including incoherence
discrimination, insertion detection, and question prediction, to explicitly
capture the coreference resolution and dialogue coherence among spoken
documents. Specifically, we design a joint learning framework where the
auxiliary self-supervised tasks can enable the pre-trained SCQA systems towards
more coherent and meaningful spoken dialogue learning. We also utilize the
proposed self-supervised learning tasks to capture intra-sentence coherence.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method provides more
coherent, meaningful, and appropriate responses, yielding superior performance
gains compared to the original pre-trained language models. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the Spoken-CoQA dataset.</span>

                                        <span>QA models based on pretrained language mod-els have achieved remarkable
performance on various benchmark datasets.However, QA models do not generalize
well to unseen data that falls outside the training distribution, due to
distributional shifts.Data augmentation (DA) techniques which drop/replace
words have shown to be effective in regularizing the model from overfitting to
the training data.Yet, they may adversely affect the QA tasks since they incur
semantic changes that may lead to wrong answers for the QA task. To tackle this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective DA method based on a stochastic
noise generator, which learns to perturb the word embedding of the input
questions and context without changing their semantics. We validate the
performance of the QA models trained with our word embedding perturbation on a
single source dataset, on five different target domains.The results show that
our method significantly outperforms the baselineDA methods. Notably, the model
trained with ours outperforms the model trained with more than 240K
artificially generated QA pairs.</span>

Answering (QA) systems over knowledge graphs. Such methods provide the
flexibility to handle QA datasets with complex queries and a large number of
entities. In this work, we propose a novel framework named CARTON, which
performs multi-task semantic parsing for handling the problem of conversational
question answering over a large-scale knowledge graph. Our framework consists
of a stack of pointer networks as an extension of a context transformer model
for parsing the input question and the dialog history. The framework generates
a sequence of actions that can be executed on the knowledge graph. We evaluate
CARTON on a standard dataset for complex sequential question answering on which
CARTON outperforms all baselines. Specifically, we observe performance
improvements in F1-score on eight out of ten question types compared to the
previous state of the art. For logical reasoning questions, an improvement of
11 absolute points is reached.</span>

intelligent robots to interpret human language better and act accordingly. We
model the social network as an And-or Graph, named SocAoG, for the consistency
of relations among a group and leveraging attributes as inference cues.
Moreover, we formulate a sequential structure prediction task, and propose an
$\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ strategy to incrementally parse SocAoG for the
dynamic inference upon any incoming utterance: (i) an $\alpha$ process
predicting attributes and relations conditioned on the semantics of dialogues,
(ii) a $\beta$ process updating the social relations based on related
attributes, and (iii) a $\gamma$ process updating individual&#x27;s attributes based
on interpersonal social relations. Empirical results on DialogRE and MovieGraph
show that our model infers social relations more accurately than the
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study shows the three
processes complement each other, and the case study demonstrates the dynamic
relational inference.</span>

proposing new benchmarks and metrics to measure them. With these tools, we

complex dialogue flow given the speech utterances and text corpora. Different
from traditional text question answering (QA) tasks, SCQA involves audio signal
processing, passage comprehension, and contextual understanding. However, ASR
systems introduce unexpected noisy signals to the transcriptions, which result
in performance degradation on SCQA. To overcome the problem, we propose CADNet,
a novel contextualized attention-based distillation approach, which applies
both cross-attention and self-attention to obtain ASR-robust contextualized
embedding representations of the passage and dialogue history for performance
improvements. We also introduce the spoken conventional knowledge distillation
framework to distill the ASR-robust knowledge from the estimated probabilities
of the teacher model to the student. We conduct extensive experiments on the

put on interpreting their representations. One of the most prominent approaches
is structural probing (Hewitt and Manning, 2019), where a linear projection of
word embeddings is performed in order to approximate the topology of dependency
structures. In this work, we introduce a new type of structural probing, where
the linear projection is decomposed into 1. isomorphic space rotation; 2.
linear scaling that identifies and scales the most relevant dimensions. In
addition to syntactic dependency, we evaluate our method on novel tasks
(lexical hypernymy and position in a sentence). We jointly train the probes for
multiple tasks and experimentally show that lexical and syntactic information
is separated in the representations. Moreover, the orthogonal constraint makes
the Structural Probes less vulnerable to memorization.</span>

In this work, we propose a novel task for Narrative Understanding: Emotion
Carrier Recognition (ECR). Emotion carriers, the text fragments that carry the
emotions of the narrator (e.g. loss of a grandpa, high school reunion), provide
a fine-grained description of the emotion state. We explore the task of ECR in

access to advanced medical care. The ability to accurately and efficiently
predict mood from easily collectible data has several important implications
for the early detection, intervention, and treatment of mental health
disorders. One promising data source to help monitor human behavior is daily
smartphone usage. However, care must be taken to summarize behaviors without
identifying the user through personal (e.g., personally identifiable
information) or protected (e.g., race, gender) attributes. In this paper, we
study behavioral markers of daily mood using a recent dataset of mobile
behaviors from adolescent populations at high risk of suicidal behaviors. Using
computational models, we find that language and multimodal representations of
mobile typed text (spanning typed characters, words, keystroke timings, and app
usage) are predictive of daily mood. However, we find that models trained to
predict mood often also capture private user identities in their intermediate
representations. To tackle this problem, we evaluate approaches that obfuscate
user identity while remaining predictive. By combining multimodal
representations with privacy-preserving learning, we are able to push forward
the performance-privacy frontier.</span>

                                        <span>Initially developed for natural language processing (NLP), Transformers are
now widely used for source code processing, due to the format similarity
between source code and text. In contrast to natural language, source code is
strictly structured, i.e., it follows the syntax of the programming language.
Several recent works develop Transformer modifications for capturing syntactic
information in source code. The drawback of these works is that they do not
compare to each other and consider different tasks. In this work, we conduct a
thorough empirical study of the capabilities of Transformers to utilize
syntactic information in different tasks. We consider three tasks (code
completion, function naming and bug fixing) and re-implement different
syntax-capturing modifications in a unified framework. We show that
Transformers are able to make meaningful predictions based purely on syntactic
information and underline the best practices of taking the syntactic
information into account for improving the performance of the model.</span>

supervised NLP tasks. However, annotated data for every target task in every
target language is rare, especially for low-resource languages. We propose
UXLA, a novel unsupervised data augmentation framework for zero-resource
transfer learning scenarios. In particular, UXLA aims to solve cross-lingual
adaptation problems from a source language task distribution to an unknown
target language task distribution, assuming no training label in the target
language. At its core, UXLA performs simultaneous self-training with data
augmentation and unsupervised sample selection. To show its effectiveness, we
conduct extensive experiments on three diverse zero-resource cross-lingual
transfer tasks. UXLA achieves SoTA results in all the tasks, outperforming the
baselines by a good margin. With an in-depth framework dissection, we
demonstrate the cumulative contributions of different components to its
success.</span>

contrast case). Despite the influential role that contrastivity plays in how
humans explain, this property is largely missing from current methods for
explaining NLP models. We present Minimal Contrastive Editing (MiCE), a method
for producing contrastive explanations of model predictions in the form of
edits to inputs that change model outputs to the contrast case. Our experiments
across three tasks--binary sentiment classification, topic classification, and
multiple-choice question answering--show that MiCE is able to produce edits
that are not only contrastive, but also minimal and fluent, consistent with
human contrastive edits. We demonstrate how MiCE edits can be used for two use
cases in NLP system development--debugging incorrect model outputs and
uncovering dataset artifacts--and thereby illustrate that producing contrastive
explanations is a promising research direction for model interpretability.</span>

                                        <span>Spoken language understanding (SLU) topic has seen a lot of progress these
last three years, with the emergence of end-to-end neural approaches. Spoken
language understanding refers to natural language processing tasks related to
semantic extraction from speech signal, like named entity recognition from
speech or slot filling task in a context of human-machine dialogue.
Classically, SLU tasks were processed through a cascade approach that consists
in applying, firstly, an automatic speech recognition process, followed by a
natural language processing module applied to the automatic transcriptions.
These three last years, end-to-end neural approaches, based on deep neural
networks, have been proposed in order to directly extract the semantics from
speech signal, by using a single neural model. More recent works on
self-supervised training with unlabeled data open new perspectives in term of
performance for automatic speech recognition and natural language processing.
In this paper, we present a brief overview of the recent advances on the French
MEDIA benchmark dataset for SLU, with or without the use of additional data. We
also present our last results that significantly outperform the current
state-of-the-art with a Concept Error Rate (CER) of 11.2%, instead of 13.6% for
the last state-of-the-art system presented this year.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in transformers have enabled Table Question Answering (Table
QA) systems to achieve high accuracy and SOTA results on open domain datasets
like WikiTableQuestions and WikiSQL. Such transformers are frequently
pre-trained on open-domain content such as Wikipedia, where they effectively
encode questions and corresponding tables from Wikipedia as seen in Table QA
dataset. However, web tables in Wikipedia are notably flat in their layout,
with the first row as the sole column header. The layout lends to a relational
view of tables where each row is a tuple. Whereas, tables in domain-specific
business or scientific documents often have a much more complex layout,
including hierarchical row and column headers, in addition to having
specialized vocabulary terms from that domain.

To address this problem, we introduce the domain-specific Table QA dataset
AIT-QA (Airline Industry Table QA). The dataset consists of 515 questions
authored by human annotators on 116 tables extracted from public U.S. SEC
filings (publicly available at: https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml) of major
airline companies for the fiscal years 2017-2019. We also provide annotations
pertaining to the nature of questions, marking those that require hierarchical
headers, domain-specific terminology, and paraphrased forms. Our zero-shot
baseline evaluation of three transformer-based SOTA Table QA methods - TaPAS
(end-to-end), TaBERT (semantic parsing-based), and RCI (row-column
encoding-based) - clearly exposes the limitation of these methods in this
practical setting, with the best accuracy at just 51.8\% (RCI). We also present
pragmatic table preprocessing steps used to pivot and project these complex
tables into a layout suitable for the SOTA Table QA models.</span>

important to understand the quality of the advice they receive. In this paper,
we explore the role of expertise in responses provided to help-seeking posts
regarding mental health. We study the differences between (1) interactions with
peers; and (2) interactions with self-identified mental health professionals.
First, we show that a classifier can distinguish between these two groups,
indicating that their language use does in fact differ. To understand this
difference, we perform several analyses addressing engagement aspects,
including whether their comments engage the support-seeker further as well as
linguistic aspects, such as dominant language and linguistic style matching.
Our work contributes toward the developing efforts of understanding how health
experts engage with health information- and support-seekers in social networks.
More broadly, it is a step toward a deeper understanding of the styles of

                                        <span>Topic segmentation of meetings is the task of dividing multi-person meeting
transcripts into topic blocks. Supervised approaches to the problem have proven
intractable due to the difficulties in collecting and accurately annotating
large datasets. In this paper we show how previous unsupervised topic
segmentation methods can be improved using pre-trained neural architectures. We
introduce an unsupervised approach based on BERT embeddings that achieves a
15.5% reduction in error rate over existing unsupervised approaches applied to

phrase, tail noun phrase) triples such as (tesla, return to, new york)
extracted from a corpus using OpenIE tools. While OpenKGs are easy to bootstrap
for a domain, they are very sparse and far from being directly usable in an end
task. Therefore, the task of predicting new facts, i.e., link prediction,
becomes an important step while using these graphs in downstream tasks such as
text comprehension, question answering, and web search query recommendation.
Learning embeddings for OpenKGs is one approach for link prediction that has
received some attention lately. However, on careful examination, we found that
current OpenKG link prediction algorithms often predict noun phrases (NPs) with
incompatible types for given noun and relation phrases. We address this problem
in this work and propose OKGIT that improves OpenKG link prediction using novel
type compatibility score and type regularization. With extensive experiments on
multiple datasets, we show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance while producing type compatible NPs in the link prediction task.</span>

dimensional vectors, enabling efficient speech search and discovery. Previous
work explored how embeddings can be obtained in zero-resource settings where no
labelled data is available in the target language. The current best approach
uses transfer learning: a single supervised multilingual model is trained using
labelled data from multiple well-resourced languages and then applied to a
target zero-resource language (without fine-tuning). However, it is still
unclear how the specific choice of training languages affect downstream
performance. Concretely, here we ask whether it is beneficial to use training
languages related to the target. Using data from eleven languages spoken in
Southern Africa, we experiment with adding data from different language
families while controlling for the amount of data per language. In word
discrimination and query-by-example search evaluations, we show that training
on languages from the same family gives large improvements. Through
finer-grained analysis, we show that training on even just a single related
language gives the largest gain. We also find that adding data from unrelated
languages generally doesn&#x27;t hurt performance.</span>

obfuscating the source language of a text becomes more attractive. In this
paper, we analyze the ability to detect the source language from the translated
output of two widely used commercial machine translation systems by utilizing
machine-learning algorithms with basic textual features like n-grams.
Evaluations show that the source language can be reconstructed with high

addition, we analyze how the document size influences the performance of the
prediction, as well as how limiting the set of possible source languages

                                        <span>OBJECTIVE: Leverage existing biomedical NLP tools and DS domain terminology
to produce a novel and comprehensive knowledge graph containing dietary
supplement (DS) information for discovering interactions between DS and drugs,
or Drug-Supplement Interactions (DSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created
SemRepDS (an extension of SemRep), capable of extracting semantic relations
from abstracts by leveraging a DS-specific terminology (iDISK) containing
28,884 DS terms not found in the UMLS. PubMed abstracts were processed using
SemRepDS to generate semantic relations, which were then filtered using a
PubMedBERT-based model to remove incorrect relations before generating our
knowledge graph (SuppKG). Two pathways are used to identify potential DS-Drug
interactions which are then evaluated by medical professionals for mechanistic
plausibility. RESULTS: Comparison analysis found that SemRepDS returned 206.9%
more DS relations and 158.5% more DS entities than SemRep. The fine-tuned BERT
model obtained an F1 score of 0.8605 and removed 43.86% of the relations,
improving the precision of the relations by 26.4% compared to pre-filtering.
SuppKG consists of 2,928 DS-specific nodes. Manual review of findings
identified 44 (88%) proposed DS-Gene-Drug and 32 (64%) proposed
DS-Gene1-Function-Gene2-Drug pathways to be mechanistically plausible.
DISCUSSION: The additional relations extracted using SemRepDS generated SuppKG
that was used to find plausible DSI not found in the current literature. By the
nature of the SuppKG, these interactions are unlikely to have been found using
SemRep without the expanded DS terminology. CONCLUSION: We successfully extend
SemRep to include DS information and produce SuppKG which can be used to find
potential DS-Drug interactions.</span>

                                        <span>Given the clinical notes written in electronic health records (EHRs), it is
challenging to predict the diagnostic codes which is formulated as a
multi-label classification task. The large set of labels, the hierarchical
dependency, and the imbalanced data make this prediction task extremely hard.
Most existing work built a binary prediction for each label independently,
ignoring the dependencies between labels. To address this problem, we propose a
two-stage framework to improve automatic ICD coding by capturing the label
correlation. Specifically, we train a label set distribution estimator to
rescore the probability of each label set candidate generated by a base
predictor. This paper is the first attempt at learning the label set
distribution as a reranking module for medical code prediction. In the
experiments, our proposed framework is able to improve upon best-performing
predictors on the benchmark MIMIC datasets. The source code of this project is

Translation task. We participated with a direct model, which is a
Transformer-based architecture trained to translate English speech audio data
into German texts. The training pipeline is characterized by knowledge
distillation and a two-step fine-tuning procedure. Both knowledge distillation
and the first fine-tuning step are carried out on manually segmented real and
synthetic data, the latter being generated with an MT system trained on the
available corpora. Differently, the second fine-tuning step is carried out on a
random segmentation of the MuST-C v2 En-De dataset. Its main goal is to reduce
the performance drops occurring when a speech translation model trained on
manually segmented data (i.e. an ideal, sentence-like segmentation) is
evaluated on automatically segmented audio (i.e. actual, more realistic testing
conditions). For the same purpose, a custom hybrid segmentation procedure that
accounts for both audio content (pauses) and for the length of the produced
segments is applied to the test data before passing them to the system. At
inference time, we compared this procedure with a baseline segmentation method
based on Voice Activity Detection (VAD). Our results indicate the effectiveness
of the proposed hybrid approach, shown by a reduction of the gap with manual
segmentation from 8.3 to 1.4 BLEU points.</span>

                                        <span>Despite rapid developments in the field of machine learning research,
collecting high-quality labels for supervised learning remains a bottleneck for
many applications. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that
state-of-the-art models for NLP tasks are becoming deeper and more complex,
often increasing the amount of training data required even for fine-tuning.
Weak supervision methods, including data programming, address this problem and
reduce the cost of label collection by using noisy label sources for
supervision. However, until recently, data programming was only accessible to
users who knew how to program. To bridge this gap, the Data Programming by
Demonstration framework was proposed to facilitate the automatic creation of
labeling functions based on a few examples labeled by a domain expert. This
framework has proven successful for generating high-accuracy labeling models
for document classification. In this work, we extend the DPBD framework to
span-level annotation tasks, arguably one of the most time-consuming NLP
labeling tasks. We built a novel tool, TagRuler, that makes it easy for
annotators to build span-level labeling functions without programming and
encourages them to explore trade-offs between different labeling models and
active learning strategies. We empirically demonstrated that an annotator could
achieve a higher F1 score using the proposed tool compared to manual labeling
for different span-level annotation tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Service manual documents are crucial to the engineering company as they
provide guidelines and knowledge to service engineers. However, it has become
inconvenient and inefficient for service engineers to retrieve specific
knowledge from documents due to the complexity of resources. In this research,
we propose an automated knowledge mining and document classification system
with novel multi-model transfer learning approaches. Particularly, the
classification performance of the system has been improved with three effective
techniques: fine-tuning, pruning, and multi-model method. The fine-tuning
technique optimizes a pre-trained BERT model by adding a feed-forward neural
network layer and the pruning technique is used to retrain the BERT model with
new data. The multi-model method initializes and trains multiple BERT models to
overcome the randomness of data ordering during the fine-tuning process. In the
first iteration of the training process, multiple BERT models are being trained
simultaneously. The best model is then selected for the next phase of the
training process with another two iterations and the training processes for
other BERT models will be terminated. The performance of the proposed system
has been evaluated by comparing with two robust baseline methods, BERT and
BERT-CNN. Experimental results on a widely used Corpus of Linguistic
Acceptability (CoLA) dataset have shown that the proposed techniques perform
better than these baseline methods in terms of accuracy and MCC score.</span>

designed for a learning task when annotated data is scarce, for example, in
depressive language detection from Tweets. We start with a rich word embedding
pre-trained from a large general dataset, which is then augmented with
embeddings learned from a much smaller and more specific domain dataset through
a simple non-linear mapping mechanism. We also experimented with several other
more sophisticated methods of such mapping including, several auto-encoder
based and custom loss-function based methods that learn embedding
representations through gradually learning to be close to the words of similar
semantics and distant to dissimilar semantics. Our strengthened representations
better capture the semantics of the depression domain, as it combines the
semantics learned from the specific domain coupled with word coverage from the
general language. We also present a comparative performance analyses of our
word embedding representations with a simple bag-of-words model, well known
sentiment and psycholinguistic lexicons, and a general pre-trained word
embedding. When used as feature representations for several different machine
learning methods, including deep learning models in a depressive Tweets
identification task, we show that our augmented word embedding representations
achieve a significantly better F1 score than the others, specially when applied
to a high quality dataset. Also, we present several data ablation tests which
confirm the efficacy of our augmentation techniques.</span>

                                        <span>With the increasing scale of search engine marketing, designing an efficient
bidding system is becoming paramount for the success of e-commerce companies.
The critical challenges faced by a modern industrial-level bidding system
include: 1. the catalog is enormous, and the relevant bidding features are of
high sparsity; 2. the large volume of bidding requests induces significant
computation burden to both the offline and online serving. Leveraging
extraneous user-item information proves essential to mitigate the sparsity
issue, for which we exploit the natural language signals from the users&#x27; query
and the contextual knowledge from the products. In particular, we extract the
vector representations of ads via the Transformer model and leverage their
geometric relation to building collaborative bidding predictions via
clustering. The two-step procedure also significantly reduces the computation
stress of bid evaluation and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the
end-to-end structure of the bidding system for search engine marketing for
Walmart e-commerce, which successfully handles tens of millions of bids each
day. We analyze the online and offline performances of our approach and discuss
how we find it as a production-efficient solution.</span>

subword tokenization algorithms, which limit their generalization ability and
adaptation to new settings. In this paper, we propose a new model inductive
bias that learns a subword tokenization end-to-end as part of the model. To
this end, we introduce a soft gradient-based subword tokenization module (GBST)
that automatically learns latent subword representations from characters in a
data-driven fashion. Concretely, GBST enumerates candidate subword blocks and
learns to score them in a position-wise fashion using a block scoring network.
We additionally introduce Charformer, a deep Transformer model that integrates
GBST and operates on the byte level. Via extensive experiments on English GLUE,
multilingual, and noisy text datasets, we show that Charformer outperforms a
series of competitive byte-level baselines while generally performing on par
and sometimes outperforming subword-based models. Additionally, Charformer is
fast, improving the speed of both vanilla byte-level and subword-level
Transformers by 28%-100% while maintaining competitive quality. We believe this
work paves the way for highly performant token-free models that are trained

                                        <span>The clinical named entity recognition (CNER) task seeks to locate and
classify clinical terminologies into predefined categories, such as diagnostic
procedure, disease disorder, severity, medication, medication dosage, and sign
symptom. CNER facilitates the study of side-effect on medications including
identification of novel phenomena and human-focused information extraction.
Existing approaches in extracting the entities of interests focus on using
static word embeddings to represent each word. However, one word can have
different interpretations that depend on the context of the sentences.
Evidently, static word embeddings are insufficient to integrate the diverse
interpretation of a word. To overcome this challenge, the technique of
contextualized word embedding has been introduced to better capture the
semantic meaning of each word based on its context. Two of these language
models, ELMo and Flair, have been widely used in the field of Natural Language
Processing to generate the contextualized word embeddings on domain-generic
documents. However, these embeddings are usually too general to capture the
proximity among vocabularies of specific domains. To facilitate various
downstream applications using clinical case reports (CCRs), we pre-train two
deep contextualized language models, Clinical Embeddings from Language Model
(C-ELMo) and Clinical Contextual String Embeddings (C-Flair) using the
clinical-related corpus from the PubMed Central. Explicit experiments show that
our models gain dramatic improvements compared to both static word embeddings
and domain-generic language models.</span>

                                        <span>The self-attention-based model, transformer, is recently becoming the leading
backbone in the field of computer vision. In spite of the impressive success
made by transformers in a variety of vision tasks, it still suffers from heavy
computation and intensive memory cost. To address this limitation, this paper
presents an Interpretability-Aware REDundancy REDuction framework (IA-RED$^2$).
We start by observing a large amount of redundant computation, mainly spent on
uncorrelated input patches, and then introduce an interpretable module to
dynamically and gracefully drop these redundant patches. This novel framework
is then extended to a hierarchical structure, where uncorrelated tokens at
different stages are gradually removed, resulting in a considerable shrinkage
of computational cost. We include extensive experiments on both image and video
tasks, where our method could deliver up to 1.4X speed-up for state-of-the-art
models like DeiT and TimeSformer, by only sacrificing less than 0.7% accuracy.
More importantly, contrary to other acceleration approaches, our method is
inherently interpretable with substantial visual evidence, making vision
transformer closer to a more human-understandable architecture while being
lighter. We demonstrate that the interpretability that naturally emerged in our
framework can outperform the raw attention learned by the original visual
transformer, as well as those generated by off-the-shelf interpretation
methods, with both qualitative and quantitative results. Project Page:

data. However, despite achieving good generalization on few-shot classification
tasks, it is still challenging to improve the adversarial robustness of the
meta-learning model in few-shot learning. Although adversarial training (AT)
methods such as Adversarial Query (AQ) can improve the adversarially robust
performance of meta-learning models, AT is still computationally expensive
training. On the other hand, meta-learning models trained with AT will drop
significant accuracy on the original clean images. This paper proposed a
meta-learning method on the adversarially robust neural network called
Long-term Cross Adversarial Training (LCAT). LCAT will update meta-learning
model parameters cross along the natural and adversarial sample distribution
direction with long-term to improve both adversarial and clean few-shot
classification accuracy. Due to cross-adversarial training, LCAT only needs
half of the adversarial training epoch than AQ, resulting in a low adversarial
training computation. Experiment results show that LCAT achieves superior
performance both on the clean and adversarial few-shot classification accuracy
than SOTA adversarial training methods for meta-learning models.</span>

                                        <span>The assessment of laboratory animal behavior is of central interest in modern
neuroscience research. Behavior is typically studied in terms of pose changes,
which are ideally captured in three dimensions. This requires triangulation
over a multi-camera system which view the animal from different angles.
However, this is challenging in realistic laboratory setups due to occlusions
and other technical constrains. Here we propose the usage of lift-pose models
that allow for robust 3D pose estimation of freely moving rodents from a single
view camera view. To obtain high-quality training data for the pose-lifting, we
first perform geometric calibration in a camera setup involving bottom as well
as side views of the behaving animal. We then evaluate the performance of two
previously proposed model architectures under given inference perspectives and
conclude that reliable 3D pose inference can be obtained using temporal
convolutions. With this work we would like to contribute to a more robust and
diverse behavior tracking of freely moving rodents for a wide range of
experiments and setups in the neuroscience community.</span>

complex problems, the likes of which we could not have imagined a few decades
back. But as many benefits as it brings, there are still ways in which it can
be used to bring harm to our society. Deep fakes have been proven to be one
such problem, and now more than ever, when any individual can create a fake
image or video simply using an application on the smartphone, there need to be
some countermeasures, with which we can detect if the image or video is a fake
or real and dispose of the problem threatening the trustworthiness of online
information. Although the Deep fakes created by neural networks, may seem to be
as real as a real image or video, it still leaves behind spatial and temporal
traces or signatures after moderation, these signatures while being invisible
to a human eye can be detected with the help of a neural network trained to
specialize in Deep fake detection. In this paper, we analyze several such
states of the art neural networks (MesoNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and Xception
Net) and compare them against each other, to find an optimal solution for
various scenarios like real-time deep fake detection to be deployed in online
social media platforms where the classification should be made as fast as
possible or for a small news agency where the classification need not be in
real-time but requires utmost accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Self-supervised deep learning methods have leveraged stereo images for
training monocular depth estimation. Although these methods show strong results
on outdoor datasets such as KITTI, they do not match performance of supervised
methods on indoor environments with camera rotation. Indoor, rotated scenes are
common for less constrained applications and pose problems for two reasons:
abundance of low texture regions and increased complexity of depth cues for
images under rotation. In an effort to extend self-supervised learning to more
generalised environments we propose two additions. First, we propose a novel
Filled Disparity Loss term that corrects for ambiguity of image reconstruction
error loss in textureless regions. Specifically, we interpolate disparity in
untextured regions, using the estimated disparity from surrounding textured
areas, and use L1 loss to correct the original estimation. Our experiments show
that depth estimation is substantially improved on low-texture scenes, without
any loss on textured scenes, when compared to Monodepth by Godard et al.
Secondly, we show that training with an application&#x27;s representative rotations,
in both pitch and roll, is sufficient to significantly improve performance over
the entire range of expected rotation. We demonstrate that depth estimation is
successfully generalised as performance is not lost when evaluated on test sets
with no camera rotation. Together these developments enable a broader use of
self-supervised learning of monocular depth estimation for complex
environments.</span>

                                        <span>Lane detection is an essential part of the perception sub-architecture of any
automated driving (AD) or advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). When
focusing on low-cost, large scale products for automated driving, model-driven
approaches for the detection of lane markings have proven good performance.
More recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed that target the
drivable area / freespace mainly in inner-city applications. Focus of these
approaches is less on lane-based driving due to the fact that the lane concept
does not fully apply in unstructured, residential inner-city environments.
So-far the concept of drivable area is seldom used for highway and inter-urban
applications due to the specific requirements of these scenarios that require
clear lane associations of all traffic participants. We believe that
lane-based, mapless driving in inter-urban and highway scenarios is still not
fully handled with sufficient robustness and availability. Especially for
challenging weather situations such as heavy rain, fog, low-standing sun,
darkness or reflections in puddles, the mapless detection of lane markings
decreases significantly or completely fails. We see potential in applying
specifically designed data-driven freespace approaches in more lane-based
driving applications for highways and inter-urban use. Therefore, we propose to
classify specifically a drivable corridor of the ego lane on pixel level with a
deep learning approach. Our approach is kept computationally efficient with
only 0.66 million parameters allowing its application in large scale products.
Thus, we were able to easily integrate into an online AD system of a test
vehicle. We demonstrate the performance of our approach under challenging
conditions qualitatively and quantitatively in comparison to a state-of-the-art
model-driven approach.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate lighting estimation is challenging yet critical to many computer
vision and computer graphics tasks such as high-dynamic-range (HDR) relighting.
Existing approaches model lighting in either frequency domain or spatial domain
which is insufficient to represent the complex lighting conditions in scenes
and tends to produce inaccurate estimation. This paper presents NeedleLight, a
new lighting estimation model that represents illumination with needlets and
allows lighting estimation in both frequency domain and spatial domain jointly.
An optimal thresholding function is designed to achieve sparse needlets which
trims redundant lighting parameters and demonstrates superior localization
properties for illumination representation. In addition, a novel spherical
transport loss is designed based on optimal transport theory which guides to
regress lighting representation parameters with consideration of the spatial
information. Furthermore, we propose a new metric that is concise yet effective
by directly evaluating the estimated illumination maps rather than rendered
images. Extensive experiments show that NeedleLight achieves superior lighting
estimation consistently across multiple evaluation metrics as compared with
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Few-shot learning is a challenging task, which aims to learn a classifier for
novel classes with few examples. Pre-training based meta-learning methods
effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a feature extractor and then
fine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based meta-learning. However,
results show that the fine-tuning step makes very marginal improvements. In
this paper, 1) we figure out the key reason, i.e., in the pre-trained feature
space, the base classes already form compact clusters while novel classes
spread as groups with large variances, which implies that fine-tuning the
feature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning the feature
extractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes during
meta-learning. Consequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based
meta-learning framework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge
(i.e., class-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative
attribute features as priors. Then, we design a prototype completion network to
learn to complete prototypes with these priors. To avoid the prototype
completion error caused by primitive knowledge noises or class differences, we
further develop a Gaussian based prototype fusion strategy that combines the
mean-based and completed prototypes by exploiting the unlabeled samples.
Extensive experiments show that our method: (i) can obtain more accurate
prototypes; (ii) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 2% - 9% in terms of
classification accuracy. Our code is available online.</span>

benefited from the application of methods from other domains. Today, we observe
the trend to fuse domain-specific tasks and approaches together, which provides
the community with new outstanding models.

In this work, we present an extension of the CLIP model that handles audio in
addition to text and images. Our proposed model incorporates the ESResNeXt
audio-model into the CLIP framework using the AudioSet dataset. Such a
combination enables the proposed model to perform bimodal and unimodal
classification and querying, while keeping CLIP&#x27;s ability to generalize to
unseen datasets in a zero-shot inference fashion.

AudioCLIP achieves new state-of-the-art results in the Environmental Sound
Classification (ESC) task, out-performing other approaches by reaching
accuracies of 90.07% on the UrbanSound8K and 97.15% on the ESC-50 datasets.
Further it sets new baselines in the zero-shot ESC-task on the same datasets
68.78% and 69.40%, respectively).

Finally, we also assess the cross-modal querying performance of the proposed
model as well as the influence of full and partial training on the results. For
the sake of reproducibility, our code is published.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, language-guided global image editing draws increasing attention
with growing application potentials. However, previous GAN-based methods are
not only confined to domain-specific, low-resolution data but also lacking in
interpretability. To overcome the collective difficulties, we develop a
text-to-operation model to map the vague editing language request into a series
of editing operations, e.g., change contrast, brightness, and saturation. Each
operation is interpretable and differentiable. Furthermore, the only
supervision in the task is the target image, which is insufficient for a stable
training of sequential decisions. Hence, we propose a novel operation planning
algorithm to generate possible editing sequences from the target image as
pseudo ground truth. Comparison experiments on the newly collected MA5k-Req
dataset and GIER dataset show the advantages of our methods. Code is available

                                        <span>The scarcity of labeled data often impedes the application of deep learning
to the segmentation of medical images. Semi-supervised learning seeks to
overcome this limitation by exploiting unlabeled examples in the learning
process. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised segmentation method
that leverages mutual information (MI) on categorical distributions to achieve
both global representation invariance and local smoothness. In this method, we
maximize the MI for intermediate feature embeddings that are taken from both
the encoder and decoder of a segmentation network. We first propose a global MI
loss constraining the encoder to learn an image representation that is
invariant to geometric transformations. Instead of resorting to
computationally-expensive techniques for estimating the MI on continuous
feature embeddings, we use projection heads to map them to a discrete cluster
assignment where MI can be computed efficiently. Our method also includes a
local MI loss to promote spatial consistency in the feature maps of the decoder
and provide a smoother segmentation. Since mutual information does not require
a strict ordering of clusters in two different assignments, we incorporate a
final consistency regularization loss on the output which helps align the
cluster labels throughout the network. We evaluate the method on four
challenging publicly-available datasets for medical image segmentation.
Experimental results show our method to outperform recently-proposed approaches
for semi-supervised segmentation and provide an accuracy near to full
supervision while training with very few annotated images.</span>

                                        <span>Understanding the semantics of human movement -- the what, how and why of the
movement -- is an important problem that requires datasets of human actions
with semantic labels. Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale
video datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D
human motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body
motions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we
present BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions
being performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about
43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of
abstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and
frame labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame
label is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the
mocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence
labels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action
categories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action
recognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To
demonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of
models on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting
learning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve
as a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition. The dataset,
baseline method, and evaluation code is made available, and supported for
academic research purposes at https://babel.is.tue.mpg.de/.</span>

task. Prior research has mainly focused to enhance the quality of generation by
investigating the use of spatial attention and/or textual attention thereby
neglecting the relationship between channels. In this work, we propose the
Combined Attention Generative Adversarial Network (CAGAN) to generate
photo-realistic images according to textual descriptions. The proposed CAGAN
utilises two attention models: word attention to draw different sub-regions
conditioned on related words; and squeeze-and-excitation attention to capture
non-linear interaction among channels. With spectral normalisation to stabilise
training, our proposed CAGAN improves the state of the art on the IS and FID on
the CUB dataset and the FID on the more challenging COCO dataset. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that judging a model by a single evaluation metric can be
misleading by developing an additional model adding local self-attention which
scores a higher IS, outperforming the state of the art on the CUB dataset, but
generates unrealistic images through feature repetition.</span>

that have faster training speed and better parameter efficiency than previous
models. To develop this family of models, we use a combination of
training-aware neural architecture search and scaling, to jointly optimize
training speed and parameter efficiency. The models were searched from the
search space enriched with new ops such as Fused-MBConv. Our experiments show
that EfficientNetV2 models train much faster than state-of-the-art models while
being up to 6.8x smaller.

Our training can be further sped up by progressively increasing the image
size during training, but it often causes a drop in accuracy. To compensate for
this accuracy drop, we propose to adaptively adjust regularization (e.g.,
dropout and data augmentation) as well, such that we can achieve both fast
training and good accuracy.

With progressive learning, our EfficientNetV2 significantly outperforms
previous models on ImageNet and CIFAR/Cars/Flowers datasets. By pretraining on
the same ImageNet21k, our EfficientNetV2 achieves 87.3% top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet ILSVRC2012, outperforming the recent ViT by 2.0% accuracy while
training 5x-11x faster using the same computing resources. Code will be

                                        <span>Nowadays, vision-based computing tasks play an important role in various
real-world applications. However, many vision computing tasks, e.g. semantic
segmentation, are usually computationally expensive, posing a challenge to the
computing systems that are resource-constrained but require fast response
speed. Therefore, it is valuable to develop accurate and real-time vision
processing models that only require limited computational resources. To this
end, we propose the Spatial-detail Guided Context Propagation Network (SGCPNet)
for achieving real-time semantic segmentation. In SGCPNet, we propose the
strategy of spatial-detail guided context propagation. It uses the spatial
details of shallow layers to guide the propagation of the low-resolution global
contexts, in which the lost spatial information can be effectively
reconstructed. In this way, the need for maintaining high-resolution features
along the network is freed, therefore largely improving the model efficiency.
On the other hand, due to the effective reconstruction of spatial details, the
segmentation accuracy can be still preserved. In the experiments, we validate
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SGCPNet model. On the
Citysacpes dataset, for example, our SGCPNet achieves 69.5 % mIoU segmentation
accuracy, while its speed reaches 178.5 FPS on 768x1536 images on a GeForce GTX
1080 Ti GPU card.</span>

on which they were trained they have a tendency to behave poorly, most
prominently over-confidence in erroneous predictions. Such behaviours will have
disastrous effects on real-world machine learning systems. In this field
graceful degradation refers to the optimisation of model performance as it
encounters this out-of-distribution data. This work presents a definition and
discussion of graceful degradation and where it can be applied in deployed
visual systems. Following this a survey of relevant areas is undertaken,
novelly splitting the graceful degradation problem into active and passive
approaches. In passive approaches, graceful degradation is handled and achieved
by the model in a self-contained manner, in active approaches the model is
updated upon encountering epistemic uncertainties. This work communicates the
importance of the problem and aims to prompt the development of machine
learning strategies that are aware of graceful degradation.</span>

                                        <span>Detecting human-object interactions (HOI) is an important step toward a
comprehensive visual understanding of machines. While detecting non-temporal
HOIs (e.g., sitting on a chair) from static images is feasible, it is unlikely
even for humans to guess temporal-related HOIs (e.g., opening/closing a door)
from a single video frame, where the neighboring frames play an essential role.
However, conventional HOI methods operating on only static images have been
used to predict temporal-related interactions, which is essentially guessing
without temporal contexts and may lead to sub-optimal performance. In this
paper, we bridge this gap by detecting video-based HOIs with explicit temporal
information. We first show that a naive temporal-aware variant of a common
action detection baseline does not work on video-based HOIs due to a
feature-inconsistency issue. We then propose a simple yet effective
architecture named Spatial-Temporal HOI Detection (ST-HOI) utilizing temporal
information such as human and object trajectories, correctly-localized visual
features, and spatial-temporal masking pose features. We construct a new video
HOI benchmark dubbed VidHOI where our proposed approach serves as a solid
baseline.</span>

                                        <span>Deformable image registration is a fundamental task in medical imaging. Due
to the large computational complexity of deformable registration of volumetric
images, conventional iterative methods usually face the tradeoff between the
registration accuracy and the computation time in practice. In order to boost
the registration performance in both accuracy and runtime, we propose a fast
convolutional neural network. Specially, to efficiently utilize the memory
resources and enlarge the model capacity, we adopt additive forwarding instead
of channel concatenation and deepen the network in each encoder and decoder
stage. To facilitate the learning efficiency, we leverage skip connection
within the encoder and decoder stages to enable residual learning and employ an
auxiliary loss at the bottom layer with lowest resolution to involve deep
supervision. Particularly, the low-resolution auxiliary loss is weighted by an
exponentially decayed parameter during the training phase. In conjunction with
the main loss in high-resolution grid, a coarse-to-fine learning strategy is
achieved. Last but not least, we introduce an auxiliary loss based on the
segmentation prior to improve the registration performance in Dice score.
Comparing to the auxiliary loss using average Dice score, the proposed
multi-label segmentation loss does not induce additional memory cost in the
training phase and can be employed on images with arbitrary amount of
categories. In the experiments, we show FDRN outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art registration methods for brain MR images by resorting to the
compact network structure and efficient learning. Besides, FDRN is a
generalized framework for image registration which is not confined to a
particular type of medical images or anatomy.</span>

to understand human activities from a video is a challenging task due to
various problems including background, camera motion and dataset variations.
This paper proposes two CNN based architectures with three streams which allow
the model to exploit the dataset under different settings. The three pathways
are differentiated in frame rates. The single pathway, operates at a single
frame rate captures spatial information, the slow pathway operates at low frame
rates captures the spatial information and the fast pathway operates at high
frame rates that capture fine temporal information. Post CNN encoders, we add
bidirectional LSTM and attention heads respectively to capture the context and
temporal features. By experimenting with various algorithms on UCF-101,
Kinetics-600 and AVA dataset, we observe that the proposed models achieve
state-of-art performance for human action recognition task.</span>

component to allow attention-based deep model architectures such as Transformer
to address sequences or images where the position of information matters. In
this paper, we propose a novel positional encoding method based on learnable
Fourier features. Instead of hard-coding each position as a token or a vector,
we represent each position, which can be multi-dimensional, as a trainable
encoding based on learnable Fourier feature mapping, modulated with a
multi-layer perceptron. The representation is particularly advantageous for a
spatial multi-dimensional position, e.g., pixel positions on an image, where
$L_2$ distances or more complex positional relationships need to be captured.
Our experiments based on several public benchmark tasks show that our learnable
Fourier feature representation for multi-dimensional positional encoding
outperforms existing methods by both improving the accuracy and allowing faster
convergence.</span>

Transformers, where pure Transformer architectures have attained top accuracy
on the major video recognition benchmarks. These video models are all built on
Transformer layers that globally connect patches across the spatial and
temporal dimensions. In this paper, we instead advocate an inductive bias of
locality in video Transformers, which leads to a better speed-accuracy
trade-off compared to previous approaches which compute self-attention globally
even with spatial-temporal factorization. The locality of the proposed video
architecture is realized by adapting the Swin Transformer designed for the
image domain, while continuing to leverage the power of pre-trained image
models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a broad range of
video recognition benchmarks, including on action recognition (84.9 top-1
accuracy on Kinetics-400 and 86.1 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-600 with ~20x less
pre-training data and ~3x smaller model size) and temporal modeling (69.6 top-1
accuracy on Something-Something v2). The code and models will be made publicly

                                        <span>DNN-based face recognition models require large centrally aggregated face
datasets for training. However, due to the growing data privacy concerns and
legal restrictions, accessing and sharing face datasets has become exceedingly
difficult. We propose FedFace, a federated learning (FL) framework for
collaborative learning of face recognition models in a privacy-aware manner.
FedFace utilizes the face images available on multiple clients to learn an
accurate and generalizable face recognition model where the face images stored
at each client are neither shared with other clients nor the central host and
each client is a mobile device containing face images pertaining to only the
owner of the device (one identity per client). Our experiments show the
effectiveness of FedFace in enhancing the verification performance of
pre-trained face recognition system on standard face verification benchmarks
namely LFW, IJB-A, and IJB-C.</span>

                                        <span>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are able to reconstruct scenes with
unprecedented fidelity, and various recent works have extended NeRF to handle
dynamic scenes. A common approach to reconstruct such non-rigid scenes is
through the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in each
input image into a canonical template coordinate space. However, these
deformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, as
topological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these
deformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limitation by
lifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5D
radiance field corresponding to each individual input image as a slice through
this &quot;hyper-space&quot;. Our method is inspired by level set methods, which model
the evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. We
evaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly between &quot;moments&quot;,
i.e., configurations of the scene, seen in the input images while maintaining
visual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We show
that our method, which we dub HyperNeRF, outperforms existing methods on both
tasks by significant margins. Compared to Nerfies, HyperNeRF reduces average
error rates by 8.6% for interpolation and 8.8% for novel-view synthesis, as
measured by LPIPS.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have developed to become powerful models
for various computer vision tasks ranging from object detection to semantic
segmentation. However, most of state-of-the-art CNNs can not be deployed
directly on edge devices such as smartphones and drones, which need low latency
under limited power and memory bandwidth. One popular, straightforward approach
to compressing CNNs is network slimming, which imposes $\ell_1$ regularization
on the channel-associated scaling factors via the batch normalization layers
during training. Network slimming thereby identifies insignificant channels
that can be pruned for inference. In this paper, we propose replacing the
$\ell_1$ penalty with an alternative sparse, nonconvex penalty in order to
yield a more compressed and/or accurate CNN architecture. We investigate
$\ell_p (0 &lt; p &lt; 1)$, transformed $\ell_1$ (T$\ell_1$), minimax concave penalty
(MCP), and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) due to their recent
successes and popularity in solving sparse optimization problems, such as
compressed sensing and variable selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
network slimming with nonconvex penalties on VGGNet, Densenet, and Resnet on
standard image classification datasets. Based on the numerical experiments,
T$\ell_1$ preserves model accuracy against channel pruning, $\ell_{1/2, 3/4}$
yield better compressed models with similar accuracies after retraining as
$\ell_1$, and MCP and SCAD provide more accurate models after retraining with
similar compression as $\ell_1$. Network slimming with T$\ell_1$ regularization
also outperforms the latest Bayesian modification of network slimming in
compressing a CNN architecture in terms of memory storage while preserving its
model accuracy after channel pruning.</span>

                                        <span>Temporal grounding aims to localize temporal boundaries within untrimmed
videos by language queries, but it faces the challenge of two types of
inevitable human uncertainties: query uncertainty and label uncertainty. The
two uncertainties stem from human subjectivity, leading to limited
generalization ability of temporal grounding. In this work, we propose a novel
DeNet (Decoupling and De-bias) to embrace human uncertainty: Decoupling - We
explicitly disentangle each query into a relation feature and a modified
feature. The relation feature, which is mainly based on skeleton-like words
(including nouns and verbs), aims to extract basic and consistent information
in the presence of query uncertainty. Meanwhile, modified feature assigned with
style-like words (including adjectives, adverbs, etc) represents the subjective
information, and thus brings personalized predictions; De-bias - We propose a
de-bias mechanism to generate diverse predictions, aim to alleviate the bias
caused by single-style annotations in the presence of label uncertainty.
Moreover, we put forward new multi-label metrics to diversify the performance
evaluation. Extensive experiments show that our approach is more effective and
robust than state-of-the-arts on Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions
datasets.</span>

                                        <span>The computation and memory needed for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
inference can be reduced by pruning weights from the trained network. Pruning
is guided by a pruning saliency, which heuristically approximates the change in
the loss function associated with the removal of specific weights. Many pruning
signals have been proposed, but the performance of each heuristic depends on
the particular trained network. This leaves the data scientist with a difficult
choice. When using any one saliency metric for the entire pruning process, we
run the risk of the metric assumptions being invalidated, leading to poor
decisions being made by the metric. Ideally we could combine the best aspects
of different saliency metrics. However, despite an extensive literature review,
we are unable to find any prior work on composing different saliency metrics.
The chief difficulty lies in combining the numerical output of different
saliency metrics, which are not directly comparable.

We propose a method to compose several primitive pruning saliencies, to
exploit the cases where each saliency measure does well. Our experiments show
that the composition of saliencies avoids many poor pruning choices identified
by individual saliencies. In most cases our method finds better selections than
even the best individual pruning saliency.</span>

increasingly critical in many real-world, high-stake applications. Hundreds of
papers have either proposed new feature attribution methods, discussed or
harnessed these tools in their work. However, despite humans being the target
end-users, most attribution methods were only evaluated on proxy
automatic-evaluation metrics. In this paper, we conduct the first, large-scale
user study on 320 lay and 11 expert users to shed light on the effectiveness of
state-of-the-art attribution methods in assisting humans in ImageNet
classification, Stanford Dogs fine-grained classification, and these two tasks
but when the input image contains adversarial perturbations. We found that, in
overall, feature attribution is surprisingly not more effective than showing
humans nearest training-set examples. On a hard task of fine-grained dog
categorization, presenting attribution maps to humans does not help, but
instead hurts the performance of human-AI teams compared to AI alone.
Importantly, we found automatic attribution-map evaluation measures to
correlate poorly with the actual human-AI team performance. Our findings
encourage the community to rigorously test their methods on the downstream
human-in-the-loop applications and to rethink the existing evaluation metrics.</span>

recent baselines sometimes struggle to reconstruct coherent 3D spaces in this

                                        <span>An agent that is capable of predicting what happens next can perform a
variety of tasks through planning with no additional training. Furthermore,
such an agent can internally represent the complex dynamics of the real-world
and therefore can acquire a representation useful for a variety of visual
perception tasks. This makes predicting the future frames of a video,
conditioned on the observed past and potentially future actions, an interesting
task which remains exceptionally challenging despite many recent advances.
Existing video prediction models have shown promising results on simple narrow
benchmarks but they generate low quality predictions on real-life datasets with
more complicated dynamics or broader domain. There is a growing body of
evidence that underfitting on the training data is one of the primary causes
for the low quality predictions. In this paper, we argue that the inefficient
use of parameters in the current video models is the main reason for
underfitting. Therefore, we introduce a new architecture, named FitVid, which
is capable of severe overfitting on the common benchmarks while having similar
parameter count as the current state-of-the-art models. We analyze the
consequences of overfitting, illustrating how it can produce unexpected
outcomes such as generating high quality output by repeating the training data,
and how it can be mitigated using existing image augmentation techniques. As a
result, FitVid outperforms the current state-of-the-art models across four
different video prediction benchmarks on four different metrics.</span>

                                        <span>The 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) is a powerful statistical tool for representing
3D face shapes. To build a 3DMM, a training set of face scans in full
point-to-point correspondence is required, and its modeling capabilities
directly depend on the variability contained in the training data. Thus, to
increase the descriptive power of the 3DMM, establishing a dense correspondence
across heterogeneous scans with sufficient diversity in terms of identities,
ethnicities, or expressions becomes essential. In this manuscript, we present a
fully automatic approach that leverages a 3DMM to transfer its dense semantic
annotation across raw 3D faces, establishing a dense correspondence between
them. We propose a novel formulation to learn a set of sparse deformation
components with local support on the face that, together with an original
non-rigid deformation algorithm, allow the 3DMM to precisely fit unseen faces
and transfer its semantic annotation. We extensively experimented our approach,
showing it can effectively generalize to highly diverse samples and accurately
establish a dense correspondence even in presence of complex facial
expressions. The accuracy of the dense registration is demonstrated by building
a heterogeneous, large-scale 3DMM from more than 9,000 fully registered scans
obtained by joining three large datasets together.</span>

sections from histopathology. We present a fully-automatic algorithm for
non-parametric (nonlinear) image registration and apply it to a previously
existing dataset from the ANHIR challenge (230 slide pairs, consecutive
sections) and a new dataset (hybrid re-stained and consecutive, 81 slide pairs,
ca. 3000 landmarks) which is made publicly available. Registration
hyperparameters are obtained in the ANHIR dataset and applied to the new
dataset without modification. In the new dataset, landmark errors after
registration range from 13.2 micrometers for consecutive sections to 1
micrometer for re-stained sections. We observe that non-parametric registration
leads to lower landmark errors in both cases, even though the effect is smaller
in re-stained sections. The nucleus-level alignment after non-parametric
registration of re-stained sections provides a valuable tool to generate
automatic ground-truth for machine learning applications in histopathology.</span>

                                        <span>Face recognition systems are extremely vulnerable to morphing attacks, in
which a morphed facial reference image can be successfully verified as two or
more distinct identities. In this paper, we propose a morph attack detection
algorithm that leverages an undecimated 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for
identifying morphed face images. The core of our framework is that artifacts
resulting from the morphing process that are not discernible in the image
domain can be more easily identified in the spatial frequency domain. A
discriminative wavelet sub-band can accentuate the disparity between a real and
a morphed image. To this end, multi-level DWT is applied to all images,
yielding 48 mid and high-frequency sub-bands each. The entropy distributions
for each sub-band are calculated separately for both bona fide and morph
images. For some of the sub-bands, there is a marked difference between the
entropy of the sub-band in a bona fide image and the identical sub-band&#x27;s
entropy in a morphed image. Consequently, we employ Kullback-Liebler Divergence
(KLD) to exploit these differences and isolate the sub-bands that are the most
discriminative. We measure how discriminative a sub-band is by its KLD value
and the 22 sub-bands with the highest KLD values are chosen for network
training. Then, we train a deep Siamese neural network using these 22 selected
sub-bands for differential morph attack detection. We examine the efficacy of
discriminative wavelet sub-bands for morph attack detection and show that a
deep neural network trained on these sub-bands can accurately identify morph
imagery.</span>

entire classes of 3D shapes with large intra-class variations. ShapeFlow allows
learning a multi-template deformation space that is agnostic to shape topology,
yet preserves fine geometric details. Different from a generative space where a
latent vector is directly decoded into a shape, a deformation space decodes a
vector into a continuous flow that can advect a source shape towards a target.
Such a space naturally allows the disentanglement of geometric style (coming
from the source) and structural pose (conforming to the target). We parametrize
the deformation between geometries as a learned continuous flow field via a
neural network and show that such deformations can be guaranteed to have
desirable properties, such as be bijectivity, freedom from self-intersections,
or volume preservation. We illustrate the effectiveness of this learned
deformation space for various downstream applications, including shape
generation via deformation, geometric style transfer, unsupervised learning of
a consistent parameterization for entire classes of shapes, and shape
interpolation.</span>

$k$-means method is a popular, efficient, and distribution-free approach for
clustering numerical-valued data, but does not apply for categorical-valued
observations. The $k$-modes method addresses this lacuna by replacing the
Euclidean with the Hamming distance and the means with the modes in the
$k$-means objective function. We provide a novel, computationally efficient
implementation of $k$-modes, called OTQT. We prove that OTQT finds updates to
improve the objective function that are undetectable to existing $k$-modes
algorithms. Although slightly slower per iteration due to algorithmic
complexity, OTQT is always more accurate per iteration and almost always faster
(and only barely slower on some datasets) to the final optimum. Thus, we
recommend OTQT as the preferred, default algorithm for $k$-modes optimization.</span>

                                        <span>Super-resolution microscopy overcomes the diffraction limit of conventional
light microscopy in spatial resolution. By providing novel spatial or
spatio-temporal information on biological processes at nanometer resolution
with molecular specificity, it plays an increasingly important role in life
sciences. However, its technical limitations require trade-offs to balance its
spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and light exposure of samples.
Recently, deep learning has achieved breakthrough performance in many image
processing and computer vision tasks. It has also shown great promise in
pushing the performance envelope of super-resolution microscopy. In this brief
Review, we survey recent advances in using deep learning to enhance performance
of super-resolution microscopy. We focus primarily on how deep learning
ad-vances reconstruction of super-resolution images. Related key technical
challenges are discussed. Despite the challenges, deep learning is set to play
an indispensable and transformative role in the development of super-resolution
microscopy. We conclude with an outlook on how deep learning could shape the
future of this new generation of light microscopy technology.</span>

military target detection, environmental monitoring, hazard prevention and
other time-critical applications require onboard real time processing
capabilities or autonomous decision making. Some unmanned remote systems like
satellites are physically remote from their operators, and all control of the
spacecraft and data returned by the spacecraft must be transmitted over a
wireless radio link. This link may not be available for extended periods when
the satellite is out of line of sight of its ground station. Therefore,
lightweight, small size and low power consumption hardware is essential for
onboard real time processing systems. With increasing dimensionality, size and
resolution of recent hyperspectral imaging sensors, additional challenges are
posed upon remote sensing processing systems and more capable computing
architectures are needed. Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) emerged as
promising architecture for light weight high performance computing that can
address these computational requirements for onboard systems. The goal of this
study is to build high performance methods for onboard hyperspectral analysis.
We propose accelerated methods for the well-known recursive hierarchical
segmentation (RHSEG) clustering method, using GPUs, hybrid multicore CPU with a
GPU and hybrid multi-core CPU/GPU clusters. RHSEG is a method developed by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which is designed to
provide rich classification information with several output levels. The
achieved speedups by parallel solutions compared to CPU sequential
implementations are 21x for parallel single GPU and 240x for hybrid multi-node
computer clusters with 16 computing nodes. The energy consumption is reduced to
74% using a single GPU compared to the equivalent parallel CPU cluster.</span>

                                        <span>Collaborative learning, which enables collaborative and decentralized
training of deep neural networks at multiple institutions in a
privacy-preserving manner, is rapidly emerging as a valuable technique in
healthcare applications. However, its distributed nature often leads to
significant heterogeneity in data distributions across institutions. Existing
collaborative learning approaches generally do not account for the presence of
heterogeneity in data among institutions, or only mildly skewed label
distributions are studied. In this paper, we present a novel generative replay
strategy to address the challenge of data heterogeneity in collaborative
learning methods. Instead of directly training a model for task performance, we
leverage recent image synthesis techniques to develop a novel dual model
architecture: a primary model learns the desired task, and an auxiliary
&quot;generative replay model&quot; either synthesizes images that closely resemble the
input images or helps extract latent variables. The generative replay strategy
is flexible to use, can either be incorporated into existing collaborative
learning methods to improve their capability of handling data heterogeneity
across institutions, or be used as a novel and individual collaborative
learning framework (termed FedReplay) to reduce communication cost.
Experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in
handling heterogeneous data across institutions. On highly heterogeneous data
partitions, our model achieves ~4.88% improvement in the prediction accuracy on
a diabetic retinopathy classification dataset, and ~49.8% reduction of mean
absolution value on a Bone Age prediction dataset, respectively, compared to
the state-of-the art collaborative learning methods.</span>

                                        <span>Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment camouflaged objects hiding
in the environment, which is challenging due to the similar appearance of
camouflaged objects and their surroundings. Research in biology suggests that
depth can provide useful object localization cues for camouflaged object
discovery, as all the animals have 3D perception ability. However, the depth
information has not been exploited for camouflaged object detection. To explore
the contribution of depth for camouflage detection, we present a depth-guided
camouflaged object detection network with pre-computed depth maps from existing
monocular depth estimation methods. Due to the domain gap between the depth
estimation dataset and our camouflaged object detection dataset, the generated
depth may not be accurate enough to be directly used in our framework. We then
introduce a depth quality assessment module to evaluate the quality of depth
based on the model prediction from both RGB COD branch and RGB-D COD branch.
During training, only high-quality depth is used to update the modal
interaction module for multi-modal learning. During testing, our depth quality
assessment module can effectively determine the contribution of depth and
select the RGB branch or RGB-D branch for camouflage prediction. Extensive
experiments on various camouflaged object detection datasets prove the
effectiveness of our solution in exploring the depth information for
camouflaged object detection. Our code and data is publicly available at:

fatalities, developing intelligent driving systems assisting drivers to
identify potential risks is in urgent need. Risky situations are generally
defined based on collision prediction in existing research. However, collisions
are only one type of risk in traffic scenarios. We believe a more generic
definition is required. In this work, we propose a novel driver-centric
definition of risk, i.e., risky objects influence driver behavior. Based on
this definition, a new task called risk object identification is introduced. We
formulate the task as a cause-effect problem and present a novel two-stage risk
object identification framework, taking inspiration from models of situation
awareness and causal inference. A driver-centric Risk Object Identification
(ROI) dataset is curated to evaluate the proposed system. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art risk object identification performance compared with strong
baselines on the ROI dataset. In addition, we conduct extensive ablative

of machine learning and computational intelligence. However, in the context of
computer vision, the problem has only been studied in specific scenarios (e.g.,
certain types of occlusions in specific types of images), although it is common
to have incomplete information in visual data. This chapter describes the
design of an academic competition focusing on inpainting of images and video
sequences that was part of the competition program of WCCI2018 and had a
satellite event collocated with ECCV2018. The ChaLearn Looking at People
Inpainting Challenge aimed at advancing the state of the art on visual
inpainting by promoting the development of methods for recovering missing and
occluded information from images and video. Three tracks were proposed in which
visual inpainting might be helpful but still challenging: human body pose
estimation, text overlays removal and fingerprint denoising. This chapter
describes the design of the challenge, which includes the release of three
novel datasets, and the description of evaluation metrics, baselines and
evaluation protocol. The results of the challenge are analyzed and discussed in

order to address some of the prevalent weaknesses in convolutional neural
networks. Due to the novelty of transformers being used in this domain along
with the self-attention mechanism, it remains unclear to what degree these
architectures are robust to corruptions. Despite some works proposing that data
augmentation remains essential for a model to be robust against corruptions, we
propose to explore the impact that the architecture has on corruption
robustness. We find that vision transformer architectures are inherently more
robust to corruptions than the ResNet-50 and MLP-Mixers. We also find that
vision transformers with 5 times fewer parameters than a ResNet-50 have more

when large amounts of annotated data are available, that is, in the supervised
case. However, such data is expensive to collect and so methods have been
developed to adapt models trained on related, often synthetic data for which
labels are readily available. Current adaptation approaches do not consider the
dependence of the generalization/transferability of these models on network
architecture. In this paper, we perform neural architecture search (NAS) to
provide architecture-level perspective and analysis for domain adaptation. We
identify the optimization gap that exists when searching architectures for
unsupervised domain adaptation which makes this NAS problem uniquely difficult.
We propose bridging this gap by using maximum mean discrepancy and regional
weighted entropy to estimate the accuracy metric. Experimental results on
several widely adopted benchmarks show that our proposed AutoAdapt framework
indeed discovers architectures that improve the performance of a number of
existing adaptation techniques.</span>

                                        <span>Moving target detection plays an important role in computer vision. However,
traditional algorithms such as frame difference and optical flow usually suffer
from low accuracy or heavy computation. Recent algorithms such as deep
learning-based convolutional neural networks have achieved high accuracy and
real-time performance, but they usually need to know the classes of targets in
advance, which limits the practical applications. Therefore, we proposed a
model free moving target detection algorithm. This algorithm extracts the
moving area through the difference of image features. Then, the color and
location probability map of the moving area will be calculated through maximum
a posteriori probability. And the target probability map can be obtained
through the dot multiply between the two maps. Finally, the optimal moving
target area can be solved by stochastic gradient descent on the target
probability map. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the highest
accuracy compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, without needing to know the
classes of targets. Furthermore, as the existing datasets are not suitable for
moving target detection, we proposed a method for producing evaluation dataset.
Besides, we also proved the proposed algorithm can be used to assist target
tracking.</span>

                                        <span>Current deep learning approaches for diffusion MRI modeling circumvent the
need for densely-sampled diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) by directly
predicting microstructural indices from sparsely-sampled DWIs. However, they
implicitly make unrealistic assumptions of static $q$-space sampling during
training and reconstruction. Further, such approaches can restrict downstream
usage of variably sampled DWIs for usages including the estimation of
microstructural indices or tractography. We propose a generative adversarial
translation framework for high-quality DWI synthesis with arbitrary $q$-space
sampling given commonly acquired structural images (e.g., B0, T1, T2). Our
translation network linearly modulates its internal representations conditioned
on continuous $q$-space information, thus removing the need for fixed sampling
schemes. Moreover, this approach enables downstream estimation of high-quality
microstructural maps from arbitrarily subsampled DWIs, which may be
particularly important in cases with sparsely sampled DWIs. Across several
recent methodologies, the proposed approach yields improved DWI synthesis
accuracy and fidelity with enhanced downstream utility as quantified by the
accuracy of scalar microstructure indices estimated from the synthesized
images. Code is available at

action category. Limited by GPU memory, mainstream methods pre-extract features
for each video. Therefore, feature quality determines the upper bound of
detection performance. In this technical report, we explored classic
convolution-based backbones and the recent surge of transformer-based
backbones. We found that the transformer-based methods can achieve better
classification performance than convolution-based, but they cannot generate
accuracy action proposals. In addition, extracting features with larger frame
resolution to reduce the loss of spatial information can also effectively
improve the performance of temporal action localization. Finally, we achieve
42.42% in terms of mAP on validation set with a single SlowFast feature by a
simple combination: BMN+TCANet, which is 1.87% higher than the result of 2020&#x27;s

multi-view approach addresses the problem that view synthesis methods are often
limited by their depth estimation stage, where incorrect depth predictions can
lead to large projection errors. To avoid this issue, we efficiently warp
multiple input images into the target frame for a range of assumed depth
planes. The resulting tensor representation is fed into a U-Net-like CNN with
gated convolutions, which directly produces the novel output view. We therefore
side-step explicit depth estimation. This improves efficiency and performance
on transparent, reflective, and feature-less scene parts. FaDIV-Syn can handle
both interpolation and extrapolation tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art
extrapolation methods on the large-scale RealEstate10k dataset. In contrast to
comparable methods, it is capable of real-time operation due to its lightweight
architecture. We further demonstrate data efficiency of FaDIV-Syn by training
from fewer examples as well as its generalization to higher resolutions and
arbitrary depth ranges under severe depth discretization.</span>

generative autoencoders with a learnable prior, called Symmetric Wasserstein
Autoencoders (SWAEs). We propose to symmetrically match the joint distributions
of the observed data and the latent representation induced by the encoder and
the decoder. The resulting algorithm jointly optimizes the modelling losses in
both the data and the latent spaces with the loss in the data space leading to
the denoising effect. With the symmetric treatment of the data and the latent
representation, the algorithm implicitly preserves the local structure of the
data in the latent space. To further improve the quality of the latent
representation, we incorporate a reconstruction loss into the objective, which
significantly benefits both the generation and reconstruction. We empirically
show the superior performance of SWAEs over the state-of-the-art generative
autoencoders in terms of classification, reconstruction, and generation.</span>

                                        <span>Visual recognition has been dominated by convolutionalneural networks (CNNs)
for years. Though recently the pre-vailing vision transformers (ViTs) have
shown great poten-tial of self-attention based models in ImageNet
classifica-tion, their performance is still inferior to latest SOTA CNNsif no
extra data are provided. In this work, we aim to closethe performance gap and
demonstrate that attention-basedmodels are indeed able to outperform CNNs. We
found thatthe main factor limiting the performance of ViTs for Ima-geNet
classification is their low efficacy in encoding fine-level features into the
token representations. To resolvethis, we introduce a noveloutlook attentionand
present asimple and general architecture, termed Vision Outlooker(VOLO). Unlike
self-attention that focuses on global depen-dency modeling at a coarse level,
the outlook attention aimsto efficiently encode finer-level features and
contexts intotokens, which are shown to be critical for recognition
per-formance but largely ignored by the self-attention. Experi-ments show that
our VOLO achieves 87.1% top-1 accuracyon ImageNet-1K classification, being the
first model exceed-ing 87% accuracy on this competitive benchmark, withoutusing
any extra training data. In addition, the pre-trainedVOLO transfers well to
downstream tasks, such as seman-tic segmentation. We achieve 84.3% mIoU score

tremendous clinical benefits, from improved treatment decisions to better dose
distribution in radiation therapy. Recent work has approached the glioma growth
modeling problem via deep learning and variational inference, thus learning
growth dynamics entirely from a real patient data distribution. So far, this
approach was constrained to predefined image acquisition intervals and
sequences of fixed length, which limits its applicability in more realistic
scenarios. We overcome these limitations by extending Neural Processes, a class
of conditional generative models for stochastic time series, with a
hierarchical multi-scale representation encoding including a spatio-temporal
attention mechanism. The result is a learned growth model that can be
conditioned on an arbitrary number of observations, and that can produce a
distribution of temporally consistent growth trajectories on a continuous time
axis. On a dataset of 379 patients, the approach successfully captures both
global and finer-grained variations in the images, exhibiting superior
performance compared to other learned growth models.</span>

                                        <span>Depth completion aims to generate a dense depth map from the sparse depth map
and aligned RGB image. However, current depth completion methods use extremely
expensive 64-line LiDAR(about $100,000) to obtain sparse depth maps, which will
limit their application scenarios. Compared with the 64-line LiDAR, the
single-line LiDAR is much less expensive and much more robust. Therefore, we
propose a method to tackle the problem of single-line depth completion, in
which we aim to generate a dense depth map from the single-line LiDAR info and
the aligned RGB image. A single-line depth completion dataset is proposed based
on the existing 64-line depth completion dataset(KITTI). A network called
Semantic Guided Two-Branch Network(SGTBN) which contains global and local
branches to extract and fuse global and local info is proposed for this task. A
Semantic guided depth upsampling module is used in our network to make full use
of the semantic info in RGB images. Except for the usual MSE loss, we add the
virtual normal loss to increase the constraint of high-order 3D geometry in our
network. Our network outperforms the state-of-the-art in the single-line depth
completion task. Besides, compared with the monocular depth estimation, our
method also has significant advantages in precision and model size.</span>

                                        <span>Understanding the 3D world from 2D projected natural images is a fundamental
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Recently, an unsupervised learning
approach has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantages in data
collection. However, to mitigate training limitations, typical methods need to
impose assumptions for viewpoint distribution (e.g., a dataset containing
various viewpoint images) or object shape (e.g., symmetric objects). These
assumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to
non-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or
bird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose
aperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip
aperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and
depth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the
ambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth
texture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs),
we develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real
image distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise
a center focus prior to guiding the learning direction. In the experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of AR-GANs in various datasets, such as flower,
bird, and face images, demonstrate their portability by incorporating them into
other 3D representation learning GANs, and validate their applicability in
shallow DoF rendering.</span>

                                        <span>Existing scene text removal methods mainly train an elaborate network with
paired images to realize the function of text localization and background
reconstruction simultaneously, but there exists two problems: 1) lacking the
exhaustive erasure of text region and 2) causing the excessive erasure to
text-free areas. To handle these issues, this paper provides a novel
ProgrEssively Region-based scene Text eraser (PERT), which introduces
region-based modification strategy to progressively erase the pixels in only
text region. Firstly, PERT decomposes the STR task to several erasing stages.
As each stage aims to take a further step toward the text-removed image rather
than directly regress to the final result, the decomposed operation reduces the
learning difficulty in each stage, and an exhaustive erasure result can be
obtained by iterating over lightweight erasing blocks with shared parameters.
Then, PERT introduces a region-based modification strategy to ensure the
integrity of text-free areas by decoupling text localization from erasure
process to guide the removal. Benefiting from the simplicity architecture, PERT
is a simple and strong baseline, and is easy to be followed and developed.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PERT obtains the state-of-the-art
results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Code is available

                                        <span>Visual Information Extraction (VIE) task aims to extract key information from
multifarious document images (e.g., invoices and purchase receipts). Most
previous methods treat the VIE task simply as a sequence labeling problem or
classification problem, which requires models to carefully identify each kind
of semantics by introducing multimodal features, such as font, color, layout.
But simply introducing multimodal features couldn&#x27;t work well when faced with
numeric semantic categories or some ambiguous texts. To address this issue, in
this paper we propose a novel key-value matching model based on a graph neural
network for VIE (MatchVIE). Through key-value matching based on relevancy
evaluation, the proposed MatchVIE can bypass the recognitions to various
semantics, and simply focuses on the strong relevancy between entities.
Besides, we introduce a simple but effective operation, Num2Vec, to tackle the
instability of encoded values, which helps model converge more smoothly.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MatchVIE can
significantly outperform previous methods. Notably, to the best of our
knowledge, MatchVIE may be the first attempt to tackle the VIE task by modeling
the relevancy between keys and values and it is a good complement to the
existing methods.</span>

                                        <span>Monte Carlo rendering algorithms are widely used to produce photorealistic
computer graphics images. However, these algorithms need to sample a
substantial amount of rays per pixel to enable proper global illumination and
thus require an immense amount of computation. In this paper, we present a
hybrid rendering method to speed up Monte Carlo rendering algorithms. Our
method first generates two versions of a rendering: one at a low resolution
with a high sample rate (LRHS) and the other at a high resolution with a low
sample rate (HRLS). We then develop a deep convolutional neural network to fuse
these two renderings into a high-quality image as if it were rendered at a high
resolution with a high sample rate. Specifically, we formulate this fusion task
as a super resolution problem that generates a high resolution rendering from a
low resolution input (LRHS), assisted with the HRLS rendering. The HRLS
rendering provides critical high frequency details which are difficult to
recover from the LRHS for any super resolution methods. Our experiments show
that our hybrid rendering algorithm is significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art Monte Carlo denoising methods while rendering high-quality
images when tested on both our own BCR dataset and the Gharbi dataset.

However, existing methods suffer from performance degradation in occluded
scenes. In this work, we propose an occlusion-robust block, Region Feature
Completion (RFC), for occluded reID. Different from most previous works that
discard the occluded regions, RFC block can recover the semantics of occluded
regions in feature space. Firstly, a Spatial RFC (SRFC) module is developed.
SRFC exploits the long-range spatial contexts from non-occluded regions to
predict the features of occluded regions. The unit-wise prediction task leads
to an encoder/decoder architecture, where the region-encoder models the
correlation between non-occluded and occluded region, and the region-decoder
utilizes the spatial correlation to recover occluded region features. Secondly,
we introduce Temporal RFC (TRFC) module which captures the long-term temporal
contexts to refine the prediction of SRFC. RFC block is lightweight, end-to-end
trainable and can be easily plugged into existing CNNs to form RFCnet.
Extensive experiments are conducted on occluded and commonly holistic reID
benchmarks. Our method significantly outperforms existing methods on the
occlusion datasets, while remains top even superior performance on holistic
datasets. The source code is available at

on non-contrast computed tomography (CT) can discriminate benign and malignant
pulmonary nodules. The LIDC-IDRI dataset, one of the largest publicly available
CT database, was exploited for study. A total of 1556 nodules from 694 patients
were involved in statistical analysis, where nodules with average scorings 3 were respectively denoted as benign and malignant. Besides, 339 nodules
from 113 patients with diagnosis ground-truth were independently evaluated.
Computer algorithms were developed to segment pulmonary structures and quantify
the distances to pleural surface, airways and vessels, as well as the counting
number and normalized volume of airways and vessels near a nodule. Odds ratio
(OR) and Chi-square (\chi^2) testing were performed to demonstrate the
correlation between features of surrounding structures and nodule malignancy. A
non-parametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted
in logistic regression to evaluate discrimination ability of each structure.
For benign and malignant groups, the average distances from nodules to pleural
surface, airways and vessels are respectively (6.56, 5.19), (37.08, 26.43) and
(1.42, 1.07) mm. The correlation between nodules and the counting number of
airways and vessels that contact or project towards nodules are respectively
(OR&#x3D;22.96, \chi^2&#x3D;105.04) and (OR&#x3D;7.06, \chi^2&#x3D;290.11). The correlation between
nodules and the volume of airways and vessels are (OR&#x3D;9.19, \chi^2&#x3D;159.02) and
(OR&#x3D;2.29, \chi^2&#x3D;55.89). The areas-under-curves (AUCs) for pleurae, airways and
vessels are respectively 0.5202, 0.6943 and 0.6529. Our results show that
malignant nodules are often surrounded by more pulmonary structures compared
with benign ones, suggesting that features of these structures could be viewed
as lung cancer biomarkers.</span>

                                        <span>In-loop filtering is used in video coding to process the reconstructed frame
in order to remove blocking artifacts. With the development of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), CNNs have been explored for in-loop filtering
considering it can be treated as an image de-noising task. However, in addition
to being a distorted image, the reconstructed frame is also obtained by a fixed
line of block based encoding operations in video coding. It carries coding-unit
based coding distortion of some similar characteristics. Therefore, in this
paper, we address the filtering problem from two aspects, global appearance
restoration for disrupted texture and local coding distortion restoration
caused by fixed pipeline of coding. Accordingly, a three-stream global
appearance and local coding distortion based fusion network is developed with a
high-level global feature stream, a high-level local feature stream and a
low-level local feature stream. Ablation study is conducted to validate the
necessity of different features, demonstrating that the global features and
local features can complement each other in filtering and achieve better
performance when combined. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one
that clearly characterizes the video filtering process from the above global
appearance and local coding distortion restoration aspects with experimental
verification, providing a clear pathway to developing filter techniques.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms the existing single-frame based methods and achieves 13.5%, 11.3%,
11.7% BD-Rate saving on average for AI, LDP and RA configurations,
respectively, compared with the HEVC reference software.</span>

                                        <span>We aim to solve the highly challenging task of generating continuous sign
language videos solely from speech segments for the first time. Recent efforts
in this space have focused on generating such videos from human-annotated text
transcripts without considering other modalities. However, replacing speech
with sign language proves to be a practical solution while communicating with
people suffering from hearing loss. Therefore, we eliminate the need of using
text as input and design techniques that work for more natural, continuous,
freely uttered speech covering an extensive vocabulary. Since the current
datasets are inadequate for generating sign language directly from speech, we
collect and release the first Indian sign language dataset comprising
speech-level annotations, text transcripts, and the corresponding sign-language
videos. Next, we propose a multi-tasking transformer network trained to
generate signer&#x27;s poses from speech segments. With speech-to-text as an
auxiliary task and an additional cross-modal discriminator, our model learns to
generate continuous sign pose sequences in an end-to-end manner. Extensive
experiments and comparisons with other baselines demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach. We also conduct additional ablation studies to analyze the
effect of different modules of our network. A demo video containing several

                                        <span>High-resolution image segmentation remains challenging and error-prone due to
the enormous size of intermediate feature maps. Conventional methods avoid this
problem by using patch based approaches where each patch is segmented
independently. However, independent patch segmentation induces errors,
particularly at the patch boundary due to the lack of contextual information in
very high-resolution images where the patch size is much smaller compared to
the full image. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a
novel framework to segment a particular patch by incorporating contextual
information from its neighboring patches. This allows the segmentation network
to see the target patch with a wider field of view without the need of larger
feature maps. Comparative analysis from a number of experiments shows that our
proposed framework is able to segment high resolution images with significantly
improved mean Intersection over Union and overall accuracy.</span>

                                        <span>Radiographs are used as the most important imaging tool for identifying spine
anomalies in clinical practice. The evaluation of spinal bone lesions, however,
is a challenging task for radiologists. This work aims at developing and
evaluating a deep learning-based framework, named VinDr-SpineXR, for the
classification and localization of abnormalities from spine X-rays. First, we
build a large dataset, comprising 10,468 spine X-ray images from 5,000 studies,
each of which is manually annotated by an experienced radiologist with bounding
boxes around abnormal findings in 13 categories. Using this dataset, we then
train a deep learning classifier to determine whether a spine scan is abnormal
and a detector to localize 7 crucial findings amongst the total 13. The
VinDr-SpineXR is evaluated on a test set of 2,078 images from 1,000 studies,
which is kept separate from the training set. It demonstrates an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 88.61% (95% CI 87.19%,
90.02%) for the image-level classification task and a mean average precision
(mAP@0.5) of 33.56% for the lesion-level localization task. These results serve
as a proof of concept and set a baseline for future research in this direction.
To encourage advances, the dataset, codes, and trained deep learning models are
made publicly available.</span>

frames to generate a higher-resolution image for each frame. However, the
redundant information between distant frames has not been fully exploited in
these methods: corresponding patches of the same instance appear across distant
frames at different scales. Based on this observation, we propose a video
super-resolution method with long-term cross-scale aggregation that leverages
similar patches (self-exemplars) across distant frames. Our model also consists
of a multi-reference alignment module to fuse the features derived from similar
patches: we fuse the features of distant references to perform high-quality
super-resolution. We also propose a novel and practical training strategy for
referenced-based super-resolution. To evaluate the performance of our proposed
method, we conduct extensive experiments on our collected CarCam dataset and
the Waymo Open dataset, and the results demonstrate our method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Our source code will be publicly available.</span>

automated data cleaning, schema matching, data discovery, semantic data type
normalization and sensitive data identification. Existing methods include
regular expression-based or dictionary lookup-based methods that are not robust
to dirty as well unseen data and are limited to a very less number of semantic
data types to predict. Existing Machine Learning methods extract large number
of engineered features from data and build logistic regression, random forest
or feedforward neural network for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce
DCoM, a collection of multi-input NLP-based deep neural networks to detect
semantic data types where instead of extracting large number of features from
the data, we feed the raw values of columns (or instances) to the model as
texts. We train DCoM on 686,765 data columns extracted from VizNet corpus with
78 different semantic data types. DCoM outperforms other contemporary results

superior lossy compression performance. However, distinct models are required
to be trained to reach different points in the rate-distortion (R-D) space. In
this paper, we consider the problem of R-D characteristic analysis and modeling
for NIC. We make efforts to formulate the essential mathematical functions to
describe the R-D behavior of NIC using deep network and statistical modeling.
Thus continuous bit-rate points could be elegantly realized by leveraging such
model via a single trained network. In this regard, we propose a plugin-in
module to learn the relationship between the target bit-rate and the binary
representation for the latent variable of auto-encoder. Furthermore, we model
the rate and distortion characteristic of NIC as a function of the coding
parameter $\lambda$ respectively. Our experiments show our proposed method is
easy to adopt and obtains competitive coding performance with fixed-rate coding
approaches, which would benefit the practical deployment of NIC. In addition,
the proposed model could be applied to NIC rate control with limited bit-rate
error using a single network.</span>

data-dependent and require large datasets for training. The lack of data in the
medical imaging field creates a bottleneck for the application of deep learning
to medical image analysis. Medical image acquisition, annotation, and analysis
are costly, and their usage is constrained by ethical restrictions. They also
require many resources, such as human expertise and funding. That makes it
difficult for non-medical researchers to have access to useful and large
medical data. Thus, as comprehensive as possible, this paper provides a
collection of medical image datasets with their associated challenges for deep
learning research. We have collected information of around three hundred
datasets and challenges mainly reported between 2013 and 2020 and categorized
them into four categories: head &amp; neck, chest &amp; abdomen, pathology &amp; blood, and
&#x60;&#x60;others&#x27;&#x27;. Our paper has three purposes: 1) to provide a most up to date and
complete list that can be used as a universal reference to easily find the
datasets for clinical image analysis, 2) to guide researchers on the
methodology to test and evaluate their methods&#x27; performance and robustness on
relevant datasets, 3) to provide a &#x60;&#x60;route&#x27;&#x27; to relevant algorithms for the
relevant medical topics, and challenge leaderboards.</span>

                                        <span>With the rapid progress of deepfake techniques in recent years, facial video
forgery can generate highly deceptive video contents and bring severe security
threats. And detection of such forgery videos is much more urgent and
challenging. Most existing detection methods treat the problem as a vanilla
binary classification problem. In this paper, the problem is treated as a
special fine-grained classification problem since the differences between fake
and real faces are very subtle. It is observed that most existing face forgery
methods left some common artifacts in the spatial domain and time domain,
including generative defects in the spatial domain and inter-frame
inconsistencies in the time domain. And a spatial-temporal model is proposed
which has two components for capturing spatial and temporal forgery traces in
global perspective respectively. The two components are designed using a novel
long distance attention mechanism. The one component of the spatial domain is
used to capture artifacts in a single frame, and the other component of the
time domain is used to capture artifacts in consecutive frames. They generate
attention maps in the form of patches. The attention method has a broader
vision which contributes to better assembling global information and extracting
local statistic information. Finally, the attention maps are used to guide the
network to focus on pivotal parts of the face, just like other fine-grained
classification methods. The experimental results on different public datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance,
and the proposed long distance attention method can effectively capture pivotal
parts for face forgery.</span>

                                        <span>The conventional spatial convolution layers in the Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are computationally expensive at the point where the training
time could take days unless the number of layers, the number of training images
or the size of the training images are reduced. The image size of 256x256
pixels is commonly used for most of the applications of CNN, but this image
size is too small for applications like Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)
classification where the image details are important for accurate
classification. This research proposed Frequency Domain Convolution (FDC) and
Frequency Domain Pooling (FDP) layers which were built with RFFT, kernel
initialization strategy, convolution artifact removal and Channel Independent
Convolution (CIC) to replace the conventional convolution and pooling layers.
The FDC and FDP layers are used to build a Frequency Domain Convolutional
Neural Network (FDCNN) to accelerate the training of large images for DR
classification. The Full FDC layer is an extension of the FDC layer to allow
direct use in conventional CNNs, it is also used to modify the VGG16
architecture. FDCNN is shown to be at least 54.21% faster and 70.74% more
memory efficient compared to an equivalent CNN architecture. The modified VGG16
architecture with Full FDC layer is reported to achieve a shorter training time
and a higher accuracy at 95.63% compared to the original VGG16 architecture for
DR classification.</span>

driving. However, achieving full autonomy remains a daunting task due to the
complex and dynamic driving environment. As a result, self-driving cars are
equipped with a suite of sensors to conduct robust and accurate environment
perception. As the number and type of sensors keep increasing, combining them
for better perception is becoming a natural trend. So far, there has been no
indepth review that focuses on multi-sensor fusion based perception. To bridge
this gap and motivate future research, this survey devotes to review recent
fusion-based 3D detection deep learning models that leverage multiple sensor
data sources, especially cameras and LiDARs. In this survey, we first introduce
the background of popular sensors for autonomous cars, including their common
data representations as well as object detection networks developed for each
type of sensor data. Next, we discuss some popular datasets for multi-modal 3D
object detection, with a special focus on the sensor data included in each
dataset. Then we present in-depth reviews of recent multi-modal 3D detection
networks by considering the following three aspects of the fusion: fusion
location, fusion data representation, and fusion granularity. After a detailed
review, we discuss open challenges and point out possible solutions. We hope
that our detailed review can help researchers to embark investigations in the
area of multi-modal 3D object detection.</span>

technologies to ensure the success of the exploration. In such a GPS denied
environment, vision-based localization is an optimal approach. In this paper,
we proposed a multi-modal registration based SLAM algorithm, which estimates
the location of a planet UAV using a nadir view camera on the UAV compared with
pre-existing digital terrain model. To overcome the scale and appearance
difference between on-board UAV images and pre-installed digital terrain model,
a theoretical model is proposed to prove that topographic features of UAV image
and DEM can be correlated in frequency domain via cross power spectrum. To
provide the six-DOF of the UAV, we also developed an optimization approach
which fuses the geo-referencing result into a SLAM system via LBA (Local Bundle
Adjustment) to achieve robust and accurate vision-based navigation even in
featureless planetary areas. To test the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed localization algorithm, a new cross-source drone-based localization
dataset for planetary exploration is proposed. The proposed dataset includes
40200 synthetic drone images taken from nine planetary scenes with related DEM
query images. Comparison experiments carried out demonstrate that over the
flight distance of 33.8km, the proposed method achieved average localization
error of 0.45 meters, compared to 1.31 meters by ORB-SLAM, with the processing
speed of 12hz which will ensure a real-time performance. We will make our
datasets available to encourage further work on this promising topic.</span>

model&#x27;s training set thereby flagging misleading predictions and bringing a
greater flexibility and transparency at deployment time. However, research in
this area has only considered Novelty Detection in the offline setting.
Recently, there has been a growing realization in the computer vision community
that applications demand a more flexible framework - Continual Learning - where
new batches of data representing new domains, new classes or new tasks become
available at different points in time. In this setting, Novelty Detection
becomes more important, interesting and challenging. This work identifies the
crucial link between the two problems and investigates the Novelty Detection
problem under the Continual Learning setting. We formulate the Continual
Novelty Detection problem and present a benchmark, where we compare several
Novelty Detection methods under different Continual Learning settings.

We show that Continual Learning affects the behaviour of novelty detection
algorithms, while novelty detection can pinpoint insights in the behaviour of a
continual learner. We further propose baselines and discuss possible research
directions. We believe that the coupling of the two problems is a promising
direction to bring vision models into practice.</span>

mobile robots. It places image retrieval in the practical context of physical
agents operating in a physical world. It is an active field of research and
many different approaches have been proposed and evaluated in many different
experiments. In the following, we argue that due to variations of this
practical context and individual design decisions, place recognition
experiments are barely comparable across different papers and that there is a
variety of properties that can change from one experiment to another. We
provide an extensive list of such properties and give examples how they can be
used to setup a place recognition experiment easier or harder. This might be
interesting for different involved parties: (1) people who just want to select
a place recognition approach that is suitable for the properties of their
particular task at hand, (2) researchers that look for open research questions
and are interested in particularly difficult instances, (3) authors that want

                                        <span>Traditional feature-based image stitching technologies rely heavily on
feature detection quality, often failing to stitch images with few features or
low resolution. The learning-based image stitching solutions are rarely studied
due to the lack of labeled data, making the supervised methods unreliable. To
address the above limitations, we propose an unsupervised deep image stitching
framework consisting of two stages: unsupervised coarse image alignment and
unsupervised image reconstruction. In the first stage, we design an
ablation-based loss to constrain an unsupervised homography network, which is
more suitable for large-baseline scenes. Moreover, a transformer layer is
introduced to warp the input images in the stitching-domain space. In the
second stage, motivated by the insight that the misalignments in pixel-level
can be eliminated to a certain extent in feature-level, we design an
unsupervised image reconstruction network to eliminate the artifacts from
features to pixels. Specifically, the reconstruction network can be implemented
by a low-resolution deformation branch and a high-resolution refined branch,
learning the deformation rules of image stitching and enhancing the resolution
simultaneously. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning
framework, a comprehensive real-world image dataset for unsupervised deep image
stitching is presented and released. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the
superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art solutions. Even compared
with the supervised solutions, our image stitching quality is still preferred
by users.</span>

                                        <span>Trail camera imagery has increasingly gained popularity amongst biologists
for conservation and ecological research. Minimal human interference required
to operate camera traps allows capturing unbiased species activities. Several
studies - based on human and wildlife interactions, migratory patterns of
various species, risk of extinction in endangered populations - are limited by
the lack of rich data and the time-consuming nature of manually annotating
trail camera imagery. We introduce a challenging wildlife camera trap
classification dataset collected from two different locations in Southwestern
Florida, consisting of 104,495 images featuring visually similar species,
varying illumination conditions, skewed class distribution, and including
samples of endangered species, i.e. Florida panthers. Experimental evaluations
with ResNet-50 architecture indicate that this image classification-based
dataset can further push the advancements in wildlife statistical modeling. We
will make the dataset publicly available.</span>

                                        <span>Arbitrary-shaped text detection is a challenging task since curved texts in
the wild are of the complex geometric layouts. Existing mainstream methods
follow the instance segmentation pipeline to obtain the text regions. However,
arbitraryshaped texts are difficult to be depicted through one single
segmentation network because of the varying scales. In this paper, we propose a
two-stage segmentation-based detector, termed as NASK (Need A Second looK), for
arbitrary-shaped text detection. Compared to the traditional single-stage
segmentation network, our NASK conducts the detection in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the first stage segmentation spotting the rectangle text proposals
and the second one retrieving compact representations. Specifically, NASK is
composed of a Text Instance Segmentation (TIS) network (1st stage), a
Geometry-aware Text RoI Alignment (GeoAlign) module, and a Fiducial pOint
eXpression (FOX) module (2nd stage). Firstly, TIS extracts the augmented
features with a novel Group Spatial and Channel Attention (GSCA) module and
conducts instance segmentation to obtain rectangle proposals. Then, GeoAlign
converts these rectangles into the fixed size and encodes RoI-wise feature
representation. Finally, FOX disintegrates the text instance into serval
pivotal geometrical attributes to refine the detection results. Extensive
experimental results on three public benchmarks including Total-Text,
SCUTCTW1500, and ICDAR 2015 verify that our NASK outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Compressed Sensing (CS) theory simultaneously realizes the signal sampling
and compression process, and can use fewer observations to achieve accurate
signal recovery, providing a solution for better and faster transmission of
massive data. In this paper, a ternary sampling matrix-based method with
attention mechanism is proposed with the purpose to solve the problem that the
CS sampling matrices in most cases are random matrices, which are irrelative to
the sampled signal and need a large storage space. The proposed method consists
of three components, i.e., ternary sampling, initial reconstruction and deep
reconstruction, with the emphasis on the ternary sampling. The main idea of the
ternary method (-1, 0, +1) is to introduce the attention mechanism to evaluate
the importance of parameters at the sampling layer after the sampling matrix is
binarized (-1, +1), followed by pruning weight of parameters, whose importance
is below a predefined threshold, to achieve ternarization. Furthermore, a
compressed sensing algorithm especially for image reconstruction is
implemented, on the basis of the ternary sampling matrix, which is called
ATP-Net, i.e., Attention-based ternary projection network. Experimental results
show that the quality of image reconstruction by means of ATP-Net maintains a
satisfactory level with the employment of the ternary sampling matrix, i.e.,
the average PSNR on Set11 is 30.4 when the sampling rate is 0.25, approximately
6% improvement compared with that of DR2-Net.</span>

                                        <span>Quite a few people in the world have to stay under permanent surveillance for
health reasons; they include diabetic people or people with some other chronic
conditions, the elderly and the disabled.These groups may face heightened risk
of having life-threatening falls or of being struck by a syncope. Due to
limited availability of resources a substantial part of people at risk can not
receive necessary monitoring and thus are exposed to excessive danger.
Nowadays, this problem is usually solved via applying Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) methods. HAR is a perspective and fast-paced Data Science
field, which has a wide range of application areas such as healthcare, sport,
security etc. However, the currently techniques of recognition are markedly
lacking in accuracy, hence, the present paper suggests a highly accurate method
for human activity classification. Wepropose a new workflow to address the HAR
problem and evaluate it on the UniMiB SHAR dataset, which consists of the
accelerometer signals. The model we suggest is based on continuous wavelet
transform (CWT) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Wavelet transform
localizes signal features both in time and frequency domains and after that a
CNN extracts these features and recognizes activity. It is also worth noting
that CWT converts 1D accelerometer signal into 2D images and thus enables to
obtain better results as 2D networks have a significantly higher predictive
capacity. In the course of the work we build a convolutional neural network and
vary such model parameters as number of spatial axes, number of layers, number
of neurons in each layer, image size, type of mother wavelet, the order of zero
moment of mother wavelet etc. Besides, we also apply models with residual
blocks which resulted in significantly higher metric values. Finally, we
succeed to reach 99.26 % accuracy and it is a worthy performance for this
problem.</span>

                                        <span>Many works in the recent literature introduce semantic mapping methods that
use CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to recognize semantic properties in
images. The types of properties (eg.: room size, place category, and objects)
and their classes (eg.: kitchen and bathroom, for place category) are usually
predefined and restricted to a specific task. Thus, all the visual data
acquired and processed during the construction of the maps are lost and only
the recognized semantic properties remain on the maps. In contrast, this work
introduces a topological semantic mapping method that uses deep visual features
extracted by a CNN, the GoogLeNet, from 2D images captured in multiple views of
the environment as the robot operates, to create consolidated representations
of visual features acquired in the regions covered by each topological node.
These consolidated representations allow flexible recognition of semantic
properties of the regions and use in a range of visual tasks. The experiments,
performed using a real-world indoor dataset, showed that the method is able to
consolidate the visual features of regions and use them to recognize objects
and place categories as semantic properties, and to indicate the topological
location of images, with very promising results. The objects are classified
using the classification layer of GoogLeNet, without retraining, and the place
categories are recognized using a shallow Multilayer Perceptron.</span>

advantages in deformable image registration. However, analyzing the effects of
hyperparameters and searching for optimal regularization parameters prove to be
too prohibitive in deep learning-based methods. This is because it involves
training a substantial number of separate models with distinct hyperparameter
values. In this paper, we propose a conditional image registration method and a
new self-supervised learning paradigm for deep deformable image registration.
By learning the conditional features that correlated with the regularization
hyperparameter, we demonstrate that optimal solutions with arbitrary
hyperparameters can be captured by a single deep convolutional neural network.
In addition, the smoothness of the resulting deformation field can be
manipulated with arbitrary strength of smoothness regularization during
inference. Extensive experiments on a large-scale brain MRI dataset show that
our proposed method enables the precise control of the smoothness of the
deformation field without sacrificing the runtime advantage or registration
accuracy.</span>

With many genres of available shows, more and more people are increasingly
getting attracted to this niche section of the entertainment industry. As anime
has recently garnered mainstream attention, we have insufficient information
regarding users&#x27; penchant and watching habits. Therefore, it is an uphill task
to build a recommendation engine for this relatively obscure entertainment
medium. In this attempt, we have built a novel hybrid recommendation system
that could act both as a recommendation system and as a means of exploring new
anime genres and titles. We have analyzed the general trends in this field and
the users&#x27; watching habits for coming up with our efficacious solution. Our
solution employs deep autoencoders for the tasks of predicting ratings and
generating embeddings. Following this, we formed clusters using the embeddings
of the anime titles. These clusters form the search space for anime with
similarities and are used to find anime similar to the ones liked and disliked
by the user. This method, combined with the predicted ratings, forms the novel
hybrid filter. In this article, we have demonstrated this idea and compared the
performance of our implemented model with the existing state-of-the-art
techniques.</span>

from traditional text question answering (QA) tasks, SCQA involves audio signal
processing, passage comprehension, and contextual understanding. However, ASR
systems introduce unexpected noisy signals to the transcriptions, which result
in performance degradation on SCQA. To overcome the problem, we propose CADNet,
a novel contextualized attention-based distillation approach, which applies
both cross-attention and self-attention to obtain ASR-robust contextualized
embedding representations of the passage and dialogue history for performance
improvements. We also introduce the spoken conventional knowledge distillation

                                        <span>Analysing research trends and predicting their impact on academia and
industry is crucial to gain a deeper understanding of the advances in a
research field and to inform critical decisions about research funding and
technology adoption. In the last years, we saw the emergence of several
publicly-available and large-scale Scientific Knowledge Graphs fostering the
development of many data-driven approaches for performing quantitative analyses
of research trends. This chapter presents an innovative framework for
detecting, analysing, and forecasting research topics based on a large-scale
knowledge graph characterising research articles according to the research
topics from the Computer Science Ontology. We discuss the advantages of a
solution based on a formal representation of topics and describe how it was
applied to produce bibliometric studies and innovative tools for analysing and
predicting research dynamics.</span>

                                        <span>Process mining is a relatively new subject which builds a bridge between
process modelling and data mining. An exclusive choice in a process model
usually splits the process into different branches. However, in some processes,
it is possible to switch from one branch to another. The inductive miner
guarantees to return sound process models, but fails to return a precise model
when there are switch behaviours between different exclusive choice branches
due to the limitation of process trees. In this paper, we present a novel
extension to the process tree model to support switch behaviours between
different branches of the exclusive choice operator and propose a novel
extension to the inductive miner to discover sound process models with switch
behaviours. The proposed discovery technique utilizes the theory of a previous
study to detect possible switch behaviours. We apply both artificial and
publicly-available datasets to evaluate our approach. Our results show that our
approach can improve the precision of discovered models by 36% while
maintaining high fitness values compared to the original inductive miner.</span>

                                        <span>Service manual documents are crucial to the engineering company as they
provide guidelines and knowledge to service engineers. However, it has become
inconvenient and inefficient for service engineers to retrieve specific
knowledge from documents due to the complexity of resources. In this research,
we propose an automated knowledge mining and document classification system
with novel multi-model transfer learning approaches. Particularly, the
classification performance of the system has been improved with three effective
techniques: fine-tuning, pruning, and multi-model method. The fine-tuning
technique optimizes a pre-trained BERT model by adding a feed-forward neural
network layer and the pruning technique is used to retrain the BERT model with
new data. The multi-model method initializes and trains multiple BERT models to
overcome the randomness of data ordering during the fine-tuning process. In the
first iteration of the training process, multiple BERT models are being trained
simultaneously. The best model is then selected for the next phase of the
training process with another two iterations and the training processes for
other BERT models will be terminated. The performance of the proposed system
has been evaluated by comparing with two robust baseline methods, BERT and
BERT-CNN. Experimental results on a widely used Corpus of Linguistic
Acceptability (CoLA) dataset have shown that the proposed techniques perform
better than these baseline methods in terms of accuracy and MCC score.</span>

                                        <span>OBJECTIVE: Leverage existing biomedical NLP tools and DS domain terminology
to produce a novel and comprehensive knowledge graph containing dietary
supplement (DS) information for discovering interactions between DS and drugs,
or Drug-Supplement Interactions (DSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created
SemRepDS (an extension of SemRep), capable of extracting semantic relations
from abstracts by leveraging a DS-specific terminology (iDISK) containing
28,884 DS terms not found in the UMLS. PubMed abstracts were processed using
SemRepDS to generate semantic relations, which were then filtered using a
PubMedBERT-based model to remove incorrect relations before generating our
knowledge graph (SuppKG). Two pathways are used to identify potential DS-Drug
interactions which are then evaluated by medical professionals for mechanistic
plausibility. RESULTS: Comparison analysis found that SemRepDS returned 206.9%
more DS relations and 158.5% more DS entities than SemRep. The fine-tuned BERT
model obtained an F1 score of 0.8605 and removed 43.86% of the relations,
improving the precision of the relations by 26.4% compared to pre-filtering.
SuppKG consists of 2,928 DS-specific nodes. Manual review of findings
identified 44 (88%) proposed DS-Gene-Drug and 32 (64%) proposed
DS-Gene1-Function-Gene2-Drug pathways to be mechanistically plausible.
DISCUSSION: The additional relations extracted using SemRepDS generated SuppKG
that was used to find plausible DSI not found in the current literature. By the
nature of the SuppKG, these interactions are unlikely to have been found using
SemRep without the expanded DS terminology. CONCLUSION: We successfully extend
SemRep to include DS information and produce SuppKG which can be used to find
potential DS-Drug interactions.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the problem of semantic matching in product search: given a
customer query, retrieve all semantically related products from a huge catalog
of size 100 million, or more. Because of large catalog spaces and real-time
latency constraints, semantic matching algorithms not only desire high recall
but also need to have low latency. Conventional lexical matching approaches
(e.g., Okapi-BM25) exploit inverted indices to achieve fast inference time, but
fail to capture behavioral signals between queries and products. In contrast,
embedding-based models learn semantic representations from customer behavior
data, but the performance is often limited by shallow neural encoders due to
latency constraints. Semantic product search can be viewed as an eXtreme
Multi-label Classification (XMC) problem, where customer queries are input
instances and products are output labels. In this paper, we aim to improve
semantic product search by using tree-based XMC models where inference time
complexity is logarithmic in the number of products. We consider hierarchical
linear models with n-gram features for fast real-time inference.
Quantitatively, our method maintains a low latency of 1.25 milliseconds per
query and achieves a 65% improvement of Recall@100 (60.9% v.s. 36.8%) over a
competing embedding-based DSSM model. Our model is robust to weight pruning
with varying thresholds, which can flexibly meet different system requirements
for online deployments. Qualitatively, our method can retrieve products that
are complementary to existing product search system and add diversity to the
match set.</span>

                                        <span>Recommender systems -- and especially matrix factorization-based
collaborative filtering algorithms -- play a crucial role in mediating our
access to online information. We show that such algorithms induce a particular
kind of stereotyping: if preferences for a \textit{set} of items are
anti-correlated in the general user population, then those items may not be
recommended together to a user, regardless of that user&#x27;s preferences and
ratings history. First, we introduce a notion of \textit{joint accessibility},
which measures the extent to which a set of items can jointly be accessed by
users. We then study joint accessibility under the standard factorization-based
collaborative filtering framework, and provide theoretical necessary and
sufficient conditions when joint accessibility is violated. Moreover, we show
that these conditions can easily be violated when the users are represented by
a single feature vector. To improve joint accessibility, we further propose an
alternative modelling fix, which is designed to capture the diverse multiple
interests of each user using a multi-vector representation. We conduct
extensive experiments on real and simulated datasets, demonstrating the
stereotyping problem with standard single-vector matrix factorization models.</span>

items to be ranked are often available. It is sensible, then, to try to combine
these representations to improve ranking. Indeed, learning to rank via
combining representations is both principled and practical for learning a
ranking function for a particular query. In extremely data-scarce settings,
however, the amount of labeled data available for a particular query can lead
to a highly variable and ineffective ranking function. One way to mitigate the
effect of the small amount of data is to leverage information from semantically
similar queries. Indeed, as we demonstrate in simulation settings and real data
examples, when semantically similar queries are available it is possible to
gainfully use them when ranking with respect to a particular query. We describe
and explore this phenomenon in the context of the bias-variance trade off and
apply it to the data-scarce settings of a Bing navigational graph and the
Drosophila larva connectome.</span>

quadrupedal robots. Animals can actively switch gaits at different speeds to
lower their energy consumption. In this paper, we devise a hierarchical
learning framework, in which distinctive locomotion gaits and natural gait
transitions emerge automatically with a simple reward of energy minimization.
We use reinforcement learning to train a high-level gait policy that specifies
gait patterns of each foot, while the low-level whole-body controller optimizes
the motor commands so that the robot can walk at a desired velocity using that
gait pattern. We test our learning framework on a quadruped robot and
demonstrate automatic gait transitions, from walking to trotting and to
fly-trotting, as the robot increases its speed. We show that the learned
hierarchical controller consumes much less energy across a wide range of
locomotion speed than baseline controllers.</span>

are ubiquitous, for example, when the learner only has query access to the

the learner must evaluate the metric via performance evaluation using a small

the metric on the validation sample. We show how to model and estimate the

                                        <span>Understanding the semantics of human movement -- the what, how and why of the
movement -- is an important problem that requires datasets of human actions
with semantic labels. Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale
video datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D
human motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body
motions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we
present BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions
being performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about
43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of
abstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and
frame labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame
label is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the
mocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence
labels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action
categories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action
recognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To
demonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of
models on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting
learning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve
as a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition. The dataset,
baseline method, and evaluation code is made available, and supported for
academic research purposes at https://babel.is.tue.mpg.de/.</span>

                                        <span>Singular value decomposition is central to many problems in engineering and
scientific fields. Several quantum algorithms have been proposed to determine
the singular values and their associated singular vectors of a given matrix.
Although these algorithms are promising, the required quantum subroutines and
resources are too costly on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose
a variational quantum algorithm for singular value decomposition (VQSVD). By
exploiting the variational principles for singular values and the Ky Fan
Theorem, we design a novel loss function such that two quantum neural networks
(or parameterized quantum circuits) could be trained to learn the singular
vectors and output the corresponding singular values. Furthermore, we conduct
numerical simulations of VQSVD for random matrices as well as its applications
in image compression of handwritten digits. Finally, we discuss the
applications of our algorithm in recommendation systems and polar
decomposition. Our work explores new avenues for quantum information processing
beyond the conventional protocols that only works for Hermitian data, and
reveals the capability of matrix decomposition on near-term quantum devices.</span>

risk bounds for learning vector-valued functions in both the kernel space and
linear space. The derived bounds are much sharper than existing ones, where
convergence rates are improved from $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$ to
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n+u}),$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ in special cases. Motivated

the kernel function of Hawkes processes. The non-parametric Bayesian approach
is important because it provides flexible Hawkes kernels and quantifies their
uncertainty. Our method is based on the cluster representation of Hawkes
processes. Utilizing the stationarity of the Hawkes process, we efficiently
sample random branching structures and thus, we split the Hawkes process into
clusters of Poisson processes. We derive two algorithms -- a block Gibbs
sampler and a maximum a posteriori estimator based on expectation maximization
-- and we show that our methods have a linear time complexity, both
theoretically and empirically. On synthetic data, we show our methods to be
able to infer flexible Hawkes triggering kernels. On two large-scale Twitter
diffusion datasets, we show that our methods outperform the current
state-of-the-art in goodness-of-fit and that the time complexity is linear in
the size of the dataset. We also observe that on diffusions related to online

pre-trained neural network to extract symbolic facts from unstructured data and
an ILP system to learn a hypothesis that performs a downstream classification
task. In order to evaluate the applicability of our approach to real-world
applications, the framework is evaluated on tasks where distributional shifts
are introduced to unstructured input data, for which pre-trained neural
networks are likely to predict incorrectly and with high confidence.
Experimental results show that FF-NSL outperforms baseline approaches such as a
random forest and deep neural networks by learning more accurate and
interpretable hypotheses with fewer examples.</span>

                                        <span>The vision community is witnessing a modeling shift from CNNs to
Transformers, where pure Transformer architectures have attained top accuracy
on the major video recognition benchmarks. These video models are all built on
Transformer layers that globally connect patches across the spatial and
temporal dimensions. In this paper, we instead advocate an inductive bias of
locality in video Transformers, which leads to a better speed-accuracy
trade-off compared to previous approaches which compute self-attention globally
even with spatial-temporal factorization. The locality of the proposed video
architecture is realized by adapting the Swin Transformer designed for the
image domain, while continuing to leverage the power of pre-trained image
models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a broad range of
video recognition benchmarks, including on action recognition (84.9 top-1
accuracy on Kinetics-400 and 86.1 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-600 with ~20x less
pre-training data and ~3x smaller model size) and temporal modeling (69.6 top-1
accuracy on Something-Something v2). The code and models will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/SwinTransformer/Video-Swin-Transformer.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, implicit deep learning has emerged as a method to increase
the depth of deep neural networks. While their training is memory-efficient,
they are still significantly slower to train than their explicit counterparts.
In Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs), the training is performed as a bi-level
problem, and its computational complexity is partially driven by the iterative
inversion of a huge Jacobian matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy
to tackle this computational bottleneck from which many bi-level problems
suffer. The main idea is to use the quasi-Newton matrices from the forward pass
to efficiently approximate the inverse Jacobian matrix in the direction needed
for the gradient computation. We provide a theorem that motivates using our
method with the original forward algorithms. In addition, by modifying these
forward algorithms, we further provide theoretical guarantees that our method
asymptotically estimates the true implicit gradient. We empirically study this
approach in many settings, ranging from hyperparameter optimization to large
Multiscale DEQs applied to CIFAR and ImageNet. We show that it reduces the
computational cost of the backward pass by up to two orders of magnitude. All
this is achieved while retaining the excellent performance of the original
models in hyperparameter optimization and on CIFAR, and giving encouraging and
competitive results on ImageNet.</span>

in bioinformatics. However, clinical predictions using information from
genomics datasets as well is not a frequently observed phenomenon in research.
Precision medicine research requires information from all available datasets to
provide intelligent clinical solutions. In this paper, we have attempted to
create a prediction model which uses information from both clinical and
genomics datasets. We have demonstrated multiclass disease predictions based on
combined clinical and genomics datasets using machine learning methods. We have
created an integrated dataset, using a clinical (ClinVar) and a genomics (gene
expression) dataset, and trained it using instance-based learner to predict
clinical diseases. We have used an innovative but simple way for multiclass
classification, where the number of output classes is as high as 75. We have
used Principal Component Analysis for feature selection. The classifier
predicted diseases with 73\% accuracy on the integrated dataset. The results
were consistent and competent when compared with other classification models.
The results show that genomics information can be reliably included in datasets
for clinical predictions and it can prove to be valuable in clinical
diagnostics and precision medicine.</span>

now widely used for source code processing, due to the format similarity
between source code and text. In contrast to natural language, source code is
strictly structured, i.e., it follows the syntax of the programming language.
Several recent works develop Transformer modifications for capturing syntactic
information in source code. The drawback of these works is that they do not
compare to each other and consider different tasks. In this work, we conduct a
thorough empirical study of the capabilities of Transformers to utilize
syntactic information in different tasks. We consider three tasks (code
completion, function naming and bug fixing) and re-implement different
syntax-capturing modifications in a unified framework. We show that
Transformers are able to make meaningful predictions based purely on syntactic
information and underline the best practices of taking the syntactic
information into account for improving the performance of the model.</span>

unsupervised and end-to-end trainable neural network for predicting vehicle
trajectories that provides partial interpretability. The novel approach is
based on the architecture and objective of common variational autoencoders. By
introducing expert knowledge within the decoder part of the autoencoder, the
encoder learns to extract latent parameters that provide a graspable meaning in
human terms. Such an interpretable latent space enables the validation by
expert defined rule sets. The evaluation of the DVAE is performed using the
publicly available highD dataset for highway traffic scenarios. In comparison
to a conventional variational autoencoder with equivalent complexity, the
proposed model provides a similar prediction accuracy but with the great
advantage of having an interpretable latent space. For crucial decision making
and assessing trustworthiness of a prediction this property is highly
desirable.</span>

actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an
autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions,
our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the
desired return. Despite its simplicity, Decision Transformer matches or exceeds

the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem. In particular, we consider the
convergence of policy gradient methods in the setting of known and unknown
parameters. We are able to produce a global linear convergence guarantee for
this approach in the setting of finite time horizon and stochastic state
dynamics under weak assumptions. The convergence of a projected policy gradient
method is also established in order to handle problems with constraints. We
illustrate the performance of the algorithm with two examples. The first
example is the optimal liquidation of a holding in an asset. We show results
for the case where we assume a model for the underlying dynamics and where we
apply the method to the data directly. The empirical evidence suggests that the
policy gradient method can learn the global optimal solution for a larger class
of stochastic systems containing the LQR framework and that it is more robust
with respect to model mis-specification when compared to a model-based

                                        <span>This paper addresses the problem of combining Byzantine resilience with
privacy in machine learning (ML). Specifically, we study if a distributed
implementation of the renowned Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) learning
algorithm is feasible with both differential privacy (DP) and
$(\alpha,f)$-Byzantine resilience. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to tackle this problem from a theoretical point of view. A key
finding of our analyses is that the classical approaches to these two
(seemingly) orthogonal issues are incompatible. More precisely, we show that a
direct composition of these techniques makes the guarantees of the resulting
SGD algorithm depend unfavourably upon the number of parameters of the ML
model, making the training of large models practically infeasible. We validate
our theoretical results through numerical experiments on publicly-available
datasets; showing that it is impractical to ensure DP and Byzantine resilience
simultaneously.</span>

                                        <span>In recent years, there has been a rapidly expanding focus on explaining the
predictions made by black-box AI systems that handle image and tabular data.
However, considerably less attention has been paid to explaining the
predictions of opaque AI systems handling time series data. In this paper, we
advance a novel model-agnostic, case-based technique -- Native Guide -- that
generates counterfactual explanations for time series classifiers. Given a
query time series, $T_{q}$, for which a black-box classification system
predicts class, $c$, a counterfactual time series explanation shows how $T_{q}$
could change, such that the system predicts an alternative class, $c&#x27;$. The
proposed instance-based technique adapts existing counterfactual instances in
the case-base by highlighting and modifying discriminative areas of the time
series that underlie the classification. Quantitative and qualitative results
from two comparative experiments indicate that Native Guide generates
plausible, proximal, sparse and diverse explanations that are better than those
produced by key benchmark counterfactual methods.</span>

                                        <span>Likelihood is a standard estimate for outlier detection. The specific role of
the normalization constraint is to ensure that the out-of-distribution (OOD)
regime has a small likelihood when samples are learned using maximum
likelihood. Because autoencoders do not possess such a process of
normalization, they often fail to recognize outliers even when they are
obviously OOD. We propose the Normalized Autoencoder (NAE), a normalized
probabilistic model constructed from an autoencoder. The probability density of
NAE is defined using the reconstruction error of an autoencoder, which is
differently defined in the conventional energy-based model. In our model,
normalization is enforced by suppressing the reconstruction of negative
samples, significantly improving the outlier detection performance. Our
experimental results confirm the efficacy of NAE, both in detecting outliers
and in generating in-distribution samples.</span>

                                        <span>Motivated by models for multiway comparison data, we consider the problem of
estimating a coordinate-wise isotonic function on the domain $[0, 1]^d$ from
noisy observations collected on a uniform lattice, but where the design points
have been permuted along each dimension. While the univariate and bivariate
versions of this problem have received significant attention, our focus is on
the multivariate case $d \geq 3$. We study both the minimax risk of estimation
(in empirical $L_2$ loss) and the fundamental limits of adaptation (quantified
by the adaptivity index) to a family of piecewise constant functions. We
provide a computationally efficient Mirsky partition estimator that is minimax
optimal while also achieving the smallest adaptivity index possible for
polynomial time procedures. Thus, from a worst-case perspective and in sharp
contrast to the bivariate case, the latent permutations in the model do not
introduce significant computational difficulties over and above vanilla
isotonic regression. On the other hand, the fundamental limits of adaptation
are significantly different with and without unknown permutations: Assuming a
hardness conjecture from average-case complexity theory, a
statistical-computational gap manifests in the former case. In a complementary
direction, we show that natural modifications of existing estimators fail to
satisfy at least one of the desiderata of optimal worst-case statistical
performance, computational efficiency, and fast adaptation. Along the way to
showing our results, we improve adaptation results in the special case $d &#x3D; 2$
and establish some properties of estimators for vanilla isotonic regression,
both of which may be of independent interest.</span>

ubiquitous, making buildings more livable, energy efficient, and sustainable.
These devices sense the environment and generate multivariate temporal data of
paramount importance for detecting anomalies and improving the prediction of
energy usage in smart buildings. However, detecting these anomalies in
centralized systems is often plagued by a huge delay in response time. To
overcome this issue, we formulate the anomaly detection problem in a federated
learning setting by leveraging the multi-task learning paradigm, which aims at
solving multiple tasks simultaneously while taking advantage of the
similarities and differences across tasks. We propose a novel privacy-by-design
federated learning model using a stacked long short-time memory (LSTM) model,
and we demonstrate that it is more than twice as fast during training
convergence compared to the centralized LSTM. The effectiveness of our
federated learning approach is demonstrated on three real-world datasets
generated by the IoT production system at General Electric Current smart
building, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods
in both classification and regression tasks. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing the overall
training cost without compromising the prediction performance.</span>

optimizing on the manifold of rank $r$ matrices, we allow our interim estimated
matrix to have a specific over-parametrized rank $2r$ structure. Our algorithm,
denoted R2RILS for rank $2r$ iterative least squares, has low memory
requirements, and at each iteration it solves a computationally cheap sparse
least-squares problem. We motivate our algorithm by its theoretical analysis

ecological loss to wild salmon populations and major economic loss to
aquaculture sites. The main transport mechanism driving the spread of sea lice
populations are near-surface ocean currents. Present strategies to estimate the

full-scale analysis. Motivated to address this challenge, we propose SALT: Sea

dispersion and distribution in space and time. Specifically, an adaptive
spatial mesh is generated by merging nodes in the lattice graph of the Ocean

elements from wav2vec 2.0 and VQ-VAE. Our model learns to reproduce quantized
representations from partially masked speech encoding using a contrastive loss

regularized by an additional consistency network that learns to reconstruct the

a way similar to a VQ-VAE model. The proposed self-supervised model is trained
on 10k hours of unlabeled data and subsequently used as the speech encoder in a
RNN-T ASR model and fine-tuned with 1k hours of labeled data. This work is one
of only a few studies of self-supervised learning on speech tasks with a large
volume of real far-field labeled data. The Wav2vec-C encoded representations

                                        <span>We introduce and investigate matrix approximation by decomposition into a sum
of radial basis function (RBF) components. An RBF component is a generalization
of the outer product between a pair of vectors, where an RBF function replaces
the scalar multiplication between individual vector elements. Even though the
RBF functions are positive definite, the summation across components is not
restricted to convex combinations and allows us to compute the decomposition
for any real matrix that is not necessarily symmetric or positive definite. We
formulate the problem of seeking such a decomposition as an optimization
problem with a nonlinear and non-convex loss function. Several modern versions
of the gradient descent method, including their scalable stochastic
counterparts, are used to solve this problem. We provide extensive empirical
evidence of the effectiveness of the RBF decomposition and that of the
gradient-based fitting algorithm. While being conceptually motivated by
singular value decomposition (SVD), our proposed nonlinear counterpart
outperforms SVD by drastically reducing the memory required to approximate a
data matrix with the same L2 error for a wide range of matrix types. For
example, it leads to 2 to 6 times memory save for Gaussian noise, graph
adjacency matrices, and kernel matrices. Moreover, this proximity-based
decomposition can offer additional interpretability in applications that
involve, e.g., capturing the inner low-dimensional structure of the data,
retaining graph connectivity structure, and preserving the acutance of images.</span>

                                        <span>Current deep learning approaches for diffusion MRI modeling circumvent the
need for densely-sampled diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) by directly
predicting microstructural indices from sparsely-sampled DWIs. However, they
implicitly make unrealistic assumptions of static $q$-space sampling during
training and reconstruction. Further, such approaches can restrict downstream
usage of variably sampled DWIs for usages including the estimation of
microstructural indices or tractography. We propose a generative adversarial
translation framework for high-quality DWI synthesis with arbitrary $q$-space
sampling given commonly acquired structural images (e.g., B0, T1, T2). Our
translation network linearly modulates its internal representations conditioned
on continuous $q$-space information, thus removing the need for fixed sampling
schemes. Moreover, this approach enables downstream estimation of high-quality
microstructural maps from arbitrarily subsampled DWIs, which may be
particularly important in cases with sparsely sampled DWIs. Across several
recent methodologies, the proposed approach yields improved DWI synthesis
accuracy and fidelity with enhanced downstream utility as quantified by the
accuracy of scalar microstructure indices estimated from the synthesized
images. Code is available at

                                        <span>As modern games continue growing both in size and complexity, it has become
more challenging to ensure that all the relevant content is tested and that any
potential issue is properly identified and fixed. Attempting to maximize
testing coverage using only human participants, however, results in a tedious
and hard to orchestrate process which normally slows down the development
cycle. Complementing playtesting via autonomous agents has shown great promise
accelerating and simplifying this process. This paper addresses the problem of
automatically exploring and testing a given scenario using reinforcement
learning agents trained to maximize game state coverage. Each of these agents
is rewarded based on the novelty of its actions, thus encouraging a curious and
exploratory behaviour on a complex 3D scenario where previously proposed
exploration techniques perform poorly. The curious agents are able to learn the
complex navigation mechanics required to reach the different areas around the
map, thus providing the necessary data to identify potential issues. Moreover,
the paper also explores different visualization strategies and evaluates how to
make better use of the collected data to drive design decisions and to
recognize possible problems and oversights.</span>

                                        <span>Federated learning is emerging as a machine learning technique that trains a
model across multiple decentralized parties. It is renowned for preserving
privacy as the data never leaves the computational devices, and recent
approaches further enhance its privacy by hiding messages transferred in
encryption. However, we found that despite the efforts, federated learning
remains privacy-threatening, due to its interactive nature across different
parties. In this paper, we analyze the privacy threats in industrial-level
federated learning frameworks with secure computation, and reveal such threats
widely exist in typical machine learning models such as linear regression,
logistic regression and decision tree. For the linear and logistic regression,
we show through theoretical analysis that it is possible for the attacker to
invert the entire private input of the victim, given very few information. For
the decision tree model, we launch an attack to infer the range of victim&#x27;s
private inputs. All attacks are evaluated on popular federated learning
frameworks and real-world datasets.</span>

                                        <span>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is believed to have higher sample
efficiency compared with model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). However,
MBRL is plagued by dynamics bottleneck dilemma. Dynamics bottleneck dilemma is
the phenomenon that the performance of the algorithm falls into the local
optimum instead of increasing when the interaction step with the environment
increases, which means more data can not bring better performance. In this
paper, we find that the trajectory reward estimation error is the main reason
that causes dynamics bottleneck dilemma through theoretical analysis. We give
an upper bound of the trajectory reward estimation error and point out that
increasing the agent&#x27;s exploration ability is the key to reduce trajectory
reward estimation error, thereby alleviating dynamics bottleneck dilemma.
Motivated by this, a model-based control method combined with exploration named
MOdel-based Progressive Entropy-based Exploration (MOPE2) is proposed. We
conduct experiments on several complex continuous control benchmark tasks. The
results verify that MOPE2 can effectively alleviate dynamics bottleneck dilemma
and have higher sample efficiency than previous MBRL and MFRL algorithms.</span>

graphs with graph neural network based models. In this paper, we introduce
graph feature to feature (Fea2Fea) prediction pipelines in a low dimensional
space to explore some preliminary results on structural feature correlation,
which is based on graph neural network. The results show that there exists high

combination with initial node features, which is filtered by graph neural
network has improved its classification accuracy in some graph datasets. We
compare the difference between concatenation methods on connecting embeddings

                                        <span>A key challenge in mining social media data streams is to identify events
which are actively discussed by a group of people in a specific local or global
area. Such events are useful for early warning for accident, protest, election
or breaking news. However, neither the list of events nor the resolution of
both event time and space is fixed or known beforehand. In this work, we
propose an online spatio-temporal event detection system using social media
that is able to detect events at different time and space resolutions. First,
to address the challenge related to the unknown spatial resolution of events, a
quad-tree method is exploited in order to split the geographical space into
multiscale regions based on the density of social media data. Then, a
statistical unsupervised approach is performed that involves Poisson
distribution and a smoothing method for highlighting regions with unexpected
density of social posts. Further, event duration is precisely estimated by
merging events happening in the same region at consecutive time intervals. A
post processing stage is introduced to filter out events that are spam, fake or
wrong. Finally, we incorporate simple semantics by using social media entities
to assess the integrity, and accuracy of detected events. The proposed method
is evaluated using different social media datasets: Twitter and Flickr for
different cities: Melbourne, London, Paris and New York. To verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare our results with two baseline
algorithms based on fixed split of geographical space and clustering method.
For performance evaluation, we manually compute recall and precision. We also
propose a new quality measure named strength index, which automatically
measures how accurate the reported event is.</span>

                                        <span>When reasoning about strategic behavior in a machine learning context it is
tempting to combine standard microfoundations of rational agents with the
statistical decision theory underlying classification. In this work, we argue
that a direct combination of these standard ingredients leads to brittle
solution concepts of limited descriptive and prescriptive value. First, we show
that rational agents with perfect information produce discontinuities in the
aggregate response to a decision rule that we often do not observe empirically.
Second, when any positive fraction of agents is not perfectly strategic,
desirable stable points -- where the classifier is optimal for the data it
entails -- cease to exist. Third, optimal decision rules under standard
microfoundations maximize a measure of negative externality known as social
burden within a broad class of possible assumptions about agent behavior.

Recognizing these limitations we explore alternatives to standard
microfoundations for binary classification. We start by describing a set of
desiderata that help navigate the space of possible assumptions about how
agents respond to a decision rule. In particular, we analyze a natural
constraint on feature manipulations, and discuss properties that are sufficient
to guarantee the robust existence of stable points. Building on these insights,
we then propose the noisy response model. Inspired by smoothed analysis and
empirical observations, noisy response incorporates imperfection in the agent
responses, which we show mitigates the limitations of standard
microfoundations. Our model retains analytical tractability, leads to more
robust insights about stable points, and imposes a lower social burden at
optimality.</span>

                                        <span>We analyze the process of creating word embedding feature representations
designed for a learning task when annotated data is scarce, for example, in
depressive language detection from Tweets. We start with a rich word embedding
pre-trained from a large general dataset, which is then augmented with
embeddings learned from a much smaller and more specific domain dataset through
a simple non-linear mapping mechanism. We also experimented with several other
more sophisticated methods of such mapping including, several auto-encoder
based and custom loss-function based methods that learn embedding
representations through gradually learning to be close to the words of similar
semantics and distant to dissimilar semantics. Our strengthened representations
better capture the semantics of the depression domain, as it combines the
semantics learned from the specific domain coupled with word coverage from the
general language. We also present a comparative performance analyses of our
word embedding representations with a simple bag-of-words model, well known
sentiment and psycholinguistic lexicons, and a general pre-trained word
embedding. When used as feature representations for several different machine
learning methods, including deep learning models in a depressive Tweets
identification task, we show that our augmented word embedding representations
achieve a significantly better F1 score than the others, specially when applied
to a high quality dataset. Also, we present several data ablation tests which
confirm the efficacy of our augmentation techniques.</span>

that avoid, as much as possible, the evaluation of non-safe input points, which
are solutions, policies, or strategies that cause an irrecoverable loss (e.g.,
breakage of a machine or equipment, or life threat). Although a comprehensive
survey of safe reinforcement learning algorithms was published in 2015, a
number of new algorithms have been proposed thereafter, and related works in
active learning and in optimization were not considered. This paper reviews
those algorithms from a number of domains including reinforcement learning,
Gaussian process regression and classification, evolutionary algorithms, and
active learning. We provide the fundamental concepts on which the reviewed
algorithms are based and a characterization of the individual algorithms. We
conclude by explaining how the algorithms are connected and suggestions for

differentially private SGD on large neural networks, which are 1) the huge
memory cost of storing individual gradients, 2) the added noise suffering
notorious dimensional dependence. Specifically, we reparametrize each weight
matrix with two \emph{gradient-carrier} matrices of small dimension and a
\emph{residual weight} matrix. We argue that such reparametrization keeps the
forward/backward process unchanged while enabling us to compute the projected
gradient without computing the gradient itself. To learn with differential
privacy, we design \emph{reparametrized gradient perturbation (RGP)} that
perturbs the gradients on gradient-carrier matrices and reconstructs an update
for the original weight from the noisy gradients. Importantly, we use
historical updates to find the gradient-carrier matrices, whose optimality is
rigorously justified under linear regression and empirically verified with deep
learning tasks. RGP significantly reduces the memory cost and improves the
utility. For example, we are the first able to apply differential privacy on
the BERT model and achieve an average accuracy of $83.9\%$ on four downstream
tasks with $\epsilon&#x3D;8$, which is within $5\%$ loss compared to the non-private
baseline but enjoys much lower privacy leakage risk.</span>

                                        <span>In spoken conversational question answering (SCQA), the answer to the
corresponding question is generated by retrieving and then analyzing a fixed
spoken document, including multi-part conversations. Most SCQA systems have
considered only retrieving information from ordered utterances. However, the
sequential order of dialogue is important to build a robust spoken
conversational question answering system, and the changes of utterances order
may severely result in low-quality and incoherent corpora. To this end, we
introduce a self-supervised learning approach, including incoherence
discrimination, insertion detection, and question prediction, to explicitly
capture the coreference resolution and dialogue coherence among spoken
documents. Specifically, we design a joint learning framework where the
auxiliary self-supervised tasks can enable the pre-trained SCQA systems towards
more coherent and meaningful spoken dialogue learning. We also utilize the
proposed self-supervised learning tasks to capture intra-sentence coherence.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method provides more
coherent, meaningful, and appropriate responses, yielding superior performance
gains compared to the original pre-trained language models. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the Spoken-CoQA dataset.</span>

approximating the one-step dynamics function using random features with
uncertain parameters, which are equivalent to a shallow Bayesian neural
network, we then view the whole dynamical system as a multi-layer neural

functional theory (DFT) and machine-learning (ML)-acceleration is essential in
rapid materials discovery. By necessity, efficient DFT-based workflows are
carried out with a single density functional approximation (DFA). Nevertheless,
properties evaluated with different DFAs can be expected to disagree for the
cases with challenging electronic structure (e.g., open shell transition metal
complexes, TMCs) for which rapid screening is most needed and accurate
benchmarks are often unavailable. To quantify the effect of DFA bias, we
introduce an approach to rapidly obtain property predictions from 23
representative DFAs spanning multiple families and &quot;rungs&quot; (e.g., semi-local to
double hybrid) and basis sets on over 2,000 TMCs. Although computed properties
(e.g., spin-state ordering and frontier orbital gap) naturally differ by DFA,
high linear correlations persist across all DFAs. We train independent ML
models for each DFA and observe convergent trends in feature importance; these
features thus provide DFA-invariant, universal design rules. We devise a
strategy to train ML models informed by all 23 DFAs and use them to predict
properties (e.g., spin-splitting energy) of over 182k TMCs. By requiring
consensus of the ANN-predicted DFA properties, we improve correspondence of
these computational lead compounds with literature-mined, experimental
compounds over the single-DFA approach typically employed. Both feature
analysis and consensus-based ML provide efficient, alternative paths to
overcome accuracy limitations of practical DFT.</span>

                                        <span>We study the recent emerging personalized federated learning (PFL) that aims
at dealing with the challenging problem of Non-I.I.D. data in the federated
learning (FL) setting. The key difference between PFL and conventional FL lies
in the training target, of which the personalized models in PFL usually pursue
a trade-off between personalization (i.e., usually from local models) and
generalization (i.e., usually from the global model) on trained models.
Conventional FL methods can hardly meet this target because of their both
well-developed global and local models. The prevalent PFL approaches usually
maintain a global model to guide the training process of local models and
transfer a proper degree of generalization to them. However, the sole global
model can only provide one direction of generalization and may even transfer
negative effects to some local models when rich statistical diversity exists
across multiple local datasets. Based on our observation, most real or
synthetic data distributions usually tend to be clustered to some degree, of
which we argue different directions of generalization can facilitate the PFL.
In this paper, we propose a novel concept called clustered generalization to
handle the challenge of statistical heterogeneity in FL. Specifically, we
maintain multiple global (generalized) models in the server to associate with
the corresponding amount of local model clusters in clients, and further
formulate the PFL as a bi-level optimization problem that can be solved
efficiently and robustly. We also conduct detailed theoretical analysis and
provide the convergence guarantee for the smooth non-convex objectives.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that our approach
surpasses the state-of-the-art by a significant margin.</span>

solution of complex reinforcement learning problems that unfold over extended
periods. We argue that a robust way of combining skills is to define and
manipulate them in the space of pseudo-rewards (or &quot;cumulants&quot;). Based on this
premise, we propose a framework for combining skills using the formalism of
options. We show that every deterministic option can be unambiguously
represented as a cumulant defined in an extended domain. Building on this
insight and on previous results on transfer learning, we show how to
approximate options whose cumulants are linear combinations of the cumulants of
known options. This means that, once we have learned options associated with a
set of cumulants, we can instantaneously synthesise options induced by any
linear combination of them, without any learning involved. We describe how this
framework provides a hierarchical interface to the environment whose abstract
actions correspond to combinations of basic skills. We demonstrate the
practical benefits of our approach in a resource management problem and a
navigation task involving a quadrupedal simulated robot.</span>

                                        <span>Understanding the 3D world from 2D projected natural images is a fundamental
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Recently, an unsupervised learning
approach has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantages in data
collection. However, to mitigate training limitations, typical methods need to
impose assumptions for viewpoint distribution (e.g., a dataset containing
various viewpoint images) or object shape (e.g., symmetric objects). These
assumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to
non-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or
bird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose
aperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip
aperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and
depth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the
ambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth
texture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs),
we develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real
image distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise
a center focus prior to guiding the learning direction. In the experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of AR-GANs in various datasets, such as flower,
bird, and face images, demonstrate their portability by incorporating them into
other 3D representation learning GANs, and validate their applicability in
shallow DoF rendering.</span>

fields. However, EEG applications are limited by low signal-to-noise ratios.
Multiple types of artifacts contribute to the noisiness of EEG, and many
techniques have been proposed to detect and correct these artifacts. These
techniques range from simply detecting and rejecting artifact ridden segments,
to extracting the noise component from the EEG signal. In this paper we review
a variety of recent and classical techniques for EEG data artifact detection
and correction with a focus on the last half-decade. We compare the strengths

prediction strategies can rarely be understood. With recent advances in
Explainable Artificial Intelligence, approaches are available to explore the
reasoning behind those complex models&#x27; predictions. One class of approaches are
post-hoc attribution methods, among which Layer-wise Relevance Propagation
(LRP) shows high performance. However, the attempt at understanding a DNN&#x27;s
reasoning often stops at the attributions obtained for individual samples in
input space, leaving the potential for deeper quantitative analyses untouched.
As a manual analysis without the right tools is often unnecessarily labor
intensive, we introduce three software packages targeted at scientists to
explore model reasoning using attribution approaches and beyond: (1) Zennit - a
highly customizable and intuitive attribution framework implementing LRP and
related approaches in PyTorch, (2) CoRelAy - a framework to easily and quickly
construct quantitative analysis pipelines for dataset-wide analyses of

(cryo-EM), the Multi-Reference Alignment (MRA) model entails the learning of an
unknown signal from repeated measurements of its images under the latent action
of a group of isometries and additive noise of magnitude $\sigma$. Despite
significant interest, a clear picture for understanding rates of estimation in
this model has emerged only recently, particularly in the high-noise regime
$\sigma \gg 1$ that is highly relevant in applications. Recent investigations
have revealed a remarkable asymptotic sample complexity of order $\sigma^6$ for
certain signals whose Fourier transforms have full support, in stark contrast
to the traditional $\sigma^2$ that arise in regular models. Often prohibitively
large in practice, these results have prompted the investigation of variations
around the MRA model where better sample complexity may be achieved. In this
paper, we show that \emph{sparse} signals exhibit an intermediate $\sigma^4$
sample complexity even in the classical MRA model. Our results explore and
exploit connections of the MRA estimation problem with two classical topics in
applied mathematics: the \textit{beltway problem} from combinatorial
optimization, and \textit{uniform uncertainty principles} from harmonic
analysis.</span>

the decoder. The resulting algorithm jointly optimizes the modelling losses in
both the data and the latent spaces with the loss in the data space leading to
the denoising effect. With the symmetric treatment of the data and the latent
representation, the algorithm implicitly preserves the local structure of the
data in the latent space. To further improve the quality of the latent
representation, we incorporate a reconstruction loss into the objective, which
significantly benefits both the generation and reconstruction. We empirically
show the superior performance of SWAEs over the state-of-the-art generative
autoencoders in terms of classification, reconstruction, and generation.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, vision transformers and MLP-based models have been developed in
order to address some of the prevalent weaknesses in convolutional neural
networks. Due to the novelty of transformers being used in this domain along
with the self-attention mechanism, it remains unclear to what degree these
architectures are robust to corruptions. Despite some works proposing that data
augmentation remains essential for a model to be robust against corruptions, we
propose to explore the impact that the architecture has on corruption
robustness. We find that vision transformer architectures are inherently more
robust to corruptions than the ResNet-50 and MLP-Mixers. We also find that
vision transformers with 5 times fewer parameters than a ResNet-50 have more
shape bias. Our code is available to reproduce.</span>

                                        <span>Mental health conditions remain underdiagnosed even in countries with common
access to advanced medical care. The ability to accurately and efficiently
predict mood from easily collectible data has several important implications
for the early detection, intervention, and treatment of mental health
disorders. One promising data source to help monitor human behavior is daily
smartphone usage. However, care must be taken to summarize behaviors without
identifying the user through personal (e.g., personally identifiable
information) or protected (e.g., race, gender) attributes. In this paper, we
study behavioral markers of daily mood using a recent dataset of mobile
behaviors from adolescent populations at high risk of suicidal behaviors. Using
computational models, we find that language and multimodal representations of
mobile typed text (spanning typed characters, words, keystroke timings, and app
usage) are predictive of daily mood. However, we find that models trained to
predict mood often also capture private user identities in their intermediate
representations. To tackle this problem, we evaluate approaches that obfuscate
user identity while remaining predictive. By combining multimodal
representations with privacy-preserving learning, we are able to push forward
the performance-privacy frontier.</span>

containing discrete and continuous variables (mixed data). In addition to the
classical learning methods on discretized data, this library proposes its
algorithm that allows structural learning and parameters learning from mixed
data without discretization since data discretization leads to information
loss. This algorithm based on mixed MI score function for structural learning,
and also linear regression and Gaussian distribution approximation for
parameters learning. The library also offers two algorithms for enumerating
graph structures - the greedy Hill-Climbing algorithm and the evolutionary
algorithm. Thus the key capabilities of the proposed library are as follows:
(1) structural and parameters learning of a Bayesian network on discretized
data, (2) structural and parameters learning of a Bayesian network on mixed
data using the MI mixed score function and Gaussian approximation, (3)
launching learning algorithms on one of two algorithms for enumerating graph
structures - Hill-Climbing and the evolutionary algorithm. Since the need for
mixed data representation comes from practical necessity, the advantages of our
implementations are evaluated in the context of solving approximation and gap

                                        <span>We derive a novel asymptotic problem-dependent lower-bound for regret
minimization in finite-horizon tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While,
similar to prior work (e.g., for ergodic MDPs), the lower-bound is the solution
to an optimization problem, our derivation reveals the need for an additional
constraint on the visitation distribution over state-action pairs that
explicitly accounts for the dynamics of the MDP. We provide a characterization
of our lower-bound through a series of examples illustrating how different MDPs
may have significantly different complexity. 1) We first consider a &quot;difficult&quot;
MDP instance, where the novel constraint based on the dynamics leads to a
larger lower-bound (i.e., a larger regret) compared to the classical analysis.
2) We then show that our lower-bound recovers results previously derived for
specific MDP instances. 3) Finally, we show that, in certain &quot;simple&quot; MDPs, the
lower bound is considerably smaller than in the general case and it does not
scale with the minimum action gap at all. We show that this last result is
attainable (up to $poly(H)$ terms, where $H$ is the horizon) by providing a
regret upper-bound based on policy gaps for an optimistic algorithm.</span>

                                        <span>Convolutional networks are ubiquitous in deep learning. They are particularly
useful for images, as they reduce the number of parameters, reduce training
time, and increase accuracy. However, as a model of the brain they are
seriously problematic, since they require weight sharing - something real
neurons simply cannot do. Consequently, while neurons in the brain can be
locally connected (one of the features of convolutional networks), they cannot
be convolutional. Locally connected but non-convolutional networks, however,
significantly underperform convolutional ones. This is troublesome for studies
that use convolutional networks to explain activity in the visual system. Here
we study plausible alternatives to weight sharing that aim at the same
regularization principle, which is to make each neuron within a pool react
similarly to identical inputs. The most natural way to do that is by showing
the network multiple translations of the same image, akin to saccades in animal
vision. However, this approach requires many translations, and doesn&#x27;t remove
the performance gap. We propose instead to add lateral connectivity to a
locally connected network, and allow learning via Hebbian plasticity. This
requires the network to pause occasionally for a sleep-like phase of &quot;weight
sharing&quot;. This method enables locally connected networks to achieve nearly
convolutional performance on ImageNet, thus supporting convolutional networks
as a model of the visual stream.</span>

                                        <span>The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) has become universal during
the past decade, which has afforded in-depth data-based research. By learning
from the large amount of healthcare data, various data-driven models have been
built to predict future events for different medical tasks, such as auto
diagnosis and heart-attack prediction. Although EHR is abundant, the population
that satisfies specific criteria for learning population-specific tasks is
scarce, making it challenging to train data-hungry deep learning models. This
study presents the Claim Pre-Training (Claim-PT) framework, a generic
pre-training model that first trains on the entire pediatric claims dataset,
followed by a discriminative fine-tuning on each population-specific task. The
semantic meaning of medical events can be captured in the pre-training stage,
and the effective knowledge transfer is completed through the task-aware
fine-tuning stage. The fine-tuning process requires minimal parameter
modification without changing the model architecture, which mitigates the data
scarcity issue and helps train the deep learning model adequately on small
patient cohorts. We conducted experiments on a real-world claims dataset with
more than one million patient records. Experimental results on two downstream
tasks demonstrated the effectiveness of our method: our general task-agnostic
pre-training framework outperformed tailored task-specific models, achieving
more than 10\% higher in model performance as compared to baselines. In
addition, our framework showed a great generalizability potential to transfer
learned knowledge from one institution to another, paving the way for future
healthcare model pre-training across institutions.</span>

                                        <span>An agent that is capable of predicting what happens next can perform a
variety of tasks through planning with no additional training. Furthermore,
such an agent can internally represent the complex dynamics of the real-world
and therefore can acquire a representation useful for a variety of visual
perception tasks. This makes predicting the future frames of a video,
conditioned on the observed past and potentially future actions, an interesting
task which remains exceptionally challenging despite many recent advances.
Existing video prediction models have shown promising results on simple narrow
benchmarks but they generate low quality predictions on real-life datasets with
more complicated dynamics or broader domain. There is a growing body of
evidence that underfitting on the training data is one of the primary causes
for the low quality predictions. In this paper, we argue that the inefficient
use of parameters in the current video models is the main reason for
underfitting. Therefore, we introduce a new architecture, named FitVid, which
is capable of severe overfitting on the common benchmarks while having similar
parameter count as the current state-of-the-art models. We analyze the
consequences of overfitting, illustrating how it can produce unexpected
outcomes such as generating high quality output by repeating the training data,

                                        <span>Introduction: One of the most important tasks in the Emergency Department
(ED) is to promptly identify the patients who will benefit from hospital
admission. Machine Learning (ML) techniques show promise as diagnostic aids in
healthcare. Material and methods: We investigated the following features
seeking to investigate their performance in predicting hospital admission:
serum levels of Urea, Creatinine, Lactate Dehydrogenase, Creatine Kinase,
C-Reactive Protein, Complete Blood Count with differential, Activated Partial
Thromboplastin Time, D Dimer, International Normalized Ratio, age, gender,
triage disposition to ED unit and ambulance utilization. A total of 3,204 ED
visits were analyzed. Results: The proposed algorithms generated models which
demonstrated acceptable performance in predicting hospital admission of ED
patients. The range of F-measure and ROC Area values of all eight evaluated
algorithms were [0.679-0.708] and [0.734-0.774], respectively. Discussion: The
main advantages of this tool include easy access, availability, yes/no result,
and low cost. The clinical implications of our approach might facilitate a
shift from traditional clinical decision-making to a more sophisticated model.
Conclusion: Developing robust prognostic models with the utilization of common
biomarkers is a project that might shape the future of emergency medicine. Our
findings warrant confirmation with implementation in pragmatic ED trials.</span>

superior lossy compression performance. However, distinct models are required
to be trained to reach different points in the rate-distortion (R-D) space. In
this paper, we consider the problem of R-D characteristic analysis and modeling
for NIC. We make efforts to formulate the essential mathematical functions to
describe the R-D behavior of NIC using deep network and statistical modeling.
Thus continuous bit-rate points could be elegantly realized by leveraging such
model via a single trained network. In this regard, we propose a plugin-in
module to learn the relationship between the target bit-rate and the binary
representation for the latent variable of auto-encoder. Furthermore, we model
the rate and distortion characteristic of NIC as a function of the coding
parameter $\lambda$ respectively. Our experiments show our proposed method is
easy to adopt and obtains competitive coding performance with fixed-rate coding
approaches, which would benefit the practical deployment of NIC. In addition,
the proposed model could be applied to NIC rate control with limited bit-rate
error using a single network.</span>

                                        <span>Pre-trained language models like Ernie or Bert are currently used in many
applications. These models come with a set of pre-trained weights typically
obtained in unsupervised/self-supervised modality on a huge amount of data.
After that, they are fine-tuned on a specific task. Applications then use these
models for inference, and often some additional constraints apply, like low
power-budget or low latency between input and output. The main avenue to meet
these additional requirements for the inference settings, is to use low
precision computation (e.g. INT8 rather than FP32), but this comes with a cost
of deteriorating the functional performance (e.g. accuracy) of the model. Some
approaches have been developed to tackle the problem and go beyond the
limitations of the PTO (Post-Training Quantization), more specifically the QAT
(Quantization Aware Training, see [4]) is a procedure that interferes with the
training process in order to make it affected (or simply disturbed) by the
quantization phase during the training itself. Besides QAT, recently
Intel-Habana Labs have proposed an additional and more direct way to make the
training results more robust to subsequent quantization which uses a
regularizer, therefore changing the loss function that drives the training
procedure. But their proposal does not work out-of-the-box for pre-trained
models like Ernie, for example. In this short paper we show why this is not
happening (for the Ernie case) and we propose a very basic way to deal with it,
sharing as well some initial results (increase in final INT8 accuracy) that
might be of interest to practitioners willing to use Ernie in their
applications, in low precision regime.</span>

uncertainty by learning features from the data and then performing Bayesian
linear regression over these features. Despite their popularity, few works have
focused on formally evaluating the predictive uncertainties of these models.
Furthermore, existing works point out the difficulties of encoding domain
knowledge in models like NLMs, making them unsuitable for applications where
interpretability is required. In this work, we show that traditional training
procedures for NLMs can drastically underestimate uncertainty in data-scarce
regions. We identify the underlying reasons for this behavior and propose a
novel training method that can both capture useful predictive uncertainties as
well as allow for incorporation of domain knowledge.</span>

smooth Q-learning, a prototypical learning model that explicitly captures the
balance between game rewards and exploration costs. We show that Q-learning
always converges to the unique quantal-response equilibrium (QRE), the standard
solution concept for games under bounded rationality, in weighted zero-sum
polymatrix games with heterogeneous learning agents using positive exploration
rates. Complementing recent results about convergence in weighted potential
games, we show that fast convergence of Q-learning in competitive settings is
obtained regardless of the number of agents and without any need for parameter
fine-tuning. As showcased by our experiments in network zero-sum games, these
theoretical results provide the necessary guarantees for an algorithmic
approach to the currently open problem of equilibrium selection in competitive

are an important tool for disease control. Neural networks are powerful
predictive models that have made contributions to many areas of public health.
In this systematic review, we provide an introduction to the neural networks
relevant to Dengue forecasting and review their applications in the literature.
The objective is to help inform model design for future work. Following the
PRISMA guidelines, we conduct a systematic search of studies that use neural
networks to forecast Dengue in human populations. We summarize the relative
performance of neural networks and comparator models, model architectures and
hyper-parameters, as well as choices of input features. Nineteen papers were
included. Most studies implement shallow neural networks using historical
Dengue incidence and meteorological input features. Prediction horizons tend to
be short. Building on the strengths of neural networks, most studies use
granular observations at the city or sub-national level. Performance of neural
networks relative to comparators such as Support Vector Machines varies across
study contexts. The studies suggest that neural networks can provide good
predictions of Dengue and should be included in the set of candidate models.
The use of convolutional, recurrent, or deep networks is relatively unexplored
but offers promising avenues for further research, as does the use of a broader
set of input features such as social media or mobile phone data.</span>

                                        <span>Markov Population Models are a widespread formalism used to model the
dynamics of complex systems, with applications in Systems Biology and many
other fields. The associated Markov stochastic process in continuous time is
often analyzed by simulation, which can be costly for large or stiff systems,
particularly when a massive number of simulations has to be performed (e.g. in
a multi-scale model). A strategy to reduce computational load is to abstract
the population model, replacing it with a simpler stochastic model, faster to
simulate. Here we pursue this idea, building on previous works and constructing
a generator capable of producing stochastic trajectories in continuous space
and discrete time. This generator is learned automatically from simulations of
the original model in a Generative Adversarial setting. Compared to previous
works, which rely on deep neural networks and Dirichlet processes, we explore
the use of state of the art generative models, which are flexible enough to
learn a full trajectory rather than a single transition kernel.</span>

applications in robotics, and the RoboCup competition is an interesting
environment for studying and evaluating reinforcement learning methods. A known
difficulty in applying reinforcement learning to robotics is the high number of
experience samples required, being the use of simulated environments for
training the agents followed by transfer learning to real-world (sim-to-real) a
viable path. This article introduces an open-source simulator for the IEEE Very
Small Size Soccer and the Small Size League optimized for reinforcement
learning experiments. We also propose a framework for creating OpenAI Gym
environments with a set of benchmarks tasks for evaluating single-agent and
multi-agent robot soccer skills. We then demonstrate the learning capabilities
of two state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods as well as their
limitations in certain scenarios introduced in this framework. We believe this
will make it easier for more teams to compete in these categories using
end-to-end reinforcement learning approaches and further develop this research
area.</span>

generate synthetic datasets of binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) given an
arbitrary set of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). The evaluation of
machine hearing algorithms frequently requires BRIR datasets in order to
simulate the acoustics of any environment. However, currently available
solutions typically consider only HRTFs measured on dummy heads, which poorly
characterize the high variability in spatial sound perception. Our solution
allows to integrate a room impulse response (RIR) simulator with different HRTF

                                        <span>Anime is quite well-received today, especially among the younger generations.
With many genres of available shows, more and more people are increasingly
getting attracted to this niche section of the entertainment industry. As anime
has recently garnered mainstream attention, we have insufficient information
regarding users&#x27; penchant and watching habits. Therefore, it is an uphill task
to build a recommendation engine for this relatively obscure entertainment
medium. In this attempt, we have built a novel hybrid recommendation system
that could act both as a recommendation system and as a means of exploring new
anime genres and titles. We have analyzed the general trends in this field and
the users&#x27; watching habits for coming up with our efficacious solution. Our
solution employs deep autoencoders for the tasks of predicting ratings and
generating embeddings. Following this, we formed clusters using the embeddings
of the anime titles. These clusters form the search space for anime with
similarities and are used to find anime similar to the ones liked and disliked
by the user. This method, combined with the predicted ratings, forms the novel
hybrid filter. In this article, we have demonstrated this idea and compared the
performance of our implemented model with the existing state-of-the-art
techniques.</span>

                                        <span>In the first part of this dissertation research, we develop a modular
framework that can serve as a recipe for constructing and analyzing iterative
algorithms for convex optimization. Specifically, our work casts optimization
as iteratively playing a two-player zero-sum game. Many existing optimization
algorithms including Frank-Wolfe and Nesterov&#x27;s acceleration methods can be
recovered from the game by pitting two online learners with appropriate
strategies against each other. Furthermore, the sum of the weighted average
regrets of the players in the game implies the convergence rate. As a result,
our approach provides simple alternative proofs to these algorithms. Moreover,
we demonstrate that our approach of optimization as iteratively playing a game
leads to three new fast Frank-Wolfe-like algorithms for some constraint sets,
which further shows that our framework is indeed generic, modular, and
easy-to-use.

In the second part, we develop a modular analysis of provable acceleration
via Polyak&#x27;s momentum for certain problems, which include solving the classical
strongly quadratic convex problems, training a wide ReLU network under the
neural tangent kernel regime, and training a deep linear network with an
orthogonal initialization. We develop a meta theorem and show that when
applying Polyak&#x27;s momentum for these problems, the induced dynamics exhibit a
form where we can directly apply our meta theorem.

In the last part of the dissertation, we show another advantage of the use of
Polyak&#x27;s momentum -- it facilitates fast saddle point escape in smooth
non-convex optimization. This result, together with those of the second part,
sheds new light on Polyak&#x27;s momentum in modern non-convex optimization and deep
learning.</span>

                                        <span>The information bottleneck (IB) principle has been suggested as a way to
analyze deep neural networks. The learning dynamics are studied by inspecting
the mutual information (MI) between the hidden layers and the input and output.
Notably, separate fitting and compression phases during training have been
reported. This led to some controversy including claims that the observations
are not reproducible and strongly dependent on the type of activation function
used as well as on the way the MI is estimated. Our study confirms that
different ways of binning when computing the MI lead to qualitatively different
results, either supporting or refusing IB conjectures. To resolve the
controversy, we study the IB principle in settings where MI is non-trivial and
can be computed exactly. We monitor the dynamics of quantized neural networks,
that is, we discretize the whole deep learning system so that no approximation
is required when computing the MI. This allows us to quantify the information
flow without measurement errors. In this setting, we observed a fitting phase
for all layers and a compression phase for the output layer in all experiments;
the compression in the hidden layers was dependent on the type of activation
function. Our study shows that the initial IB results were not artifacts of
binning when computing the MI. However, the critical claim that the compression
phase may not be observed for some networks also holds true.</span>

                                        <span>Spatial-temporal forecasting has attracted tremendous attention in a wide
range of applications, and traffic flow prediction is a canonical and typical
example. The complex and long-range spatial-temporal correlations of traffic
flow bring it to a most intractable challenge. Existing works typically utilize
shallow graph convolution networks (GNNs) and temporal extracting modules to
model spatial and temporal dependencies respectively. However, the
representation ability of such models is limited due to: (1) shallow GNNs are
incapable to capture long-range spatial correlations, (2) only spatial
connections are considered and a mass of semantic connections are ignored,
which are of great importance for a comprehensive understanding of traffic
networks. To this end, we propose Spatial-Temporal Graph Ordinary Differential
Equation Networks (STGODE). Specifically, we capture spatial-temporal dynamics
through a tensor-based ordinary differential equation (ODE), as a result,
deeper networks can be constructed and spatial-temporal features are utilized
synchronously. To understand the network more comprehensively, semantical
adjacency matrix is considered in our model, and a well-design temporal
dialated convolution structure is used to capture long term temporal
dependencies. We evaluate our model on multiple real-world traffic datasets and
superior performance is achieved over state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

However, GNNs remain hard to interpret as the interplay between node features

novel method called Kedge for explicitly sparsifying the underlying graph by
removing unnecessary neighbors. Our key idea is based on a tractable method for
sparsification using the Hard Kumaraswamy distribution that can be used in
conjugation with any GNN model. Kedge learns edge masks in a modular fashion
trained with any GNN allowing for gradient based optimization in an end-to-end
fashion. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our model Kedge can
prune a large proportion of the edges with only a minor effect on the test
accuracy. Specifically, in the PubMed dataset, Kedge learns to drop more than
80% of the edges with an accuracy drop of merely 2% showing that graph
structure has only a small contribution in comparison to node features.
Finally, we also show that Kedge effectively counters the over-smoothing
phenomena in deep GNNs by maintaining good task performance with increasing GNN
layers.</span>

data. However, despite achieving good generalization on few-shot classification
tasks, it is still challenging to improve the adversarial robustness of the
meta-learning model in few-shot learning. Although adversarial training (AT)
methods such as Adversarial Query (AQ) can improve the adversarially robust
performance of meta-learning models, AT is still computationally expensive
training. On the other hand, meta-learning models trained with AT will drop
significant accuracy on the original clean images. This paper proposed a
meta-learning method on the adversarially robust neural network called
Long-term Cross Adversarial Training (LCAT). LCAT will update meta-learning
model parameters cross along the natural and adversarial sample distribution
direction with long-term to improve both adversarial and clean few-shot
classification accuracy. Due to cross-adversarial training, LCAT only needs
half of the adversarial training epoch than AQ, resulting in a low adversarial
training computation. Experiment results show that LCAT achieves superior
performance both on the clean and adversarial few-shot classification accuracy
than SOTA adversarial training methods for meta-learning models.</span>

                                        <span>Whilst recent neural text-to-speech (TTS) approaches produce high-quality
speech, they typically require a large amount of recordings from the target
speaker. In previous work, a 3-step method was proposed to generate
high-quality TTS while greatly reducing the amount of data required for
training. However, we have observed a ceiling effect in the level of
naturalness achievable for highly expressive voices when using this approach.
In this paper, we present a method for building highly expressive TTS voices
with as little as 15 minutes of speech data from the target speaker. Compared
to the current state-of-the-art approach, our proposed improvements close the
gap to recordings by 23.3% for naturalness of speech and by 16.3% for speaker
similarity. Further, we match the naturalness and speaker similarity of a
Tacotron2-based full-data (~10 hours) model using only 15 minutes of target
speaker data, whereas with 30 minutes or more, we significantly outperform it.
The following improvements are proposed: 1) changing from an autoregressive,
attention-based TTS model to a non-autoregressive model replacing attention
with an external duration model and 2) an additional Conditional Generative
Adversarial Network (cGAN) based fine-tuning step.</span>

                                        <span>Modeling the joint distribution of high-dimensional data is a central task in
unsupervised machine learning. In recent years, many interests have been
attracted to developing learning models based on tensor networks, which have
advantages of theoretical understandings of the expressive power using
entanglement properties, and as a bridge connecting the classical computation
and the quantum computation. Despite the great potential, however, existing
tensor-network-based unsupervised models only work as a proof of principle, as
their performances are much worse than the standard models such as the
restricted Boltzmann machines and neural networks. In this work, we present the
Autoregressive Matrix Product States (AMPS), a tensor-network-based model
combining the matrix product states from quantum many-body physics and the
autoregressive models from machine learning. The model enjoys exact calculation
of normalized probability and unbiased sampling, as well as a clear theoretical
understanding of expressive power. We demonstrate the performance of our model
using two applications, the generative modeling on synthetic and real-world
data, and the reinforcement learning in statistical physics. Using extensive
numerical experiments, we show that the proposed model significantly
outperforms the existing tensor-network-based models and the restricted
Boltzmann machines, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art neural network
models.</span>

representation techniques are then presented. Then, we cover the analysis
techniques and create a taxonomy of the main stock market forecast models.
Importantly, we discuss representative work in each category of the taxonomy,
analyzing their respective contributions. Finally, this paper shows the

negligible influence both on backpropagation and training. Yet, in the real
world, 32 bits default precision combined with the size of deep learning
problems makes it a hyperparameter of training methods. We investigate the
importance of the value of ReLU (0) for several precision levels (16, 32, 64

CIFAR10, SVHN). We observe considerable variations of backpropagation outputs
which occur around half of the time in 32 bits precision. The effect disappears
with double precision, while it is systematic at 16 bits. For vanilla SGD
training, the choice ReLU (0) &#x3D; 0 seems to be the most efficient. We also
evidence that reconditioning approaches as batch-norm or ADAM tend to buffer
the influence of ReLU (0)&#x27;s value. Overall, the message we want to convey is

military target detection, environmental monitoring, hazard prevention and
other time-critical applications require onboard real time processing
capabilities or autonomous decision making. Some unmanned remote systems like
satellites are physically remote from their operators, and all control of the
spacecraft and data returned by the spacecraft must be transmitted over a
wireless radio link. This link may not be available for extended periods when
the satellite is out of line of sight of its ground station. Therefore,
lightweight, small size and low power consumption hardware is essential for
onboard real time processing systems. With increasing dimensionality, size and
resolution of recent hyperspectral imaging sensors, additional challenges are
posed upon remote sensing processing systems and more capable computing
architectures are needed. Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) emerged as
promising architecture for light weight high performance computing that can
address these computational requirements for onboard systems. The goal of this
study is to build high performance methods for onboard hyperspectral analysis.
We propose accelerated methods for the well-known recursive hierarchical
segmentation (RHSEG) clustering method, using GPUs, hybrid multicore CPU with a
GPU and hybrid multi-core CPU/GPU clusters. RHSEG is a method developed by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which is designed to
provide rich classification information with several output levels. The
achieved speedups by parallel solutions compared to CPU sequential
implementations are 21x for parallel single GPU and 240x for hybrid multi-node
computer clusters with 16 computing nodes. The energy consumption is reduced to
74% using a single GPU compared to the equivalent parallel CPU cluster.</span>

classification (XMC) problems due to their scalability to large output spaces
(e.g., millions or more). However, existing methods partition the large label
space into mutually exclusive clusters, which is sub-optimal when labels have
multi-modality and rich semantics. For instance, the label &quot;Apple&quot; can be the
fruit or the brand name, which leads to the following research question: can we
disentangle these multi-modal labels with non-exclusive clustering tailored for
downstream XMC tasks? In this paper, we show that the label assignment problem
in partition-based XMC can be formulated as an optimization problem, with the
objective of maximizing precision rates. This leads to an efficient algorithm
to form flexible and overlapped label clusters, and a method that can
alternatively optimizes the cluster assignments and the model parameters for
partition-based XMC. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show
that our method can successfully disentangle multi-modal labels, leading to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four XMC benchmarks.</span>

                                        <span>Data analysis plays an indispensable role for value creation in industry.
Cluster analysis in this context is able to explore given datasets with little
or no prior knowledge and to identify unknown patterns. As (big) data
complexity increases in the dimensions volume, variety, and velocity, this
becomes even more important. Many tools for cluster analysis have been
developed from early on and the variety of different clustering algorithms is
huge. As the selection of the right clustering procedure is crucial to the
results of the data analysis, users are in need for support on their journey of
extracting knowledge from raw data. Thus, the objective of this paper lies in
the identification of a systematic selection logic for clustering algorithms
and corresponding validation concepts. The goal is to enable potential users to
choose an algorithm that fits best to their needs and the properties of their
underlying data clustering problem. Moreover, users are supported in selecting
the right validation concepts to make sense of the clustering results. Based on
a comprehensive literature review, this paper provides assessment criteria for
clustering method evaluation and validation concept selection. The criteria are
applied to several common algorithms and the selection process of an algorithm
is supported by the introduction of pseudocode-based routines that consider the
underlying data structure.</span>

practice, monitoring, i.e. verifying that these operate within specification,
has become an important practical problem. An important aspect of this
monitoring is to check whether the inputs (or intermediates) have strayed from
the distribution they were validated for, which can void the performance
assurances obtained during testing.

There are two common approaches for this. The, perhaps, more classical one is
outlier detection or novelty detection, where, for a single input we ask
whether it is an outlier, i.e. exceedingly unlikely to have originated from a
reference distribution. The second, perhaps more recent approach, is to
consider a larger number of inputs and compare its distribution to a reference
distribution (e.g. sampled during testing). This is done under the label drift
detection.

In this work, we bridge the gap between outlier detection and drift detection
through comparing a given number of inputs to an automatically chosen part of
the reference distribution.</span>

component to allow attention-based deep model architectures such as Transformer
to address sequences or images where the position of information matters. In
this paper, we propose a novel positional encoding method based on learnable
Fourier features. Instead of hard-coding each position as a token or a vector,
we represent each position, which can be multi-dimensional, as a trainable
encoding based on learnable Fourier feature mapping, modulated with a
multi-layer perceptron. The representation is particularly advantageous for a
spatial multi-dimensional position, e.g., pixel positions on an image, where
$L_2$ distances or more complex positional relationships need to be captured.
Our experiments based on several public benchmark tasks show that our learnable
Fourier feature representation for multi-dimensional positional encoding
outperforms existing methods by both improving the accuracy and allowing faster
convergence.</span>

such as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption
planning. This paper studies the \textit{long-term forecasting} problem of time
series. Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms
to discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns
of the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies.
Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise
self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information
utilization bottleneck. Towards these challenges, we propose Autoformer as a
novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We go
beyond the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as
a basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with
progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired
by the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism
based on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and
representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation
outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term
forecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative
improvement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy,
traffic, economics, weather and disease.</span>

                                        <span>Bayesian Optimization is a sample-efficient black-box optimization procedure
that is typically applied to problems with a small number of independent
objectives. However, in practice we often wish to optimize objectives defined
over many correlated outcomes (or &#x60;&#x60;tasks&quot;). For example, scientists may want
to optimize the coverage of a cell tower network across a dense grid of
locations. Similarly, engineers may seek to balance the performance of a robot
across dozens of different environments via constrained or robust optimization.
However, the Gaussian Process (GP) models typically used as probabilistic
surrogates for multi-task Bayesian Optimization scale poorly with the number of
outcomes, greatly limiting applicability. We devise an efficient technique for
exact multi-task GP sampling that combines exploiting Kronecker structure in
the covariance matrices with Matheron&#x27;s identity, allowing us to perform
Bayesian Optimization using exact multi-task GP models with tens of thousands
of correlated outputs. In doing so, we achieve substantial improvements in
sample efficiency compared to existing approaches that only model aggregate
functions of the outcomes. We demonstrate how this unlocks a new class of
applications for Bayesian Optimization across a range of tasks in science and
engineering, including optimizing interference patterns of an optical
interferometer with more than 65,000 outputs.</span>

functions considered by previous works. State density has a clear physical and
mathematical interpretation, and is able to express a wide variety of

constraints can also avoid the time-consuming process of designing and tuning
cost functions required by value function-based constraints to encode system

functions to develop an effective algorithm to solve the density constrained RL
problem optimally and the constrains are guaranteed to be satisfied. We prove
that the proposed algorithm converges to a near-optimal solution with a bounded

ranging from climate science to medicine, but overwhelming complexity stymies
insight. Existing theory is often not able to succinctly describe salient
phenomena, and progress has largely relied on ad hoc definitions of dynamical
regimes to guide and focus exploration. We present a formal definition in which
the identification of dynamical regimes is formulated as an optimization
problem, and we propose an intelligible objective function. Furthermore, we
propose an unsupervised learning framework which eliminates the need for a
priori knowledge and ad hoc definitions; instead, the user need only choose
appropriate clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms, and this choice
can be guided using our proposed objective function. We illustrate its
applicability with example problems drawn from ocean dynamics, tumor
angiogenesis, and turbulent boundary layers. Our method is a step towards
unbiased data exploration that allows serendipitous discovery within dynamical
systems, with the potential to propel the physical sciences forward.</span>

collecting high-quality labels for supervised learning remains a bottleneck for
many applications. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that
state-of-the-art models for NLP tasks are becoming deeper and more complex,
often increasing the amount of training data required even for fine-tuning.
Weak supervision methods, including data programming, address this problem and
reduce the cost of label collection by using noisy label sources for
supervision. However, until recently, data programming was only accessible to
users who knew how to program. To bridge this gap, the Data Programming by
Demonstration framework was proposed to facilitate the automatic creation of
labeling functions based on a few examples labeled by a domain expert. This
framework has proven successful for generating high-accuracy labeling models
for document classification. In this work, we extend the DPBD framework to
span-level annotation tasks, arguably one of the most time-consuming NLP
labeling tasks. We built a novel tool, TagRuler, that makes it easy for
annotators to build span-level labeling functions without programming and
encourages them to explore trade-offs between different labeling models and
active learning strategies. We empirically demonstrated that an annotator could
achieve a higher F1 score using the proposed tool compared to manual labeling
for different span-level annotation tasks.</span>

                                        <span>In federated learning (FL), model training is distributed over clients and
local models are aggregated by a central server. The performance of uploaded
models in such situations can vary widely due to imbalanced data distributions,
potential demands on privacy protections, and quality of transmissions. In this
paper, we aim to minimize FL training delay over wireless channels, constrained
by overall training performance as well as each client&#x27;s differential privacy
(DP) requirement. We solve this problem in the framework of multi-agent
multi-armed bandit (MAMAB) to deal with the situation where there are multiple
clients confornting different unknown transmission environments, e.g., channel
fading and interferences. Specifically, we first transform the long-term
constraints on both training performance and each client&#x27;s DP into a virtual
queue based on the Lyapunov drift technique. Then, we convert the MAMAB to a
max-min bipartite matching problem at each communication round, by estimating
rewards with the upper confidence bound (UCB) approach. More importantly, we
propose two efficient solutions to this matching problem, i.e., modified
Hungarian algorithm and greedy matching with a better alternative (GMBA), in
which the first one can achieve the optimal solution with a high complexity
while the second one approaches a better trade-off by enabling a verified
low-complexity with little performance loss. In addition, we develop an upper
bound on the expected regret of this MAMAB based FL framework, which shows a
linear growth over the logarithm of communication rounds, justifying its
theoretical feasibility. Extensive experimental results are conducted to
validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, and the impacts of
various parameters on the FL performance over wireless edge networks are also
discussed.</span>

on which they were trained they have a tendency to behave poorly, most
prominently over-confidence in erroneous predictions. Such behaviours will have
disastrous effects on real-world machine learning systems. In this field
graceful degradation refers to the optimisation of model performance as it
encounters this out-of-distribution data. This work presents a definition and
discussion of graceful degradation and where it can be applied in deployed
visual systems. Following this a survey of relevant areas is undertaken,
novelly splitting the graceful degradation problem into active and passive
approaches. In passive approaches, graceful degradation is handled and achieved
by the model in a self-contained manner, in active approaches the model is
updated upon encountering epistemic uncertainties. This work communicates the
importance of the problem and aims to prompt the development of machine
learning strategies that are aware of graceful degradation.</span>

                                        <span>The Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) algorithm exhibits exceptional
competence for predicting continuous variables from inter-correlated brain
recordings in brain-computer interfaces, which achieved successful prediction
from epidural electrocorticography of macaques to three-dimensional continuous
hand trajectories recently. Nevertheless, PLSR is in essence formulated based
on the least square criterion, thus, being non-robust with respect to
complicated noises consequently. The aim of the present study is to propose a
robust version of PLSR. To this end, the maximum correntropy criterion is
adopted to structure a new robust variant of PLSR, namely Partial Maximum
Correntropy Regression (PMCR). Half-quadratic optimization technique is
utilized to calculate the robust latent variables. We assess the proposed PMCR
on a synthetic example and the public Neurotycho dataset. Compared with the
conventional PLSR and the state-of-the-art variant, PMCR realized superior
prediction competence on three different performance indicators with
contaminated training set. The proposed PMCR was demonstrated as an effective
approach for robust decoding from noisy brain measurements, which could reduce
the performance degradation resulting from adverse noises, thus, improving the
decoding robustness of brain-computer interfaces.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we aim to address the problem of solving a non-convex
optimization problem over an intersection of multiple variable sets. This kind
of problems is typically solved by using an alternating minimization (AM)
strategy which splits the overall problem into a set of sub-problems
corresponding to each variable, and then iteratively performs minimization over
each sub-problem using a fixed updating rule. However, due to the intrinsic
non-convexity of the overall problem, the optimization can usually be trapped
into bad local minimum even when each sub-problem can be globally optimized at
each iteration. To tackle this problem, we propose a meta-learning based Global
Scope Optimization (GSO) method. It adaptively generates optimizers for
sub-problems via meta-learners and constantly updates these meta-learners with
respect to the global loss information of the overall problem. Therefore, the
sub-problems are optimized with the objective of minimizing the global loss
specifically. We evaluate the proposed model on a number of simulations,
including solving bi-linear inverse problems: matrix completion, and non-linear
problems: Gaussian mixture models. The experimental results show that our
proposed approach outperforms AM-based methods in standard settings, and is
able to achieve effective optimization in some challenging cases while other
methods would typically fail.</span>

                                        <span>Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is increasingly used to automatically tune
the predictive performance (e.g., accuracy) of machine learning models.
However, in a plethora of real-world applications, accuracy is only one of the
multiple -- often conflicting -- performance criteria, necessitating the
adoption of a multi-objective (MO) perspective. While the literature on MO
optimization is rich, few prior studies have focused on HPO. In this paper, we
propose algorithms that extend asynchronous successive halving (ASHA) to the MO
setting. Considering multiple evaluation metrics, we assess the performance of
these methods on three real world tasks: (i) Neural architecture search, (ii)
algorithmic fairness and (iii) language model optimization. Our empirical
analysis shows that MO ASHA enables to perform MO HPO at scale. Further, we
observe that that taking the entire Pareto front into account for candidate
selection consistently outperforms multi-fidelity HPO based on MO scalarization
in terms of wall-clock time. Our algorithms (to be open-sourced) establish new
baselines for future research in the area.</span>

observations, such as images, can provide autonomous agents with broad
capabilities. Visual model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that plan
future actions directly have shown impressive results on tasks that require
only short-horizon reasoning, however, these methods struggle on temporally
extended tasks. We argue that it is easier to solve long-horizon tasks by
planning sequences of states rather than just actions, as the effects of
actions greatly compound over time and are harder to optimize. To achieve this,
we draw on the idea of collocation, which has shown good results on
long-horizon tasks in optimal control literature, and adapt it to the
image-based setting by utilizing learned latent state space models. The
resulting latent collocation method (LatCo) optimizes trajectories of latent
states, which improves over previously proposed shooting methods for visual
model-based RL on tasks with sparse rewards and long-term goals. Videos and

from traditional text question answering (QA) tasks, SCQA involves audio signal
processing, passage comprehension, and contextual understanding. However, ASR
systems introduce unexpected noisy signals to the transcriptions, which result
in performance degradation on SCQA. To overcome the problem, we propose CADNet,
a novel contextualized attention-based distillation approach, which applies
both cross-attention and self-attention to obtain ASR-robust contextualized
embedding representations of the passage and dialogue history for performance
improvements. We also introduce the spoken conventional knowledge distillation
framework to distill the ASR-robust knowledge from the estimated probabilities

policy evaluation (OPE) problems with model-based methods (for episodic MDP)
and provides a unified framework towards optimal learning for several
well-motivated offline tasks. Uniform OPE
$\sup_\Pi|Q^\pi-\hat{Q}^\pi|&lt;\epsilon$ is a stronger measure than the
point-wise OPE and ensures offline learning when $\Pi$ contains all policies
(the global class). In this paper, we establish an $\Omega(H^2
S/d_m\epsilon^2)$ lower bound (over model-based family) for the global uniform
OPE and our main result establishes an upper bound of
$\tilde{O}(H^2/d_m\epsilon^2)$ for the \emph{local} uniform convergence that
applies to all \emph{near-empirically optimal} policies for the MDPs with
\emph{stationary} transition. Here $d_m$ is the minimal marginal state-action
probability. Critically, the highlight in achieving the optimal rate
$\tilde{O}(H^2/d_m\epsilon^2)$ is our design of \emph{singleton absorbing MDP},
which is a new sharp analysis tool that works with the model-based approach. We
generalize such a model-based framework to the new settings: offline
task-agnostic and the offline reward-free with optimal complexity
$\tilde{O}(H^2\log(K)/d_m\epsilon^2)$ ($K$ is the number of tasks) and
$\tilde{O}(H^2S/d_m\epsilon^2)$ respectively. These results provide a unified

                                        <span>The difficulty of deterministic planning increases exponentially with
search-tree depth. Black-box planning presents an even greater challenge, since
planners must operate without an explicit model of the domain. Heuristics can
make search more efficient, but goal-aware heuristics for black-box planning
usually rely on goal counting, which is often quite uninformative. In this
work, we show how to overcome this limitation by discovering macro-actions that
make the goal-count heuristic more accurate. Our approach searches for
macro-actions with focused effects (i.e. macros that modify only a small number
of state variables), which align well with the assumptions made by the
goal-count heuristic. Focused macros dramatically improve black-box planning
efficiency across a wide range of planning domains, sometimes beating even
state-of-the-art planners with access to a full domain model.</span>

agriculture commodity price prediction system with novel machine learning
techniques. Due to the increasing large amounts historical data of agricultural
commodity prices and the need of performing accurate prediction of price
fluctuations, the solution has largely shifted from statistical methods to
machine learning area. However, the selection of proper set from historical
data for forecasting still has limited consideration. On the other hand, when
implementing machine learning techniques, finding a suitable model with optimal
parameters for global solution, nonlinearity and avoiding curse of
dimensionality are still biggest challenges, therefore machine learning
strategies study are needed. In this research, we propose a web-based automated
system to predict agriculture commodity price. In the two series experiments,
five popular machine learning algorithms, ARIMA, SVR, Prophet, XGBoost and LSTM
have been compared with large historical datasets in Malaysia and the most
optimal algorithm, LSTM model with an average of 0.304 mean-square error has
been selected as the prediction engine of the proposed system.</span>

other fields proves that AI can achieve human-like performance. However,
success always comes with challenges. Deep learning algorithms are
data-dependent and require large datasets for training. The lack of data in the
medical imaging field creates a bottleneck for the application of deep learning
to medical image analysis. Medical image acquisition, annotation, and analysis
are costly, and their usage is constrained by ethical restrictions. They also
require many resources, such as human expertise and funding. That makes it
difficult for non-medical researchers to have access to useful and large
medical data. Thus, as comprehensive as possible, this paper provides a
collection of medical image datasets with their associated challenges for deep
learning research. We have collected information of around three hundred
datasets and challenges mainly reported between 2013 and 2020 and categorized
them into four categories: head &amp; neck, chest &amp; abdomen, pathology &amp; blood, and
&#x60;&#x60;others&#x27;&#x27;. Our paper has three purposes: 1) to provide a most up to date and
complete list that can be used as a universal reference to easily find the
datasets for clinical image analysis, 2) to guide researchers on the
methodology to test and evaluate their methods&#x27; performance and robustness on
relevant datasets, 3) to provide a &#x60;&#x60;route&#x27;&#x27; to relevant algorithms for the
relevant medical topics, and challenge leaderboards.</span>

                                        <span>Understanding and explaining the mistakes made by trained models is critical
to many machine learning objectives, such as improving robustness, addressing
concept drift, and mitigating biases. However, this is often an ad hoc process
that involves manually looking at the model&#x27;s mistakes on many test samples and
guessing at the underlying reasons for those incorrect predictions. In this
paper, we propose a systematic approach, conceptual explanation scores (CES),
that explains why a classifier makes a mistake on a particular test sample(s)
in terms of human-understandable concepts (e.g. this zebra is misclassified as
a dog because of faint stripes). We base CES on two prior ideas: counterfactual
explanations and concept activation vectors, and validate our approach on
well-known pretrained models, showing that it explains the models&#x27; mistakes
meaningfully. We also train new models with intentional and known spurious
correlations, which CES successfully identifies from a single misclassified
test sample. The code for CES is publicly available and can easily be applied
to new models.</span>

and generalization to novel operational conditions. Hand-designed models,
however, may be insufficiently accurate, even after careful parameter tuning.
This motivates the use of machine learning techniques to approximate the robot
dynamics over a training set of state-control trajectories. The dynamics of
many robots, including ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles, are described
in terms of their SE(3) pose and generalized velocity, and satisfy conservation
of energy principles. This paper proposes a Hamiltonian formulation over the
SE(3) manifold of the structure of a neural ordinary differential equation
(ODE) network to approximate the dynamics of a rigid body. In contrast to a
black-box ODE network, our formulation guarantees total energy conservation by
construction. We develop energy shaping and damping injection control for the
learned, potentially under-actuated SE(3) Hamiltonian dynamics to enable a
unified approach for stabilization and trajectory tracking with various
platforms, including pendulum, rigid-body, and quadrotor systems.</span>

                                        <span>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential of utilizing
near-term quantum machines to gain certain computational advantages over
classical methods. Nevertheless, modern VQAs suffer from cumbersome
computational overhead, hampered by the tradition of employing a solitary
quantum processor to handle large-volume data. As such, to better exert the
superiority of VQAs, it is of great significance to improve their runtime
efficiency. Here we devise an efficient distributed optimization scheme, called
QUDIO, to address this issue. Specifically, in QUDIO, a classical central
server partitions the learning problem into multiple subproblems and allocate
them to multiple local nodes where each of them consists of a quantum processor
and a classical optimizer. During the training procedure, all local nodes
proceed parallel optimization and the classical server synchronizes
optimization information among local nodes timely. In doing so, we prove a
sublinear convergence rate of QUDIO in terms of the number of global iteration
under the ideal scenario, while the system imperfection may incur divergent
optimization. Numerical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that QUDIO
can surprisingly achieve a superlinear runtime speedup with respect to the
number of local nodes. Our proposal can be readily mixed with other advanced
VQAs-based techniques to narrow the gap between the state of the art and
applications with quantum advantage.</span>

                                        <span>Shared feature spaces for actor-critic methods aims to capture generalized
latent representations to be used by the policy and value function with the
hopes for a more stable and sample-efficient optimization. However, such a
paradigm present a number of challenges in practice, as parameters generating a
shared representation must learn off two distinct objectives, resulting in
competing updates and learning perturbations. In this paper, we present a novel
feature-sharing framework to address these difficulties by introducing the mix
and mask mechanisms and the distributional scalarization technique. These
mechanisms behaves dynamically to couple and decouple connected latent features
variably between the policy and value function, while the distributional
scalarization standardizes the two objectives using a probabilistic standpoint.
From our experimental results, we demonstrate significant performance
improvements compared to alternative methods using separate networks and
networks with a shared backbone.</span>

coronavirus ailment 2019 (COVID-19) is critical in the counteraction and
control of the COVID-19 flare-up. The new associated cases with COVID-19
information were gathered from 20 January 2020 to 21 July 2020. We filtered out
the countries which are converging and used those for training the network. We
utilized the SARIMAX, Linear regression model to anticipate new suspected
COVID-19 cases for the countries which did not converge yet. We predict the
curve of non-converged countries with the help of proposed Statistical SARIMAX
model (SSM). We present new information investigation-based forecast results
that can assist governments with planning their future activities and help
clinical administrations to be more ready for what&#x27;s to come. Our framework can
foresee peak corona cases with an R-Squared value of 0.986 utilizing linear
regression and fall of this pandemic at various levels for countries like
India, US, and Brazil. We found that considering more countries for training
degrades the prediction process as constraints vary from nation to nation.

efficient hardware acceleration that couples high computational performance
with low power consumption. Driven by the rapid evolution of network
architectures and their algorithmic features, accelerator designs are
constantly updated and improved. To evaluate and compare hardware design
choices, designers can refer to a myriad of accelerator implementations in the

system-level and benchmark-specific performance metrics, making it difficult to
quantitatively compare the individual effect of each utilized optimization

designs, slowing-down the research progress. This work provides a survey of
neural network accelerator optimization approaches that have been used in
recent works and reports their individual effects on edge processing
performance. It presents the list of optimizations and their quantitative
effects as a construction kit, allowing to assess the design choices for each

                                        <span>Successful quantitative investment usually relies on precise predictions of
the future movement of the stock price. Recently, machine learning based
solutions have shown their capacity to give more accurate stock prediction and
become indispensable components in modern quantitative investment systems.
However, the i.i.d. assumption behind existing methods is inconsistent with the
existence of diverse trading patterns in the stock market, which inevitably
limits their ability to achieve better stock prediction performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel architecture, Temporal Routing Adaptor (TRA), to
empower existing stock prediction models with the ability to model multiple
stock trading patterns. Essentially, TRA is a lightweight module that consists
of a set of independent predictors for learning multiple patterns as well as a
router to dispatch samples to different predictors. Nevertheless, the lack of
explicit pattern identifiers makes it quite challenging to train an effective
TRA-based model. To tackle this challenge, we further design a learning
algorithm based on Optimal Transport (OT) to obtain the optimal sample to
predictor assignment and effectively optimize the router with such assignment
through an auxiliary loss term. Experiments on the real-world stock ranking
task show that compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, e.g., Attention LSTM
and Transformer, the proposed method can improve information coefficient (IC)
from 0.053 to 0.059 and 0.051 to 0.056 respectively. Our dataset and code used

                                        <span>The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is an efficient simulation technique for
computational fluid mechanics and beyond. It is based on a simple
stream-and-collide algorithm on Cartesian grids, which is easily compatible
with modern machine learning architectures. While it is becoming increasingly
clear that deep learning can provide a decisive stimulus for classical
simulation techniques, recent studies have not addressed possible connections
between machine learning and LBM. Here, we introduce Lettuce, a PyTorch-based
LBM code with a threefold aim. Lettuce enables GPU accelerated calculations
with minimal source code, facilitates rapid prototyping of LBM models, and
enables integrating LBM simulations with PyTorch&#x27;s deep learning and automatic
differentiation facility. As a proof of concept for combining machine learning
with the LBM, a neural collision model is developed, trained on a doubly
periodic shear layer and then transferred to a different flow, a decaying
turbulence. We also exemplify the added benefit of PyTorch&#x27;s automatic
differentiation framework in flow control and optimization. To this end, the
spectrum of a forced isotropic turbulence is maintained without further
constraining the velocity field. The source code is freely available from

probability distributions and efficient density estimation. However, they are
well known to fail while detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs as they

by demonstrating that flows, if extended by an attention mechanism, can

providing high environmental consistency, operating system distribution
portability, and resource isolation. Existing mainstream cloud service
providers have prevalently adopted container technologies in their distributed
system infrastructures for automated application management. To handle the
automation of deployment, maintenance, autoscaling, and networking of
containerized applications, container orchestration is proposed as an essential
research problem. However, the highly dynamic and diverse feature of cloud
workloads and environments considerably raises the complexity of orchestration
mechanisms. Machine learning algorithms are accordingly employed by container
orchestration systems for behavior modelling and prediction of
multi-dimensional performance metrics. Such insights could further improve the
quality of resource provisioning decisions in response to the changing
workloads under complex environments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
literature review of existing machine learning-based container orchestration
approaches. Detailed taxonomies are proposed to classify the current researches
by their common features. Moreover, the evolution of machine learning-based
container orchestration technologies from the year 2016 to 2021 has been
designed based on objectives and metrics. A comparative analysis of the
reviewed techniques is conducted according to the proposed taxonomies, with

                                        <span>In reacting flow systems, thermoacoustic instability characterized by high
amplitude pressure fluctuations, is driven by a positive coupling between the
unsteady heat release rate and the acoustic field of the combustor. When the
underlying flow is turbulent, as a control parameter of the system is varied
and the system approach thermoacoustic instability, the acoustic pressure
oscillations synchronize with heat release rate oscillations. Consequently,
during the onset of thermoacoustic instability in turbulent combustors, the
system dynamics transition from chaotic oscillations to periodic oscillations
via a state of intermittency. Thermoacoustic systems are traditionally modeled
by coupling the model for the unsteady heat source and the acoustic subsystem,
each estimated independently. The response of the unsteady heat source, the
flame, to acoustic fluctuations are characterized by introducing external
unsteady forcing. This necessitates a powerful excitation module to obtain the
nonlinear response of the flame to acoustic perturbations. Instead of
characterizing individual subsystems, we introduce a neural ordinary
differential equation (neural ODE) framework to model the thermoacoustic system
as a whole. The neural ODE model for the thermoacoustic system uses time series
of the heat release rate and the pressure fluctuations, measured simultaneously
without introducing any external perturbations, to model their coupled
interaction. Further, we use the parameters of neural ODE to define an anomaly
measure that represents the proximity of system dynamics to limit cycle
oscillations and thus provide an early warning signal for the onset of
thermoacoustic instability.</span>

                                        <span>Learning new tasks continuously without forgetting on a constantly changing
data distribution is essential for real-world problems but extremely
challenging for modern deep learning. In this work we propose HCL, a Hybrid
generative-discriminative approach to Continual Learning for classification. We
model the distribution of each task and each class with a normalizing flow. The
flow is used to learn the data distribution, perform classification, identify
task changes, and avoid forgetting, all leveraging the invertibility and exact
likelihood which are uniquely enabled by the normalizing flow model. We use the
generative capabilities of the flow to avoid catastrophic forgetting through
generative replay and a novel functional regularization technique. For task
identification, we use state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques based on
measuring the typicality of the model&#x27;s statistics. We demonstrate the strong
performance of HCL on a range of continual learning benchmarks such as
split-MNIST, split-CIFAR, and SVHN-MNIST.</span>

input-stability assumptions. Despite the ever-growing volume of works on
differential privacy in general and differentially private clustering in
particular, only three works (Nissim et al. 2007, Wang et al. 2015, Huang et
al. 2018) looked at the problem of privately clustering &quot;nice&quot; k-means
instances, all three relying on the sample-and-aggregate framework and all
three measuring utility in terms of Wasserstein distance between the true
cluster centers and the centers returned by the private algorithm. In this work
we improve upon this line of works on multiple axes. We present a far simpler
algorithm for clustering stable inputs (not relying on the sample-and-aggregate
framework), and analyze its utility in both the Wasserstein distance and the
k-means cost. Moreover, our algorithm has straight-forward analogues for &quot;nice&quot;
k-median instances and for the local-model of differential privacy.</span>

                                        <span>Detection of semantic data types is a very crucial task in data science for
automated data cleaning, schema matching, data discovery, semantic data type
normalization and sensitive data identification. Existing methods include
regular expression-based or dictionary lookup-based methods that are not robust
to dirty as well unseen data and are limited to a very less number of semantic
data types to predict. Existing Machine Learning methods extract large number
of engineered features from data and build logistic regression, random forest
or feedforward neural network for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce
DCoM, a collection of multi-input NLP-based deep neural networks to detect
semantic data types where instead of extracting large number of features from
the data, we feed the raw values of columns (or instances) to the model as
texts. We train DCoM on 686,765 data columns extracted from VizNet corpus with
78 different semantic data types. DCoM outperforms other contemporary results
with a quite significant margin on the same dataset.</span>

                                        <span>The recurrent network architecture is a widely used model in sequence
modeling, but its serial dependency hinders the computation parallelization,
which makes the operation inefficient. The same problem was encountered in
serial adder at the early stage of digital electronics. In this paper, we
discuss the similarities between recurrent neural network (RNN) and serial
adder. Inspired by carry-lookahead adder, we introduce carry-lookahead module
to RNN, which makes it possible for RNN to run in parallel. Then, we design the
method of parallel RNN computation, and finally Carry-lookahead RNN (CL-RNN) is
proposed. CL-RNN takes advantages in parallelism and flexible receptive field.
Through a comprehensive set of tests, we verify that CL-RNN can perform better
than existing typical RNNs in sequence modeling tasks which are specially
designed for RNNs.</span>

exhibit strong homophily with respect to the node labels i.e. connected nodes
have same labels. However, they perform poorly on heterophilic graphs. Recent
approaches have typically modified aggregation schemes, designed adaptive graph
filters, etc. to address this limitation. In spite of this, the performance on
heterophilic graphs can still be poor. We propose a simple alternative method
that exploits Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) of topological
structure and node features. Our approach achieves up to ~30% improvement in
performance over state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs. This work is
an early investigation into methods that differ from aggregation based
approaches. Our experimental results suggest that it might be important to
explore other alternatives to aggregation methods for heterophilic setting.</span>

abstract the data and tasks, and develop an interactive multi-view interface

learning (MARL) based upon any nonlinear function of the team&#x27;s long-term
state-action occupancy measure, i.e., a \emph{general utility}. This subsumes
the cumulative return but also allows one to incorporate risk-sensitivity,
exploration, and priors. % We derive the {\bf D}ecentralized {\bf S}hadow
Reward {\bf A}ctor-{\bf C}ritic (DSAC) in which agents alternate between policy
evaluation (critic), weighted averaging with neighbors (information mixing),
and local gradient updates for their policy parameters (actor). DSAC augments
the classic critic step by requiring agents to (i) estimate their local
occupancy measure in order to (ii) estimate the derivative of the local utility
with respect to their occupancy measure, i.e., the &quot;shadow reward&quot;. DSAC
converges to $\epsilon$-stationarity in $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{2.5})$
(Theorem \ref{theorem:final}) or faster $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{2})$
(Corollary \ref{corollary:communication}) steps with high probability,
depending on the amount of communications. We further establish the
non-existence of spurious stationary points for this problem, that is, DSAC
finds the globally optimal policy (Corollary \ref{corollary:global}).

cooperative MARL.</span>

                                        <span>Graph neural networks (GNNs) emerged recently as a standard toolkit for
learning from data on graphs. Current GNN designing works depend on immense
human expertise to explore different message-passing mechanisms, and require
manual enumeration to determine the proper message-passing depth. Inspired by
the strong searching capability of neural architecture search (NAS) in CNN,
this paper proposes Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) with novel-designed
search space. The GNAS can automatically learn better architecture with the
optimal depth of message passing on the graph. Specifically, we design Graph
Neural Architecture Paradigm (GAP) with tree-topology computation procedure and
two types of fine-grained atomic operations (feature filtering and neighbor
aggregation) from message-passing mechanism to construct powerful graph network
search space. Feature filtering performs adaptive feature selection, and
neighbor aggregation captures structural information and calculates neighbors&#x27;
statistics. Experiments show that our GNAS can search for better GNNs with
multiple message-passing mechanisms and optimal message-passing depth. The
searched network achieves remarkable improvement over state-of-the-art manual
designed and search-based GNNs on five large-scale datasets at three classical
graph tasks. Codes can be found at https://github.com/phython96/GNAS-MP.</span>

                                        <span>The computation and memory needed for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
inference can be reduced by pruning weights from the trained network. Pruning
is guided by a pruning saliency, which heuristically approximates the change in
the loss function associated with the removal of specific weights. Many pruning
signals have been proposed, but the performance of each heuristic depends on
the particular trained network. This leaves the data scientist with a difficult
choice. When using any one saliency metric for the entire pruning process, we
run the risk of the metric assumptions being invalidated, leading to poor
decisions being made by the metric. Ideally we could combine the best aspects
of different saliency metrics. However, despite an extensive literature review,
we are unable to find any prior work on composing different saliency metrics.
The chief difficulty lies in combining the numerical output of different
saliency metrics, which are not directly comparable.

We propose a method to compose several primitive pruning saliencies, to
exploit the cases where each saliency measure does well. Our experiments show
that the composition of saliencies avoids many poor pruning choices identified
by individual saliencies. In most cases our method finds better selections than
even the best individual pruning saliency.</span>

                                        <span>Throughout science and technology, receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves and associated area under the curve (AUC) measures constitute powerful
tools for assessing the predictive abilities of features, markers and tests in
binary classification problems. Despite its immense popularity, ROC analysis
has been subject to a fundamental restriction, in that it applies to
dichotomous (yes or no) outcomes only. Here we introduce ROC movies and
universal ROC (UROC) curves that apply to just any linearly ordered outcome,
along with an associated coefficient of predictive ability (CPA) measure. CPA
equals the area under the UROC curve, and admits appealing interpretations in
terms of probabilities and rank based covariances. For binary outcomes CPA
equals AUC, and for pairwise distinct outcomes CPA relates linearly to
Spearman&#x27;s coefficient, in the same way that the C index relates linearly to
Kendall&#x27;s coefficient. ROC movies, UROC curves, and CPA nest and generalize the
tools of classical ROC analysis, and are bound to supersede them in a wealth of
applications. Their usage is illustrated in data examples from biomedicine and
meteorology, where rank based measures yield new insights in the WeatherBench

physical-numerical models for weather prediction.</span>

for electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However,
CNN models have been found vulnerable to universal adversarial perturbations
(UAPs), which are small and example-independent, yet powerful enough to degrade
the performance of a CNN model, when added to a benign example. This paper
proposes a novel total loss minimization (TLM) approach to generate UAPs for
EEG-based BCIs. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of TLM on
three popular CNN classifiers for both target and non-target attacks. We also
verified the transferability of UAPs in EEG-based BCI systems. To our
knowledge, this is the first study on UAPs of CNN classifiers in EEG-based
BCIs. UAPs are easy to construct, and can attack BCIs in real-time, exposing a
potentially critical security concern of BCIs.</span>

                                        <span>The rapid development of artificial intelligence and deep learning has
provided many opportunities to further enhance the safety, stability, and
accuracy of industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). As indispensable
components to many mission-critical CPS assets and equipment, mechanical
bearings need to be monitored to identify any trace of abnormal conditions.
Most of the data-driven approaches applied to bearing fault diagnosis
up-to-date are trained using a large amount of fault data collected a priori.
In many practical applications, however, it can be unsafe and time-consuming to
collect sufficient data samples for each fault category, making it challenging
to train a robust classifier. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning
framework for bearing fault diagnosis based on model-agnostic meta-learning
(MAML), which targets for training an effective fault classifier using limited
data. In addition, it can leverage the training data and learn to identify new
fault scenarios more efficiently. Case studies on the generalization to new
artificial faults show that the proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy
up to 25% higher than a Siamese network-based benchmark study. Finally, the
robustness and the generalization capability of the proposed framework are
further validated by applying it to identify real bearing damages using data
from artificial damages, which compares favorably against 6 state-of-the-art
few-shot learning algorithms using consistent test environments.</span>

review of publications on ML applied in PPC. The research objective of this
study is twofold: firstly, it aims to identify techniques and tools allowing to
apply ML in PPC, and secondly, it reviews the characteristics of Industry 4.0

than 1 million people in the U.S. have confirmed cases of COVID-19. This
infectious respiratory disease has spread rapidly across more than 3000
counties and 50 states in the U.S. and have exhibited evolutionary clustering
and complex triggering patterns. It is essential to understand the complex
spacetime intertwined propagation of this disease so that accurate prediction
or smart external intervention can be carried out. In this paper, we model the
propagation of the COVID-19 as spatio-temporal point processes and propose a
generative and intensity-free model to track the spread of the disease. We
further adopt a generative adversarial imitation learning framework to learn
the model parameters. In comparison with the traditional likelihood-based
learning methods, this imitation learning framework does not need to prespecify
an intensity function, which alleviates the model-misspecification. Moreover,
the adversarial learning procedure bypasses the difficult-to-evaluate integral
involved in the likelihood evaluation, which makes the model inference more
scalable with the data and variables. We showcase the dynamic learning
performance on the COVID-19 confirmed cases in the U.S. and evaluate the social
distancing policy based on the learned generative model.</span>

                                        <span>Low rank matrix recovery problems, including matrix completion and matrix
sensing, appear in a broad range of applications. In this work we present GNMR
-- an extremely simple iterative algorithm for low rank matrix recovery, based
on a Gauss-Newton linearization. On the theoretical front, we derive recovery
guarantees for GNMR in both the matrix sensing and matrix completion settings.
A key property of GNMR is that it implicitly keeps the factor matrices
approximately balanced throughout its iterations. On the empirical front, we
show that for matrix completion with uniform sampling, GNMR performs better
than several popular methods, especially when given very few observations close
to the information limit.</span>

                                        <span>Radiographs are used as the most important imaging tool for identifying spine
anomalies in clinical practice. The evaluation of spinal bone lesions, however,
is a challenging task for radiologists. This work aims at developing and
evaluating a deep learning-based framework, named VinDr-SpineXR, for the
classification and localization of abnormalities from spine X-rays. First, we
build a large dataset, comprising 10,468 spine X-ray images from 5,000 studies,
each of which is manually annotated by an experienced radiologist with bounding
boxes around abnormal findings in 13 categories. Using this dataset, we then
train a deep learning classifier to determine whether a spine scan is abnormal
and a detector to localize 7 crucial findings amongst the total 13. The
VinDr-SpineXR is evaluated on a test set of 2,078 images from 1,000 studies,
which is kept separate from the training set. It demonstrates an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 88.61% (95% CI 87.19%,
90.02%) for the image-level classification task and a mean average precision
(mAP@0.5) of 33.56% for the lesion-level localization task. These results serve
as a proof of concept and set a baseline for future research in this direction.
To encourage advances, the dataset, codes, and trained deep learning models are
made publicly available.</span>

                                        <span>Self-supervised deep learning methods have leveraged stereo images for
training monocular depth estimation. Although these methods show strong results
on outdoor datasets such as KITTI, they do not match performance of supervised
methods on indoor environments with camera rotation. Indoor, rotated scenes are
common for less constrained applications and pose problems for two reasons:
abundance of low texture regions and increased complexity of depth cues for
images under rotation. In an effort to extend self-supervised learning to more
generalised environments we propose two additions. First, we propose a novel
Filled Disparity Loss term that corrects for ambiguity of image reconstruction
error loss in textureless regions. Specifically, we interpolate disparity in
untextured regions, using the estimated disparity from surrounding textured
areas, and use L1 loss to correct the original estimation. Our experiments show
that depth estimation is substantially improved on low-texture scenes, without
any loss on textured scenes, when compared to Monodepth by Godard et al.
Secondly, we show that training with an application&#x27;s representative rotations,
in both pitch and roll, is sufficient to significantly improve performance over
the entire range of expected rotation. We demonstrate that depth estimation is
successfully generalised as performance is not lost when evaluated on test sets
with no camera rotation. Together these developments enable a broader use of
self-supervised learning of monocular depth estimation for complex
environments.</span>

                                        <span>Sketching uses randomized Hash functions for dimensionality reduction and
acceleration. The existing sketching methods, such as count sketch (CS), tensor
sketch (TS), and higher-order count sketch (HCS), either suffer from low
accuracy or slow speed in some tensor based applications. In this paper, the
proposed fast count sketch (FCS) applies multiple shorter Hash functions based
CS to the vector form of the input tensor, which is more accurate than TS since
the spatial information of the input tensor can be preserved more sufficiently.
When the input tensor admits CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD), FCS can
accelerate CS and HCS by using fast Fourier transform, which exhibits a
computational complexity asymptotically identical to TS for low-order tensors.
The effectiveness of FCS is validated by CPD, tensor regression network
compression, and Kronecker product compression. Experimental results show its
superior performance in terms of approximation accuracy and computational
efficiency.</span>

                                        <span>Designing novel protein sequences for a desired 3D topological fold is a
fundamental yet non-trivial task in protein engineering. Challenges exist due
to the complex sequence--fold relationship, as well as the difficulties to
capture the diversity of the sequences (therefore structures and functions)
within a fold. To overcome these challenges, we propose Fold2Seq, a novel
transformer-based generative framework for designing protein sequences
conditioned on a specific target fold. To model the complex sequence--structure
relationship, Fold2Seq jointly learns a sequence embedding using a transformer
and a fold embedding from the density of secondary structural elements in 3D
voxels. On test sets with single, high-resolution and complete structure inputs
for individual folds, our experiments demonstrate improved or comparable
performance of Fold2Seq in terms of speed, coverage, and reliability for
sequence design, when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods that
include data-driven deep generative models and physics-based RosettaDesign. The
unique advantages of fold-based Fold2Seq, in comparison to a structure-based
deep model and RosettaDesign, become more evident on three additional
real-world challenges originating from low-quality, incomplete, or ambiguous
input structures. Source code and data are available at

Networks (CNNs) are computationally expensive at the point where the training
time could take days unless the number of layers, the number of training images
or the size of the training images are reduced. The image size of 256x256
pixels is commonly used for most of the applications of CNN, but this image
size is too small for applications like Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)
classification where the image details are important for accurate
classification. This research proposed Frequency Domain Convolution (FDC) and
Frequency Domain Pooling (FDP) layers which were built with RFFT, kernel
initialization strategy, convolution artifact removal and Channel Independent
Convolution (CIC) to replace the conventional convolution and pooling layers.
The FDC and FDP layers are used to build a Frequency Domain Convolutional
Neural Network (FDCNN) to accelerate the training of large images for DR
classification. The Full FDC layer is an extension of the FDC layer to allow
direct use in conventional CNNs, it is also used to modify the VGG16
architecture. FDCNN is shown to be at least 54.21% faster and 70.74% more
memory efficient compared to an equivalent CNN architecture. The modified VGG16
architecture with Full FDC layer is reported to achieve a shorter training time
and a higher accuracy at 95.63% compared to the original VGG16 architecture for
DR classification.</span>

has found many applications in financial services ranging from fund recommender
systems, competitors analysis, portfolio analytics, marketing and sales, etc.
The traditional methods are either qualitative, and hence prone to biases and
often not reproducible, or, are known not to capture all the nuances
(non-linearities) among the portfolios from the raw data. We propose a
radically new approach to identify similar funds based on the weighted
bipartite network representation of funds and their underlying assets data
using a sophisticated machine learning method called Node2Vec which learns an
embedded low-dimensional representation of the network. We call the embedding
\emph{Fund2Vec}. Ours is the first ever study of the weighted bipartite network
representation of the funds-assets network in its original form that identifies
structural similarity among portfolios as opposed to merely portfolio overlaps.</span>

exploited the vulnerabilities of IoT devices. However, it is still challenging
to detect the initial intrusion on IoT devices prior to massive attacks. Recent
studies have utilized power side-channel information to characterize this
intrusion behavior on IoT devices but still lack real-time detection
approaches. This study aimed to design an online intrusion detection system
called DeepAuditor for IoT devices via power auditing. To realize the real-time
system, we first proposed a lightweight power auditing device called Power
Auditor. With the Power Auditor, we developed a Distributed CNN classifier for
online inference in our laboratory setting. In order to protect data leakage
and reduce networking redundancy, we also proposed a privacy-preserved
inference protocol via Packed Homomorphic Encryption and a sliding window
protocol in our system. The classification accuracy and processing time were
measured in our laboratory settings. We also demonstrated that the distributed
CNN design is secure against any distributed components. Overall, the
measurements were shown to the feasibility of our real-time distributed system
for intrusion detection on IoT devices.</span>

bounds on the regret. In this work, we initiate the study of best-case lower
bounds in online convex optimization, wherein we bound the largest improvement
an algorithm can obtain relative to the single best action in hindsight. This
problem is motivated by the goal of better understanding the adaptivity of a
learning algorithm. Another motivation comes from fairness: it is known that
best-case lower bounds are instrumental in obtaining algorithms for
decision-theoretic online learning (DTOL) that satisfy a notion of group
fairness. Our contributions are a general method to provide best-case lower
bounds in Follow The Regularized Leader (FTRL) algorithms with time-varying
regularizers, which we use to show that best-case lower bounds are of the same
order as existing upper regret bounds: this includes situations with a fixed
learning rate, decreasing learning rates, timeless methods, and adaptive
gradient methods. In stark contrast, we show that the linearized version of
FTRL can attain negative linear regret. Finally, in DTOL with two experts and
binary predictions, we fully characterize the best-case sequences, which
provides a finer understanding of the best-case lower bounds.</span>

debiased encoders. This process not only requires a lot of instance-level
annotations for sensitive attributes, it also does not guarantee that all
fairness sensitive information has been removed from the encoder. To address
these limitations, we explore the following research question: Can we reduce
the discrimination of DNN models by only debiasing the classification head,
even with biased representations as inputs? To this end, we propose a new
mitigation technique, namely, Representation Neutralization for Fairness (RNF)
that achieves fairness by debiasing only the task-specific classification head
of DNN models. To this end, we leverage samples with the same ground-truth
label but different sensitive attributes, and use their neutralized
representations to train the classification head of the DNN model. The key idea
of RNF is to discourage the classification head from capturing spurious
correlation between fairness sensitive information in encoder representations
with specific class labels. To address low-resource settings with no access to
sensitive attribute annotations, we leverage a bias-amplified model to generate
proxy annotations for sensitive attributes. Experimental results over several
benchmark datasets demonstrate our RNF framework to effectively reduce
discrimination of DNN models with minimal degradation in task-specific
performance.</span>

problems where the GP realization and the noisy observations of that
realization lie on different domains. When the mapping between those domains is
linear, such as integration or differentiation, inference is still closed form.
However, many of the scaling and approximation techniques that our community
has developed do not apply to this setting. In this work, we introduce the
hierarchical inducing point GP (HIP-GP), a scalable inter-domain GP inference
method that enables us to improve the approximation accuracy by increasing the
number of inducing points to the millions. HIP-GP, which relies on inducing
points with grid structure and a stationary kernel assumption, is suitable for
low-dimensional problems. In developing HIP-GP, we introduce (1) a fast
whitening strategy, and (2) a novel preconditioner for conjugate gradients
which can be helpful in general GP settings. Our code is available at https:

known dynamics. By reframing policy learning in continuous-time, we show that
it is possible construct a more efficient and accurate gradient estimator. The
standard back-propagation through time estimator (BPTT) computes exact
gradients for a crude discretization of the continuous-time system. In
contrast, we approximate continuous-time gradients in the original system. With
the explicit goal of estimating continuous-time gradients, we are able to
discretize adaptively and construct a more efficient policy gradient estimator
which we call the Continuous-Time Policy Gradient (CTPG). We show that
replacing BPTT policy gradients with more efficient CTPG estimates results in
faster and more robust learning in a variety of control tasks and simulators.</span>

                                        <span>Recommender systems -- and especially matrix factorization-based
collaborative filtering algorithms -- play a crucial role in mediating our
access to online information. We show that such algorithms induce a particular
kind of stereotyping: if preferences for a \textit{set} of items are
anti-correlated in the general user population, then those items may not be
recommended together to a user, regardless of that user&#x27;s preferences and
ratings history. First, we introduce a notion of \textit{joint accessibility},
which measures the extent to which a set of items can jointly be accessed by
users. We then study joint accessibility under the standard factorization-based
collaborative filtering framework, and provide theoretical necessary and
sufficient conditions when joint accessibility is violated. Moreover, we show
that these conditions can easily be violated when the users are represented by
a single feature vector. To improve joint accessibility, we further propose an
alternative modelling fix, which is designed to capture the diverse multiple
interests of each user using a multi-vector representation. We conduct
extensive experiments on real and simulated datasets, demonstrating the
stereotyping problem with standard single-vector matrix factorization models.</span>

supervised NLP tasks. However, annotated data for every target task in every
target language is rare, especially for low-resource languages. We propose
UXLA, a novel unsupervised data augmentation framework for zero-resource
transfer learning scenarios. In particular, UXLA aims to solve cross-lingual
adaptation problems from a source language task distribution to an unknown
target language task distribution, assuming no training label in the target
language. At its core, UXLA performs simultaneous self-training with data
augmentation and unsupervised sample selection. To show its effectiveness, we
conduct extensive experiments on three diverse zero-resource cross-lingual
transfer tasks. UXLA achieves SoTA results in all the tasks, outperforming the
baselines by a good margin. With an in-depth framework dissection, we
demonstrate the cumulative contributions of different components to its
success.</span>

verify the safety and robustness of neural networks in real-world applications.
Existing methods are designed to verify the network before use, which is
limited to relatively simple specifications and fixed networks. These methods
are not ready to be applied to real-world problems with complex and/or
dynamically changing specifications and networks. To effectively handle
dynamically changing specifications and networks, the verification needs to be
performed online when these changes take place. However, it is still
challenging to run existing verification algorithms online. Our key insight is
that we can leverage the temporal dependencies of these changes to accelerate
the verification process, e.g., by warm starting new online verification using
previous verified results. This paper establishes a novel framework for
scalable online verification to solve real-world verification problems with
dynamically changing specifications and/or networks, known as domain shift and
weight shift respectively. We propose three types of techniques (branch
management, perturbation tolerance analysis, and incremental computation) to
accelerate the online verification of deep neural networks. Experiment results
show that our online verification algorithm is up to two orders of magnitude
faster than existing verification algorithms, and thus can scale to real-world
applications.</span>

probabilistic models for predictive modeling as neural ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), and for generative modeling as continuous normalizing flows.
In this work, we design a framework to decipher the internal dynamics of these
continuous depth models by pruning their network architectures. Our empirical
results suggest that pruning improves generalization for neural ODEs in
generative modeling. Moreover, pruning finds minimal and efficient neural ODE
representations with up to 98\% less parameters compared to the original
network, without loss of accuracy. Finally, we show that by applying pruning we
can obtain insightful information about the design of better neural ODEs.We

simulated data, including an estimate of the detector-noise characteristics

neural-network parameters, and enables inference for any observed data
consistent with the training distribution, accounting for noise nonstationarity

                                        <span>In this paper, a novel and robust algorithm is proposed for adaptive
beamforming based on the idea of reconstructing the autocorrelation sequence
(ACS) of a random process from a set of measured data. This is obtained from
the first column and the first row of the sample covariance matrix (SCM) after
averaging along its diagonals. Then, the power spectrum of the correlation
sequence is estimated using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The DFT
coefficients corresponding to the angles within the noise-plus-interference
region are used to reconstruct the noise-plus-interference covariance matrix
(NPICM), while the desired signal covariance matrix (DSCM) is estimated by
identifying and removing the noise-plus-interference component from the SCM. In
particular, the spatial power spectrum of the estimated received signal is
utilized to compute the correlation sequence corresponding to the
noise-plus-interference in which the dominant DFT coefficient of the
noise-plus-interference is captured. A key advantage of the proposed adaptive
beamforming is that only little prior information is required. Specifically, an
imprecise knowledge of the array geometry and of the angular sectors in which
the interferences are located is needed. Simulation results demonstrate that
compared with previous reconstruction-based beamformers, the proposed approach

                                        <span>Classical machine learning (ML) provides a potentially powerful approach to
solving challenging quantum many-body problems in physics and chemistry.
However, the advantages of ML over more traditional methods have not been
firmly established. In this work, we prove that classical ML algorithms can
efficiently predict ground state properties of gapped Hamiltonians in finite
spatial dimensions, after learning from data obtained by measuring other
Hamiltonians in the same quantum phase of matter. In contrast, under widely
accepted complexity theory assumptions, classical algorithms that do not learn
from data cannot achieve the same guarantee. We also prove that classical ML
algorithms can efficiently classify a wide range of quantum phases of matter.
Our arguments are based on the concept of a classical shadow, a succinct
classical description of a many-body quantum state that can be constructed in
feasible quantum experiments and be used to predict many properties of the
state. Extensive numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical results in a
variety of scenarios, including Rydberg atom systems, 2D random Heisenberg
models, symmetry-protected topological phases, and topologically ordered
phases.</span>

                                        <span>In temporal difference (TD) learning, off-policy sampling is known to be more
practical than on-policy sampling, and by decoupling learning from data
collection, it enables data reuse. It is known that policy evaluation
(including multi-step off-policy importance sampling) has the interpretation of
solving a generalized Bellman equation. In this paper, we derive finite-sample
bounds for any general off-policy TD-like stochastic approximation algorithm
that solves for the fixed-point of this generalized Bellman operator. Our key
step is to show that the generalized Bellman operator is simultaneously a
contraction mapping with respect to a weighted $\ell_p$-norm for each $p$ in
$[1,\infty)$, with a common contraction factor.

Off-policy TD-learning is known to suffer from high variance due to the
product of importance sampling ratios. A number of algorithms (e.g.
$Q^\pi(\lambda)$, Tree-Backup$(\lambda)$, Retrace$(\lambda)$, and $Q$-trace)
have been proposed in the literature to address this issue. Our results
immediately imply finite-sample bounds of these algorithms. In particular, we
provide first-known finite-sample guarantees for $Q^\pi(\lambda)$,
Tree-Backup$(\lambda)$, and Retrace$(\lambda)$, and improve the best known
bounds of $Q$-trace in [19]. Moreover, we show the bias-variance trade-offs in
each of these algorithms.</span>

complex problems, the likes of which we could not have imagined a few decades
back. But as many benefits as it brings, there are still ways in which it can
be used to bring harm to our society. Deep fakes have been proven to be one
such problem, and now more than ever, when any individual can create a fake
image or video simply using an application on the smartphone, there need to be
some countermeasures, with which we can detect if the image or video is a fake
or real and dispose of the problem threatening the trustworthiness of online
information. Although the Deep fakes created by neural networks, may seem to be
as real as a real image or video, it still leaves behind spatial and temporal
traces or signatures after moderation, these signatures while being invisible
to a human eye can be detected with the help of a neural network trained to
specialize in Deep fake detection. In this paper, we analyze several such
states of the art neural networks (MesoNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and Xception
Net) and compare them against each other, to find an optimal solution for
various scenarios like real-time deep fake detection to be deployed in online
social media platforms where the classification should be made as fast as
possible or for a small news agency where the classification need not be in
real-time but requires utmost accuracy.</span>

models, conditional VAEs (CVAEs) were recently shown capable of generating
output that can be modified using labels specifying desired content, albeit
working with segments of levels and platformers exclusively. We expand these
works by using CVAEs for generating whole platformer and dungeon levels, and
blending levels across these genres. We show that CVAEs can reliably control
door placement in dungeons and progression direction in platformer levels.
Thus, by using appropriate labels, our approach can generate whole dungeons and
platformer levels of interconnected rooms and segments respectively as well as
levels that blend dungeons and platformers. We demonstrate our approach using
The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Mega Man and Lode Runner.</span>

strong performance in several speech and vision problems. In contrast to other
generative models, normalizing flows have tractable likelihoods and allow for
stable training. However, they have to be carefully designed to represent
invertible functions with efficient Jacobian determinant calculation. In
practice, these requirements lead to overparameterized and sophisticated
architectures that are inferior to alternative feed-forward models in terms of
inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we investigate whether one

provide a positive answer to this question by proposing a simple distillation

                                        <span>We consider the problem of semantic matching in product search: given a
customer query, retrieve all semantically related products from a huge catalog
of size 100 million, or more. Because of large catalog spaces and real-time
latency constraints, semantic matching algorithms not only desire high recall
but also need to have low latency. Conventional lexical matching approaches
(e.g., Okapi-BM25) exploit inverted indices to achieve fast inference time, but
fail to capture behavioral signals between queries and products. In contrast,
embedding-based models learn semantic representations from customer behavior
data, but the performance is often limited by shallow neural encoders due to
latency constraints. Semantic product search can be viewed as an eXtreme
Multi-label Classification (XMC) problem, where customer queries are input
instances and products are output labels. In this paper, we aim to improve
semantic product search by using tree-based XMC models where inference time
complexity is logarithmic in the number of products. We consider hierarchical
linear models with n-gram features for fast real-time inference.
Quantitatively, our method maintains a low latency of 1.25 milliseconds per
query and achieves a 65% improvement of Recall@100 (60.9% v.s. 36.8%) over a
competing embedding-based DSSM model. Our model is robust to weight pruning
with varying thresholds, which can flexibly meet different system requirements
for online deployments. Qualitatively, our method can retrieve products that
are complementary to existing product search system and add diversity to the
match set.</span>

                                        <span>The claims data, containing medical codes, services information, and incurred
expenditure, can be a good resource for estimating an individual&#x27;s health
condition and medical risk level. In this study, we developed Transformer-based
Multimodal AutoEncoder (TMAE), an unsupervised learning framework that can
learn efficient patient representation by encoding meaningful information from
the claims data. TMAE is motivated by the practical needs in healthcare to
stratify patients into different risk levels for improving care delivery and
management. Compared to previous approaches, TMAE is able to 1) model
inpatient, outpatient, and medication claims collectively, 2) handle irregular
time intervals between medical events, 3) alleviate the sparsity issue of the
rare medical codes, and 4) incorporate medical expenditure information. We
trained TMAE using a real-world pediatric claims dataset containing more than
600,000 patients and compared its performance with various approaches in two
clustering tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TMAE has superior
performance compared to all baselines. Multiple downstream applications are

the weight parameters perturbations, i.e., sharpness, attracts attention in
recent years (Sun et al., 2020). However, sharpness is known to remain a
critical issue, &quot;scale-sensitivity.&quot; In this paper, we propose a novel
sharpness measure, Minimum Sharpness. It is known that NNs have a specific
scale transformation that constitutes equivalent classes where functional
properties are completely identical, and at the same time, their sharpness
could change unlimitedly. We define our sharpness through a minimization
problem over the equivalent NNs being invariant to the scale transformation. We
also develop an efficient and exact technique to make the sharpness tractable,
which reduces the heavy computational costs involved with Hessian. In the
experiment, we observed that our sharpness has a valid correlation with the
generalization of NNs and runs with less computational cost than existing
sharpness measures.</span>

subword tokenization algorithms, which limit their generalization ability and
adaptation to new settings. In this paper, we propose a new model inductive
bias that learns a subword tokenization end-to-end as part of the model. To
this end, we introduce a soft gradient-based subword tokenization module (GBST)
that automatically learns latent subword representations from characters in a
data-driven fashion. Concretely, GBST enumerates candidate subword blocks and
learns to score them in a position-wise fashion using a block scoring network.
We additionally introduce Charformer, a deep Transformer model that integrates
GBST and operates on the byte level. Via extensive experiments on English GLUE,
multilingual, and noisy text datasets, we show that Charformer outperforms a
series of competitive byte-level baselines while generally performing on par
and sometimes outperforming subword-based models. Additionally, Charformer is
fast, improving the speed of both vanilla byte-level and subword-level
Transformers by 28%-100% while maintaining competitive quality. We believe this
work paves the way for highly performant token-free models that are trained
completely end-to-end.</span>

                                        <span>We consider the phenomenon of adversarial examples in ReLU networks with
independent gaussian parameters. For networks of constant depth and with a
large range of widths (for instance, it suffices if the width of each layer is
polynomial in that of any other layer), small perturbations of input vectors
lead to large changes of outputs. This generalizes results of Daniely and
Schacham (2020) for networks of rapidly decreasing width and of Bubeck et al
(2021) for two-layer networks. The proof shows that adversarial examples arise
in these networks because the functions that they compute are very close to
linear. Bottleneck layers in the network play a key role: the minimal width up
to some point in the network determines scales and sensitivities of mappings
computed up to that point. The main result is for networks with constant depth,
but we also show that some constraint on depth is necessary for a result of
this kind, because there are suitably deep networks that, with constant
probability, compute a function that is close to constant.</span>

                                        <span>In modern ranking problems, different and disparate representations of the
items to be ranked are often available. It is sensible, then, to try to combine
these representations to improve ranking. Indeed, learning to rank via
combining representations is both principled and practical for learning a
ranking function for a particular query. In extremely data-scarce settings,
however, the amount of labeled data available for a particular query can lead
to a highly variable and ineffective ranking function. One way to mitigate the
effect of the small amount of data is to leverage information from semantically
similar queries. Indeed, as we demonstrate in simulation settings and real data
examples, when semantically similar queries are available it is possible to
gainfully use them when ranking with respect to a particular query. We describe
and explore this phenomenon in the context of the bias-variance trade off and
apply it to the data-scarce settings of a Bing navigational graph and the
Drosophila larva connectome.</span>

an active research topic in network traffic control systems. While modern
firewalls provide the capability to decrypt packets, this is not appealing for
privacy advocates. Hence, identifying any information from encrypted traffic is
a challenging task. Nonetheless, previous work has identified machine learning
methods that may enable application and service identification. The process
involves high level feature extraction from network packet data then training a
robust machine learning classifier for traffic identification. We propose a
classification technique using an ensemble of deep learning architectures on
packet, payload, and inter-arrival time sequences. To our knowledge, this is
the first time such deep learning architectures have been applied to the Server
Name Indication (SNI) classification problem. Our ensemble model beats the

has a disparate impact on different sub-groups in the population, which leads
to a significantly high drop-in model utility for sub-populations that are
under-represented (minorities), compared to well-represented ones. In this
work, we aim to compare PATE, another mechanism for training deep learning

                                        <span>High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) surpasses its predecessors in encoding
efficiency by introducing new coding tools at the cost of an increased encoding
time-complexity. The Coding Tree Unit (CTU) is the main building block used in
HEVC. In the HEVC standard, frames are divided into CTUs with the predetermined
size of up to 64x64 pixels. Each CTU is then divided recursively into a number
of equally sized square areas, known as Coding Units (CUs). Although this
diversity of frame partitioning increases encoding efficiency, it also causes
an increase in the time complexity due to the increased number of ways to find
the optimal partitioning. To address this complexity, numerous algorithms have
been proposed to eliminate unnecessary searches during partitioning CTUs by
exploiting the correlation in the video. In this paper, existing CTU depth
decision algorithms for HEVC are surveyed. These algorithms are categorized
into two groups, namely statistics and machine learning approaches. Statistics
approaches are further subdivided into neighboring and inherent approaches.
Neighboring approaches exploit the similarity between adjacent CTUs to limit
the depth range of the current CTU, while inherent approaches use only the
available information within the current CTU. Machine learning approaches try
to extract and exploit similarities implicitly. Traditional methods like
support vector machines or random forests use manually selected features, while
recently proposed deep learning methods extract features during training.
Finally, this paper discusses extending these methods to more recent video
coding formats such as Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and AOMedia Video 1(AV1).</span>

poses serious challenges for Arabic Sentiment Analysis (SA). While previous
research works tackle SA and sarcasm detection separately, this paper
introduces an end-to-end deep Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model, allowing
knowledge interaction between the two tasks. Our MTL model&#x27;s architecture
consists of a Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT)
model, a multi-task attention interaction module, and two task classifiers. The
overall obtained results show that our proposed model outperforms its
single-task counterparts on both SA and sarcasm detection sub-tasks.</span>

                                        <span>We present CharacterChat, a concept and chatbot to support writers in
creating fictional characters. Concretely, writers progressively turn the bot
into their imagined character through conversation. We iteratively developed
CharacterChat in a user-centred approach, starting with a survey on character
creation with writers (N&#x3D;30), followed by two qualitative user studies (N&#x3D;7 and
N&#x3D;8). Our prototype combines two modes: (1) Guided prompts help writers define
character attributes (e.g. User: &quot;Your name is Jane.&quot;), including suggestions
for attributes (e.g. Bot: &quot;What is my main motivation?&quot;) and values, realised
as a rule-based system with a concept network. (2) Open conversation with the
chatbot helps writers explore their character and get inspiration, realised
with a language model that takes into account the defined character attributes.
Our user studies reveal benefits particularly for early stages of character
creation, and challenges due to limited conversational capabilities. We
conclude with lessons learned and ideas for future work.</span>

                                        <span>Broad-coverage meaning representations in NLP mostly focus on explicitly
expressed content. More importantly, the scarcity of datasets annotating
diverse implicit roles limits empirical studies into their linguistic nuances.
For example, in the web review &quot;Great service!&quot;, the provider and consumer are
implicit arguments of different types. We examine an annotated corpus of
fine-grained implicit arguments (Cui and Hershcovich, 2020) by carefully
re-annotating it, resolving several inconsistencies. Subsequently, we present
the first transition-based neural parser that can handle implicit arguments
dynamically, and experiment with two different transition systems on the
improved dataset. We find that certain types of implicit arguments are more
difficult to parse than others and that the simpler system is more accurate in
recovering implicit arguments, despite having a lower overall parsing score,
attesting current reasoning limitations of NLP models. This work will
facilitate a better understanding of implicit and underspecified language, by
incorporating it holistically into meaning representations.</span>

                                        <span>Conventional representation learning algorithms for knowledge graphs (KG) map
each entity to a unique embedding vector. Such a shallow lookup results in a
linear growth of memory consumption for storing the embedding matrix and incurs
high computational costs when working with real-world KGs. Drawing parallels
with subword tokenization commonly used in NLP, we explore the landscape of
more parameter-efficient node embedding strategies with possibly sublinear
memory requirements. To this end, we propose NodePiece, an anchor-based
approach to learn a fixed-size entity vocabulary. In NodePiece, a vocabulary of
subword/sub-entity units is constructed from anchor nodes in a graph with known
relation types. Given such a fixed-size vocabulary, it is possible to bootstrap
an encoding and embedding for any entity, including those unseen during
training. Experiments show that NodePiece performs competitively in node
classification, link prediction, and relation prediction tasks while retaining
less than 10% of explicit nodes in a graph as anchors and often having 10x
fewer parameters.</span>

proficiency from the language learners&#x27; spoken responses to test prompts. The
task has significant relevance to the field of computer assisted language
learning. The approach presented in the paper relies on two separate modules:
(1) an automatic speech recognition system that yields text transcripts of the
spoken interactions involved, and (2) a multiple classifier system based on
deep learners that ranks the transcripts into proficiency classes. Different
deep neural network architectures (both feed-forward and recurrent) are
specialized over diverse representations of the texts in terms of: a reference
grammar, the outcome of probabilistic language models, several word embeddings,
and two bag-of-word models. Combination of the individual classifiers is
realized either via a probabilistic pseudo-joint model, or via a neural mixture
of experts. Using the data of the third Spoken CALL Shared Task challenge, the
highest values to date were obtained in terms of three popular evaluation

advancements in pre-training large models on massive amounts of data and the
need for intelligent agents to communicate in a natural manner. While
techniques can effectively generate fluent text, they can also produce
undesirable societal biases that can have a disproportionately negative impact
on marginalized populations. Language generation presents unique challenges for
biases in terms of direct user interaction and the structure of decoding
techniques. To better understand these challenges, we present a survey on
societal biases in language generation, focusing on how data and techniques
contribute to biases and progress towards reducing biases. Motivated by a lack
of studies on biases from decoding techniques, we also conduct experiments to
quantify the effects of these techniques. By further discussing general trends
and open challenges, we call to attention promising directions for research and
the importance of fairness and inclusivity considerations for language
generation applications.</span>

world is a key way for them to exhibit the human-like intelligence.
Image-grounded conversation is thus proposed to address this challenge.
Existing works focus on exploring the multimodal dialog models that ground the
conversation on a given image. In this paper, we take a step further to study
image-grounded conversation under a fully open-ended setting where no paired
dialog and image are assumed available. Specifically, we present Maria, a
neural conversation agent powered by the visual world experiences which are
retrieved from a large-scale image index. Maria consists of three flexible
components, i.e., text-to-image retriever, visual concept detector and
visual-knowledge-grounded response generator. The retriever aims to retrieve a
correlated image to the dialog from an image index, while the visual concept
detector extracts rich visual knowledge from the image. Then, the response
generator is grounded on the extracted visual knowledge and dialog context to
generate the target response. Extensive experiments demonstrate Maria
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on automatic metrics and human
evaluation, and can generate informative responses that have some visual
commonsense of the physical world.</span>

between the kinds of knowledge or skill levels we can achieve on different
tasks at the same time. When it comes to Neural Networks, that is not the case,
the major breakthroughs in the field are extremely task and domain specific.
Vision and language are dealt with in separate manners, using separate methods
and different datasets. In this work, we propose to use knowledge acquired by
benchmark Vision Models which are trained on ImageNet to help a much smaller
architecture learn to classify text. After transforming the textual data
contained in the IMDB dataset to gray scale images. An analysis of different
domains and the Transfer Learning method is carried out. Despite the challenge
posed by the very different datasets, promising results are achieved. The main
contribution of this work is a novel approach which links large pretrained
models on both language and vision to achieve state-of-the-art results in
different sub-fields from the original task. Without needing high compute
capacity resources. Specifically, Sentiment Analysis is achieved after
transferring knowledge between vision and language models. BERT embeddings are
transformed into grayscale images, these images are then used as training
examples for pretrained vision models such as VGG16 and ResNet

captions. By tagging images with soft text labels using a trained visual
classifier with a fixed vocabulary, previous work has shown that it is possible
to train a model that can detect whether a particular text keyword occurs in
speech utterances or not. Here we investigate whether visually grounded speech
models can also do keyword localisation: predicting where, within an utterance,
a given textual keyword occurs without any explicit text-based or alignment
supervision. We specifically consider whether incorporating attention into a
convolutional model is beneficial for localisation. Although absolute
localisation performance with visually supervised models is still modest
(compared to using unordered bag-of-word text labels for supervision), we show
that attention provides a large gain in performance over previous visually
grounded models. As in many other speech-image studies, we find that many of
the incorrect localisations are due to semantic confusions, e.g. locating the
word &#x27;backstroke&#x27; for the query keyword &#x27;swimming&#x27;.</span>

Portuguese NLP, which can be challenging due to lack of resources, our
approaches performed remarkably well in the classification task, achieving
maximum accuracy of .93 and top average F1 Scores of .89 (macro) and .93

language bias and hence fail to reason from the visual clue. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Language-Prior Feedback (LPF) objective function, to
re-balance the proportion of each answer&#x27;s loss value in the total VQA loss.
The LPF firstly calculates a modulating factor to determine the language bias
using a question-only branch. Then, the LPF assigns a self-adaptive weight to
each training sample in the training process. With this reweighting mechanism,
the LPF ensures that the total VQA loss can be reshaped to a more balanced
form. By this means, the samples that require certain visual information to
predict will be efficiently used during training. Our method is simple to
implement, model-agnostic, and end-to-end trainable. We conduct extensive
experiments and the results show that the LPF (1) brings a significant
improvement over various VQA models, (2) achieves competitive performance on
the bias-sensitive VQA-CP v2 benchmark.</span>

output sentence by enforcing the presence or absence of certain words and
phrases. Although current approaches can enforce terms to appear in the
translation, they often struggle to make the constraint word form agree with
the rest of the generated output. Our manual analysis shows that 46% of the
errors in the output of a baseline constrained model for English to Czech
translation are related to agreement. We investigate mechanisms to allow neural
machine translation to infer the correct word inflection given lemmatized
constraints. In particular, we focus on methods based on training the model
with constraints provided as part of the input sequence. Our experiments on the
English-Czech language pair show that this approach improves the translation of
constrained terms in both automatic and manual evaluation by reducing errors in
agreement. Our approach thus eliminates inflection errors, without introducing
new errors or decreasing the overall quality of the translation.</span>

                                        <span>We present a novel approach to the problem of text style transfer. Unlike
previous approaches requiring style-labeled training data, our method makes use
of readily-available unlabeled text by relying on the implicit connection in
style between adjacent sentences, and uses labeled data only at inference time.
We adapt T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), a strong pretrained text-to-text model, to
extract a style vector from text and use it to condition the decoder to perform
style transfer. As our label-free training results in a style vector space
encoding many facets of style, we recast transfers as &quot;targeted restyling&quot;
vector operations that adjust specific attributes of the input while preserving
others. We demonstrate that training on unlabeled Amazon reviews data results
in a model that is competitive on sentiment transfer, even compared to models
trained fully on labeled data. Furthermore, applying our novel method to a
diverse corpus of unlabeled web text results in a single model capable of
transferring along multiple dimensions of style (dialect, emotiveness,
formality, politeness, sentiment) despite no additional training and using only
a handful of exemplars at inference time.</span>

                                        <span>This paper addresses a series of complex and unresolved issues in the
historical phonology of West Iranian languages. The West Iranian languages
(Persian, Kurdish, Balochi, and other languages) display a high degree of
non-Lautgesetzlich behavior. Most of this irregularity is undoubtedly due to
language contact; we argue, however, that an oversimplified view of the
processes at work has prevailed in the literature on West Iranian dialectology,
with specialists assuming that deviations from an expected outcome in a given
non-Persian language are due to lexical borrowing from some chronological stage
of Persian. It is demonstrated that this qualitative approach yields at times
problematic conclusions stemming from the lack of explicit probabilistic
inferences regarding the distribution of the data: Persian may not be the sole
donor language; additionally, borrowing at the lexical level is not always the
mechanism that introduces irregularity. In many cases, the possibility that
West Iranian languages show different reflexes in different conditioning
environments remains under-explored. We employ a novel Bayesian approach
designed to overcome these problems and tease apart the different determinants
of irregularity in patterns of West Iranian sound change. Our methodology
allows us to provisionally resolve a number of outstanding questions in the
literature on West Iranian dialectology concerning the dialectal affiliation of
certain sound changes. We outline future directions for work of this sort.</span>

positivity bias, a tendency for people to report positive views of reality. But
what about the language used in negative reviews? Consistent with prior work,
we show that English negative reviews tend to contain more positive words than
negative words, using a variety of datasets. We reconcile this observation with
prior findings on the pragmatics of negation, and show that negations are
commonly associated with positive words in negative reviews. Furthermore, in
negative reviews, the majority of sentences with positive words express
negative opinions based on sentiment classifiers, indicating some form of
negation.</span>

multilingual Winograd Schema corpus by processing several datasets from prior
work within a standardized pipeline and measure cross-lingual generalization
ability in terms of out-of-sample performance. The method performs
competitively with recent supervised and unsupervised approaches for

small subset of attention heads for all studied languages, which provides
evidence of universal reasoning capabilities in multilingual encoders.</span>

(ASR), especially character-based models. With the combined choice of
characters from multiple languages, the outcome from character-based models
suffers from phoneme duplication, resulting in language-inconsistent spellings.
We propose Contextualized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CCTC) loss to
encourage spelling consistencies of a character-based non-autoregressive ASR
which allows for faster inference. The CCTC loss conditions the main prediction
on the predicted contexts to ensure language consistency in the spellings. In
contrast to existing CTC-based approaches, CCTC loss does not require
frame-level alignments, since the context ground truth is obtained from the
model&#x27;s estimated path. Compared to the same model trained with regular CTC
loss, our method consistently improved the ASR performance on both CS and

                                        <span>Event extraction is a fundamental task for natural language processing.
Finding the roles of event arguments like event participants is essential for
event extraction. However, doing so for real-life event descriptions is
challenging because an argument&#x27;s role often varies in different contexts.
While the relationship and interactions between multiple arguments are useful
for settling the argument roles, such information is largely ignored by
existing approaches. This paper presents a better approach for event extraction
by explicitly utilizing the relationships of event arguments. We achieve this
through a carefully designed task-oriented dialogue system. To model the
argument relation, we employ reinforcement learning and incremental learning to
extract multiple arguments via a multi-turned, iterative process. Our approach
leverages knowledge of the already extracted arguments of the same sentence to
determine the role of arguments that would be difficult to decide individually.
It then uses the newly obtained information to improve the decisions of
previously extracted arguments. This two-way feedback process allows us to
exploit the argument relations to effectively settle argument roles, leading to
better sentence understanding and event extraction. Experimental results show
that our approach consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art event
extraction methods for the classification of events and argument role and
argument identification.</span>

                                        <span>The attention module, which is a crucial component in Transformer, cannot
scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic complexity. Many works
focus on approximating the dot-then-exponentiate softmax function in the
original attention, leading to sub-quadratic or even linear-complexity
Transformer architectures. However, we show that these methods cannot be
applied to more powerful attention modules that go beyond the
dot-then-exponentiate style, e.g., Transformers with relative positional
encoding (RPE). Since in many state-of-the-art models, relative positional
encoding is used as default, designing efficient Transformers that can
incorporate RPE is appealing. In this paper, we propose a novel way to
accelerate attention calculation for Transformers with RPE on top of the
kernelized attention. Based upon the observation that relative positional
encoding forms a Toeplitz matrix, we mathematically show that kernelized
attention with RPE can be calculated efficiently using Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). With FFT, our method achieves $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time complexity.
Interestingly, we further demonstrate that properly using relative positional
encoding can mitigate the training instability problem of vanilla kernelized
attention. On a wide range of tasks, we empirically show that our models can be
trained from scratch without any optimization issues. The learned model
performs better than many efficient Transformer variants and is faster than
standard Transformer in the long-sequence regime.</span>

deletion, or substitution of a character, or the transposition of two adjacent
characters within a single word. Or, it can be the result of word boundary
problems that lead to run-on errors and incorrect-split errors. The traditional
N-gram correction methods can handle single-word errors effectively. However,
they show limitations when dealing with split and merge errors. In this paper,
we develop an unsupervised method that can handle both errors. The method we
develop leads to a sizable improvement in the correction rates. This tutorial
paper addresses very difficult word correction problems - namely incorrect

                                        <span>Atomic clauses are fundamental text units for understanding complex
sentences. Identifying the atomic sentences within complex sentences is
important for applications such as summarization, argument mining, discourse
analysis, discourse parsing, and question answering. Previous work mainly
relies on rule-based methods dependent on parsing. We propose a new task to
decompose each complex sentence into simple sentences derived from the tensed
clauses in the source, and a novel problem formulation as a graph edit task.
Our neural model learns to Accept, Break, Copy or Drop elements of a graph that
combines word adjacency and grammatical dependencies. The full processing
pipeline includes modules for graph construction, graph editing, and sentence
generation from the output graph. We introduce DeSSE, a new dataset designed to
train and evaluate complex sentence decomposition, and MinWiki, a subset of
MinWikiSplit. ABCD achieves comparable performance as two parsing baselines on
MinWiki. On DeSSE, which has a more even balance of complex sentence types, our
model achieves higher accuracy on the number of atomic sentences than an
encoder-decoder baseline. Results include a detailed error analysis.</span>

                                        <span>The growth rate in the amount of biomedical documents is staggering.
Unlocking information trapped in these documents can enable researchers and
practitioners to operate confidently in the information world. Biomedical NER,
the task of recognising biomedical names, is usually employed as the first step
of the NLP pipeline. Standard NER models, based on sequence tagging technique,
are good at recognising short entity mentions in the generic domain. However,
there are several open challenges of applying these models to recognise
biomedical names: 1) Biomedical names may contain complex inner structure
(discontinuity and overlapping) which cannot be recognised using standard
sequence tagging technique; 2) The training of NER models usually requires
large amount of labelled data, which are difficult to obtain in the biomedical
domain; and, 3) Commonly used language representation models are pre-trained on
generic data; a domain shift therefore exists between these models and target
biomedical data. To deal with these challenges, we explore several research
directions and make the following contributions: 1) we propose a
transition-based NER model which can recognise discontinuous mentions; 2) We
develop a cost-effective approach that nominates the suitable pre-training
data; and, 3) We design several data augmentation methods for NER. Our
contributions have obvious practical implications, especially when new
biomedical applications are needed. Our proposed data augmentation methods can
help the NER model achieve decent performance, requiring only a small amount of
labelled data. Our investigation regarding selecting pre-training data can
improve the model by incorporating language representation models, which are
pre-trained using in-domain data. Finally, our proposed transition-based NER
model can further improve the performance by recognising discontinuous
mentions.</span>

                                        <span>Most approaches to emotion analysis of social media, literature, news, and
other domains focus exclusively on basic emotion categories as defined by Ekman
or Plutchik. However, art (such as literature) enables engagement in a broader
range of more complex and subtle emotions. These have been shown to also
include mixed emotional responses. We consider emotions in poetry as they are
elicited in the reader, rather than what is expressed in the text or intended
by the author. Thus, we conceptualize a set of aesthetic emotions that are
predictive of aesthetic appreciation in the reader, and allow the annotation of
multiple labels per line to capture mixed emotions within their context. We
evaluate this novel setting in an annotation experiment both with carefully
trained experts and via crowdsourcing. Our annotation with experts leads to an
acceptable agreement of kappa &#x3D; .70, resulting in a consistent dataset for
future large scale analysis. Finally, we conduct first emotion classification
experiments based on BERT, showing that identifying aesthetic emotions is
challenging in our data, with up to .52 F1-micro on the German subset. Data and

However, the term explanation encompasses a broad range of notions, each with
different properties and ramifications. Our goal is to provide an overview of
diverse types of explanations and human limitations, and discuss implications
for collecting and using explanations in NLP. Inspired by prior work in
psychology and cognitive sciences, we group existing human explanations in NLP
into three categories: proximal mechanism, evidence, and procedure. These three
types differ in nature and have implications for the resultant explanations.
For instance, procedure is not considered explanations in psychology and
connects with a rich body of work on learning from instructions. The diversity
of explanations is further evidenced by proxy questions that are needed for
annotators to interpret and answer open-ended why questions. Finally,
explanations may require different, often deeper, understandings than
predictions, which casts doubt on whether humans can provide useful
explanations in some tasks.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a novel spoken-text-style conversion method that
can simultaneously execute multiple style conversion modules such as
punctuation restoration and disfluency deletion without preparing matched
datasets. In practice, transcriptions generated by automatic speech recognition
systems are not highly readable because they often include many disfluencies
and do not include punctuation marks. To improve their readability, multiple
spoken-text-style conversion modules that individually model a single
conversion task are cascaded because matched datasets that simultaneously
handle multiple conversion tasks are often unavailable. However, the cascading
is unstable against the order of tasks because of the chain of conversion
errors. Besides, the computation cost of the cascading must be higher than the
single conversion. To execute multiple conversion tasks simultaneously without
preparing matched datasets, our key idea is to distinguish individual
conversion tasks using the on-off switch. In our proposed zero-shot joint
modeling, we switch the individual tasks using multiple switching tokens,
enabling us to utilize a zero-shot learning approach to executing simultaneous
conversions. Our experiments on joint modeling of disfluency deletion and
punctuation restoration demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</span>

                                        <span>End-to-end models with auto-regressive decoders have shown impressive results
for automatic speech recognition (ASR). These models formulate the
sequence-level probability as a product of the conditional probabilities of all
individual tokens given their histories. However, the performance of locally
normalised models can be sub-optimal because of factors such as exposure bias.
Consequently, the model distribution differs from the underlying data
distribution. In this paper, the residual energy-based model (R-EBM) is
proposed to complement the auto-regressive ASR model to close the gap between
the two distributions. Meanwhile, R-EBMs can also be regarded as
utterance-level confidence estimators, which may benefit many downstream tasks.
Experiments on a 100hr LibriSpeech dataset show that R-EBMs can reduce the word
error rates (WERs) by 8.2%/6.7% while improving areas under precision-recall
curves of confidence scores by 12.6%/28.4% on test-clean/test-other sets.
Furthermore, on a state-of-the-art model using self-supervised learning
(wav2vec 2.0), R-EBMs still significantly improves both the WER and confidence
estimation performance.</span>

high-dimensional inputs from modalities as diverse as vision, audition, touch,
proprioception, etc. The perception models used in deep learning on the other
hand are designed for individual modalities, often relying on domain-specific
assumptions such as the local grid structures exploited by virtually all
existing vision models. These priors introduce helpful inductive biases, but
also lock models to individual modalities. In this paper we introduce the
Perceiver - a model that builds upon Transformers and hence makes few
architectural assumptions about the relationship between its inputs, but that
also scales to hundreds of thousands of inputs, like ConvNets. The model
leverages an asymmetric attention mechanism to iteratively distill inputs into
a tight latent bottleneck, allowing it to scale to handle very large inputs. We
show that this architecture is competitive with or outperforms strong,
specialized models on classification tasks across various modalities: images,
point clouds, audio, video, and video+audio. The Perceiver obtains performance
comparable to ResNet-50 and ViT on ImageNet without 2D convolutions by directly
attending to 50,000 pixels. It is also competitive in all modalities in
AudioSet.</span>

random latent vectors. Although manipulating the latent vectors controls the
synthesized outputs, editing real images with GANs suffers from i)
time-consuming optimization for projecting real images to the latent vectors,
ii) or inaccurate embedding through an encoder. We propose StyleMapGAN: the
intermediate latent space has spatial dimensions, and a spatially variant
modulation replaces AdaIN. It makes the embedding through an encoder more
accurate than existing optimization-based methods while maintaining the
properties of GANs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in various image manipulation
tasks such as local editing and image interpolation. Last but not least,
conventional editing methods on GANs are still valid on our StyleMapGAN. Source

                                        <span>A popular way to create detailed yet easily controllable 3D shapes is via
procedural modeling, i.e. generating geometry using programs. Such programs
consist of a series of instructions along with their associated parameter
values. To fully realize the benefits of this representation, a shape program
should be compact and only expose degrees of freedom that allow for meaningful
manipulation of output geometry. One way to achieve this goal is to design
higher-level macro operators that, when executed, expand into a series of
commands from the base shape modeling language. However, manually authoring
such macros, much like shape programs themselves, is difficult and largely
restricted to domain experts. In this paper, we present ShapeMOD, an algorithm
for automatically discovering macros that are useful across large datasets of
3D shape programs. ShapeMOD operates on shape programs expressed in an
imperative, statement-based language. It is designed to discover macros that
make programs more compact by minimizing the number of function calls and free
parameters required to represent an input shape collection. We run ShapeMOD on
multiple collections of programs expressed in a domain-specific language for 3D
shape structures. We show that it automatically discovers a concise set of
macros that abstract out common structural and parametric patterns that
generalize over large shape collections. We also demonstrate that the macros
found by ShapeMOD improve performance on downstream tasks including shape
generative modeling and inferring programs from point clouds. Finally, we
conduct a user study that indicates that ShapeMOD&#x27;s discovered macros make
interactive shape editing more efficient.</span>

                                        <span>Current out-of-distribution detection approaches usually present special
requirements (e.g., collecting outlier data and hyperparameter validation) and
produce side effects (classification accuracy drop and slow/inefficient
inferences). Recently, entropic out-of-distribution detection has been proposed
as a seamless approach (i.e., a solution that avoids all the previously
mentioned drawbacks). The entropic out-of-distribution detection solution
comprises the IsoMax loss for training and the entropic score for
out-of-distribution detection. The IsoMax loss works as a SoftMax loss drop-in
replacement because swapping the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss requires no
changes in the model&#x27;s architecture or training procedures/hyperparameters. In
this paper, we propose to perform what we call an isometrization of the
distances used in the IsoMax loss. Additionally, we propose to replace the
entropic score with the minimum distance score. Our experiments showed that
these simple modifications increase out-of-distribution detection performance
while keeping the solution seamless.</span>

patients where the annotated data is limited or unavailable. There have been
several attempts to use gradient-based attribution methods to localize
pathology from medical scans without using segmentation labels. This research
direction has been impeded by the lack of robustness and reliability. These
methods are highly sensitive to the network parameters. In this study, we
introduce a robust visual explanation method to address this problem for

for quantifying lesions in the lungs caused by the Covid-19 with high accuracy

shortage of medical resources. To aid and accelerate the diagnosis process,
automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 via deep learning models has recently been
explored by researchers across the world. While different data-driven deep
learning models have been developed to mitigate the diagnosis of COVID-19, the
data itself is still scarce due to patient privacy concerns. Federated Learning
(FL) is a natural solution because it allows different organizations to
cooperatively learn an effective deep learning model without sharing raw data.
However, recent studies show that FL still lacks privacy protection and may
cause data leakage. We investigate this challenging problem by proposing a
simple yet effective algorithm, named \textbf{F}ederated \textbf{L}earning
\textbf{o}n Medical Datasets using \textbf{P}artial Networks (FLOP), that
shares only a partial model between the server and clients. Extensive
experiments on benchmark data and real-world healthcare tasks show that our
approach achieves comparable or better performance while reducing the privacy
and security risks. Of particular interest, we conduct experiments on the
COVID-19 dataset and find that our FLOP algorithm can allow different hospitals
to collaboratively and effectively train a partially shared model without
sharing local patients&#x27; data.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, visual Transformer (ViT) and its following works abandon the
convolution and exploit the self-attention operation, attaining a comparable or
even higher accuracy than CNNs. More recently, MLP-Mixer abandons both the
convolution and the self-attention operation, proposing an architecture
containing only MLP layers. To achieve cross-patch communications, it devises
an additional token-mixing MLP besides the channel-mixing MLP. It achieves
promising results when training on an extremely large-scale dataset. But it
cannot achieve as outstanding performance as its CNN and ViT counterparts when
training on medium-scale datasets such as ImageNet1K and ImageNet21K. The
performance drop of MLP-Mixer motivates us to rethink the token-mixing MLP. We
discover that the token-mixing MLP is a variant of the depthwise convolution
with a global reception field and spatial-specific configuration. But the
global reception field and the spatial-specific property make token-mixing MLP
prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel pure MLP architecture,
spatial-shift MLP (S$^2$-MLP). Different from MLP-Mixer, our S$^2$-MLP only
contains channel-mixing MLP. We utilize a spatial-shift operation for
communications between patches. It has a local reception field and is
spatial-agnostic. It is parameter-free and efficient for computation. The
proposed S$^2$-MLP attains higher recognition accuracy than MLP-Mixer when
training on ImageNet-1K dataset. Meanwhile, S$^2$-MLP accomplishes as excellent
performance as ViT on ImageNet-1K dataset with considerably simpler

major bottleneck in medical imaging settings. Findings on natural images
suggest that deep neural models can show a strong textural bias when carrying
out image classification tasks. In this thorough empirical study, we draw
inspiration from findings on natural images and investigate ways in which
addressing the textural bias phenomenon could bring up the robustness of deep
segmentation models when applied to three-dimensional (3D) medical data. To
achieve this, publicly available MRI scans from the Developing Human Connectome
Project are used to study ways in which simulating textural noise can help
train robust models in a complex semantic segmentation task. We contribute an
extensive empirical investigation consisting of 176 experiments and illustrate
how applying specific types of simulated textural noise prior to training can
lead to texture invariant models, resulting in improved robustness when
segmenting scans corrupted by previously unseen noise types and levels.</span>

                                        <span>Current low-precision quantization algorithms often have the hidden cost of
conversion back and forth from floating point to quantized integer values. This
hidden cost limits the latency improvement realized by quantizing Neural
Networks. To address this, we present HAWQV3, a novel mixed-precision
integer-only quantization framework. The contributions of HAWQV3 are the
following: (i) An integer-only inference where the entire computational graph
is performed only with integer multiplication, addition, and bit shifting,
without any floating point operations or even integer division; (ii) A novel
hardware-aware mixed-precision quantization method where the bit-precision is
calculated by solving an integer linear programming problem that balances the
trade-off between model perturbation and other constraints, e.g., memory
footprint and latency; (iii) Direct hardware deployment and open source
contribution for 4-bit uniform/mixed-precision quantization in TVM, achieving
an average speed up of $1.45\times$ for uniform 4-bit, as compared to uniform
8-bit for ResNet50 on T4 GPUs; and (iv) extensive evaluation of the proposed
methods on ResNet18/50 and InceptionV3, for various model compression levels
with/without mixed precision. For ResNet50, our INT8 quantization achieves an
accuracy of $77.58\%$, which is $2.68\%$ higher than prior integer-only work,
and our mixed-precision INT4/8 quantization can reduce INT8 latency by $23\%$
and still achieve $76.73\%$ accuracy. Our framework and the TVM implementation
have been open sourced.</span>

learning applications, the optimality, reproducibility and cost of NAS schemes
remain hard to assess. In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS
(GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting
stability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by
importance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously
discovered top architectures, thus increasingly focusing on important parts of
a large search space. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adversarial learning
approach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on
rewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search
space without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments
show that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three
public NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search
constraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve
already optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet
and ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in
their original search space.</span>

facing downwards, we collected images of sea turtle carapace, each belonging to
one of sixteen Chelonia mydas juveniles. We then learned co-variant and robust
image descriptors from these images, enabling indexing and retrieval. In this
work, we presented several classification results of sea turtle carapaces using
the learned image descriptors. We found that a template-based descriptor, i.e.,
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) performed exceedingly better during
classification than keypoint-based descriptors. For our dataset, a
high-dimensional descriptor is a must due to the minimal gradient and color

                                        <span>Most existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems tend to overly rely on
language bias and hence fail to reason from the visual clue. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Language-Prior Feedback (LPF) objective function, to
re-balance the proportion of each answer&#x27;s loss value in the total VQA loss.
The LPF firstly calculates a modulating factor to determine the language bias
using a question-only branch. Then, the LPF assigns a self-adaptive weight to
each training sample in the training process. With this reweighting mechanism,
the LPF ensures that the total VQA loss can be reshaped to a more balanced
form. By this means, the samples that require certain visual information to
predict will be efficiently used during training. Our method is simple to
implement, model-agnostic, and end-to-end trainable. We conduct extensive
experiments and the results show that the LPF (1) brings a significant
improvement over various VQA models, (2) achieves competitive performance on
the bias-sensitive VQA-CP v2 benchmark.</span>

                                        <span>Recent work has shown that convolutional neural network classifiers overly
rely on texture at the expense of shape cues. We make a similar but different
distinction between shape and local image cues, on the one hand, and global
image statistics, on the other. Our method, called Permuted Adaptive Instance
Normalization (pAdaIN), reduces the representation of global statistics in the
hidden layers of image classifiers. pAdaIN samples a random permutation $\pi$
that rearranges the samples in a given batch. Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) is then applied between the activations of each (non-permuted) sample
$i$ and the corresponding activations of the sample $\pi(i)$, thus swapping
statistics between the samples of the batch. Since the global image statistics
are distorted, this swapping procedure causes the network to rely on cues, such
as shape or texture. By choosing the random permutation with probability $p$
and the identity permutation otherwise, one can control the effect&#x27;s strength.

With the correct choice of $p$, fixed apriori for all experiments and
selected without considering test data, our method consistently outperforms
baselines in multiple settings. In image classification, our method improves on
both CIFAR100 and ImageNet using multiple architectures. In the setting of
robustness, our method improves on both ImageNet-C and Cifar-100-C for multiple
architectures. In the setting of domain adaptation and domain generalization,
our method achieves state of the art results on the transfer learning task from
GTAV to Cityscapes and on the PACS benchmark.</span>

                                        <span>We present a method for estimating neural scenes representations of objects
given only a single image. The core of our method is the estimation of a
geometric scaffold for the object and its use as a guide for the reconstruction
of the underlying radiance field. Our formulation is based on a generative
process that first maps a latent code to a voxelized shape, and then renders it
to an image, with the object appearance being controlled by a second latent
code. During inference, we optimize both the latent codes and the networks to
fit a test image of a new object. The explicit disentanglement of shape and
appearance allows our model to be fine-tuned given a single image. We can then
render new views in a geometrically consistent manner and they represent
faithfully the input object. Additionally, our method is able to generalize to
images outside of the training domain (more realistic renderings and even real
photographs). Finally, the inferred geometric scaffold is itself an accurate
estimate of the object&#x27;s 3D shape. We demonstrate in several experiments the
effectiveness of our approach in both synthetic and real images.</span>

                                        <span>Reflecting on the last few years, the biggest breakthroughs in deep
reinforcement learning (RL) have been in the discrete action domain. Robotic
manipulation, however, is inherently a continuous control environment, but
these continuous control reinforcement learning algorithms often depend on
actor-critic methods that are sample-inefficient and inherently difficult to
train, due to the joint optimisation of the actor and critic. To that end, we
explore how we can bring the stability of discrete action RL algorithms to the
robot manipulation domain. We extend the recently released ARM algorithm, by
replacing the continuous next-best pose agent with a discrete next-best pose
agent. Discretisation of rotation is trivial given its bounded nature, while
translation is inherently unbounded, making discretisation difficult. We
formulate the translation prediction as the voxel prediction problem by
discretising the 3D space; however, voxelisation of a large workspace is memory
intensive and would not work with a high density of voxels, crucial to
obtaining the resolution needed for robotic manipulation. We therefore propose
to apply this voxel prediction in a coarse-to-fine manner by gradually
increasing the resolution. In each step, we extract the highest valued voxel as
the predicted location, which is then used as the centre of the
higher-resolution voxelisation in the next step. This coarse-to-fine prediction
is applied over several steps, giving a near-lossless prediction of the
translation. We show that our new coarse-to-fine algorithm is able to
accomplish RLBench tasks much more efficiently than the continuous control
equivalent, and even train some real-world tasks, tabular rasa, in less than 7
minutes, with only 3 demonstrations. Moreover, we show that by moving to a
voxel representation, we are able to easily incorporate observations from
multiple cameras.</span>

classification models, tagged by the community with the broader term supervised
learning. The extraordinary results gave rise to a hype loaded with ambitious
promises and overstatements. Soon the community realised that the success owed
much to the availability of thousands of labelled examples and supervised
learning went, for many, from glory to shame: Some criticised deep learning as
a whole and others proclaimed that the way forward had to be alternatives to
supervised learning: predictive, unsupervised, semi-supervised and, more
recently, self-supervised learning. However, all these seem brand names, rather
than actual categories of a theoretically grounded taxonomy. Moreover, the call
to banish supervised learning was motivated by the questionable claim that
humans learn with little or no supervision and are capable of robust
out-of-distribution generalisation. Here, we review insights about learning and
supervision in nature, revisit the notion that learning and generalisation are
not possible without supervision or inductive biases and argue that we will
make better progress if we just call it by its name.</span>

aiming to achieve high-generalization capability in cross-content, -resolution
and -frame rate quality prediction. In particular, we evaluate the quality of a
video by learning effective feature representations in spatial-temporal domain.
In the spatial domain, to tackle the resolution and content variations, we
impose the Gaussian distribution constraints on the quality features. The
unified distribution can significantly reduce the domain gap between different
video samples, resulting in a more generalized quality feature representation.
Along the temporal dimension, inspired by the mechanism of visual perception,
we propose a pyramid temporal aggregation module by involving the short-term
and long-term memory to aggregate the frame-level quality. Experiments show
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on cross-dataset
settings, and achieves comparable performance on intra-dataset configurations,
demonstrating the high-generalization capability of the proposed method.</span>

as RGB, thermal and hyperspectral cameras (among others), to make large scale
and rapid measurements of the physical properties of plants for the purpose of
better understanding the difference between crops and facilitating rapid plant
breeding programs. One of the most basic phenotyping tasks is to determine the
cultivar, or species, in a particular sensor product. This simple phenotype can
be used to detect errors in planting and to learn the most differentiating
features between cultivars. It is also a challenging visual recognition task,
as a large number of highly related crops are grown simultaneously, leading to
a classification problem with low inter-class variance. In this paper, we
introduce the Sorghum-100 dataset, a large dataset of RGB imagery of sorghum
captured by a state-of-the-art gantry system, a multi-resolution network
architecture that learns both global and fine-grained features on the crops,
and a new global pooling strategy called Dynamic Outlier Pooling which
outperforms standard global pooling strategies on this task.</span>

                                        <span>The subtleties of human perception, as measured by vision scientists through
the use of psychophysics, are important clues to the internal workings of
visual recognition. For instance, measured reaction time can indicate whether a
visual stimulus is easy for a subject to recognize, or whether it is hard. In
this paper, we consider how to incorporate psychophysical measurements of
visual perception into the loss function of a deep neural network being trained
for a recognition task, under the assumption that such information can enforce
consistency with human behavior. As a case study to assess the viability of
this approach, we look at the problem of handwritten document transcription.
While good progress has been made towards automatically transcribing modern
handwriting, significant challenges remain in transcribing historical
documents. Here we describe a general enhancement strategy, underpinned by the
new loss formulation, which can be applied to the training regime of any deep
learning-based document transcription system. Through experimentation, reliable
performance improvement is demonstrated for the standard IAM and RIMES datasets
for three different network architectures. Further, we go on to show
feasibility for our approach on a new dataset of digitized Latin manuscripts,
originally produced by scribes in the Cloister of St. Gall in the the 9th
century.</span>

the probability density function of data via a sequence of invertible
transformations. Yet, modeling long-range dependencies over normalizing flows
remains understudied. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce two types of
invertible attention mechanisms for generative flow models. To be precise, we
propose map-based and scaled dot-product attention for unconditional and
conditional generative flow models. The key idea is to exploit split-based
attention mechanisms to learn the attention weights and input representations
on every two splits of flow feature maps. Our method provides invertible
attention modules with tractable Jacobian determinants, enabling seamless
integration of it at any positions of the flow-based models. The proposed
attention mechanism can model the global data dependencies, leading to more
comprehensive flow models. Evaluation on multiple generation tasks demonstrates
that the introduced attention flow idea results in efficient flow models and
compares favorably against the state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional
generative flow methods.</span>

                                        <span>Designed to learn long-range interactions on sequential data, transformers
continue to show state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of tasks. In
contrast to CNNs, they contain no inductive bias that prioritizes local
interactions. This makes them expressive, but also computationally infeasible
for long sequences, such as high-resolution images. We demonstrate how
combining the effectiveness of the inductive bias of CNNs with the expressivity
of transformers enables them to model and thereby synthesize high-resolution
images. We show how to (i) use CNNs to learn a context-rich vocabulary of image
constituents, and in turn (ii) utilize transformers to efficiently model their
composition within high-resolution images. Our approach is readily applied to
conditional synthesis tasks, where both non-spatial information, such as object
classes, and spatial information, such as segmentations, can control the
generated image. In particular, we present the first results on
semantically-guided synthesis of megapixel images with transformers and obtain
the state of the art among autoregressive models on class-conditional ImageNet.

examples. Black-box attack is the most threatening attack. At present,
black-box attack methods mainly adopt gradient-based iterative attack methods,
which usually limit the relationship between the iteration step size, the
number of iterations, and the maximum perturbation. In this paper, we propose a
new gradient iteration framework, which redefines the relationship between the
above three. Under this framework, we easily improve the attack success rate of
DI-TI-MIM. In addition, we propose a gradient iterative attack method based on
input dropout, which can be well combined with our framework. We further
propose a multi dropout rate version of this method. Experimental results show
that our best method can achieve attack success rate of 96.2\% for defense
model on average, which is higher than the state-of-the-art gradient-based
attacks.</span>

temporal spans has not been fully explored. This is partially because that,
existing benchmark datasets were mainly collected with limited spatial and
temporal ranges, e.g., using videos recorded in a few days by cameras in a
specific region of the campus. Such limited spatial and temporal ranges make it
hard to simulate the difficulties of person re-ID in real scenarios. In this
work, we contribute a novel Large-scale Spatio-Temporal LaST person re-ID
dataset, including 10,862 identities with more than 228k images. Compared with
existing datasets, LaST presents more challenging and high-diversity re-ID
settings, and significantly larger spatial and temporal ranges. For instance,
each person can appear in different cities or countries, and in various time
slots from daytime to night, and in different seasons from spring to winter. To
our best knowledge, LaST is a novel person re-ID dataset with the largest
spatio-temporal ranges. Based on LaST, we verified its challenge by conducting
a comprehensive performance evaluation of 14 re-ID algorithms. We further
propose an easy-to-implement baseline that works well on such challenging re-ID
setting. We also verified that models pre-trained on LaST can generalize well
on existing datasets with short-term and cloth-changing scenarios. We expect
LaST to inspire future works toward more realistic and challenging re-ID tasks.

via powerful learned prior from the numerous external natural images. However,
they show unpleasant results on the test image whose distribution is far from
the that of training images because their models are biased toward the training
images. In this paper, we propose a simple image inpainting algorithm with
test-time adaptation named AdaFill. Given a single out-of-distributed test
image, our goal is to complete hole region more naturally than the pre-trained
inpainting models. To achieve this goal, we treat remained valid regions of the
test image as another training cues because natural images have strong internal
similarities. From this test-time adaptation, our network can exploit
externally learned image priors from the pre-trained features as well as the
internal prior of the test image explicitly. Experimental results show that
AdaFill outperforms other models on the various out-of-distribution test
images. Furthermore, the model named ZeroFill, that are not pre-trained also
sometimes outperforms the pre-trained models.</span>

                                        <span>Optical colonoscopy (OC), the most prevalent colon cancer screening tool, has
a high miss rate due to a number of factors, including the geometry of the
colon (haustral fold and sharp bends occlusions), endoscopist inexperience or
fatigue, endoscope field of view, etc. We present a framework to visualize the
missed regions per-frame during the colonoscopy, and provides a workable
clinical solution. Specifically, we make use of 3D reconstructed virtual
colonoscopy (VC) data and the insight that VC and OC share the same underlying
geometry but differ in color, texture and specular reflections, embedded in the
OC domain. A lossy unpaired image-to-image translation model is introduced with
enforced shared latent space for OC and VC. This shared latent space captures
the geometric information while deferring the color, texture, and specular
information creation to additional Gaussian noise input. This additional noise
input can be utilized to generate one-to-many mappings from VC to OC and OC to
OC. The code, data and trained models will be released via our Computational
Endoscopy Platform at https://github.com/nadeemlab/CEP.</span>

                                        <span>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) often trains and evaluates a large number of
architectures. Recent predictor-based NAS approaches attempt to address such
heavy computation costs with two key steps: sampling some
architecture-performance pairs and fitting a proxy accuracy predictor. Given
limited samples, these predictors, however, are far from accurate to locate top
architectures due to the difficulty of fitting the huge search space. This
paper reflects on a simple yet crucial question: if our final goal is to find
the best architecture, do we really need to model the whole space well?. We
propose a paradigm shift from fitting the whole architecture space using one
strong predictor, to progressively fitting a search path towards the
high-performance sub-space through a set of weaker predictors. As a key
property of the proposed weak predictors, their probabilities of sampling
better architectures keep increasing. Hence we only sample a few well-performed
architectures guided by the previously learned predictor and estimate a new
better weak predictor. This embarrassingly easy framework produces
coarse-to-fine iteration to refine the ranking of sampling space gradually.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method costs fewer samples to find
top-performance architectures on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, as well as
achieves the state-of-the-art ImageNet performance on the NASNet search space.
In particular, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) predictor-based NAS methods,
WeakNAS outperforms all of them with notable margins, e.g., requiring at least
7.5x less samples to find global optimal on NAS-Bench-101; and WeakNAS can also
absorb them for further performance boost. We further strike the new SOTA
result of 81.3% in the ImageNet MobileNet Search Space. The code is available
at https://github.com/VITA-Group/WeakNAS.</span>

                                        <span>Deep generative models have recently demonstrated the ability to synthesize
photorealistic images of human faces with novel identities. A key challenge to
the wide applicability of such techniques is to provide independent control
over semantically meaningful parameters: appearance, head pose, face shape, and
facial expressions. In this paper, we propose VariTex - to the best of our
knowledge the first method that learns a variational latent feature space of
neural face textures, which allows sampling of novel identities. We combine
this generative model with a parametric face model and gain explicit control
over head pose and facial expressions. To generate images of complete human
heads, we propose an additive decoder that generates plausible additional
details such as hair. A novel training scheme enforces a pose independent
latent space and in consequence, allows learning of a one-to-many mapping
between latent codes and pose-conditioned exterior regions. The resulting
method can generate geometrically consistent images of novel identities
allowing fine-grained control over head pose, face shape, and facial
expressions, facilitating a broad range of downstream tasks, like sampling
novel identities, re-posing, expression transfer, and more.</span>

                                        <span>Alongside the prevalence of mobile videos, the general public leans towards
consuming vertical videos on hand-held devices. To revitalize the exposure of
horizontal contents, we hereby set forth the exploration of automated
horizontal-to-vertical (abbreviated as H2V) video conversion with our proposed
H2V framework, accompanied by an accurately annotated H2V-142K dataset.
Concretely, H2V framework integrates video shot boundary detection, subject
selection and multi-object tracking to facilitate the subject-preserving
conversion, wherein the key is subject selection. To achieve so, we propose a
Rank-SS module that detects human objects, then selects the subject-to-preserve
via exploiting location, appearance, and salient cues. Afterward, the framework
automatically crops the video around the subject to produce vertical contents
from horizontal sources. To build and evaluate our H2V framework, H2V-142K
dataset is densely annotated with subject bounding boxes for 125 videos with
132K frames and 9,500 video covers, upon which we demonstrate superior subject
selection performance comparing to traditional salient approaches, and exhibit
promising horizontal-to-vertical conversion performance overall. By publicizing
this dataset as well as our approach, we wish to pave the way for more valuable
endeavors on the horizontal-to-vertical video conversion task.</span>

                                        <span>Fluorescence microscopy allows for a detailed inspection of cells, cellular
networks, and anatomical landmarks by staining with a variety of
carefully-selected markers visualized as color channels. Quantitative
characterization of structures in acquired images often relies on automatic
image analysis methods. Despite the success of deep learning methods in other
vision applications, their potential for fluorescence image analysis remains
underexploited. One reason lies in the considerable workload required to train
accurate models, which are normally specific for a given combination of
markers, and therefore applicable to a very restricted number of experimental
settings. We herein propose Marker Sampling and Excite, a neural network
approach with a modality sampling strategy and a novel attention module that
together enable (i) flexible training with heterogeneous datasets with
combinations of markers and (ii) successful utility of learned models on
arbitrary subsets of markers prospectively. We show that our single neural
network solution performs comparably to an upper bound scenario where an
ensemble of many networks is na\&quot;ively trained for each possible marker
combination separately. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of this
framework in high-throughput biological analysis by revising a recent
quantitative characterization of bone marrow vasculature in 3D confocal
microscopy datasets and further confirm the validity of our approach on an
additional, significantly different dataset of microvessels in fetal liver
tissues. Not only can our work substantially ameliorate the use of deep
learning in fluorescence microscopy analysis, but it can also be utilized in
other fields with incomplete data acquisitions and missing modalities.</span>

                                        <span>Cross-domain object detection is challenging, because object detection model
is often vulnerable to data variance, especially to the considerable domain
shift between two distinctive domains. In this paper, we propose a new Unbiased
Mean Teacher (UMT) model for cross-domain object detection. We reveal that
there often exists a considerable model bias for the simple mean teacher (MT)
model in cross-domain scenarios, and eliminate the model bias with several
simple yet highly effective strategies. In particular, for the teacher model,
we propose a cross-domain distillation method for MT to maximally exploit the
expertise of the teacher model. Moreover, for the student model, we alleviate
its bias by augmenting training samples with pixel-level adaptation. Finally,
for the teaching process, we employ an out-of-distribution estimation strategy
to select samples that most fit the current model to further enhance the
cross-domain distillation process. By tackling the model bias issue with these
strategies, our UMT model achieves mAPs of 44.1%, 58.1%, 41.7%, and 43.1% on
benchmark datasets Clipart1k, Watercolor2k, Foggy Cityscapes, and Cityscapes,
respectively, which outperforms the existing state-of-the-art results in
notable margins. Our implementation is available at

targeted images were taken from the actual paddy environment without special

rice diseases from the images. We developed an object detection model training

                                        <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained considerable attention
owing to their ability to reproduce images. However, they can recreate training
images faithfully despite image degradation in the form of blur, noise, and
compression, generating similarly degraded images. To solve this problem, the
recently proposed noise robust GAN (NR-GAN) provides a partial solution by
demonstrating the ability to learn a clean image generator directly from noisy
images using a two-generator model comprising image and noise generators.
However, its application is limited to noise, which is relatively easy to
decompose owing to its additive and reversible characteristics, and its
application to irreversible image degradation, in the form of blur,
compression, and combination of all, remains a challenge. To address these
problems, we propose blur, noise, and compression robust GAN (BNCR-GAN) that
can learn a clean image generator directly from degraded images without
knowledge of degradation parameters (e.g., blur kernel types, noise amounts, or
quality factor values). Inspired by NR-GAN, BNCR-GAN uses a multiple-generator
model composed of image, blur-kernel, noise, and quality-factor generators.
However, in contrast to NR-GAN, to address irreversible characteristics, we
introduce masking architectures adjusting degradation strength values in a
data-driven manner using bypasses before and after degradation. Furthermore, to
suppress uncertainty caused by the combination of blur, noise, and compression,
we introduce adaptive consistency losses imposing consistency between
irreversible degradation processes according to the degradation strengths. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of BNCR-GAN through large-scale comparative
studies on CIFAR-10 and a generality analysis on FFHQ. In addition, we
demonstrate the applicability of BNCR-GAN in image restoration.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate prediction of pedestrian and bicyclist paths is integral to the
development of reliable autonomous vehicles in dense urban environments. The
interactions between vehicle and pedestrian or bicyclist have a significant
impact on the trajectories of traffic participants e.g. stopping or turning to
avoid collisions. Although recent datasets and trajectory prediction approaches
have fostered the development of autonomous vehicles yet the amount of
vehicle-pedestrian (bicyclist) interactions modeled are sparse. In this work,
we propose Euro-PVI, a dataset of pedestrian and bicyclist trajectories. In
particular, our dataset caters more diverse and complex interactions in dense
urban scenarios compared to the existing datasets. To address the challenges in
predicting future trajectories with dense interactions, we develop a joint
inference model that learns an expressive multi-modal shared latent space
across agents in the urban scene. This enables our Joint-$\beta$-cVAE approach
to better model the distribution of future trajectories. We achieve state of
the art results on the nuScenes and Euro-PVI datasets demonstrating the
importance of capturing interactions between ego-vehicle and pedestrians
(bicyclists) for accurate predictions.</span>

during optical colonoscopy procedures. If segmented accurately, haustral folds
can allow for better estimation of missed surface and can also serve as
valuable landmarks for registering pre-treatment virtual (CT) and optical
colonoscopies, to guide navigation towards the anomalies found in pre-treatment
scans. We present a novel generative adversarial network, FoldIt, for
feature-consistent image translation of optical colonoscopy videos to virtual
colonoscopy renderings with haustral fold overlays. A new transitive loss is
introduced in order to leverage ground truth information between haustral fold
annotations and virtual colonoscopy renderings. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model on real challenging optical colonoscopy videos as
well as on textured virtual colonoscopy videos with clinician-verified haustral
fold annotations. All code and scripts to reproduce the experiments of this

                                        <span>The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread all over the world
since its first report in December 2019 and thoracic computed tomography (CT)
has become one of the main tools for its diagnosis. In recent years, deep
learning-based approaches have shown impressive performance in myriad image
recognition tasks. However, they usually require a large number of annotated
data for training. Inspired by Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), a common finding in
COIVD-19 patient&#x27;s CT scans, we proposed in this paper a novel self-supervised
pretraining method based on pseudo lesions generation and restoration for
COVID-19 diagnosis. We used Perlin noise, a gradient noise based mathematical
model, to generate lesion-like patterns, which were then randomly pasted to the
lung regions of normal CT images to generate pseudo COVID-19 images. The pairs
of normal and pseudo COVID-19 images were then used to train an encoder-decoder
architecture based U-Net for image restoration, which does not require any
labelled data. The pretrained encoder was then fine-tuned using labelled data
for COVID-19 diagnosis task. Two public COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of
CT images were employed for evaluation. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed self-supervised learning approach could extract
better feature representation for COVID-19 diagnosis and the accuracy of the
proposed method outperformed the supervised model pretrained on large scale
images by 6.57% and 3.03% on SARS-CoV-2 dataset and Jinan COVID-19 dataset,
respectively.</span>

                                        <span>The goal of this work is to characterize the representational impact that
foveation operations have for machine vision systems, inspired by the foveated
human visual system, which has higher acuity at the center of gaze and
texture-like encoding in the periphery. To do so, we introduce models
consisting of a first-stage \textit{fixed} image transform followed by a
second-stage \textit{learnable} convolutional neural network, and we varied the
first stage component. The primary model has a foveated-textural input stage,
which we compare to a model with foveated-blurred input and a model with
spatially-uniform blurred input (both matched for perceptual compression), and
a final reference model with minimal input-based compression. We find that: 1)
the foveated-texture model shows similar scene classification accuracy as the
reference model despite its compressed input, with greater i.i.d.
generalization than the other models; 2) the foveated-texture model has greater
sensitivity to high-spatial frequency information and greater robustness to
occlusion, w.r.t the comparison models; 3) both the foveated systems, show a
stronger center image-bias relative to the spatially-uniform systems even with
a weight sharing constraint. Critically, these results are preserved over
different classical CNN architectures throughout their learning dynamics.
Altogether, this suggests that foveation with peripheral texture-based
computations yields an efficient, distinct, and robust representational format
of scene information, and provides symbiotic computational insight into the
representational consequences that texture-based peripheral encoding may have
for processing in the human visual system, while also potentially inspiring the
next generation of computer vision models via spatially-adaptive computation.

diabetic patients. DR is a microvascular disease that affects the eye retina,
which causes vessel blockage and therefore cuts the main source of nutrition
for the retina tissues. Treatment for this visual disorder is most effective
when it is detected in its earliest stages, as severe DR can result in
irreversible blindness. Nonetheless, DR identification requires the expertise
of Ophthalmologists which is often expensive and time-consuming. Therefore,
automatic detection systems were introduced aiming to facilitate the
identification process, making it available globally in a time and
cost-efficient manner. However, due to the limited reliable datasets and
medical records for this particular eye disease, the obtained predictions
accuracies were relatively unsatisfying for eye specialists to rely on them as
diagnostic systems. Thus, we explored an ensemble-based learning strategy,
merging a substantial selection of well-known classification algorithms in one
sophisticated diagnostic model. The proposed framework achieved the highest
accuracy rates among all other common classification algorithms in the area. 4
subdatasets were generated to contain the top 5 and top 10 features of the
Messidor dataset, selected by InfoGainEval. and WrapperSubsetEval., accuracies

processing as a promising substitute of convolution-based neural networks for
visual learning tasks. However, its supremacy degenerates given an insufficient
amount of training data (e.g., ImageNet). To make it into practical utility, we
propose a novel distillation-based method to train vision transformers. Unlike
previous works, where merely heavy convolution-based teachers are provided, we
introduce lightweight teachers with different architectural inductive biases
(e.g., convolution and involution) to co-advise the student transformer. The
key is that teachers with different inductive biases attain different knowledge
despite that they are trained on the same dataset, and such different knowledge
compounds and boosts the student&#x27;s performance during distillation. Equipped
with this cross inductive bias distillation method, our vision transformers
(termed as CivT) outperform all previous transformers of the same architecture

                                        <span>Accurate detection of obstacles in 3D is an essential task for autonomous
driving and intelligent transportation. In this work, we propose a general
multimodal fusion framework FusionPainting to fuse the 2D RGB image and 3D
point clouds at a semantic level for boosting the 3D object detection task.
Especially, the FusionPainting framework consists of three main modules: a
multi-modal semantic segmentation module, an adaptive attention-based semantic
fusion module, and a 3D object detector. First, semantic information is
obtained for 2D images and 3D Lidar point clouds based on 2D and 3D
segmentation approaches. Then the segmentation results from different sensors
are adaptively fused based on the proposed attention-based semantic fusion
module. Finally, the point clouds painted with the fused semantic label are
sent to the 3D detector for obtaining the 3D objection results. The
effectiveness of the proposed framework has been verified on the large-scale
nuScenes detection benchmark by comparing it with three different baselines.
The experimental results show that the fusion strategy can significantly
improve the detection performance compared to the methods using only point
clouds, and the methods using point clouds only painted with 2D segmentation
information. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes testing benchmark.</span>

synthesis process of typical generative adversarial networks depends on
absolute pixel coordinates in an unhealthy manner. This manifests itself as,
e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces
of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that
causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals in the
network as continuous, we derive generally applicable, small architectural
changes that guarantee that unwanted information cannot leak into the
hierarchical synthesis process. The resulting networks match the FID of
StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they
are fully equivariant to translation and rotation even at subpixel scales. Our

reconstruction to estimate body surface from a sparse set of landmarks, so
called DeepMurf. We apply a denoising autoencoder to estimate missing
landmarks. Then we apply an attention model to estimate body joints from
landmarks. Finally, a cascading network is applied to regress parameters of a
statistical generative model that reconstructs body. Our set of proposed loss

                                        <span>Building instance segmentation models that are data-efficient and can handle
rare object categories is an important challenge in computer vision. Leveraging
data augmentations is a promising direction towards addressing this challenge.
Here, we perform a systematic study of the Copy-Paste augmentation ([13, 12])
for instance segmentation where we randomly paste objects onto an image. Prior
studies on Copy-Paste relied on modeling the surrounding visual context for
pasting the objects. However, we find that the simple mechanism of pasting
objects randomly is good enough and can provide solid gains on top of strong
baselines. Furthermore, we show Copy-Paste is additive with semi-supervised
methods that leverage extra data through pseudo labeling (e.g. self-training).
On COCO instance segmentation, we achieve 49.1 mask AP and 57.3 box AP, an
improvement of +0.6 mask AP and +1.5 box AP over the previous state-of-the-art.
We further demonstrate that Copy-Paste can lead to significant improvements on
the LVIS benchmark. Our baseline model outperforms the LVIS 2020 Challenge
winning entry by +3.6 mask AP on rare categories.</span>

desirable feature in tasks such as activity recognition and content-based video
retrieval. Reducing the search space into a finite set of action segments
facilitates a faster and less noisy matching. However, there exist a
substantial gap in machine understanding of natural temporal cuts during a
continuous human activity. This work reports on a novel gaze-based approach for
segmenting action segments in videos captured using an egocentric camera. Gaze
is used to locate the region-of-interest inside a frame. By tracking two simple
motion-based parameters inside successive regions-of-interest, we discover a
finite set of temporal cuts. We present several results using combinations (of
the two parameters) on a dataset, i.e., BRISGAZE-ACTIONS. The dataset contains
egocentric videos depicting several daily-living activities. The quality of the
temporal cuts is further improved by implementing two entropy measures.</span>

that deep learning is carried out in edge computing platforms. However, the
effectiveness of interpretability methods on these networks has not been
assessed.

In this paper, we compare the performance of several widely used saliency
map-based interpretabilty techniques (Gradient, SmoothGrad and GradCAM), when
applied to Binarized or Full Precision Neural Networks (FPNNs). We found that
the basic Gradient method produces very similar-looking maps for both types of
network. However, SmoothGrad produces significantly noisier maps for BNNs.
GradCAM also produces saliency maps which differ between network types, with
some of the BNNs having seemingly nonsensical explanations. We comment on
possible reasons for these differences in explanations and present it as an
example of why interpretability techniques should be tested on a wider range of
network types.</span>

                                        <span>The subject of &quot;fairness&quot; in artificial intelligence (AI) refers to assessing
AI algorithms for potential bias based on demographic characteristics such as
race and gender, and the development of algorithms to address this bias. Most
applications to date have been in computer vision, although some work in
healthcare has started to emerge. The use of deep learning (DL) in cardiac MR
segmentation has led to impressive results in recent years, and such techniques
are starting to be translated into clinical practice. However, no work has yet
investigated the fairness of such models. In this work, we perform such an
analysis for racial/gender groups, focusing on the problem of training data
imbalance, using a nnU-Net model trained and evaluated on cine short axis
cardiac MR data from the UK Biobank dataset, consisting of 5,903 subjects from
6 different racial groups. We find statistically significant differences in
Dice performance between different racial groups. To reduce the racial bias, we
investigated three strategies: (1) stratified batch sampling, in which batch
sampling is stratified to ensure balance between racial groups; (2) fair
meta-learning for segmentation, in which a DL classifier is trained to classify
race and jointly optimized with the segmentation model; and (3) protected group
models, in which a different segmentation model is trained for each racial
group. We also compared the results to the scenario where we have a perfectly
balanced database. To assess fairness we used the standard deviation (SD) and
skewed error ratio (SER) of the average Dice values. Our results demonstrate
that the racial bias results from the use of imbalanced training data, and that
all proposed bias mitigation strategies improved fairness, with the best SD and
SER resulting from the use of protected group models.</span>

an unexpected level. In the face of increasing data, the importance of data
processing has increased remarkably. Our resource topic is on the processing of
video data, which has an important place in increasing data, and the production
of summary videos. Within the scope of this resource, a new method for anomaly
detection with object-based unsupervised learning has been developed while
creating a video summary. By using this method, the video data is processed as
pixels and the result is produced as a video segment. The process flow can be
briefly summarized as follows. Objects on the video are detected according to
their type, and then they are tracked. Then, the tracking history data of the
objects are processed, and the classifier is trained with the object type.
Thanks to this classifier, anomaly behavior of objects is detected. Video
segments are determined by processing video moments containing anomaly
behaviors. The video summary is created by extracting the detected video
segments from the original video and combining them. The model we developed has
been tested and verified separately for single camera and dual camera systems.</span>

has mostly been driven by the search for the best performance in terms of
classification accuracy on standardized benchmarks like ImageNet. More
recently, this focus has been expanded by the notion of model robustness, i.e.
the generalization abilities of models towards previously unseen changes in the
data distribution. While new benchmarks, like ImageNet-C, have been introduced
to measure robustness properties, we argue that fixed testsets are only able to
capture a small portion of possible data variations and are thus limited and
prone to generate new overfitted solutions. To overcome these drawbacks, we
suggest to estimate the robustness of a model directly from the structure of
its learned feature-space. We introduce robustness indicators which are
obtained via unsupervised clustering of latent representations inside a trained
classifier and show very high correlations to the model performance on
corrupted test data.</span>

impairment and irreversible blindness in the working-age adults. Due to the
renaissance of deep learning (DL), DL-based DR diagnosis has become a promising
tool for the early screening and severity grading of DR. However, training deep
neural networks (DNNs) requires an enormous amount of carefully labeled data.
Noisy label data may be introduced when labeling plenty of data, degrading the
performance of models. In this work, we propose a novel label management
mechanism (LMM) for the DNN to overcome overfitting on the noisy data. LMM
utilizes maximum posteriori probability (MAP) in the Bayesian statistic and
time-weighted technique to selectively correct the labels of unclean data,
which gradually purify the training data and improve classification

demonstrated that LMM could boost performance of models and is superior to
three state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>In this paper, we present Vision Permutator, a conceptually simple and data
efficient MLP-like architecture for visual recognition. By realizing the
importance of the positional information carried by 2D feature representations,
unlike recent MLP-like models that encode the spatial information along the
flattened spatial dimensions, Vision Permutator separately encodes the feature
representations along the height and width dimensions with linear projections.
This allows Vision Permutator to capture long-range dependencies along one
spatial direction and meanwhile preserve precise positional information along
the other direction. The resulting position-sensitive outputs are then
aggregated in a mutually complementing manner to form expressive
representations of the objects of interest. We show that our Vision Permutators
are formidable competitors to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers. Without the dependence on spatial convolutions or attention
mechanisms, Vision Permutator achieves 81.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet without
extra large-scale training data (e.g., ImageNet-22k) using only 25M learnable
parameters, which is much better than most CNNs and vision transformers under
the same model size constraint. When scaling up to 88M, it attains 83.2% top-1
accuracy. We hope this work could encourage research on rethinking the way of
encoding spatial information and facilitate the development of MLP-like models.

remote sensing applications with optical images difficult or even impossible.
In this manuscript, a novel method for clouds-corrupted optical image
restoration has been presented and developed, based on a joint data fusion
paradigm, where three deep neural networks have been combined in order to fuse
spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series

EPIC-Kitchens 2021 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Challenge for Action
Recognition. The EPIC-Kitchens dataset is more difficult than other video
domain adaptation datasets due to multi-tasks with more modalities. Firstly, to
participate in the challenge, we employ a transformer to capture the spatial
information from each modality. Secondly, we employ a temporal attention module
to model temporal-wise inter-dependency. Thirdly, we employ the adversarial
domain adaptation network to learn the general features between labeled source
and unlabeled target domain. Finally, we incorporate multiple modalities to
improve the performance by a three-stream network with late fusion. Our network
achieves the comparable performance with the state-of-the-art baseline T$A^3$N
and outperforms the baseline on top-1 accuracy for verb class and top-5
accuracies for all three tasks which are verb, noun and action. Under the team
name xy9, our submission achieved 5th place in terms of top-1 accuracy for verb
class and all top-5 accuracies.</span>

                                        <span>One widely used approach towards understanding the inner workings of deep
convolutional neural networks is to visualize unit responses via activation
maximization. Feature visualizations via activation maximization are thought to
provide humans with precise information about the image features that cause a
unit to be activated. If this is indeed true, these synthetic images should
enable humans to predict the effect of an intervention, such as whether
occluding a certain patch of the image (say, a dog&#x27;s head) changes a unit&#x27;s
activation. Here, we test this hypothesis by asking humans to predict which of
two square occlusions causes a larger change to a unit&#x27;s activation. Both a
large-scale crowdsourced experiment and measurements with experts show that on
average, the extremely activating feature visualizations by Olah et al. (2017)
indeed help humans on this task ($67 \pm 4\%$ accuracy; baseline performance
without any visualizations is $60 \pm 3\%$). However, they do not provide any
significant advantage over other visualizations (such as e.g. dataset samples),
which yield similar performance ($66 \pm 3\%$ to $67 \pm 3\%$ accuracy). Taken
together, we propose an objective psychophysical task to quantify the benefit
of unit-level interpretability methods for humans, and find no evidence that
feature visualizations provide humans with better &quot;causal understanding&quot; than
simple alternative visualizations.</span>

                                        <span>Self-training based unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has shown great
potential to address the problem of domain shift, when applying a trained deep
learning model in a source domain to unlabeled target domains. However, while
the self-training UDA has demonstrated its effectiveness on discriminative
tasks, such as classification and segmentation, via the reliable pseudo-label
selection based on the softmax discrete histogram, the self-training UDA for
generative tasks, such as image synthesis, is not fully investigated. In this
work, we propose a novel generative self-training (GST) UDA framework with
continuous value prediction and regression objective for cross-domain image
synthesis. Specifically, we propose to filter the pseudo-label with an
uncertainty mask, and quantify the predictive confidence of generated images
with practical variational Bayes learning. The fast test-time adaptation is
achieved by a round-based alternative optimization scheme. We validated our
framework on the tagged-to-cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) synthesis
problem, where datasets in the source and target domains were acquired from
different scanners or centers. Extensive validations were carried out to verify
our framework against popular adversarial training UDA methods. Results show
that our GST, with tagged MRI of test subjects in new target domains, improved
the synthesis quality by a large margin, compared with the adversarial training
UDA methods.</span>

image (I2I) translation. However, due to the imbalance in the data, learning
joint distribution for various domains is still very challenging. Although
existing models can generate realistic target images, it&#x27;s difficult to
maintain the structure of the source image. In addition, training a generative
model on large data in multiple domains requires a lot of time and computer
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a novel image-to-image
translation method that generates images of the target domain by finetuning a
stylegan2 pretrained model. The stylegan2 model is suitable for unsupervised
I2I translation on unbalanced datasets; it is highly stable, produces realistic
images, and even learns properly from limited data when applied with simple
fine-tuning techniques. Thus, in this paper, we propose new methods to preserve
the structure of the source images and generate realistic images in the target
domain. The code and results are available at

characterizing patient blood samples. Automated methods to detect and classify
blood cell subtypes have important medical applications. Automated medical
image processing and analysis offers a powerful tool for medical diagnosis. In
this work we tackle the problem of white blood cell classification based on the
morphological characteristics of their outer contour, color. The work we would
explore a set of preprocessing and segmentation (Color-based segmentation,
Morphological processing, contouring) algorithms along with a set of features
extraction methods (Corner detection algorithms and Histogram of
Gradients(HOG)), dimensionality reduction algorithms (Principal Component
Analysis(PCA)) that are able to recognize and classify through various
Unsupervised(k-nearest neighbors) and Supervised (Support Vector Machine,
Decision Trees, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis,
Naive Bayes) algorithms different categories of white blood cells to
Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, and Neutrophil. We even take a step forwards
to explore various Deep Convolutional Neural network architecture (Sqeezent,
MobilenetV1,MobilenetV2, InceptionNet etc.) without preprocessing/segmentation
and with preprocessing. We would like to explore many algorithms to identify
the robust algorithm with least time complexity and low resource requirement.
The outcome of this work can be a cue to selection of algorithms as per
requirement for automated blood cell classification.</span>

                                        <span>Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) results from chronic remodeling caused by
a broad range of systemic and cardiovascular disease including hypertension,
aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and cardiac amyloidosis. Early
detection and characterization of LVH can significantly impact patient care but
is limited by under-recognition of hypertrophy, measurement error and
variability, and difficulty differentiating etiologies of LVH. To overcome this
challenge, we present EchoNet-LVH - a deep learning workflow that automatically
quantifies ventricular hypertrophy with precision equal to human experts and
predicts etiology of LVH. Trained on 28,201 echocardiogram videos, our model
accurately measures intraventricular wall thickness (mean absolute error [MAE]
1.4mm, 95% CI 1.2-1.5mm), left ventricular diameter (MAE 2.4mm, 95% CI
2.2-2.6mm), and posterior wall thickness (MAE 1.2mm, 95% CI 1.1-1.3mm) and
classifies cardiac amyloidosis (area under the curve of 0.83) and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (AUC 0.98) from other etiologies of LVH. In external datasets
from independent domestic and international healthcare systems, EchoNet-LVH
accurately quantified ventricular parameters (R2 of 0.96 and 0.90 respectively)
and detected cardiac amyloidosis (AUC 0.79) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(AUC 0.89) on the domestic external validation site. Leveraging measurements
across multiple heart beats, our model can more accurately identify subtle
changes in LV geometry and its causal etiologies. Compared to human experts,
EchoNet-LVH is fully automated, allowing for reproducible, precise
measurements, and lays the foundation for precision diagnosis of cardiac
hypertrophy. As a resource to promote further innovation, we also make publicly
available a large dataset of 23,212 annotated echocardiogram videos.</span>

                                        <span>Semantic segmentation from very fine resolution (VFR) urban scene images
plays a significant role in several application scenarios including autonomous
driving, land cover classification, and urban planning, etc. However, the
tremendous details contained in the VFR image severely limit the potential of
the existing deep learning approaches. More seriously, the considerable
variations in scale and appearance of objects further deteriorate the
representational capacity of those se-mantic segmentation methods, leading to
the confusion of adjacent objects. Addressing such is-sues represents a
promising research field in the remote sensing community, which paves the way
for scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision making. In this
manuscript, we pro-pose a bilateral awareness network (BANet) which contains a
dependency path and a texture path to fully capture the long-range
relationships and fine-grained details in VFR images. Specif-ically, the
dependency path is conducted based on the ResT, a novel Transformer backbone
with memory-efficient multi-head self-attention, while the texture path is
built on the stacked convo-lution operation. Besides, using the linear
attention mechanism, a feature aggregation module (FAM) is designed to
effectively fuse the dependency features and texture features. Extensive
experiments conducted on the three large-scale urban scene image segmentation
datasets, i.e., ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, ISPRS Potsdam dataset, and UAVid
dataset, demonstrate the effective-ness of our BANet. Specifically, a 64.6%
mIoU is achieved on the UAVid dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Low-rankness is important in the hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising tasks.
The tensor nuclear norm (TNN), defined based on the tensor singular value
decomposition, is a state-of-the-art method to describe the low-rankness of
HSI. However, TNN ignores some of the physical meanings of HSI in tackling the
denoising tasks, leading to suboptimal denoising performance. In this paper, we
propose the multi-modal and frequency-weighted tensor nuclear norm (MFWTNN) and
the non-convex MFWTNN for HSI denoising tasks. Firstly, we investigate the
physical meaning of frequency components and reconsider their weights to
improve the low-rank representation ability of TNN. Meanwhile, we also consider
the correlation among two spatial dimensions and the spectral dimension of HSI
and combine the above improvements to TNN to propose MFWTNN. Secondly, we use
non-convex functions to approximate the rank function of the frequency tensor
and propose the NonMFWTNN to relax the MFWTNN better. Besides, we adaptively
choose bigger weights for slices mainly containing noise information and
smaller weights for slices containing profile information. Finally, we develop
the efficient alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) based algorithm
to solve the proposed models, and the effectiveness of our models are
substantiated in simulated and real HSI datasets.</span>

long-term AR applications. Multi-agent cooperative SLAM is the precondition of
multi-user AR interaction. The cooperation of multiple smart phones has the
potential to improve efficiency and robustness of task completion and can
complete tasks that a single agent cannot do. However, it depends on robust
communication, efficient location detection, robust mapping, and efficient
information sharing among agents. We propose a multi-intelligence collaborative
monocular visual-inertial SLAM deployed on multiple ios mobile devices with a
centralized architecture. Each agent can independently explore the environment,
run a visual-inertial odometry module online, and then send all the measurement
information to a central server with higher computing resources. The server
manages all the information received, detects overlapping areas, merges and
optimizes the map, and shares information with the agents when needed. We have
verified the performance of the system in public datasets and real
environments. The accuracy of mapping and fusion of the proposed system is
comparable to VINS-Mono which requires higher computing resources.</span>

a labeled source domain to an unlabeled and unseen target domain, which is
usually trained on data from both domains. Access to the source domain data at
the adaptation stage, however, is often limited, due to data storage or privacy
issues. To alleviate this, in this work, we target source free UDA for
segmentation, and propose to adapt an &#x60;&#x60;off-the-shelf&quot; segmentation model
pre-trained in the source domain to the target domain, with an adaptive
batch-wise normalization statistics adaptation framework. Specifically, the
domain-specific low-order batch statistics, i.e., mean and variance, are
gradually adapted with an exponential momentum decay scheme, while the
consistency of domain shareable high-order batch statistics, i.e., scaling and
shifting parameters, is explicitly enforced by our optimization objective. The
transferability of each channel is adaptively measured first from which to
balance the contribution of each channel. Moreover, the proposed source free
UDA framework is orthogonal to unsupervised learning methods, e.g.,
self-entropy minimization, which can thus be simply added on top of our
framework. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 database show that our
source free UDA framework outperformed existing source-relaxed UDA methods for
the cross-subtype UDA segmentation task and yielded comparable results for the
cross-modality UDA segmentation task, compared with a supervised UDA methods
with the source data.</span>

increased interest in the Computer Vision community, especially due to its
broad use in a number of applications such as realistic 3D avatar creation,
pose invariant face recognition and face hallucination. Since the introduction
of the 3D Morphable Model in the late 90&#x27;s, we witnessed an explosion of
research aiming at particularly tackling this task. Nevertheless, despite the
increasing level of detail in the 3D face reconstructions from single images
mainly attributed to deep learning advances, finer and highly deformable
components of the face such as the tongue are still absent from all 3D face
models in the literature, although being very important for the realness of the
3D avatar representations. In this work we present the first, to the best of
our knowledge, end-to-end trainable pipeline that accurately reconstructs the
3D face together with the tongue. Moreover, we make this pipeline robust in
&quot;in-the-wild&quot; images by introducing a novel GAN method tailored for 3D tongue
surface generation. Finally, we make publicly available to the community the
first diverse tongue dataset, consisting of 1,800 raw scans of 700 individuals
varying in gender, age, and ethnicity backgrounds. As we demonstrate in an
extensive series of quantitative as well as qualitative experiments, our model
proves to be robust and realistically captures the 3D tongue structure, even in
adverse &quot;in-the-wild&quot; conditions.</span>

magnitudes less frequently than common ones, leading to highly-imbalanced data
where rare classes can have only handfuls of examples. Learning from few
examples is a known challenge for deep learning based classification
algorithms, and is the focus of the field of low-shot learning. One potential
approach to increase the training data for these rare classes is to augment the
limited real data with synthetic samples. This has been shown to help, but the
domain shift between real and synthetic hinders the approaches&#x27; efficacy when
tested on real data.

We explore the use of image-to-image translation methods to close the domain
gap between synthetic and real imagery for animal species classification in
data collected from camera traps: motion-activated static cameras used to
monitor wildlife. We use low-level feature alignment between source and target
domains to make synthetic data for a rare species generated using a graphics

                                        <span>Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) has attracted increasing attention recently
with the prevalence of sharing images on social networks. Since human emotions
are ambiguous and subjective, it is more reasonable to address VEA in a label
distribution learning (LDL) paradigm rather than a single-label classification
task. Different from other LDL tasks, there exist intrinsic relationships
between emotions and unique characteristics within them, as demonstrated in
psychological theories. Inspired by this, we propose a well-grounded
circular-structured representation to utilize the prior knowledge for visual
emotion distribution learning. To be specific, we first construct an Emotion
Circle to unify any emotional state within it. On the proposed Emotion Circle,
each emotion distribution is represented with an emotion vector, which is
defined with three attributes (i.e., emotion polarity, emotion type, emotion
intensity) as well as two properties (i.e., similarity, additivity). Besides,
we design a novel Progressive Circular (PC) loss to penalize the
dissimilarities between predicted emotion vector and labeled one in a
coarse-to-fine manner, which further boosts the learning process in an
emotion-specific way. Extensive experiments and comparisons are conducted on
public visual emotion distribution datasets, and the results demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                                        <span>Fetal motion is unpredictable and rapid on the scale of conventional MR scan
times. Therefore, dynamic fetal MRI, which aims at capturing fetal motion and
dynamics of fetal function, is limited to fast imaging techniques with
compromises in image quality and resolution. Super-resolution for dynamic fetal
MRI is still a challenge, especially when multi-oriented stacks of image slices
for oversampling are not available and high temporal resolution for recording
the dynamics of the fetus or placenta is desired. Further, fetal motion makes
it difficult to acquire high-resolution images for supervised learning methods.
To address this problem, in this work, we propose STRESS (Spatio-Temporal
Resolution Enhancement with Simulated Scans), a self-supervised
super-resolution framework for dynamic fetal MRI with interleaved slice
acquisitions. Our proposed method simulates an interleaved slice acquisition
along the high-resolution axis on the originally acquired data to generate
pairs of low- and high-resolution images. Then, it trains a super-resolution
network by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations in the MR time
series, which is used to enhance the resolution of the original data.
Evaluations on both simulated and in utero data show that our proposed method
outperforms other self-supervised super-resolution methods and improves image
quality, which is beneficial to other downstream tasks and evaluations.</span>

                                        <span>Although instance segmentation has made considerable advancement over recent
years, it&#x27;s still a challenge to design high accuracy algorithms with real-time
performance. In this paper, we propose a real-time instance segmentation
framework termed OrienMask. Upon the one-stage object detector YOLOv3, a mask
head is added to predict some discriminative orientation maps, which are
explicitly defined as spatial offset vectors for both foreground and background
pixels. Thanks to the discrimination ability of orientation maps, masks can be
recovered without the need for extra foreground segmentation. All instances
that match with the same anchor size share a common orientation map. This
special sharing strategy reduces the amortized memory utilization for mask
predictions but without loss of mask granularity. Given the surviving box
predictions after NMS, instance masks can be concurrently constructed from the
corresponding orientation maps with low complexity. Owing to the concise design
for mask representation and its effective integration with the anchor-based
object detector, our method is qualified under real-time conditions while
maintaining competitive accuracy. Experiments on COCO benchmark show that
OrienMask achieves 34.8 mask AP at the speed of 42.7 fps evaluated with a
single RTX 2080 Ti. The code is available at https://github.com/duwt/OrienMask.</span>

                                        <span>Federated Learning (FL) has become an active and promising distributed
machine learning paradigm. As a result of statistical heterogeneity, recent
studies clearly show that the performance of popular FL methods (e.g., FedAvg)
deteriorates dramatically due to the client drift caused by local updates. This
paper proposes a novel Federated Learning algorithm (called IGFL), which
leverages both Individual and Group behaviors to mimic distribution, thereby
improving the ability to deal with heterogeneity. Unlike existing FL methods,
our IGFL can be applied to both client and server optimization. As a
by-product, we propose a new attention-based federated learning in the server
optimization of IGFL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to
incorporate attention mechanisms into federated optimization. We conduct
extensive experiments and show that IGFL can significantly improve the
performance of existing federated learning methods. Especially when the
distributions of data among individuals are diverse, IGFL can improve the
classification accuracy by about 13% compared with prior baselines.</span>

                                        <span>Histological subtype of papillary (p) renal cell carcinoma (RCC), type 1 vs.
type 2, is an essential prognostic factor. The two subtypes of pRCC have a
similar pattern, i.e., the papillary architecture, yet some subtle differences,
including cellular and cell-layer level patterns. However, the cellular and
cell-layer level patterns almost cannot be captured by existing CNN-based
models in large-size histopathological images, which brings obstacles to
directly applying these models to such a fine-grained classification task. This
paper proposes a novel instance-based Vision Transformer (i-ViT) to learn
robust representations of histopathological images for the pRCC subtyping task
by extracting finer features from instance patches (by cropping around
segmented nuclei and assigning predicted grades). The proposed i-ViT takes
top-K instances as input and aggregates them for capturing both the cellular
and cell-layer level patterns by a position-embedding layer, a grade-embedding
layer, and a multi-head multi-layer self-attention module. To evaluate the
performance of the proposed framework, experienced pathologists are invited to
selected 1162 regions of interest from 171 whole slide images of type 1 and
type 2 pRCC. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better
performance than existing CNN-based models with a significant margin.</span>

learning. Our method maximizes the mutual information between the query
features and their label predictions for a given few-shot task, in conjunction
with a supervision loss based on the support set. We motivate our transductive
loss by deriving a formal relation between the classification accuracy and
mutual-information maximization. Furthermore, we propose a new
alternating-direction solver, which substantially speeds up transductive
inference over gradient-based optimization, while yielding competitive
accuracy. We also provide a convergence analysis of our solver based on
Zangwill&#x27;s theory and bound-optimization arguments. TIM inference is modular:
it can be used on top of any base-training feature extractor. Following
standard transductive few-shot settings, our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that TIM outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly across
various datasets and networks, while used on top of a fixed feature extractor
trained with simple cross-entropy on the base classes, without resorting to
complex meta-learning schemes. It consistently brings between 2 % and 5 %
improvement in accuracy over the best performing method, not only on all the
well-established few-shot benchmarks but also on more challenging scenarios,
with random tasks, domain shift and larger numbers of classes, as in the

                                        <span>Image denoising is of great importance for medical imaging system, since it
can improve image quality for disease diagnosis and downstream image analyses.
In a variety of applications, dynamic imaging techniques are utilized to
capture the time-varying features of the subject, where multiple images are
acquired for the same subject at different time points. Although
signal-to-noise ratio of each time frame is usually limited by the short
acquisition time, the correlation among different time frames can be exploited
to improve denoising results with shared information across time frames. With
the success of neural networks in computer vision, supervised deep learning
methods show prominent performance in single-image denoising, which rely on
large datasets with clean-vs-noisy image pairs. Recently, several
self-supervised deep denoising models have been proposed, achieving promising
results without needing the pairwise ground truth of clean images. In the field
of multi-image denoising, however, very few works have been done on extracting
correlated information from multiple slices for denoising using self-supervised
deep learning methods. In this work, we propose Deformed2Self, an end-to-end
self-supervised deep learning framework for dynamic imaging denoising. It
combines single-image and multi-image denoising to improve image quality and
use a spatial transformer network to model motion between different slices.
Further, it only requires a single noisy image with a few auxiliary
observations at different time frames for training and inference. Evaluations
on phantom and in vivo data with different noise statistics show that our
method has comparable performance to other state-of-the-art unsupervised or
self-supervised denoising methods and outperforms under high noise levels.</span>

fully exploit quantization benefits on Ampere GPU Tensor Cores. Specifically,
APNN-TC first incorporates a novel emulation algorithm to support arbitrary
short bit-width computation with int1 compute primitives and XOR/AND Boolean
operations. Second, APNN-TC integrates arbitrary precision layer designs to
efficiently map our emulation algorithm to Tensor Cores with novel batching
strategies and specialized memory organization. Third, APNN-TC embodies a novel
arbitrary precision NN design to minimize memory access across layers and
further improve performance. Extensive evaluations show that APNN-TC can
achieve significant speedup over CUTLASS kernels and various NN models, such as
ResNet and VGG.</span>

                                        <span>One of the distinct features of this century has been the population of older
adults which has been on a constant rise. Elderly people have several needs and
requirements due to physical disabilities, cognitive issues, weakened memory
and disorganized behavior, that they face with increasing age. The extent of
these limitations also differs according to the varying diversities in elderly,
which include age, gender, background, experience, skills, knowledge and so on.
These varying needs and challenges with increasing age, limits abilities of
older adults to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in an independent
manner. To add to it, the shortage of caregivers creates a looming need for
technology-based services for elderly people, to assist them in performing
their daily routine tasks to sustain their independent living and active aging.
To address these needs, this work consists of making three major contributions
in this field. First, it provides a rather comprehensive review of assisted
living technologies aimed at helping elderly people to perform ADLs. Second,
the work discusses the challenges identified through this review, that
currently exist in the context of implementation of assisted living services
for elderly care in Smart Homes and Smart Cities. Finally, the work also
outlines an approach for implementation, extension and integration of the
existing works in this field for development of a much-needed framework that
can provide personalized assistance and user-centered behavior interventions to
elderly as per their varying and ever-changing needs.</span>

recognized in crowd counting. Humans glance at a crowd image and instantly know
the approximate number of human and where they are through attention the crowd
regions and the congestion degree of crowd regions with a global receptive
filed. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel feedback network with
Region-Aware block called RANet by modeling human&#x27;s Top-Down visual perception
mechanism. Firstly, we introduce a feedback architecture to generate priority
maps that provide prior about candidate crowd regions in input images. The
prior enables the RANet pay more attention to crowd regions. Then we design
Region-Aware block that could adaptively encode the contextual information into
input images through global receptive field. More specifically, we scan the
whole input images and its priority maps in the form of column vector to obtain
a relevance matrix estimating their similarity. The relevance matrix obtained
would be utilized to build global relationships between pixels. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art crowd counting methods on several public datasets.</span>

success of object recognition and retrieval. Nowadays, as the embodiment of
innovation, the diversity of the industrial goods is significantly larger, in
which the incomplete multiview, multimodal and multilabel are different from
the traditional dataset. In this paper, we introduce an industrial goods
dataset, namely PatentNet, with numerous highly diverse, accurate and detailed
annotations of industrial goods images, and corresponding texts. In PatentNet,
the images and texts are sourced from design patent. Within over 6M images and
corresponding texts of industrial goods labeled manually checked by
professionals, PatentNet is the first ongoing industrial goods image database
whose varieties are wider than industrial goods datasets used previously for
benchmarking. PatentNet organizes millions of images into 32 classes and 219
subclasses based on the Locarno Classification Agreement. Through extensive
experiments on image classification, image retrieval and incomplete multiview
clustering, we demonstrate that our PatentNet is much more diverse, complex,
and challenging, enjoying higher potentials than existing industrial image
datasets. Furthermore, the characteristics of incomplete multiview, multimodal
and multilabel in PatentNet are able to offer unparalleled opportunities in the
artificial intelligence community and beyond.</span>

metrics but is bottlenecked on the ability to analyze enormous volumes of
information using human labor. Deep learning is widely viewed as a key
advancement to relieve this bottleneck. We identify one such domain, where deep
learning can be leveraged to alleviate the process of manual scoring. Novelty
preference paradigms have been widely used to study recognition memory in pigs,
but analysis of these videos requires human intervention. We introduce a subset
of such videos in the form of the &#x27;Pig Novelty Preference Behavior&#x27; (PNPB)
dataset that is fully annotated with pig actions and keypoints. In order to
demonstrate the application of state-of-the-art action recognition models on
this dataset, we compare LRCN, C3D, and TSM on the basis of various analytical
metrics and discuss common pitfalls of the models. Our methods achieve an
accuracy of 93% and a mean Average Precision of 96% in estimating piglet
behavior.

model onto non-annotated target domain in the absence of source data. However,
state-of-the-art methods for source free domain adaptation (SFDA) are subject
to strict limits: 1) access to internal specifications of source models is a
must; and 2) pseudo labels should be clean during self-training, making
critical tasks relying on semantic segmentation unreliable. Aiming at these
pitfalls, this study develops a domain adaptive solution to semantic
segmentation with pseudo label rectification (namely \textit{PR-SFDA}), which
operates in two phases: 1) \textit{Confidence-regularized unsupervised
learning}: Maximum squares loss applies to regularize the target model to
ensure the confidence in prediction; and 2) \textit{Noise-aware pseudo label
learning}: Negative learning enables tolerance to noisy pseudo labels in
training, meanwhile positive learning achieves fast convergence. Extensive
experiments have been performed on domain adaptive semantic segmentation
benchmark, \textit{GTA5 $\to$ Cityscapes}. Overall, \textit{PR-SFDA} achieves a
performance of 49.0 mIoU, which is very close to that of the state-of-the-art
counterparts. Note that the latter demand accesses to the source model&#x27;s
internal specifications, whereas the \textit{PR-SFDA} solution needs none as a
sharp contrast.</span>

technique to handle complex and practical problems. However, one of the
fundamental problems is the lack of formal methods to analyze their behavior.
To address this challenge, we propose an approach to compute the exact
reachable sets of a network given an input domain, where the reachable set is
represented by the face lattice structure. Besides the computation of reachable
sets, our approach is also capable of backtracking to the input domain given an
output reachable set. Therefore, a full analysis of a network&#x27;s behavior can be
realized. In addition, an approach for fast analysis is also introduced, which
conducts fast computation of reachable sets by considering selected sensitive
neurons in each layer. The exact pixel-level reachability analysis method is
evaluated on a CNN for the CIFAR10 dataset and compared to related works. The
fast analysis method is evaluated over a CNN CIFAR10 dataset and VGG16
architecture for the ImageNet dataset.</span>

images. So far, the geometry learned by neural volume rendering techniques was
modeled using a generic density function. Furthermore, the geometry itself was
extracted using an arbitrary level set of the density function leading to a
noisy, often low fidelity reconstruction. The goal of this paper is to improve
geometry representation and reconstruction in neural volume rendering. We
achieve that by modeling the volume density as a function of the geometry. This
is in contrast to previous work modeling the geometry as a function of the
volume density. In more detail, we define the volume density function as
Laplace&#x27;s cumulative distribution function (CDF) applied to a signed distance
function (SDF) representation. This simple density representation has three
benefits: (i) it provides a useful inductive bias to the geometry learned in
the neural volume rendering process; (ii) it facilitates a bound on the opacity
approximation error, leading to an accurate sampling of the viewing ray.
Accurate sampling is important to provide a precise coupling of geometry and
radiance; and (iii) it allows efficient unsupervised disentanglement of shape
and appearance in volume rendering. Applying this new density representation to
challenging scene multiview datasets produced high quality geometry
reconstructions, outperforming relevant baselines. Furthermore, switching shape
and appearance between scenes is possible due to the disentanglement of the
two.</span>

is not an exception. Having automatic item descriptions is of great interest
for fashion web platforms hosting sometimes hundreds of thousands of images.
This paper is one of the first tackling image captioning for fashion images. To
contribute addressing dataset diversity issues, we introduced the InFashAIv1
dataset containing almost 16.000 African fashion item images with their titles,
prices and general descriptions. We also used the well known DeepFashion
dataset in addition to InFashAIv1. Captions are generated using the
\textit{Show and Tell} model made of CNN encoder and RNN Decoder. We showed
that jointly training the model on both datasets improves captions quality for
African style fashion images, suggesting a transfer learning from Western style
data. The InFashAIv1 dataset is released on
\href{https://github.com/hgilles06/infashai}{Github} to encourage works with
more diversity inclusion.</span>

                                        <span>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is one of the primary tools to show
microstructural characterization of materials as well as film thickness.
However, manual determination of film thickness from TEM images is
time-consuming as well as subjective, especially when the films in question are
very thin and the need for measurement precision is very high. Such is the case
for head overcoat (HOC) thickness measurements in the magnetic hard disk drive
industry. It is therefore necessary to develop software to automatically
measure HOC thickness. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a HOC
layer segmentation method using NASNet-Large as an encoder and then followed by
a decoder architecture, which is one of the most commonly used architectures in
deep learning for image segmentation. To further improve segmentation results,
we are the first to propose a post-processing layer to remove irrelevant
portions in the segmentation result. To measure the thickness of the segmented
HOC layer, we propose a regressive convolutional neural network (RCNN) model as
well as orthogonal thickness calculation methods. Experimental results
demonstrate a higher dice score for our model which has lower mean squared
error and outperforms current state-of-the-art manual measurement.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks are behind many of the recent successes in machine
learning applications. However, these models can produce overconfident
decisions while encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) examples or making a
wrong prediction. This inconsistent predictive confidence limits the
integration of independently-trained learning models into a larger system. This
paper introduces separable concept learning framework to realistically measure
the performance of classifiers in presence of OOD examples. In this setup,
several instances of a classifier are trained on different parts of a partition
of the set of classes. Later, the performance of the combination of these
models is evaluated on a separate test set. Unlike current OOD detection
techniques, this framework does not require auxiliary OOD datasets and does not
separate classification from detection performance. Furthermore, we present a
new strong baseline for more consistent predictive confidence in deep models,
called fitted ensembles, where overconfident predictions are rectified by
transformed versions of the original classification task. Fitted ensembles can
naturally detect OOD examples without requiring auxiliary data by observing
contradicting predictions among its components. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN,
CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet show fitted ensemble significantly outperform
conventional ensembles on OOD examples and are possible to scale.</span>

                                        <span>Many learning-based 3D shape semantic segmentation methods assign labels to
shape atoms (e.g. points in a point cloud or faces in a mesh) with a
single-pass approach trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such methods achieve
impressive performance but require large amounts of labeled training data. This
paradigm entangles two separable subproblems: (1) decomposing a shape into
regions and (2) assigning semantic labels to these regions. We claim that
disentangling these subproblems reduces the labeled data burden: (1) region
decomposition requires no semantic labels and could be performed in an
unsupervised fashion, and (2) labeling shape regions instead of atoms results
in a smaller search space and should be learnable with less labeled training
data. In this paper, we investigate this second claim by presenting the
Neurally-Guided Shape Parser (NGSP), a method that learns how to assign
semantic labels to regions of an over-segmented 3D shape. We solve this problem
via MAP inference, modeling the posterior probability of a labeling assignment
conditioned on an input shape. We employ a Monte Carlo importance sampling
approach guided by a neural proposal network, a search-based approach made
feasible by assuming the input shape is decomposed into discrete regions. We
evaluate NGSP on the task of hierarchical semantic segmentation on manufactured
3D shapes from PartNet. We find that NGSP delivers significant performance
improvements over baselines that learn to label shape atoms and then aggregate
predictions for each shape region, especially in low-data regimes. Finally, we
demonstrate that NGSP is robust to region granularity, as it maintains strong
segmentation performance even as the regions undergo significant corruption.</span>

                                        <span>In this work, we propose a novel straightforward method for medical volume
and sequence segmentation with limited annotations. To avert laborious
annotating, the recent success of self-supervised learning(SSL) motivates the
pre-training on unlabeled data. Despite its success, it is still challenging to
adapt typical SSL methods to volume/sequence segmentation, due to their lack of
mining on local semantic discrimination and rare exploitation on volume and
sequence structures. Based on the continuity between slices/frames and the
common spatial layout of organs across volumes/sequences, we introduced a novel
bootstrap self-supervised representation learning method by leveraging the
predictable possibility of neighboring slices. At the core of our method is a
simple and straightforward dense self-supervision on the predictions of local
representations and a strategy of predicting locals based on global context,
which enables stable and reliable supervision for both global and local
representation mining among volumes. Specifically, we first proposed an
asymmetric network with an attention-guided predictor to enforce
distance-specific prediction and supervision on slices within and across
volumes/sequences. Secondly, we introduced a novel prototype-based
foreground-background calibration module to enhance representation consistency.
The two parts are trained jointly on labeled and unlabeled data. When evaluated
on three benchmark datasets of medical volumes and sequences, our model
outperforms existing methods with a large margin of 4.5\% DSC on ACDC, 1.7\% on
Prostate, and 2.3\% on CAMUS. Intensive evaluations reveals the effectiveness
and superiority of our method.</span>

                                        <span>Detailed analysis of seizure semiology, the symptoms and signs which occur
during a seizure, is critical for management of epilepsy patients. Inter-rater
reliability using qualitative visual analysis is often poor for semiological
features. Therefore, automatic and quantitative analysis of video-recorded
seizures is needed for objective assessment.

We present GESTURES, a novel architecture combining convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn deep
representations of arbitrarily long videos of epileptic seizures.

We use a spatiotemporal CNN (STCNN) pre-trained on large human action
recognition (HAR) datasets to extract features from short snippets (approx. 0.5
s) sampled from seizure videos. We then train an RNN to learn seizure-level
representations from the sequence of features.

We curated a dataset of seizure videos from 68 patients and evaluated
GESTURES on its ability to classify seizures into focal onset seizures (FOSs)
(N &#x3D; 106) vs. focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs) (N &#x3D; 77),
obtaining an accuracy of 98.9% using bidirectional long short-term memory
(BLSTM) units.

We demonstrate that an STCNN trained on a HAR dataset can be used in
combination with an RNN to accurately represent arbitrarily long videos of

However, currently OMR processing from various sheet music images still lacks
precision to be widely applicable. Here, we present an MMdA (Measure-based
Multimodal deep learning (DL)-driven Assembly) method allowing for end-to-end
OMR processing from various images including inclined photo images. Using this
method, measures are extracted by a deep learning model, aligned, and resized
to be used for inference of given musical symbol components by using multiple
deep learning models in sequence or in parallel. Use of each standardized
measure enables efficient training of the models and accurate adjustment of
five staff lines in each measure. Multiple musical symbol component category
models with a small number of feature types can represent a diverse set of
notes and other musical symbols including chords. This MMdA method provides a
solution to end-to-end OMR processing with precision.</span>

                                        <span>This paper jointly resolves two problems in vision transformer: i) the
computation of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) has high computational/space
complexity; ii) recent vision transformer networks are overly tuned for image
classification, ignoring the difference between image classification (simple
scenarios, more similar to NLP) and downstream scene understanding tasks
(complicated scenarios, rich structural and contextual information). To this
end, we note that pyramid pooling has been demonstrated to be effective in
various vision tasks owing to its powerful context abstraction, and its natural
property of spatial invariance is suitable to address the loss of structural
information (problem ii)). Hence, we propose to adapt pyramid pooling to MHSA
for alleviating its high requirement on computational resources (problem i)).
In this way, this pooling-based MHSA can well address the above two problems
and is thus flexible and powerful for downstream scene understanding tasks.
Plugged with our pooling-based MHSA, we build a downstream-task-oriented
transformer network, dubbed Pyramid Pooling Transformer (P2T). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that, when applied P2T as the backbone network, it
shows substantial superiority in various downstream scene understanding tasks
such as semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, and
visual saliency detection, compared to previous CNN- and transformer-based
networks. The code will be released at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/P2T. Note

attain the balance between exploration and exploitation. Due to the superior
performance and low feedback learning without the learning to act in multiple
situations, Multi-armed Bandits drawing widespread attention in applications
ranging such as recommender systems. Likewise, within the recommender system,
collaborative filtering (CF) is arguably the earliest and most influential
method in the recommender system. Crucially, new users and an ever-changing
pool of recommended items are the challenges that recommender systems need to
address. For collaborative filtering, the classical method is training the
model offline, then perform the online testing, but this approach can no longer
handle the dynamic changes in user preferences which is the so-called cold
start. So how to effectively recommend items to users in the absence of
effective information? To address the aforementioned problems, a multi-armed
bandit based collaborative filtering recommender system has been proposed,
named BanditMF. BanditMF is designed to address two challenges in the
multi-armed bandits algorithm and collaborative filtering: (1) how to solve the
cold start problem for collaborative filtering under the condition of scarcity
of valid information, (2) how to solve the sub-optimal problem of bandit
algorithms in strong social relations domains caused by independently
estimating unknown parameters associated with each user and ignoring
correlations between users.</span>

                                        <span>One of the key challenges in Sequential Recommendation (SR) is how to extract
and represent user preferences. Traditional SR methods rely on the next item as
the supervision signal to guide preference extraction and representation. We
propose a novel learning strategy, named preference editing. The idea is to
force the SR model to discriminate the common and unique preferences in
different sequences of interactions between users and the recommender system.
By doing so, the SR model is able to learn how to identify common and unique
user preferences, and thereby do better user preference extraction and
representation. We propose a transformer based SR model, named MrTransformer
(Multi-preference Transformer), that concatenates some special tokens in front
of the sequence to represent multiple user preferences and makes sure they
capture different aspects through a preference coverage mechanism. Then, we
devise a preference editing-based self-supervised learning mechanism for
training MrTransformer which contains two main operations: preference
separation and preference recombination. The former separates the common and
unique user preferences for a given pair of sequences. The latter swaps the
common preferences to obtain recombined user preferences for each sequence.
Based on the preference separation and preference recombination operations, we
define two types of SSL loss that require that the recombined preferences are
similar to the original ones, and the common preferences are close to each
other.

We carry out extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. MrTransformer
with preference editing significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods
in terms of Recall, MRR and NDCG. We find that long sequences whose user
preferences are harder to extract and represent benefit most from preference
editing.</span>

                                        <span>This paper proposes new acoustic feature signatures based on the multiscale
fractal dimension (MFD), which are robust against the diversity of
environmental sounds, for the content-based similarity search. The diversity of
sound sources and acoustic compositions is a typical feature of environmental
sounds. Several acoustic features have been proposed for environmental sounds.
Among them is the widely-used Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs),
which describes frequency-domain features. However, in addition to these
features in the frequency domain, environmental sounds have other important
features in the time domain with various time scales. In our previous paper, we
proposed enhanced multiscale fractal dimension signature (EMFD) for
environmental sounds. This paper extends EMFD by using the kernel density
estimation method, which results in better performance of the similarity search
tasks. Furthermore, it newly proposes another acoustic feature signature based
on MFD, namely very-long-range multiscale fractal dimension signature (MFD-VL).
The MFD-VL signature describes several features of the time-varying envelope
for long periods of time. The MFD-VL signature has stability and robustness
against background noise and small fluctuations in the parameters of sound
sources, which are produced in field recordings. We discuss the effectiveness
of these signatures in the similarity sound search by comparing with acoustic
features proposed in the DCASE 2018 challenges. Due to the unique
descriptiveness of our proposed signatures, we confirmed the signatures are
effective when they are used with other acoustic features.</span>

commonly observed in healthcare information systems. In this paper, we propose
an approach to detect redundant activity labels using control-flow relations
and numerical data values from event logs. Natural Language Processing is also
integrated into our method to assess semantic similarity between labels, which
provides users with additional insights. We have evaluated our approach through
synthetic logs generated from the real-life Sepsis log and a case study using
the MIMIC-III data set. The results demonstrate that our approach can
successfully detect redundant activity labels. This approach can add value to
the preprocessing step to generate more representative event logs for process
mining tasks in the healthcare domain.</span>

conferences commonly constitute the main platforms for releasing the latest

GraphConfRec, a conference recommender system which combines SciGraph and graph
neural networks, to infer suggestions based not only on title and abstract, but
also on co-authorship and citation relationships. GraphConfRec achieves a
recall@10 of up to 0.580 and a MAP of up to 0.336 with a graph attention

                                        <span>Machine learning models for the ad-hoc retrieval of documents and passages
have recently shown impressive improvements due to better language
understanding using large pre-trained language models. However, these
over-parameterized models are inherently non-interpretable and do not provide
any information on the parts of the documents that were used to arrive at a
certain prediction.

In this paper we introduce the select and rank paradigm for document ranking,
where interpretability is explicitly ensured when scoring longer documents.
Specifically, we first select sentences in a document based on the input query
and then predict the query-document score based only on the selected sentences,
acting as an explanation. We treat sentence selection as a latent variable
trained jointly with the ranker from the final output. We conduct extensive
experiments to demonstrate that our inherently interpretable select-and-rank
approach is competitive in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods and
sometimes even outperforms them. This is due to our novel end-to-end training
approach based on weighted reservoir sampling that manages to train the
selector despite the stochastic sentence selection. We also show that our
sentence selection approach can be used to provide explanations for models that
operate on only parts of the document, such as BERT.</span>

                                        <span>Atomic clauses are fundamental text units for understanding complex
sentences. Identifying the atomic sentences within complex sentences is
important for applications such as summarization, argument mining, discourse
analysis, discourse parsing, and question answering. Previous work mainly
relies on rule-based methods dependent on parsing. We propose a new task to
decompose each complex sentence into simple sentences derived from the tensed
clauses in the source, and a novel problem formulation as a graph edit task.
Our neural model learns to Accept, Break, Copy or Drop elements of a graph that
combines word adjacency and grammatical dependencies. The full processing
pipeline includes modules for graph construction, graph editing, and sentence
generation from the output graph. We introduce DeSSE, a new dataset designed to
train and evaluate complex sentence decomposition, and MinWiki, a subset of
MinWikiSplit. ABCD achieves comparable performance as two parsing baselines on
MinWiki. On DeSSE, which has a more even balance of complex sentence types, our
model achieves higher accuracy on the number of atomic sentences than an
encoder-decoder baseline. Results include a detailed error analysis.</span>

                                        <span>One widely used approach towards understanding the inner workings of deep
convolutional neural networks is to visualize unit responses via activation
maximization. Feature visualizations via activation maximization are thought to
provide humans with precise information about the image features that cause a
unit to be activated. If this is indeed true, these synthetic images should
enable humans to predict the effect of an intervention, such as whether
occluding a certain patch of the image (say, a dog&#x27;s head) changes a unit&#x27;s
activation. Here, we test this hypothesis by asking humans to predict which of
two square occlusions causes a larger change to a unit&#x27;s activation. Both a
large-scale crowdsourced experiment and measurements with experts show that on
average, the extremely activating feature visualizations by Olah et al. (2017)
indeed help humans on this task ($67 \pm 4\%$ accuracy; baseline performance
without any visualizations is $60 \pm 3\%$). However, they do not provide any
significant advantage over other visualizations (such as e.g. dataset samples),
which yield similar performance ($66 \pm 3\%$ to $67 \pm 3\%$ accuracy). Taken
together, we propose an objective psychophysical task to quantify the benefit
of unit-level interpretability methods for humans, and find no evidence that
feature visualizations provide humans with better &quot;causal understanding&quot; than
simple alternative visualizations.</span>

                                        <span>Many learning-based 3D shape semantic segmentation methods assign labels to
shape atoms (e.g. points in a point cloud or faces in a mesh) with a
single-pass approach trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such methods achieve
impressive performance but require large amounts of labeled training data. This
paradigm entangles two separable subproblems: (1) decomposing a shape into
regions and (2) assigning semantic labels to these regions. We claim that
disentangling these subproblems reduces the labeled data burden: (1) region
decomposition requires no semantic labels and could be performed in an
unsupervised fashion, and (2) labeling shape regions instead of atoms results
in a smaller search space and should be learnable with less labeled training
data. In this paper, we investigate this second claim by presenting the
Neurally-Guided Shape Parser (NGSP), a method that learns how to assign
semantic labels to regions of an over-segmented 3D shape. We solve this problem
via MAP inference, modeling the posterior probability of a labeling assignment
conditioned on an input shape. We employ a Monte Carlo importance sampling
approach guided by a neural proposal network, a search-based approach made
feasible by assuming the input shape is decomposed into discrete regions. We
evaluate NGSP on the task of hierarchical semantic segmentation on manufactured
3D shapes from PartNet. We find that NGSP delivers significant performance
improvements over baselines that learn to label shape atoms and then aggregate
predictions for each shape region, especially in low-data regimes. Finally, we
demonstrate that NGSP is robust to region granularity, as it maintains strong
segmentation performance even as the regions undergo significant corruption.</span>

heavy computation costs with two key steps: sampling some

limited samples, these predictors, however, are far from accurate to locate top
architectures due to the difficulty of fitting the huge search space. This
paper reflects on a simple yet crucial question: if our final goal is to find
the best architecture, do we really need to model the whole space well?. We
propose a paradigm shift from fitting the whole architecture space using one
strong predictor, to progressively fitting a search path towards the
high-performance sub-space through a set of weaker predictors. As a key
property of the proposed weak predictors, their probabilities of sampling
better architectures keep increasing. Hence we only sample a few well-performed
architectures guided by the previously learned predictor and estimate a new
better weak predictor. This embarrassingly easy framework produces
coarse-to-fine iteration to refine the ranking of sampling space gradually.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method costs fewer samples to find
top-performance architectures on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, as well as
achieves the state-of-the-art ImageNet performance on the NASNet search space.
In particular, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) predictor-based NAS methods,
WeakNAS outperforms all of them with notable margins, e.g., requiring at least
7.5x less samples to find global optimal on NAS-Bench-101; and WeakNAS can also
absorb them for further performance boost. We further strike the new SOTA
result of 81.3% in the ImageNet MobileNet Search Space. The code is available

online learning problem. To develop more statistically-efficient algorithms, we
propose to use the assumption of a random-effect model. In this model, the mean
rewards of arms are drawn independently from an unknown distribution, whose
parameters we estimate. We provide an estimator of the arm means in this model
and also analyze its uncertainty. Based on these results, we design a UCB

on its $n$-round regret, which matches an existing lower bound. Our experiments
show that ReUCB can outperform Thompson sampling in various scenarios, without

stochastic shortest path (SSP) and bound their regret over $K$ episodes. When
all stationary policies are proper, our first algorithm obtains sublinear
regret ($K^{3/4}$), is computationally efficient, and uses stationary policies.
This is the first LFA algorithm with these three properties, to the best of our

of a more general one, which has $\sqrt{K}$ regret for general features given

identically distributed random variables with which the original time series
has a causal representation. The innovation at a time is statistically
independent of the prior history of the time series. As such, it represents the
new information contained at present but not in the past. Because of its simple
probability structure, an innovations sequence is the most efficient signature
of the original. Unlike the principle or independent analysis (PCA/ICA)
representations, an innovations sequence preserves not only the complete
statistical properties but also the temporal order of the original time series.
An long-standing open problem is to find a computationally tractable way to
extract an innovations sequence of non-Gaussian processes. This paper presents
a deep learning approach, referred to as Innovations Autoencoder (IAE), that
extracts innovations sequences using a causal convolutional neural network. An
application of IAE to nonparametric anomaly detection with unknown anomaly and

                                        <span>In Federated edge learning (FEEL), energy-constrained devices at the network
edge consume significant energy when training and uploading their local machine
learning models, leading to a decrease in their lifetime. This work proposes
novel solutions for energy-efficient FEEL by jointly considering local training
data, available computation, and communications resources, and deadline
constraints of FEEL rounds to reduce energy consumption. This paper considers a
system model where the edge server is equipped with multiple antennas employing
beamforming techniques to communicate with the local users through orthogonal
channels. Specifically, we consider a problem that aims to find the optimal
user&#x27;s resources, including the fine-grained selection of relevant training
samples, bandwidth, transmission power, beamforming weights, and processing
speed with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption given a deadline
constraint on the communication rounds of FEEL. Then, we devise tractable
solutions by first proposing a novel fine-grained training algorithm that
excludes less relevant training samples and effectively chooses only the
samples that improve the model&#x27;s performance. After that, we derive closed-form
solutions, followed by a Golden-Section-based iterative algorithm to find the
optimal computation and communication resources that minimize energy
consumption. Experiments using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our
proposed algorithms considerably outperform the state-of-the-art solutions as
energy consumption decreases by 79% for MNIST and 73% for CIFAR-10 datasets.</span>

processing as a promising substitute of convolution-based neural networks for
visual learning tasks. However, its supremacy degenerates given an insufficient
amount of training data (e.g., ImageNet). To make it into practical utility, we
propose a novel distillation-based method to train vision transformers. Unlike
previous works, where merely heavy convolution-based teachers are provided, we
introduce lightweight teachers with different architectural inductive biases
(e.g., convolution and involution) to co-advise the student transformer. The
key is that teachers with different inductive biases attain different knowledge
despite that they are trained on the same dataset, and such different knowledge
compounds and boosts the student&#x27;s performance during distillation. Equipped
with this cross inductive bias distillation method, our vision transformers
(termed as CivT) outperform all previous transformers of the same architecture

utilized to measure the innovation of the data points. We study the Innovation

for languages other than English. Pretrained cross-lingual models are a source
of powerful language-agnostic representations, yet their inherent reasoning
capabilities are still actively studied. In this work, we design a simple

work within a standardized pipeline and measure cross-lingual generalization
ability in terms of out-of-sample performance. The method performs
competitively with recent supervised and unsupervised approaches for
commonsense reasoning, even when applied to other languages in a zero-shot

                                        <span>This paper considers quantized distributed optimization algorithms in the
parameter server framework of distributed training. We introduce the principle
we call Differential Quantization (DQ) that prescribes that the past
quantization errors should be compensated in such a way as to direct the
descent trajectory of a quantized algorithm towards that of its unquantized
counterpart. Assuming that the objective function is smooth and strongly
convex, we prove that in the limit of large problem dimension, Differentially
Quantized Gradient Descent (DQ-GD) attains a linear contraction factor of
$\max\{\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}, 2^{-R}\}$, where $\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}$ is the
contraction factor of unquantized gradient descent (GD). Thus at any
$R\geq\log_2 1 /\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}$ bits, the contraction factor of DQ-GD is
the same as that of unquantized GD, i.e., there is no loss due to quantization.
We show a converse demonstrating that no quantized gradient descent algorithm
can converge faster than $\max\{\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}, 2^{-R}\}$. In contrast,
naively quantized GD where the worker directly quantizes the gradient barely
attains $\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}} + 2^{-R}$. The principle of differential
quantization continues to apply to gradient methods with momentum such as
Nesterov&#x27;s accelerated gradient descent, and Polyak&#x27;s heavy ball method. For
these algorithms as well, if the rate is above a certain threshold, there is no
loss in contraction factor obtained by the differentially quantized algorithm
compared to its unquantized counterpart, and furthermore, the differentially
quantized heavy ball method attains the optimal contraction achievable among
all (even unquantized) gradient methods. Experimental results on both simulated
and real-world least-squares problems validate our theoretical analysis.</span>

language processing (NLP) to a new era. In this survey, we provide a
comprehensive review of PTMs for NLP. We first briefly introduce language
representation learning and its research progress. Then we systematically
categorize existing PTMs based on a taxonomy with four perspectives. Next, we
describe how to adapt the knowledge of PTMs to the downstream tasks. Finally,
we outline some potential directions of PTMs for future research. This survey
is purposed to be a hands-on guide for understanding, using, and developing
PTMs for various NLP tasks.</span>

                                        <span>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), more specifically their Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) variants, have been widely used as a deep learning tool for
tackling sequence-based learning tasks in text and speech. Training of such
LSTM applications is computationally intensive due to the recurrent nature of
hidden state computation that repeats for each time step. While sparsity in
Deep Neural Nets has been widely seen as an opportunity for reducing
computation time in both training and inference phases, the usage of non-ReLU
activation in LSTM RNNs renders the opportunities for such dynamic sparsity
associated with neuron activation and gradient values to be limited or
non-existent. In this work, we identify dropout induced sparsity for LSTMs as a
suitable mode of computation reduction. Dropout is a widely used regularization
mechanism, which randomly drops computed neuron values during each iteration of
training. We propose to structure dropout patterns, by dropping out the same
set of physical neurons within a batch, resulting in column (row) level hidden
state sparsity, which are well amenable to computation reduction at run-time in
general-purpose SIMD hardware as well as systolic arrays. We conduct our
experiments for three representative NLP tasks: language modelling on the PTB
dataset, OpenNMT based machine translation using the IWSLT De-En and En-Vi
datasets, and named entity recognition sequence labelling using the CoNLL-2003
shared task. We demonstrate that our proposed approach can be used to translate
dropout-based computation reduction into reduced training time, with
improvement ranging from 1.23x to 1.64x, without sacrificing the target metric.</span>

                                        <span>In many sequential decision-making problems (e.g., robotics control, game
playing, sequential prediction), human or expert data is available containing
useful information about the task. However, imitation learning (IL) from a
small amount of expert data can be challenging in high-dimensional environments
with complex dynamics. Behavioral cloning is a simple method that is widely
used due to its simplicity of implementation and stable convergence but doesn&#x27;t
utilize any information involving the environment&#x27;s dynamics. Many existing
methods that exploit dynamics information are difficult to train in practice
due to an adversarial optimization process over reward and policy approximators
or biased, high variance gradient estimators. We introduce a method for
dynamics-aware IL which avoids adversarial training by learning a single
Q-function, implicitly representing both reward and policy. On standard
benchmarks, the implicitly learned rewards show a high positive correlation
with the ground-truth rewards, illustrating our method can also be used for
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Our method, Inverse soft-Q learning
(IQ-Learn) obtains state-of-the-art results in offline and online imitation
learning settings, surpassing existing methods both in the number of required
environment interactions and scalability in high-dimensional spaces.</span>

                                        <span>As predictive models are deployed into the real world, they must increasingly
contend with strategic behavior. A growing body of work on strategic
classification treats this problem as a Stackelberg game: the decision-maker
&quot;leads&quot; in the game by deploying a model, and the strategic agents &quot;follow&quot; by
playing their best response to the deployed model. Importantly, in this
framing, the burden of learning is placed solely on the decision-maker, while
the agents&#x27; best responses are implicitly treated as instantaneous. In this
work, we argue that the order of play in strategic classification is
fundamentally determined by the relative frequencies at which the
decision-maker and the agents adapt to each other&#x27;s actions. In particular, by
generalizing the standard model to allow both players to learn over time, we
show that a decision-maker that makes updates faster than the agents can
reverse the order of play, meaning that the agents lead and the decision-maker
follows. We observe in standard learning settings that such a role reversal can
be desirable for both the decision-maker and the strategic agents. Finally, we
show that a decision-maker with the freedom to choose their update frequency
can induce learning dynamics that converge to Stackelberg equilibria with
either order of play.</span>

                                        <span>We investigate the adversarial robustness of CNNs from the perspective of
channel-wise activations. By comparing \textit{non-robust} (normally trained)
and \textit{robustified} (adversarially trained) models, we observe that
adversarial training (AT) robustifies CNNs by aligning the channel-wise
activations of adversarial data with those of their natural counterparts.
However, the channels that are \textit{negatively-relevant} (NR) to predictions
are still over-activated when processing adversarial data. Besides, we also
observe that AT does not result in similar robustness for all classes. For the
robust classes, channels with larger activation magnitudes are usually more
\textit{positively-relevant} (PR) to predictions, but this alignment does not
hold for the non-robust classes. Given these observations, we hypothesize that
suppressing NR channels and aligning PR ones with their relevances further
enhances the robustness of CNNs under AT. To examine this hypothesis, we
introduce a novel mechanism, i.e., \underline{C}hannel-wise
\underline{I}mportance-based \underline{F}eature \underline{S}election (CIFS).
The CIFS manipulates channels&#x27; activations of certain layers by generating
non-negative multipliers to these channels based on their relevances to
predictions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR10 and
SVHN clearly verify the hypothesis and CIFS&#x27;s effectiveness of robustifying
CNNs.</span>

                                        <span>Accurate prediction of pedestrian and bicyclist paths is integral to the
development of reliable autonomous vehicles in dense urban environments. The
interactions between vehicle and pedestrian or bicyclist have a significant
impact on the trajectories of traffic participants e.g. stopping or turning to
avoid collisions. Although recent datasets and trajectory prediction approaches
have fostered the development of autonomous vehicles yet the amount of
vehicle-pedestrian (bicyclist) interactions modeled are sparse. In this work,
we propose Euro-PVI, a dataset of pedestrian and bicyclist trajectories. In
particular, our dataset caters more diverse and complex interactions in dense
urban scenarios compared to the existing datasets. To address the challenges in
predicting future trajectories with dense interactions, we develop a joint
inference model that learns an expressive multi-modal shared latent space
across agents in the urban scene. This enables our Joint-$\beta$-cVAE approach
to better model the distribution of future trajectories. We achieve state of
the art results on the nuScenes and Euro-PVI datasets demonstrating the
importance of capturing interactions between ego-vehicle and pedestrians
(bicyclists) for accurate predictions.</span>

noise model and only until recently has near-optimal noise tolerance bound been
established under the mild condition that the unlabeled data distribution is

of a matrix Chernoff-type inequality to bound the spectrum of an empirical
covariance matrix for well-behaved distributions, in conjunction with a careful
exploration of the localization schemes of Awasthi~et~al.~(2017). We further
extend the algorithm and analysis to the more general and stronger nasty noise

                                        <span>Recently, bound propagation based certified robust training methods have been
proposed for training neural networks with certifiable robustness guarantees.
Despite that state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods including interval bound
propagation (IBP) and CROWN-IBP have per-batch training complexity similar to
standard neural network training, they usually use a long warmup schedule with
hundreds or thousands epochs to reach SOTA performance and are thus still
costly. In this paper, we identify two important issues in existing methods,
namely exploded bounds at initialization, and the imbalance in ReLU activation
states. These two issues make certified training difficult and unstable, and
thereby long warmup schedules were needed in prior works. To mitigate these
issues and conduct certified training with shorter warmup, we propose three
improvements: 1) We derive a new weight initialization method for IBP training;
2) We propose to fully add Batch Normalization (BN) to each layer in the model,
since we find BN can reduce the imbalance in ReLU activation states; 3) We also
design regularization to explicitly tighten certified bounds and balance ReLU
activation states. In our experiments, we are able to obtain 65.03% verified
error on CIFAR-10 ($\epsilon&#x3D;\frac{8}{255}$) and 82.36% verified error on
TinyImageNet ($\epsilon&#x3D;\frac{1}{255}$) using very short training schedules
(160 and 80 total epochs, respectively), outperforming literature SOTA trained
with hundreds or thousands epochs under the same network architecture.</span>

examples. Black-box attack is the most threatening attack. At present,
black-box attack methods mainly adopt gradient-based iterative attack methods,
which usually limit the relationship between the iteration step size, the
number of iterations, and the maximum perturbation. In this paper, we propose a
new gradient iteration framework, which redefines the relationship between the
above three. Under this framework, we easily improve the attack success rate of
DI-TI-MIM. In addition, we propose a gradient iterative attack method based on
input dropout, which can be well combined with our framework. We further
propose a multi dropout rate version of this method. Experimental results show
that our best method can achieve attack success rate of 96.2\% for defense
model on average, which is higher than the state-of-the-art gradient-based
attacks.</span>

successful approach toward efficient and cost-effective machine learning.
However, models trained on a smaller subset may show poor generalization
ability. In this paper, our goal is to design an algorithm for selecting a
subset of the training data, so that the model can be trained quickly, without
significantly sacrificing on accuracy. More specifically, we focus on data
subset selection for L2 regularized regression problems and provide a novel
problem formulation which seeks to minimize the training loss with respect to
both the trainable parameters and the subset of training data, subject to error
bounds on the validation set. We tackle this problem using several technical
innovations. First, we represent this problem with simplified constraints using
the dual of the original training problem and show that the objective of this
new representation is a monotone and alpha-submodular function, for a wide
variety of modeling choices. Such properties lead us to develop SELCON, an
efficient majorization-minimization algorithm for data subset selection, that
admits an approximation guarantee even when the training provides an imperfect
estimate of the trained model. Finally, our experiments on several datasets
show that SELCON trades off accuracy and efficiency more effectively than the
current state-of-the-art.</span>

quantum computers. However, training VQAs often requires an extensive amount of
time and suffers from the barren plateau problem where the magnitude of the
gradients vanishes with increasing number of qubits. Here, we show how to
optimally train VQAs for learning quantum states. Parameterized quantum
circuits can form Gaussian kernels, which we use to derive adaptive learning
rates for gradient ascent. We introduce the generalized quantum natural
gradient that features stability and optimized movement in parameter space.
Both methods together outperform other optimization routines in training VQAs.
Our methods also excel at numerically optimizing driving protocols for quantum
control problems. The gradients of the VQA do not vanish when the fidelity
between the initial state and the state to be learned is bounded from below. We
identify a VQA for quantum simulation with such a constraint that thus can be
trained free of barren plateaus. Finally, we propose the application of
Gaussian kernels for quantum machine learning.</span>

with long-range interactions and lack a principled way to model higher-order
structures. These problems can be attributed to the strong coupling between the
computational graph and the input graph structure. The recently proposed
Message Passing Simplicial Networks naturally decouple these elements by
performing message passing on the clique complex of the graph. Nevertheless,
these models are severely constrained by the rigid combinatorial structure of
Simplicial Complexes (SCs). In this work, we extend recent theoretical results
on SCs to regular Cell Complexes, topological objects that flexibly subsume SCs
and graphs. We show that this generalisation provides a powerful set of graph
&#x60;&#x60;lifting&#x27;&#x27; transformations, each leading to a unique hierarchical message
passing procedure. The resulting methods, which we collectively call CW
Networks (CWNs), are strictly more powerful than the WL test and, in certain
cases, not less powerful than the 3-WL test. In particular, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of one such scheme, based on rings, when applied to molecular
graph problems. The proposed architecture benefits from provably larger
expressivity than commonly used GNNs, principled modelling of higher-order
signals and from compressing the distances between nodes. We demonstrate that
our model achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of molecular datasets.</span>

                                        <span>The attention module, which is a crucial component in Transformer, cannot
scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic complexity. Many works
focus on approximating the dot-then-exponentiate softmax function in the
original attention, leading to sub-quadratic or even linear-complexity
Transformer architectures. However, we show that these methods cannot be
applied to more powerful attention modules that go beyond the
dot-then-exponentiate style, e.g., Transformers with relative positional
encoding (RPE). Since in many state-of-the-art models, relative positional
encoding is used as default, designing efficient Transformers that can
incorporate RPE is appealing. In this paper, we propose a novel way to
accelerate attention calculation for Transformers with RPE on top of the
kernelized attention. Based upon the observation that relative positional
encoding forms a Toeplitz matrix, we mathematically show that kernelized
attention with RPE can be calculated efficiently using Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). With FFT, our method achieves $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time complexity.
Interestingly, we further demonstrate that properly using relative positional
encoding can mitigate the training instability problem of vanilla kernelized
attention. On a wide range of tasks, we empirically show that our models can be
trained from scratch without any optimization issues. The learned model
performs better than many efficient Transformer variants and is faster than
standard Transformer in the long-sequence regime.</span>

addressed by machine learning techniques: the evaluation of the influence of
each of the features on the classification of individuals. Specifically, a
measure of that influence is introduced using the Shapley value of cooperative
games. In addition, an axiomatic characterisation of the proposed measure is
provided based on properties of efficiency and balanced contributions.
Furthermore, some experiments have been designed in order to validate the
appropriate performance of such measure. Finally, the methodology introduced is
applied to a sample of COVID-19 patients to study the influence of certain

                                        <span>Achieving a high prediction rate is a crucial task in fault detection.
Although various classification procedures are available, none of them can give
high accuracy in all applications. Therefore, in this paper, a novel
multi-classifier fusion approach is developed to boost the performance of the
individual classifiers. This is acquired by using Dempster-Shafer theory (DST).
However, in cases with conflicting evidences, the DST may give
counter-intuitive results. In this regard, a preprocessing technique based on a
new metric is devised in order to measure and mitigate the conflict between the
evidences. To evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
the method is applied to 15 benchmarks datasets from UCI and KEEL. Further, it
is applied for classifying polycrystalline Nickel alloy first-stage turbine
blades based on their broadband vibrational response. Through statistical
analysis with different noise levels, and by comparing with four
state-of-the-art fusion techniques, it is shown that that the proposed method
improves the classification accuracy and outperforms the individual
classifiers.</span>

                                        <span>A popular way to create detailed yet easily controllable 3D shapes is via
procedural modeling, i.e. generating geometry using programs. Such programs
consist of a series of instructions along with their associated parameter
values. To fully realize the benefits of this representation, a shape program
should be compact and only expose degrees of freedom that allow for meaningful
manipulation of output geometry. One way to achieve this goal is to design
higher-level macro operators that, when executed, expand into a series of
commands from the base shape modeling language. However, manually authoring
such macros, much like shape programs themselves, is difficult and largely
restricted to domain experts. In this paper, we present ShapeMOD, an algorithm
for automatically discovering macros that are useful across large datasets of
3D shape programs. ShapeMOD operates on shape programs expressed in an
imperative, statement-based language. It is designed to discover macros that
make programs more compact by minimizing the number of function calls and free
parameters required to represent an input shape collection. We run ShapeMOD on
multiple collections of programs expressed in a domain-specific language for 3D
shape structures. We show that it automatically discovers a concise set of
macros that abstract out common structural and parametric patterns that
generalize over large shape collections. We also demonstrate that the macros
found by ShapeMOD improve performance on downstream tasks including shape
generative modeling and inferring programs from point clouds. Finally, we
conduct a user study that indicates that ShapeMOD&#x27;s discovered macros make
interactive shape editing more efficient.</span>

$\mathbb{R}^d$ with adversarial noise where the overall probability of a noisy
label is constrained to be at most $\nu$. Our main contribution is a
Perceptron-like online active learning algorithm that runs in polynomial time,
and under the conditions that the marginal distribution is isotropic
log-concave and $\nu &#x3D; \Omega(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$ is the
target error rate, our algorithm PAC learns the underlying halfspace with
near-optimal label complexity of $\tilde{O}\big(d \cdot
polylog(\frac{1}{\epsilon})\big)$ and sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}\big(\frac{d}{\epsilon} \big)$. Prior to this work, existing online
algorithms designed for tolerating the adversarial noise are subject to either
label complexity polynomial in $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, or suboptimal noise
tolerance, or restrictive marginal distributions. With the additional prior
knowledge that the underlying halfspace is $s$-sparse, we obtain
attribute-efficient label complexity of $\tilde{O}\big( s \cdot polylog(d,
\frac{1}{\epsilon}) \big)$ and sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}\big(\frac{s}{\epsilon} \cdot polylog(d) \big)$. As an immediate
corollary, we show that under the agnostic model where no assumption is made on
the noise rate $\nu$, our active learner achieves an error rate of $O(OPT) +
\epsilon$ with the same running time and label and sample complexity, where
$OPT$ is the best possible error rate achievable by any homogeneous halfspace.</span>

risks posed by sea-level rise to coastal communities. While these models are
necessary for understanding climate risks, there is a level of uncertainty
inherent in each parameter in the models. This model parametric uncertainty
leads to uncertainty in future climate risks. Consequently, there is a need to
understand how those parameter uncertainties impact our assessment of future
climate risks and the efficacy of strategies to manage them. Here, we use
random forests to examine the parametric drivers of future climate risk and how
the relative importances of those drivers change over time. We find that the
equilibrium climate sensitivity and a factor that scales the effect of aerosols
on radiative forcing are consistently the most important climate model
parametric uncertainties throughout the 2020 to 2150 interval for both low and
high radiative forcing scenarios. The near-term hazards of high-end sea-level
rise are driven primarily by thermal expansion, while the longer-term hazards
are associated with mass loss from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Our
results highlight the practical importance of considering time-evolving
parametric uncertainties when developing strategies to manage future climate
risks.</span>

random latent vectors. Although manipulating the latent vectors controls the
synthesized outputs, editing real images with GANs suffers from i)
time-consuming optimization for projecting real images to the latent vectors,
ii) or inaccurate embedding through an encoder. We propose StyleMapGAN: the
intermediate latent space has spatial dimensions, and a spatially variant
modulation replaces AdaIN. It makes the embedding through an encoder more
accurate than existing optimization-based methods while maintaining the
properties of GANs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in various image manipulation

                                        <span>Fluorescence microscopy allows for a detailed inspection of cells, cellular
networks, and anatomical landmarks by staining with a variety of
carefully-selected markers visualized as color channels. Quantitative
characterization of structures in acquired images often relies on automatic
image analysis methods. Despite the success of deep learning methods in other
vision applications, their potential for fluorescence image analysis remains
underexploited. One reason lies in the considerable workload required to train
accurate models, which are normally specific for a given combination of
markers, and therefore applicable to a very restricted number of experimental
settings. We herein propose Marker Sampling and Excite, a neural network
approach with a modality sampling strategy and a novel attention module that
together enable (i) flexible training with heterogeneous datasets with
combinations of markers and (ii) successful utility of learned models on
arbitrary subsets of markers prospectively. We show that our single neural
network solution performs comparably to an upper bound scenario where an
ensemble of many networks is na\&quot;ively trained for each possible marker
combination separately. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of this
framework in high-throughput biological analysis by revising a recent
quantitative characterization of bone marrow vasculature in 3D confocal
microscopy datasets and further confirm the validity of our approach on an
additional, significantly different dataset of microvessels in fetal liver
tissues. Not only can our work substantially ameliorate the use of deep
learning in fluorescence microscopy analysis, but it can also be utilized in
other fields with incomplete data acquisitions and missing modalities.</span>

framework for reinforcement learning based on Bregman divergences and momentum
techniques. Specifically, we propose a Bregman gradient policy optimization
(BGPO) algorithm based on the basic momentum technique and mirror descent
iteration. At the same time, we present an accelerated Bregman gradient policy
optimization (VR-BGPO) algorithm based on a momentum variance-reduced
technique. Moreover, we introduce a convergence analysis framework for our
Bregman gradient policy optimization under the nonconvex setting. Specifically,
we prove that BGPO achieves the sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$
for finding $\epsilon$-stationary point only requiring one trajectory at each
iteration, and VR-BGPO reaches the best known sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point, which
also only requires one trajectory at each iteration. In particular, by using
different Bregman divergences, our methods unify many existing policy
optimization algorithms and their new variants such as the existing
(variance-reduced) policy gradient algorithms and (variance-reduced) natural
policy gradient algorithms. Extensive experimental results on multiple
reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the efficiency of our new algorithms.</span>

connections between nodes and nodes&#x27; cluster memberships may change over time,
e.g., due to community migration. We first propose a dynamic stochastic block
model that captures these changes, and a simple decay-based clustering
algorithm that clusters nodes based on weighted connections between them, where
the weight decreases at a fixed rate over time. This decay rate can then be
interpreted as signifying the importance of including historical connection
information in the clustering. However, the optimal decay rate may differ for
clusters with different rates of turnover. We characterize the optimal decay
rate for each cluster and propose a clustering method that achieves almost
exact recovery of the true clusters. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our
clustering algorithm with optimized decay rates on simulated graph data.
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a popular algorithm for sequence learning,
use a similar decay-based method, and we use this insight to propose two new

                                        <span>Tensor decompositions are powerful tools for dimensionality reduction and
feature interpretation of multidimensional data such as signals. Existing
tensor decomposition objectives (e.g., Frobenius norm) are designed for fitting
raw data under statistical assumptions, which may not align with downstream
classification tasks. Also, real-world tensor data are usually high-ordered and
have large dimensions with millions or billions of entries. Thus, it is
expensive to decompose the whole tensor with traditional algorithms. In
practice, raw tensor data also contains redundant information while data
augmentation techniques may be used to smooth out noise in samples. This paper
addresses the above challenges by proposing augmented tensor decomposition
(ATD), which effectively incorporates data augmentations to boost downstream
classification. To reduce the memory footprint of the decomposition, we propose
a stochastic algorithm that updates the factor matrices in a batch fashion. We
evaluate ATD on multiple signal datasets. It shows comparable or better
performance (e.g., up to 15% in accuracy) over self-supervised and autoencoder
baselines with less than 5% of model parameters, achieves 0.6% ~ 1.3% accuracy
gain over other tensor-based baselines, and reduces the memory footprint by 9X
when compared to standard tensor decomposition algorithms.</span>

                                        <span>Attribution methods have been shown as promising approaches for identifying
key features that led to learned model predictions. While most existing
attribution methods rely on a baseline input for performing feature
perturbations, limited research has been conducted to address the baseline
selection issues. Poor choices of baselines limit the ability of one-vs-one
(1-vs-1) explanations for multi-class classifiers, which means the attribution
methods were not able to explain why an input belongs to its original class but
not the other specified target class. 1-vs-1 explanation is crucial when
certain classes are more similar than others, e.g. two bird types among
multiple animals, by focusing on key differentiating features rather than
shared features across classes. In this paper, we present GAN-based Model
EXplainability (GANMEX), a novel approach applying Generative Adversarial
Networks (GAN) by incorporating the to-be-explained classifier as part of the
adversarial networks. Our approach effectively selects the counterfactual
baseline as the closest realistic sample belong to the target class, which
allows attribution methods to provide true 1-vs-1 explanations. We showed that
GANMEX baselines improved the saliency maps and led to stronger performance on
perturbation-based evaluation metrics over the existing baselines. Existing
attribution results are known for being insensitive to model randomization, and
we demonstrated that GANMEX baselines led to better outcome under the cascading
randomization of the model.</span>

because they greatly improve the efficiency of both learning and inference. Our
work is based on a recently proposed decomposition of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) that has decoupled the dynamics of the training process into a
data-dependent component and an architecture-dependent kernel - the latter
referred to as Path Kernel. That work has shown how to design sparse neural
networks for faster convergence, without any training data, using the
Synflow-L2 algorithm. We first show that even though Synflow-L2 is optimal in
terms of convergence, for a given network density, it results in sub-networks
with &quot;bottleneck&quot; (narrow) layers - leading to poor performance as compared to
other data-agnostic methods that use the same number of parameters. Then we
propose a new method to construct sparse networks, without any training data,
referred to as Paths with Higher-Edge Weights (PHEW). PHEW is a probabilistic
network formation method based on biased random walks that only depends on the
initial weights. It has similar path kernel properties as Synflow-L2 but it
generates much wider layers, resulting in better generalization and
performance. PHEW achieves significant improvements over the data-independent
SynFlow and SynFlow-L2 methods at a wide range of network densities.</span>

                                        <span>Generative Adversarial Networks are notoriously challenging to train. The
underlying minmax optimization is highly susceptible to the variance of the
stochastic gradient and the rotational component of the associated game vector
field. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Lookahead algorithm for
minmax optimization, originally developed for single objective minimization
only. The backtracking step of our Lookahead-minmax naturally handles the
rotational game dynamics, a property which was identified to be key for
enabling gradient ascent descent methods to converge on challenging examples
often analyzed in the literature. Moreover, it implicitly handles high variance
without using large mini-batches, known to be essential for reaching state of
the art performance. Experimental results on MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and
ImageNet demonstrate a clear advantage of combining Lookahead-minmax with Adam
or extragradient, in terms of performance and improved stability, for
negligible memory and computational cost. Using 30-fold fewer parameters and
16-fold smaller minibatches we outperform the reported performance of the
class-dependent BigGAN on CIFAR-10 by obtaining FID of 12.19 without using the
class labels, bringing state-of-the-art GAN training within reach of common
computational resources.</span>

                                        <span>Score-based diffusion models synthesize samples by reversing a stochastic
process that diffuses data to noise, and are trained by minimizing a weighted
combination of score matching losses. The log-likelihood of score-based models
can be tractably computed through a connection to continuous normalizing flows,
but log-likelihood is not directly optimized by the weighted combination of
score matching losses. We show that for a specific weighting scheme, the
objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood, thus enabling approximate
maximum likelihood training of score-based models. We empirically observe that
maximum likelihood training consistently improves the likelihood of score-based
models across multiple datasets, stochastic processes, and model architectures.
Our best models achieve negative log-likelihoods of 2.74 and 3.76 bits/dim on
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32x32, outperforming autoregressive models on these
tasks.</span>

installed. However, recent supply-chain attacks demonstrate that application
integrity must be ensured during installation itself. We introduce SIGL, a new
tool for detecting malicious behavior during software installation. SIGL
collects traces of system call activity, building a data provenance graph that
it analyzes using a novel autoencoder architecture with a graph long short-term
memory network (graph LSTM) for the encoder and a standard multilayer
perceptron for the decoder. SIGL flags suspicious installations as well as the
specific installation-time processes that are likely to be malicious. Using a
test corpus of 625 malicious installers containing real-world malware, we
demonstrate that SIGL has a detection accuracy of 96%, outperforming similar
systems from industry and academia by up to 87% in precision and recall and 45%
in accuracy. We also demonstrate that SIGL can pinpoint the processes most
likely to have triggered malicious behavior, works on different audit platforms
and operating systems, and is robust to training data contamination and
adversarial attack. It can be used with application-specific models, even in
the presence of new software versions, as well as application-agnostic
meta-models that encompass a wide range of applications and installers.</span>

                                        <span>Current out-of-distribution detection approaches usually present special
requirements (e.g., collecting outlier data and hyperparameter validation) and
produce side effects (classification accuracy drop and slow/inefficient
inferences). Recently, entropic out-of-distribution detection has been proposed
as a seamless approach (i.e., a solution that avoids all the previously
mentioned drawbacks). The entropic out-of-distribution detection solution
comprises the IsoMax loss for training and the entropic score for
out-of-distribution detection. The IsoMax loss works as a SoftMax loss drop-in
replacement because swapping the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss requires no
changes in the model&#x27;s architecture or training procedures/hyperparameters. In
this paper, we propose to perform what we call an isometrization of the
distances used in the IsoMax loss. Additionally, we propose to replace the
entropic score with the minimum distance score. Our experiments showed that
these simple modifications increase out-of-distribution detection performance
while keeping the solution seamless.</span>

propose a variant of Thompson sampling that learns to explore better as it
interacts with bandit instances drawn from an unknown prior. The algorithm
meta-learns the prior and thus we call it MetaTS. We propose several efficient
implementations of MetaTS and analyze it in Gaussian bandits. Our analysis

                                        <span>In this paper, we propose a Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) to forecast
dominant wave periods in oceanic waters. First, we use the data collected from
CDIP buoys and apply various data filtering methods. The data filtering methods
allow us to obtain a high-quality dataset for training and validation purposes.
We then extract various wave-based features like wave heights, periods,
skewness, kurtosis, etc., and atmospheric features like humidity, pressure, and
air temperature for the buoys. Afterward, we train algorithms that use LightGBM
and Extra Trees through a hv-block cross-validation scheme to forecast dominant
wave periods for up to 30 days ahead. LightGBM has the R2 score of 0.94, 0.94,
and 0.94 for 1-day ahead, 15-day ahead, and 30-day ahead prediction. Similarly,
Extra Trees (ET) has an R2 score of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 1-day ahead,
15-day ahead, and 30 day ahead prediction. In case of the test dataset,
LightGBM has R2 score of 0.94, 0.94, and 0.94 for 1-day ahead, 15-day ahead and
30-day ahead prediction. ET has R2 score of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 1-day
ahead, 15-day ahead, and 30-day ahead prediction. A similar R2 score for both
training and the test dataset suggests that the machine learning models
developed in this paper are robust. Since the LightGBM algorithm outperforms ET
for all the windows tested, it is taken as the final algorithm. Note that the
performance of both methods does not decrease significantly as the forecast
horizon increases. Likewise, the proposed method outperforms the numerical
approaches included in this paper in the test dataset. For 1 day ahead
prediction, the proposed algorithm has SI, Bias, CC, and RMSE of 0.09, 0.00,
0.97, and 1.78 compared to 0.268, 0.40, 0.63, and 2.18 for the European Centre
for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model, which outperforms all the
other methods in the test dataset.</span>

                                        <span>Recent advances in scanning tunneling and transmission electron microscopies
(STM and STEM) have allowed routine generation of large volumes of imaging data
containing information on the structure and functionality of materials. The
experimental data sets contain signatures of long-range phenomena such as
physical order parameter fields, polarization and strain gradients in STEM, or
standing electronic waves and carrier-mediated exchange interactions in STM,
all superimposed onto scanning system distortions and gradual changes of
contrast due to drift and/or mis-tilt effects. Correspondingly, while the human
eye can readily identify certain patterns in the images such as lattice
periodicities, repeating structural elements, or microstructures, their
automatic extraction and classification are highly non-trivial and universal
pathways to accomplish such analyses are absent. We pose that the most
distinctive elements of the patterns observed in STM and (S)TEM images are
similarity and (almost-) periodicity, behaviors stemming directly from the
parsimony of elementary atomic structures, superimposed on the gradual changes
reflective of order parameter distributions. However, the discovery of these
elements via global Fourier methods is non-trivial due to variability and lack
of ideal discrete translation symmetry. To address this problem, we develop
shift-invariant variational autoencoders (shift-VAE) that allow disentangling
characteristic repeating features in the images, their variations, and shifts
inevitable for random sampling of image space. Shift-VAEs balance the
uncertainty in the position of the object of interest with the uncertainty in
shape reconstruction. This approach is illustrated for model 1D data, and
further extended to synthetic and experimental STM and STEM 2D data.</span>

                                        <span>Dynamical variational auto-encoders (DVAEs) are a class of deep generative
models with latent variables, dedicated to time series data modeling. DVAEs can
be considered as extensions of the variational autoencoder (VAE) that include
the modeling of temporal dependencies between successive observed and/or latent
vectors in data sequences. Previous work has shown the interest of DVAEs and
their better performance over the VAE for speech signals (spectrogram)
modeling. Independently, the VAE has been successfully applied to speech
enhancement in noise, in an unsupervised noise-agnostic set-up that does not
require the use of a parallel dataset of clean and noisy speech samples for
training, but only requires clean speech signals. In this paper, we extend
those works to DVAE-based single-channel unsupervised speech enhancement, hence
exploiting both speech signals unsupervised representation learning and
dynamics modeling. We propose an unsupervised speech enhancement algorithm
based on the most general form of DVAEs, that we then adapt to three specific
DVAE models to illustrate the versatility of the framework. More precisely, we
combine DVAE-based speech priors with a noise model based on nonnegative matrix
factorization, and we derive a variational expectation-maximization (VEM)
algorithm to perform speech enhancement. Experimental results show that the
proposed approach based on DVAEs outperforms its VAE counterpart and a
supervised speech enhancement baseline.</span>

field-of-view LDR camera image in real-time. This enables perceptually
appealing reflections and shading on virtual objects of any material finish,
from mirror to diffuse, rendered into a real physical environment using
augmented reality. Our method is based on our efficient convolutional neural
network architecture, EnvMapNet, trained end-to-end with two novel losses,
ProjectionLoss for the generated image, and ClusterLoss for adversarial
training. Through qualitative and quantitative comparison to state-of-the-art
methods, we demonstrate that our algorithm reduces the directional error of
estimated light sources by more than 50%, and achieves 3.7 times lower Frechet
Inception Distance (FID). We further showcase a mobile application that is able
to run our neural network model in under 9 ms on an iPhone XS, and render in
real-time, visually coherent virtual objects in previously unseen real-world

care industry, sports, rehabilitation and fitness assessment), sufficiently
valid and reliable gait parameter measurement is still limited to high-tech
gait laboratories mostly. Here, we demonstrate the excellent validity and
test-retest repeatability of a novel gait assessment system which is built upon
modern convolutional neural networks to extract three-dimensional skeleton
joints from monocular frontal-view videos of walking humans. The validity study
is based on a comparison to the GAITRite pressure-sensitive walkway system. All
measured gait parameters (gait speed, cadence, step length and step time)
showed excellent concurrent validity for multiple walk trials at normal and
fast gait speeds. The test-retest-repeatability is on the same level as the
GAITRite system. In conclusion, we are convinced that our results can pave the
way for cost, space and operationally effective gait analysis in broad
mainstream applications. Most sensor-based systems are costly, must be operated
by extensively trained personnel (e.g., motion capture systems) or - even if
not quite as costly - still possess considerable complexity (e.g., wearable
sensors). In contrast, a video sufficient for the assessment method presented
here can be obtained by anyone, without much training, via a smartphone camera.</span>

the probability density function of data via a sequence of invertible
transformations. Yet, modeling long-range dependencies over normalizing flows
remains understudied. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce two types of
invertible attention mechanisms for generative flow models. To be precise, we
propose map-based and scaled dot-product attention for unconditional and
conditional generative flow models. The key idea is to exploit split-based
attention mechanisms to learn the attention weights and input representations
on every two splits of flow feature maps. Our method provides invertible
attention modules with tractable Jacobian determinants, enabling seamless
integration of it at any positions of the flow-based models. The proposed
attention mechanism can model the global data dependencies, leading to more
comprehensive flow models. Evaluation on multiple generation tasks demonstrates
that the introduced attention flow idea results in efficient flow models and
compares favorably against the state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional
generative flow methods.</span>

attain the balance between exploration and exploitation. Due to the superior
performance and low feedback learning without the learning to act in multiple
situations, Multi-armed Bandits drawing widespread attention in applications
ranging such as recommender systems. Likewise, within the recommender system,
collaborative filtering (CF) is arguably the earliest and most influential
method in the recommender system. Crucially, new users and an ever-changing
pool of recommended items are the challenges that recommender systems need to
address. For collaborative filtering, the classical method is training the
model offline, then perform the online testing, but this approach can no longer
handle the dynamic changes in user preferences which is the so-called cold
start. So how to effectively recommend items to users in the absence of
effective information? To address the aforementioned problems, a multi-armed
bandit based collaborative filtering recommender system has been proposed,
named BanditMF. BanditMF is designed to address two challenges in the
multi-armed bandits algorithm and collaborative filtering: (1) how to solve the
cold start problem for collaborative filtering under the condition of scarcity
of valid information, (2) how to solve the sub-optimal problem of bandit
algorithms in strong social relations domains caused by independently
estimating unknown parameters associated with each user and ignoring
correlations between users.</span>

                                        <span>An increasingly common setting in machine learning involves multiple parties,
each with their own data, who want to jointly make predictions on future test
points. Agents wish to benefit from the collective expertise of the full set of
agents to make better predictions than they would individually, but may not be
willing to release their data or model parameters. In this work, we explore a
decentralized mechanism to make collective predictions at test time, leveraging
each agent&#x27;s pre-trained model without relying on external validation, model
retraining, or data pooling. Our approach takes inspiration from the literature
in social science on human consensus-making. We analyze our mechanism
theoretically, showing that it converges to inverse meansquared-error (MSE)
weighting in the large-sample limit. To compute error bars on the collective
predictions we propose a decentralized Jackknife procedure that evaluates the
sensitivity of our mechanism to a single agent&#x27;s prediction. Empirically, we
demonstrate that our scheme effectively combines models with differing quality
across the input space. The proposed consensus prediction achieves significant
gains over classical model averaging, and even outperforms weighted averaging
schemes that have access to additional validation data.</span>

                                        <span>This paper deals with the problem of localization in a cellular network in a
dense urban scenario. Global Navigation Satellite Systems typically perform
poorly in urban environments, where the likelihood of line-of-sight conditions
between the devices and the satellites is low, and thus alternative
localization methods are required for good accuracy. We present a deep learning
method for localization, based merely on pathloss, which does not require any
increase in computation complexity at the user devices with respect to the
device standard operations, unlike methods that rely on time of arrival or
angle of arrival information. In a wireless network, user devices scan the base
station beacon slots and identify the few strongest base station signals for
handover and user-base station association purposes. In the proposed method,
the user to be localized simply reports such received signal strengths to a
central processing unit, which may be located in the cloud. For each base
station we have good approximation of the pathloss at every location in a dense
grid in the map. This approximation is provided by RadioUNet, a deep
learning-based simulator of pathloss functions in urban environment, that we
have previously proposed and published. Using the estimated pathloss radio maps
of all base stations and the corresponding reported signal strengths, the
proposed deep learning algorithm can extract a very accurate localization of
the user. The proposed method, called LocUNet, enjoys high robustness to
inaccuracies in the estimated radio maps. We demonstrate this by numerical
experiments, which obtain state-of-the-art results.</span>

photorealistic images of human faces with novel identities. A key challenge to
the wide applicability of such techniques is to provide independent control
over semantically meaningful parameters: appearance, head pose, face shape, and
facial expressions. In this paper, we propose VariTex - to the best of our
knowledge the first method that learns a variational latent feature space of
neural face textures, which allows sampling of novel identities. We combine
this generative model with a parametric face model and gain explicit control
over head pose and facial expressions. To generate images of complete human
heads, we propose an additive decoder that generates plausible additional
details such as hair. A novel training scheme enforces a pose independent
latent space and in consequence, allows learning of a one-to-many mapping
between latent codes and pose-conditioned exterior regions. The resulting
method can generate geometrically consistent images of novel identities
allowing fine-grained control over head pose, face shape, and facial
expressions, facilitating a broad range of downstream tasks, like sampling
novel identities, re-posing, expression transfer, and more.</span>

                                        <span>Minimizing cross-entropy over the softmax scores of a linear map composed
with a high-capacity encoder is arguably the most popular choice for training
neural networks on supervised learning tasks. However, recent works show that
one can directly optimize the encoder instead, to obtain equally (or even more)
discriminative representations via a supervised variant of a contrastive
objective. In this work, we address the question whether there are fundamental
differences in the sought-for representation geometry in the output space of
the encoder at minimal loss. Specifically, we prove, under mild assumptions,
that both losses attain their minimum once the representations of each class
collapse to the vertices of a regular simplex, inscribed in a hypersphere. We
provide empirical evidence that this configuration is attained in practice and
that reaching a close-to-optimal state typically indicates good generalization
performance. Yet, the two losses show remarkably different optimization
behavior. The number of iterations required to perfectly fit to data scales
superlinearly with the amount of randomly flipped labels for the supervised
contrastive loss. This is in contrast to the approximately linear scaling
previously reported for networks trained with cross-entropy.</span>

                                        <span>Social learning is a key component of human and animal intelligence. By
taking cues from the behavior of experts in their environment, social learners
can acquire sophisticated behavior and rapidly adapt to new circumstances. This
paper investigates whether independent reinforcement learning (RL) agents in a
multi-agent environment can learn to use social learning to improve their
performance. We find that in most circumstances, vanilla model-free RL agents
do not use social learning. We analyze the reasons for this deficiency, and
show that by imposing constraints on the training environment and introducing a
model-based auxiliary loss we are able to obtain generalized social learning
policies which enable agents to: i) discover complex skills that are not
learned from single-agent training, and ii) adapt online to novel environments
by taking cues from experts present in the new environment. In contrast, agents
trained with model-free RL or imitation learning generalize poorly and do not
succeed in the transfer tasks. By mixing multi-agent and solo training, we can
obtain agents that use social learning to gain skills that they can deploy when
alone, even out-performing agents trained alone from the start.</span>

                                        <span>Imitation learning is an effective and safe technique to train robot policies
in the real world because it does not depend on an expensive random exploration
process. However, due to the lack of exploration, learning policies that
generalize beyond the demonstrated behaviors is still an open challenge. We
present a novel imitation learning framework to enable robots to 1) learn
complex real world manipulation tasks efficiently from a small number of human
demonstrations, and 2) synthesize new behaviors not contained in the collected
demonstrations. Our key insight is that multi-task domains often present a
latent structure, where demonstrated trajectories for different tasks intersect
at common regions of the state space. We present Generalization Through
Imitation (GTI), a two-stage offline imitation learning algorithm that exploits
this intersecting structure to train goal-directed policies that generalize to
unseen start and goal state combinations. In the first stage of GTI, we train a
stochastic policy that leverages trajectory intersections to have the capacity
to compose behaviors from different demonstration trajectories together. In the
second stage of GTI, we collect a small set of rollouts from the unconditioned
stochastic policy of the first stage, and train a goal-directed agent to
generalize to novel start and goal configurations. We validate GTI in both
simulated domains and a challenging long-horizon robotic manipulation domain in
the real world. Additional results and videos are available at

                                        <span>As machine learning models are increasingly used in critical decision-making
settings (e.g., healthcare, finance), there has been a growing emphasis on
developing methods to explain model predictions. Such \textit{explanations} are
used to understand and establish trust in models and are vital components in
machine learning pipelines. Though explanations are a critical piece in these
systems, there is little understanding about how they are vulnerable to
manipulation by adversaries. In this paper, we discuss how two broad classes of
explanations are vulnerable to manipulation. We demonstrate how adversaries can
design biased models that manipulate model agnostic feature attribution methods
(e.g., LIME \&amp; SHAP) and counterfactual explanations that hill-climb during the
counterfactual search (e.g., Wachter&#x27;s Algorithm \&amp; DiCE) into
\textit{concealing} the model&#x27;s biases. These vulnerabilities allow an
adversary to deploy a biased model, yet explanations will not reveal this bias,
thereby deceiving stakeholders into trusting the model. We evaluate the
manipulations on real world data sets, including COMPAS and Communities \&amp;
Crime, and find explanations can be manipulated in practice.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks, while generalize well, are known to be sensitive to
small adversarial perturbations. This phenomenon poses severe security threat
and calls for in-depth investigation of the robustness of deep learning models.
With the emergence of neural networks for graph structured data, similar
investigations are urged to understand their robustness. It has been found that
adversarially perturbing the graph structure and/or node features may result in
a significant degradation of the model performance. In this work, we show from
a different angle that such fragility similarly occurs if the graph contains a
few bad-actor nodes, which compromise a trained graph neural network through
flipping the connections to any targeted victim. Worse, the bad actors found
for one graph model severely compromise other models as well. We call the bad
actors &#x60;&#x60;anchor nodes&#x27;&#x27; and propose an algorithm, named GUA, to identify them.
Thorough empirical investigations suggest an interesting finding that the
anchor nodes often belong to the same class; and they also corroborate the
intuitive trade-off between the number of anchor nodes and the attack success
rate. For the dataset Cora which contains 2708 nodes, as few as six anchor
nodes will result in an attack success rate higher than 80\% for GCN and other
three models.</span>

                                        <span>Recent studies show a close connection between neural networks (NN) and
kernel methods. However, most of these analyses (e.g., NTK) focus on the
influence of (infinite) width instead of the depth of NN models. There remains
a gap between theory and practical network designs that benefit from the depth.
This paper first proposes a novel kernel family named Neural Optimization
Kernel (NOK). Our kernel is defined as the inner product between two $T$-step
updated functionals in RKHS w.r.t. a regularized optimization problem.
Theoretically, we proved the monotonic descent property of our update rule for
both convex and non-convex problems, and a $O(1/T)$ convergence rate of our
updates for convex problems. Moreover, we propose a data-dependent structured
approximation of our NOK, which builds the connection between training deep NNs
and kernel methods associated with NOK. The resultant computational graph is a
ResNet-type finite width NN. Our structured approximation preserved the
monotonic descent property and $O(1/T)$ convergence rate. Namely, a $T$-layer
NN performs $T$-step monotonic descent updates. Notably, we show our
$T$-layered structured NN with ReLU maintains a $O(1/T)$ convergence rate
w.r.t. a convex regularized problem, which explains the success of ReLU on
training deep NN from a NN architecture optimization perspective. For the
unsupervised learning and the shared parameter case, we show the equivalence of
training structured NN with GD and performing functional gradient descent in
RKHS associated with a fixed (data-dependent) NOK at an infinity-width regime.
For finite NOKs, we prove generalization bounds. Remarkably, we show that
overparameterized deep NN (NOK) can increase the expressive power to reduce

                                        <span>Splitting network computations between the edge device and a server enables
low edge-compute inference of neural networks but might expose sensitive
information about the test query to the server. To address this problem,
existing techniques train the model to minimize information leakage for a given
set of sensitive attributes. In practice, however, the test queries might
contain attributes that are not foreseen during training. We propose instead an
unsupervised obfuscation method to discard the information irrelevant to the
main task. We formulate the problem via an information theoretical framework
and derive an analytical solution for a given distortion to the model output.
In our method, the edge device runs the model up to a split layer determined
based on its computational capacity. It then obfuscates the obtained feature
vector based on the first layer of the server model by removing the components
in the null space as well as the low-energy components of the remaining signal.
Our experimental results show that our method outperforms existing techniques
in removing the information of the irrelevant attributes and maintaining the
accuracy on the target label. We also show that our method reduces the
communication cost and incurs only a small computational overhead.</span>

understand how the network will learn and generalize. One natural measure of
complexity is how the network distorts length - if the network takes a
unit-length curve as input, what is the length of the resulting curve of
outputs? It has been widely believed that this length grows exponentially in
network depth. We prove that in fact this is not the case: the expected length
distortion does not grow with depth, and indeed shrinks slightly, for ReLU
networks with standard random initialization. We also generalize this result by
proving upper bounds both for higher moments of the length distortion and for
the distortion of higher-dimensional volumes. These theoretical results are
corroborated by our experiments.</span>

algorithm for forecasting Significant Wave Heights in oceanic waters. To derive
multiple features from the CDIP buoys, which make point measurements, we first
nowcast various parameters and then forecast them at 30-min intervals. The
proposed algorithm has Scatter Index (SI), Bias, Correlation Coefficient, Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.130, -0.002, 0.97, and 0.14, respectively, for
one day ahead prediction and 0.110, -0.001, 0.98, and 0.122, respectively, for
14-day ahead prediction on the testing dataset. While other state-of-the-art
methods can only forecast up to 120 hours ahead, we extend it further to 14
days. Our proposed setup includes spectral features, hv-block cross-validation,
and stringent QC criteria. The proposed algorithm performs significantly better
than the state-of-the-art methods commonly used for significant wave height
forecasting for one-day ahead prediction. Moreover, the improved performance of
the proposed machine learning method compared to the numerical methods shows
that this performance can be extended to even longer periods allowing for early
prediction of significant wave heights in oceanic waters.</span>

high-dimensional inputs from modalities as diverse as vision, audition, touch,
proprioception, etc. The perception models used in deep learning on the other
hand are designed for individual modalities, often relying on domain-specific
assumptions such as the local grid structures exploited by virtually all
existing vision models. These priors introduce helpful inductive biases, but
also lock models to individual modalities. In this paper we introduce the
Perceiver - a model that builds upon Transformers and hence makes few
architectural assumptions about the relationship between its inputs, but that
also scales to hundreds of thousands of inputs, like ConvNets. The model
leverages an asymmetric attention mechanism to iteratively distill inputs into
a tight latent bottleneck, allowing it to scale to handle very large inputs. We
show that this architecture is competitive with or outperforms strong,
specialized models on classification tasks across various modalities: images,
point clouds, audio, video, and video+audio. The Perceiver obtains performance
comparable to ResNet-50 and ViT on ImageNet without 2D convolutions by directly
attending to 50,000 pixels. It is also competitive in all modalities in
AudioSet.</span>

vector onto the $\ell_{p}$ ball in which $p\in(0,1)$. Such a problem emerges as
the core building block in statistical machine learning and signal processing
tasks because of its ability to promote sparsity. However, efficient numerical
algorithms for finding the projections are still not available, particularly in
large-scale optimization. To meet this challenge, we first derive the
first-order necessary optimality conditions of this problem using Fr\&#x27;echet

approach for computing the stationary point through solving a sequence of
projections onto the reweighted $\ell_{1}$-balls. This method is practically
simple to implement and computationally efficient. Moreover, the proposed
algorithm is shown to converge uniquely under mild conditions and has a
worst-case $O(1/\sqrt{k})$ convergence rate. Numerical experiments demonstrate

understanding. Using a software vulnerability detection use case, we evaluate
the models&#x27; ability to capture the correct vulnerability signals to produce
their predictions. Our prediction-preserving input minimization (P2IM) approach
systematically reduces the original source code to a minimal snippet which a
model needs to maintain its prediction. The model&#x27;s reliance on incorrect
signals is then uncovered when the vulnerability in the original code is
missing in the minimal snippet, both of which the model however predicts as
being vulnerable. We measure the signal awareness of models using a new metric
we propose- Signal-aware Recall (SAR). We apply P2IM on three different neural
network architectures across multiple datasets. The results show a sharp drop
in the model&#x27;s Recall from the high 90s to sub-60s with the new metric,
highlighting that the models are presumably picking up a lot of noise or
dataset nuances while learning their vulnerability detection logic. Although
the drop in model performance may be perceived as an adversarial attack, but
this isn&#x27;t P2IM&#x27;s objective. The idea is rather to uncover the signal-awareness
of a black-box model in a data-driven manner via controlled queries. SAR&#x27;s
purpose is to measure the impact of task-agnostic model training, and not to
suggest a shortcoming in the Recall metric. The expectation, in fact, is for
SAR to match Recall in the ideal scenario where the model truly captures
task-specific signals.</span>

and the Poisson Lee-Carter model on multiple populations. We develop some
neural networks that replicate the structure of the individual LC models and
allow their joint fitting by analysing the mortality data of all the considered
populations simultaneously. The neural network architecture is specifically
designed to calibrate each individual model using all available information
instead of using a population-specific subset of data as in the traditional
estimation schemes. A large set of numerical experiments performed on all the
countries of the Human Mortality Database (HMD) shows the effectiveness of our
approach. In particular, the resulting parameter estimates appear smooth and
less sensitive to the random fluctuations often present in the mortality rates&#x27;
data, especially for low-population countries. In addition, the forecasting
performance results significantly improved as well.</span>

networks typically yield uncalibrated predictions, calibrated confidence scores
that are representative of the true likelihood of a prediction can be achieved
using post-hoc calibration methods. However, to date the focus of these
approaches has been on in-domain calibration. Our contribution is two-fold.
First, we show that existing post-hoc calibration methods yield highly
over-confident predictions under domain shift. Second, we introduce a simple
strategy where perturbations are applied to samples in the validation set
before performing the post-hoc calibration step. In extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that this perturbation step results in substantially better
calibration under domain shift on a wide range of architectures and modelling
tasks.</span>

perspective of regret minimization. Unlike most prior work in this area, we
focus on the problem of designing an online controller which competes with the
optimal dynamic sequence of control actions selected in hindsight, instead of
the best controller in some specific class of controllers. This formulation of
regret is attractive when the environment changes over time and no single
controller achieves good performance over the entire time horizon. We show that
in the measurement-feedback setting, unlike in the full-information setting,
there is no single offline controller which outperforms every other offline
controller on every disturbance, and propose a new $H_2$-optimal offline
controller as a benchmark for the online controller to compete against. We show
that the corresponding regret-optimal online controller can be found via a
novel reduction to the classical Nehari problem from robust control and present
a tight data-dependent bound on its regret.</span>

learning applications, the optimality, reproducibility and cost of NAS schemes
remain hard to assess. In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS
(GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting
stability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by
importance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously
discovered top architectures, thus increasingly focusing on important parts of
a large search space. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adversarial learning
approach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on
rewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search
space without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments
show that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three
public NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search
constraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve
already optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet
and ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in
their original search space.</span>

illumination. Our system is designed to handle fully dynamic scenes, and makes
no assumptions about the lighting, geometry, and materials. The data-driven
nature of our approach sidesteps many difficulties of caching algorithms, such
as locating, interpolating, and updating cache points. Since pretraining neural
networks to handle novel, dynamic scenes is a formidable generalization
challenge, we do away with pretraining and instead achieve generalization via
adaptation, i.e. we opt for training the radiance cache while rendering. We
employ self-training to provide low-noise training targets and simulate
infinite-bounce transport by merely iterating few-bounce training updates. The
updates and cache queries incur a mild overhead -- about 2.6ms on full HD
resolution -- thanks to a streaming implementation of the neural network that
fully exploits modern hardware. We demonstrate significant noise reduction at
the cost of little induced bias, and report state-of-the-art, real-time
performance on a number of challenging scenarios.</span>

                                        <span>Learning a sequence of tasks without access to i.i.d. observations is a
widely studied form of continual learning (CL) that remains challenging. In
principle, Bayesian learning directly applies to this setting, since recursive
and one-off Bayesian updates yield the same result. In practice, however,
recursive updating often leads to poor trade-off solutions across tasks because
approximate inference is necessary for most models of interest. Here, we
describe an alternative Bayesian approach where task-conditioned parameter
distributions are continually inferred from data. We offer a practical deep
learning implementation of our framework based on probabilistic
task-conditioned hypernetworks, an approach we term &quot;posterior meta-replay&quot;.
Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our probabilistic hypernetworks
compress sequences of posterior parameter distributions with virtually no
forgetting. We obtain considerable performance gains compared to existing
Bayesian CL methods, and identify task inference as our major limiting factor.
This limitation has several causes that are independent of the considered
sequential setting, opening up new avenues for progress in CL.</span>

Brazilian legal proceedings in three possible classes of status: (i) archived
proceedings, (ii) active proceedings, and (iii) suspended proceedings. This
problem&#x27;s resolution is intended to assist public and private institutions in
managing large portfolios of legal proceedings, providing gains in scale and
efficiency. In this paper, legal proceedings are made up of sequences of short

and machine learning techniques to solve the problem. Although working with
Portuguese NLP, which can be challenging due to lack of resources, our
approaches performed remarkably well in the classification task, achieving
maximum accuracy of .93 and top average F1 Scores of .89 (macro) and .93
(weighted). Furthermore, we could extract and interpret the patterns learned by
one of our models besides quantifying how those patterns relate to the
classification task. The interpretability step is important among machine
learning legal applications and gives us an exciting insight into how black-box

                                        <span>In many applications, it is desirable that a classifier not only makes
accurate predictions, but also outputs calibrated posterior probabilities.
However, many existing classifiers, especially deep neural network classifiers,
tend to be uncalibrated. Post-hoc calibration is a technique to recalibrate a
model by learning a calibration map. Existing approaches mostly focus on
constructing calibration maps with low calibration errors, however, this
quality is inadequate for a calibrator being useful. In this paper, we
introduce two constraints that are worth consideration in designing a
calibration map for post-hoc calibration. Then we present Meta-Cal, which is
built from a base calibrator and a ranking model. Under some mild assumptions,
two high-probability bounds are given with respect to these constraints.
Empirical results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet and a range of popular
network architectures show our proposed method significantly outperforms the
current state of the art for post-hoc multi-class classification calibration.</span>

mitigating cyber risks and proactively blocking intrusions. In this paper, we
propose MG-DVD, a novel detection framework based on dynamic heterogeneous
graph learning, to detect malware variants in real time. Particularly, MG-DVD
first models the fine-grained execution event streams of malware variants into
dynamic heterogeneous graphs and investigates real-world meta-graphs between
malware objects, which can effectively characterize more discriminative
malicious evolutionary patterns between malware and their variants. Then,
MG-DVD presents two dynamic walk-based heterogeneous graph learning methods to
learn more comprehensive representations of malware variants, which
significantly reduces the cost of the entire graph retraining. As a result,
MG-DVD is equipped with the ability to detect malware variants in real time,
and it presents better interpretability by introducing meaningful meta-graphs.
Comprehensive experiments on large-scale samples prove that our proposed MG-DVD
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting malware variants in terms of
effectiveness and efficiency.</span>

                                        <span>Federated Learning (FL) has become an active and promising distributed
machine learning paradigm. As a result of statistical heterogeneity, recent
studies clearly show that the performance of popular FL methods (e.g., FedAvg)
deteriorates dramatically due to the client drift caused by local updates. This
paper proposes a novel Federated Learning algorithm (called IGFL), which
leverages both Individual and Group behaviors to mimic distribution, thereby
improving the ability to deal with heterogeneity. Unlike existing FL methods,
our IGFL can be applied to both client and server optimization. As a
by-product, we propose a new attention-based federated learning in the server
optimization of IGFL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to
incorporate attention mechanisms into federated optimization. We conduct
extensive experiments and show that IGFL can significantly improve the
performance of existing federated learning methods. Especially when the
distributions of data among individuals are diverse, IGFL can improve the
classification accuracy by about 13% compared with prior baselines.</span>

as RGB, thermal and hyperspectral cameras (among others), to make large scale
and rapid measurements of the physical properties of plants for the purpose of
better understanding the difference between crops and facilitating rapid plant
breeding programs. One of the most basic phenotyping tasks is to determine the
cultivar, or species, in a particular sensor product. This simple phenotype can
be used to detect errors in planting and to learn the most differentiating
features between cultivars. It is also a challenging visual recognition task,
as a large number of highly related crops are grown simultaneously, leading to
a classification problem with low inter-class variance. In this paper, we
introduce the Sorghum-100 dataset, a large dataset of RGB imagery of sorghum
captured by a state-of-the-art gantry system, a multi-resolution network
architecture that learns both global and fine-grained features on the crops,
and a new global pooling strategy called Dynamic Outlier Pooling which
outperforms standard global pooling strategies on this task.</span>

learn dynamic models from time-series data in science and engineering
applications. This work aims at learning Neural ODE for stiff systems, which
are usually raised from chemical kinetic modeling in chemical and biological
systems. We first show the challenges of learning neural ODE in the classical
stiff ODE systems of Robertson&#x27;s problem and propose techniques to mitigate the
challenges associated with scale separations in stiff systems. We then present
successful demonstrations in stiff systems of Robertson&#x27;s problem and an air
pollution problem. The demonstrations show that the usage of deep networks with
rectified activations, proper scaling of the network outputs as well as loss
functions, and stabilized gradient calculations are the key techniques enabling
the learning of stiff neural ODE. The success of learning stiff neural ODE
opens up possibilities of using neural ODEs in applications with widely varying
time-scales, like chemical dynamics in energy conversion, environmental

a primal-dual based algorithm that achieves a problem-dependent logarithmic
regret bound. The BwK problem extends the multi-arm bandit (MAB) problem to
model the resource consumption associated with playing each arm, and the
existing BwK literature has been mainly focused on deriving asymptotically
optimal distribution-free regret bounds. We first study the primal and dual
linear programs underlying the BwK problem. From this primal-dual perspective,
we discover symmetry between arms and knapsacks, and then propose a new notion
of sub-optimality measure for the BwK problem. The sub-optimality measure
highlights the important role of knapsacks in determining algorithm regret and
inspires the design of our two-phase algorithm. In the first phase, the
algorithm identifies the optimal arms and the binding knapsacks, and in the
second phase, it exhausts the binding knapsacks via playing the optimal arms
through an adaptive procedure. Our regret upper bound involves the proposed
sub-optimality measure and it has a logarithmic dependence on length of horizon
$T$ and a polynomial dependence on $m$ (the numbers of arms) and $d$ (the
number of knapsacks). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
problem-dependent logarithmic regret bound for solving the general BwK problem.</span>

inference due to its computational efficiency and broad applicability. Crucial
to the performance of VI is the selection of the associated divergence measure,
as VI approximates the intractable distribution by minimizing this divergence.
In this paper we propose a meta-learning algorithm to learn the divergence
metric suited for the task of interest, automating the design of VI methods. In
addition, we learn the initialization of the variational parameters without
additional cost when our method is deployed in the few-shot learning scenarios.
We demonstrate our approach outperforms standard VI on Gaussian mixture

                                        <span>There has been a recent resurgence of interest in explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) that aims to reduce the opaqueness of AI-based
decision-making systems, allowing humans to scrutinize and trust them. Prior
work in this context has focused on the attribution of responsibility for an
algorithm&#x27;s decisions to its inputs wherein responsibility is typically
approached as a purely associational concept. In this paper, we propose a
principled causality-based approach for explaining black-box decision-making
systems that addresses limitations of existing methods in XAI. At the core of
our framework lies probabilistic contrastive counterfactuals, a concept that
can be traced back to philosophical, cognitive, and social foundations of
theories on how humans generate and select explanations. We show how such
counterfactuals can quantify the direct and indirect influences of a variable
on decisions made by an algorithm, and provide actionable recourse for
individuals negatively affected by the algorithm&#x27;s decision. Unlike prior work,
our system, LEWIS: (1)can compute provably effective explanations and recourse
at local, global and contextual levels (2)is designed to work with users with
varying levels of background knowledge of the underlying causal model and
(3)makes no assumptions about the internals of an algorithmic system except for
the availability of its input-output data. We empirically evaluate LEWIS on
three real-world datasets and show that it generates human-understandable
explanations that improve upon state-of-the-art approaches in XAI, including
the popular LIME and SHAP. Experiments on synthetic data further demonstrate
the correctness of LEWIS&#x27;s explanations and the scalability of its recourse
algorithm.</span>

application areas including gene regulatory networks inference, risk analysis
and image processing. Learning the structure of a Bayesian network (BNSL) from
discrete data is known to be an NP-hard task with a superexponential search
space of directed acyclic graphs. In this work, we propose a new polynomial
time algorithm for discovering a subset of all possible cluster cuts, a greedy
algorithm for approximately solving the resulting linear program, and a
generalised arc consistency algorithm for the acyclicity constraint. We embed
these in the constraint programmingbased branch-and-bound solver CPBayes and
show that, despite being suboptimal, they improve performance by orders of
magnitude. The resulting solver also compares favourably with GOBNILP, a
state-of-the-art solver for the BNSL problem which solves an NP-hard problem to
discover each cut and solves the linear program exactly.</span>

                                        <span>We show that learning can be improved by using loss functions that evolve
cyclically during training to emphasize one class at a time. In
underparameterized networks, such dynamical loss functions can lead to
successful training for networks that fail to find a deep minima of the
standard cross-entropy loss. In overparameterized networks, dynamical loss
functions can lead to better generalization. Improvement arises from the
interplay of the changing loss landscape with the dynamics of the system as it
evolves to minimize the loss. In particular, as the loss function oscillates,
instabilities develop in the form of bifurcation cascades, which we study using
the Hessian and Neural Tangent Kernel. Valleys in the landscape widen and
deepen, and then narrow and rise as the loss landscape changes during a cycle.
As the landscape narrows, the learning rate becomes too large and the network
becomes unstable and bounces around the valley. This process ultimately pushes
the system into deeper and wider regions of the loss landscape and is
characterized by decreasing eigenvalues of the Hessian. This results in better
regularized models with improved generalization performance.</span>

                                        <span>The goal of this work is to characterize the representational impact that
foveation operations have for machine vision systems, inspired by the foveated
human visual system, which has higher acuity at the center of gaze and
texture-like encoding in the periphery. To do so, we introduce models
consisting of a first-stage \textit{fixed} image transform followed by a
second-stage \textit{learnable} convolutional neural network, and we varied the
first stage component. The primary model has a foveated-textural input stage,
which we compare to a model with foveated-blurred input and a model with
spatially-uniform blurred input (both matched for perceptual compression), and
a final reference model with minimal input-based compression. We find that: 1)
the foveated-texture model shows similar scene classification accuracy as the
reference model despite its compressed input, with greater i.i.d.
generalization than the other models; 2) the foveated-texture model has greater
sensitivity to high-spatial frequency information and greater robustness to
occlusion, w.r.t the comparison models; 3) both the foveated systems, show a
stronger center image-bias relative to the spatially-uniform systems even with
a weight sharing constraint. Critically, these results are preserved over
different classical CNN architectures throughout their learning dynamics.
Altogether, this suggests that foveation with peripheral texture-based
computations yields an efficient, distinct, and robust representational format
of scene information, and provides symbiotic computational insight into the
representational consequences that texture-based peripheral encoding may have
for processing in the human visual system, while also potentially inspiring the
next generation of computer vision models via spatially-adaptive computation.

learning tasks, there is little understanding behind the structures that are
being captured by these embeddings. For example, we wonder if the topological
features, such as the Triangle Count, the Degree of the node and other
centrality measures are concretely encoded in the embeddings. Furthermore, we
ask if the presence of these structures in the embeddings is necessary for a
better performance on the downstream tasks, such as clustering and
classification. To address these questions, we conduct an extensive empirical
study over three classes of unsupervised graph embedding models and seven
different variants of Graph Autoencoders. Our results show that five
topological features: the Degree, the Local Clustering Score, the Betweenness
Centrality, the Eigenvector Centrality, and Triangle Count are concretely
preserved in the first layer of the graph autoencoder that employs the SUM
aggregation rule, under the condition that the model preserves the second-order
proximity. We supplement further evidence for the presence of these features by
revealing a hierarchy in the distribution of the topological features in the
embeddings of the aforementioned model. We also show that a model with such
properties can outperform other models on certain downstream tasks, especially
when the preserved features are relevant to the task at hand. Finally, we
evaluate the suitability of our findings through a test case study related to
social influence prediction.</span>

                                        <span>Transfer learning has become a common solution to address training data
scarcity in practice. It trains a specified student model by reusing or
fine-tuning early layers of a well-trained teacher model that is usually
publicly available. However, besides utility improvement, the transferred
public knowledge also brings potential threats to model confidentiality, and
even further raises other security and privacy issues.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation of the
teacher model exposure threat in the transfer learning context, aiming to gain
a deeper insight into the tension between public knowledge and model
confidentiality. To this end, we propose a teacher model fingerprinting attack
to infer the origin of a student model, i.e., the teacher model it transfers
from. Specifically, we propose a novel optimization-based method to carefully
generate queries to probe the student model to realize our attack. Unlike
existing model reverse engineering approaches, our proposed fingerprinting
method neither relies on fine-grained model outputs, e.g., posteriors, nor
auxiliary information of the model architecture or training dataset. We
systematically evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The empirical
results demonstrate that our attack can accurately identify the model origin
with few probing queries. Moreover, we show that the proposed attack can serve
as a stepping stone to facilitating other attacks against machine learning
models, such as model stealing.</span>

                                        <span>Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) results from chronic remodeling caused by
a broad range of systemic and cardiovascular disease including hypertension,
aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and cardiac amyloidosis. Early
detection and characterization of LVH can significantly impact patient care but
is limited by under-recognition of hypertrophy, measurement error and
variability, and difficulty differentiating etiologies of LVH. To overcome this
challenge, we present EchoNet-LVH - a deep learning workflow that automatically
quantifies ventricular hypertrophy with precision equal to human experts and
predicts etiology of LVH. Trained on 28,201 echocardiogram videos, our model
accurately measures intraventricular wall thickness (mean absolute error [MAE]
1.4mm, 95% CI 1.2-1.5mm), left ventricular diameter (MAE 2.4mm, 95% CI
2.2-2.6mm), and posterior wall thickness (MAE 1.2mm, 95% CI 1.1-1.3mm) and
classifies cardiac amyloidosis (area under the curve of 0.83) and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (AUC 0.98) from other etiologies of LVH. In external datasets
from independent domestic and international healthcare systems, EchoNet-LVH
accurately quantified ventricular parameters (R2 of 0.96 and 0.90 respectively)
and detected cardiac amyloidosis (AUC 0.79) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(AUC 0.89) on the domestic external validation site. Leveraging measurements
across multiple heart beats, our model can more accurately identify subtle
changes in LV geometry and its causal etiologies. Compared to human experts,
EchoNet-LVH is fully automated, allowing for reproducible, precise
measurements, and lays the foundation for precision diagnosis of cardiac
hypertrophy. As a resource to promote further innovation, we also make publicly
available a large dataset of 23,212 annotated echocardiogram videos.</span>

                                        <span>This paper studies task adaptive pre-trained model selection, an
underexplored problem of assessing pre-trained models for the target task and
select best ones from the model zoo \emph{without fine-tuning}. A few pilot
works addressed the problem in transferring supervised pre-trained models to
classification tasks, but they cannot handle emerging unsupervised pre-trained
models or regression tasks. In pursuit of a practical assessment method, we
propose to estimate the maximum value of label evidence given features
extracted by pre-trained models. Unlike the maximum likelihood, the maximum
evidence is \emph{immune to over-fitting}, while its expensive computation can
be dramatically reduced by our carefully designed algorithm. The Logarithm of
Maximum Evidence (LogME) can be used to assess pre-trained models for transfer
learning: a pre-trained model with a high LogME value is likely to have good
transfer performance. LogME is \emph{fast, accurate, and general},
characterizing itself as the first practical method for assessing pre-trained
models. Compared with brute-force fine-tuning, LogME brings at most
$3000\times$ speedup in wall-clock time and requires only $1\%$ memory
footprint. It outperforms prior methods by a large margin in their setting and
is applicable to new settings. It is general enough for diverse pre-trained
models (supervised pre-trained and unsupervised pre-trained), downstream tasks
(classification and regression), and modalities (vision and language). Code is

                                        <span>The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to SGD&#x27;s
mysterious ability to avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, as sharp
minima are known to lead to poor generalization. Recently, empirical evidence
of heavy-tailed gradient noise was reported in many deep learning tasks, and it
was shown in \c{S}im\c{s}ekli (2019a,b) that SGD can escape sharp local minima
under the presence of such heavy-tailed gradient noise, providing a partial
solution to the mystery. In this work, we analyze a popular variant of SGD
where gradients are truncated above a fixed threshold. We show that it achieves
a stronger notion of avoiding sharp minima: it can effectively eliminate sharp
local minima entirely from its training trajectory. We characterize the
dynamics of truncated SGD driven by heavy-tailed noises. First, we show that
the truncation threshold and width of the attraction field dictate the order of
the first exit time from the associated local minimum. Moreover, when the
objective function satisfies appropriate structural conditions, we prove that
as the learning rate decreases, the dynamics of heavy-tailed truncated SGD
closely resemble those of a continuous-time Markov chain that never visits any
sharp minima. Real data experiments on deep learning confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds a &quot;flatter&quot; local
minima and achieves better generalization.</span>

that deep learning is carried out in edge computing platforms. However, the
effectiveness of interpretability methods on these networks has not been
assessed.

In this paper, we compare the performance of several widely used saliency
map-based interpretabilty techniques (Gradient, SmoothGrad and GradCAM), when
applied to Binarized or Full Precision Neural Networks (FPNNs). We found that
the basic Gradient method produces very similar-looking maps for both types of
network. However, SmoothGrad produces significantly noisier maps for BNNs.
GradCAM also produces saliency maps which differ between network types, with
some of the BNNs having seemingly nonsensical explanations. We comment on
possible reasons for these differences in explanations and present it as an
example of why interpretability techniques should be tested on a wider range of
network types.</span>

high-dimensional objects. TN have recently shown their potential for machine
learning applications and offer a unifying view of common tensor decomposition
models such as Tucker, tensor train (TT) and tensor ring (TR). However,
identifying the best tensor network structure from data for a given task is
challenging. In this work, we leverage the TN formalism to develop a generic
and efficient adaptive algorithm to jointly learn the structure and the
parameters of a TN from data. Our method is based on a simple greedy approach
starting from a rank one tensor and successively identifying the most promising
tensor network edges for small rank increments. Our algorithm can adaptively
identify TN structures with small number of parameters that effectively
optimize any differentiable objective function. Experiments on tensor
decomposition, tensor completion and model compression tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In particular, our method outperforms
the state-of-the-art evolutionary topology search [Li and Sun, 2020] for tensor
decomposition of images (while being orders of magnitude faster) and finds
efficient tensor network structures to compress neural networks outperforming
popular TT based approaches [Novikov et al., 2015].</span>

                                        <span>We propose a new method for unsupervised continual knowledge consolidation in
generative models that relies on the partitioning of Variational Autoencoder&#x27;s
latent space. Acquiring knowledge about new data samples without forgetting
previous ones is a critical problem of continual learning. Currently proposed
methods achieve this goal by extending the existing model while constraining
its behavior not to degrade on the past data, which does not exploit the full
potential of relations within the entire training dataset. In this work, we
identify this limitation and posit the goal of continual learning as a
knowledge accumulation task. We solve it by continuously re-aligning latent
space partitions that we call bands which are representations of samples seen
in different tasks, driven by the similarity of the information they contain.
In addition, we introduce a simple yet effective method for controlled
forgetting of past data that improves the quality of reconstructions encoded in
latent bands and a latent space disentanglement technique that improves
knowledge consolidation. On top of the standard continual learning evaluation
benchmarks, we evaluate our method on a new knowledge consolidation scenario
and show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art by up to
twofold across all testing scenarios.</span>

layers in their designs. By implication, these ANNs hold too many parameters,
which needed unnecessarily trained without impacting the result. The features,
a convolutional layer can process, are strictly limited by its receptive field.
By layer-wise analyzing the expansion of the receptive fields, we can reliably
predict sequences of layers that will not contribute qualitatively to the

design strategies to resolve these inefficiencies, optimizing the

can train a neural network to learn an estimated map for its reverse process
from outputs to inputs. Combined with variational autoencoders, we can generate
new samples from the same statistics as the training data. Improvements of the
results are obtained by using concepts from generative adversarial networks.
Finally, we show that the technique can be modified for training neural
networks locally, saving computational memory resources. Applying these
techniques, we report results for three vision generative tasks: MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and celebA.</span>

                                        <span>We present a novel approach to the problem of text style transfer. Unlike
previous approaches requiring style-labeled training data, our method makes use
of readily-available unlabeled text by relying on the implicit connection in
style between adjacent sentences, and uses labeled data only at inference time.
We adapt T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), a strong pretrained text-to-text model, to
extract a style vector from text and use it to condition the decoder to perform
style transfer. As our label-free training results in a style vector space
encoding many facets of style, we recast transfers as &quot;targeted restyling&quot;
vector operations that adjust specific attributes of the input while preserving
others. We demonstrate that training on unlabeled Amazon reviews data results
in a model that is competitive on sentiment transfer, even compared to models
trained fully on labeled data. Furthermore, applying our novel method to a
diverse corpus of unlabeled web text results in a single model capable of
transferring along multiple dimensions of style (dialect, emotiveness,
formality, politeness, sentiment) despite no additional training and using only
a handful of exemplars at inference time.</span>

Descent and Mirrored Stein Variational Gradient Descent minimize the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to constrained target distributions by
evolving particles in a dual space defined by a mirror map. Stein Variational
Natural Gradient exploits non-Euclidean geometry to more efficiently minimize

We demonstrate that these new samplers yield accurate approximations to

blocklists, which leave a &#x60;&#x60;window of opportunity&#x27;&#x27; for attackers during which
victims are unprotected. One possible approach to shorten this window aims to
detect phishing attacks earlier, during website preparation, by monitoring
Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. Previous attempts to work with CT log data
for phishing classification exist, however they lack evaluations on actual CT
log data. In this paper, we present a pipeline that facilitates such
evaluations by addressing a number of problems when working with CT log data.
The pipeline includes dataset creation, training, and past or live
classification of CT logs. Its modular structure makes it possible to easily
exchange classifiers or verification sources to support ground truth labeling
efforts and classifier comparisons. We test the pipeline on a number of new and
existing classifiers, and find a general potential to improve classifiers for
this scenario in the future. We publish the source code of the pipeline and the
used datasets along with this paper

resource usage is known as one of the greatest causes of high energy
consumption in cloud data centers. Resource allocation in cloud data centers
aiming to reduce energy consumption has been conducted using live migration of
Virtual Machines (VMs) and their consolidation into the small number of
Physical Machines (PMs). However, the selection of the appropriate VM for
migration is an important challenge. To solve this issue, VMs can be classified
according to the pattern of user requests into sensitive or insensitive classes
to latency, and thereafter suitable VMs can be selected for migration. In this
paper, the combination of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent
Unit (GRU) is utilized for the classification of VMs in the Microsoft Azure
dataset. Due to the fact the majority of VMs in this dataset are labeled as
insensitive to latency, migration of more VMs in this group not only reduces
energy consumption but also decreases the violation of Service Level Agreements
(SLA). Based on the empirical results, the proposed model obtained an accuracy
of 95.18which clearly demonstrates the superiority of our proposed model
compared to other existing models.</span>

linear growth of memory consumption for storing the embedding matrix and incurs
high computational costs when working with real-world KGs. Drawing parallels
with subword tokenization commonly used in NLP, we explore the landscape of
more parameter-efficient node embedding strategies with possibly sublinear

subword/sub-entity units is constructed from anchor nodes in a graph with known
relation types. Given such a fixed-size vocabulary, it is possible to bootstrap
an encoding and embedding for any entity, including those unseen during

                                        <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained considerable attention
owing to their ability to reproduce images. However, they can recreate training
images faithfully despite image degradation in the form of blur, noise, and
compression, generating similarly degraded images. To solve this problem, the
recently proposed noise robust GAN (NR-GAN) provides a partial solution by
demonstrating the ability to learn a clean image generator directly from noisy
images using a two-generator model comprising image and noise generators.
However, its application is limited to noise, which is relatively easy to
decompose owing to its additive and reversible characteristics, and its
application to irreversible image degradation, in the form of blur,
compression, and combination of all, remains a challenge. To address these
problems, we propose blur, noise, and compression robust GAN (BNCR-GAN) that
can learn a clean image generator directly from degraded images without
knowledge of degradation parameters (e.g., blur kernel types, noise amounts, or
quality factor values). Inspired by NR-GAN, BNCR-GAN uses a multiple-generator
model composed of image, blur-kernel, noise, and quality-factor generators.
However, in contrast to NR-GAN, to address irreversible characteristics, we
introduce masking architectures adjusting degradation strength values in a
data-driven manner using bypasses before and after degradation. Furthermore, to
suppress uncertainty caused by the combination of blur, noise, and compression,
we introduce adaptive consistency losses imposing consistency between
irreversible degradation processes according to the degradation strengths. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of BNCR-GAN through large-scale comparative
studies on CIFAR-10 and a generality analysis on FFHQ. In addition, we
demonstrate the applicability of BNCR-GAN in image restoration.</span>

                                        <span>Reflecting on the last few years, the biggest breakthroughs in deep
reinforcement learning (RL) have been in the discrete action domain. Robotic
manipulation, however, is inherently a continuous control environment, but
these continuous control reinforcement learning algorithms often depend on
actor-critic methods that are sample-inefficient and inherently difficult to
train, due to the joint optimisation of the actor and critic. To that end, we
explore how we can bring the stability of discrete action RL algorithms to the
robot manipulation domain. We extend the recently released ARM algorithm, by
replacing the continuous next-best pose agent with a discrete next-best pose
agent. Discretisation of rotation is trivial given its bounded nature, while
translation is inherently unbounded, making discretisation difficult. We
formulate the translation prediction as the voxel prediction problem by
discretising the 3D space; however, voxelisation of a large workspace is memory
intensive and would not work with a high density of voxels, crucial to
obtaining the resolution needed for robotic manipulation. We therefore propose
to apply this voxel prediction in a coarse-to-fine manner by gradually
increasing the resolution. In each step, we extract the highest valued voxel as
the predicted location, which is then used as the centre of the
higher-resolution voxelisation in the next step. This coarse-to-fine prediction
is applied over several steps, giving a near-lossless prediction of the
translation. We show that our new coarse-to-fine algorithm is able to
accomplish RLBench tasks much more efficiently than the continuous control
equivalent, and even train some real-world tasks, tabular rasa, in less than 7
minutes, with only 3 demonstrations. Moreover, we show that by moving to a
voxel representation, we are able to easily incorporate observations from

demonstrations or artificially created agents in order to replicate their
behaviors. Its success has been demonstrated in areas such as video games,
autonomous driving, robotic simulations and object manipulation. However, this
replicating process could be problematic, such as the performance is highly
dependent on the demonstration quality, and most trained agents are limited to
perform well in task-specific environments. In this survey, we provide a
systematic review on imitation learning. We first introduce the background
knowledge from development history and preliminaries, followed by presenting
different taxonomies within Imitation Learning and key milestones of the field.
We then detail challenges in learning strategies and present research
opportunities with learning policy from suboptimal demonstration, voice
instructions and other associated optimization schemes.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-action restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) are a powerful framework
for constrained resource allocation in which $N$ independent processes are
managed. However, previous work only study the offline setting where problem
dynamics are known. We address this restrictive assumption, designing the first
algorithms for learning good policies for Multi-action RMABs online using
combinations of Lagrangian relaxation and Q-learning. Our first approach,
MAIQL, extends a method for Q-learning the Whittle index in binary-action RMABs
to the multi-action setting. We derive a generalized update rule and
convergence proof and establish that, under standard assumptions, MAIQL
converges to the asymptotically optimal multi-action RMAB policy as
$t\rightarrow{}\infty$. However, MAIQL relies on learning Q-functions and
indexes on two timescales which leads to slow convergence and requires problem
structure to perform well. Thus, we design a second algorithm, LPQL, which
learns the well-performing and more general Lagrange policy for multi-action
RMABs by learning to minimize the Lagrange bound through a variant of
Q-learning. To ensure fast convergence, we take an approximation strategy that
enables learning on a single timescale, then give a guarantee relating the
approximation&#x27;s precision to an upper bound of LPQL&#x27;s return as
$t\rightarrow{}\infty$. Finally, we show that our approaches always outperform
baselines across multiple settings, including one derived from real-world
medication adherence data.</span>

                                        <span>The transition matrix, denoting the transition relationship from clean labels
to noisy labels, is essential to build statistically consistent classifiers in
label-noise learning. Existing methods for estimating the transition matrix
rely heavily on estimating the noisy class posterior. However, the estimation
error for noisy class posterior could be large due to the randomness of label
noise, which would lead the transition matrix to be poorly estimated.
Therefore, in this paper, we aim to solve this problem by exploiting the
divide-and-conquer paradigm. Specifically, we introduce an intermediate class
to avoid directly estimating the noisy class posterior. By this intermediate
class, the original transition matrix can then be factorized into the product
of two easy-to-estimate transition matrices. We term the proposed method the
dual-T estimator. Both theoretical analyses and empirical results illustrate
the effectiveness of the dual-T estimator for estimating transition matrices,
leading to better classification performances.</span>

inputs. Here we demonstrate a problem of machine learning in vital application
areas such as medical informatics or patent law that consists of the inclusion
of measurements on which target outputs are deterministically defined in the
representations of input data. This leads to perfect, but circular predictions
based on a machine reconstruction of the known target definition, but fails on
real-world data where the defining measurements may not or only incompletely be
available. We present a circularity test that shows, for given datasets and
black-box machine learning models, whether the target functional definition can
be reconstructed and has been used in training. We argue that a transfer of
research results to real-world applications requires to avoid circularity by
separating measurements that define target outcomes from data representations
in machine learning.</span>

                                        <span>The outbreak of COVID-19 Disease due to the novel coronavirus has caused a
shortage of medical resources. To aid and accelerate the diagnosis process,
automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 via deep learning models has recently been
explored by researchers across the world. While different data-driven deep
learning models have been developed to mitigate the diagnosis of COVID-19, the
data itself is still scarce due to patient privacy concerns. Federated Learning
(FL) is a natural solution because it allows different organizations to
cooperatively learn an effective deep learning model without sharing raw data.
However, recent studies show that FL still lacks privacy protection and may
cause data leakage. We investigate this challenging problem by proposing a
simple yet effective algorithm, named \textbf{F}ederated \textbf{L}earning
\textbf{o}n Medical Datasets using \textbf{P}artial Networks (FLOP), that
shares only a partial model between the server and clients. Extensive
experiments on benchmark data and real-world healthcare tasks show that our
approach achieves comparable or better performance while reducing the privacy
and security risks. Of particular interest, we conduct experiments on the
COVID-19 dataset and find that our FLOP algorithm can allow different hospitals
to collaboratively and effectively train a partially shared model without
sharing local patients&#x27; data.</span>

                                        <span>The increasing computational requirements of deep neural networks (DNNs) have
led to significant interest in obtaining DNN models that are sparse, yet
accurate. Recent work has investigated the even harder case of sparse training,
where the DNN weights are, for as much as possible, already sparse to reduce
computational costs during training.

Existing sparse training methods are mainly empirical and often have lower
accuracy relative to the dense baseline. In this paper, we present a general
approach called Alternating Compressed/DeCompressed (AC/DC) training of DNNs,
demonstrate convergence for a variant of the algorithm, and show that AC/DC
outperforms existing sparse training methods in accuracy at similar
computational budgets; at high sparsity levels, AC/DC even outperforms existing
methods that rely on accurate pre-trained dense models. An important property
of AC/DC is that it allows co-training of dense and sparse models, yielding
accurate sparse-dense model pairs at the end of the training process. This is
useful in practice, where compressed variants may be desirable for deployment
in resource-constrained settings without re-doing the entire training flow, and
also provides us with insights into the accuracy gap between dense and
compressed models.</span>

necessary and sufficient condition for learning objectives to be compatible

                                        <span>Fine-scale simulation of complex systems governed by multiscale partial
differential equations (PDEs) is computationally expensive and various
multiscale methods have been developed for addressing such problems. In
addition, it is challenging to develop accurate surrogate and uncertainty
quantification models for high-dimensional problems governed by stochastic
multiscale PDEs using limited training data. In this work to address these
challenges, we introduce a novel hybrid deep-learning and multiscale approach
for stochastic multiscale PDEs with limited training data. For demonstration
purposes, we focus on a porous media flow problem. We use an image-to-image
supervised deep learning model to learn the mapping between the input
permeability field and the multiscale basis functions. We introduce a Bayesian
approach to this hybrid framework to allow us to perform uncertainty
quantification and propagation tasks. The performance of this hybrid approach
is evaluated with varying intrinsic dimensionality of the permeability field.
Numerical results indicate that the hybrid network can efficiently predict well
for high-dimensional inputs.</span>

deep learning models in an open-world setting. However, existing OOD detection
solutions can be brittle in the open world, facing various types of adversarial
OOD inputs. While methods leveraging auxiliary OOD data have emerged, our
analysis on illuminative examples reveals a key insight that the majority of
auxiliary OOD examples may not meaningfully improve or even hurt the decision
boundary of the OOD detector, which is also observed in empirical results on
real data. In this paper, we provide a theoretically motivated method,
Adversarial Training with informative Outlier Mining (ATOM), which improves the
robustness of OOD detection. We show that, by mining informative auxiliary OOD
data, one can significantly improve OOD detection performance, and somewhat
surprisingly, generalize to unseen adversarial attacks. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance under a broad family of classic and adversarial
OOD evaluation tasks. For example, on the CIFAR-10 in-distribution dataset,
ATOM reduces the FPR (at TPR 95%) by up to 57.99% under adversarial OOD inputs,
surpassing the previous best baseline by a large margin.</span>

interpretability of connectionist architectures, have been reported in the
recent literature. However, our understanding of how to design Bayesian Deep
Learning (BDL) hyperparameters, specifically, the depth, width and ensemble
size, for robust function mapping with uncertainty quantification, is still
emerging. This paper attempts to further our understanding by mapping Bayesian
connectionist representations to polynomials of different orders with varying
noise types and ratios. We examine the noise-contaminated polynomials to search
for the combination of hyperparameters that can extract the underlying
polynomial signals while quantifying uncertainties based on the noise
attributes. Specifically, we attempt to study the question that an appropriate
neural architecture and ensemble configuration can be found to detect a signal
of any n-th order polynomial contaminated with noise having different
distributions and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios and varying noise attributes.
Our results suggest the possible existence of an optimal network depth as well
as an optimal number of ensembles for prediction skills and uncertainty
quantification, respectively. However, optimality is not discernible for width,
even though the performance gain reduces with increasing width at high values
of width. Our experiments and insights can be directional to understand
theoretical properties of BDL representations and to design practical
solutions.</span>

adults which has been on a constant rise. Elderly people have several needs and
requirements due to physical disabilities, cognitive issues, weakened memory
and disorganized behavior, that they face with increasing age. The extent of
these limitations also differs according to the varying diversities in elderly,
which include age, gender, background, experience, skills, knowledge and so on.
These varying needs and challenges with increasing age, limits abilities of
older adults to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in an independent
manner. To add to it, the shortage of caregivers creates a looming need for
technology-based services for elderly people, to assist them in performing
their daily routine tasks to sustain their independent living and active aging.
To address these needs, this work consists of making three major contributions
in this field. First, it provides a rather comprehensive review of assisted
living technologies aimed at helping elderly people to perform ADLs. Second,
the work discusses the challenges identified through this review, that
currently exist in the context of implementation of assisted living services
for elderly care in Smart Homes and Smart Cities. Finally, the work also
outlines an approach for implementation, extension and integration of the
existing works in this field for development of a much-needed framework that
can provide personalized assistance and user-centered behavior interventions to
elderly as per their varying and ever-changing needs.</span>

for automatic speech recognition (ASR). These models formulate the
sequence-level probability as a product of the conditional probabilities of all
individual tokens given their histories. However, the performance of locally
normalised models can be sub-optimal because of factors such as exposure bias.
Consequently, the model distribution differs from the underlying data
distribution. In this paper, the residual energy-based model (R-EBM) is
proposed to complement the auto-regressive ASR model to close the gap between
the two distributions. Meanwhile, R-EBMs can also be regarded as
utterance-level confidence estimators, which may benefit many downstream tasks.
Experiments on a 100hr LibriSpeech dataset show that R-EBMs can reduce the word
error rates (WERs) by 8.2%/6.7% while improving areas under precision-recall
curves of confidence scores by 12.6%/28.4% on test-clean/test-other sets.
Furthermore, on a state-of-the-art model using self-supervised learning
(wav2vec 2.0), R-EBMs still significantly improves both the WER and confidence
estimation performance.</span>

$k$-Median and $k$-Means) in the context of individual fairness. The dataset
consists of $n$ points, and we want to find $k$ centers such that (a) the
objective is minimized, while (b) respecting the individual fairness constraint
that every point $v$ has a center within a distance at most $r(v)$, where
$r(v)$ is $v$&#x27;s distance to its $(n/k)$th nearest point. Jung, Kannan, and Lutz
[FORC 2020] introduced this concept and designed a clustering algorithm with
provable (approximate) fairness and objective guarantees for the $\ell_\infty$
or $k$-Center objective. Mahabadi and Vakilian [ICML 2020] revisited this
problem to give a local-search algorithm for all $\ell_p$-norms. Empirically,
their algorithms outperform Jung et. al.&#x27;s by a large margin in terms of cost
(for $k$-Median and $k$-Means), but they incur a reasonable loss in fairness.
In this paper, our main contribution is to use Linear Programming (LP)
techniques to obtain better algorithms for this problem, both in theory and in
practice. We prove that by modifying known LP rounding techniques, one gets a
worst-case guarantee on the objective which is much better than in MV20, and
empirically, this objective is extremely close to the optimal. Furthermore, our
theoretical fairness guarantees are comparable with MV20 in theory, and
empirically, we obtain noticeably fairer solutions. Although solving the LP
{\em exactly} might be prohibitive, we demonstrate that in practice, a simple
sparsification technique drastically improves the run-time of our algorithm.</span>

an underdetermined system of noisy linear equations. In analogy to classical
compressed sensing, here we assume a generative model as a prior, that is, we
assume the vector is represented by a deep generative model $G: \mathbb{R}^k
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$. Classical recovery approaches such as empirical risk
minimization (ERM) are guaranteed to succeed when the measurement matrix is
sub-Gaussian. However, when the measurement matrix and measurements are
heavy-tailed or have outliers, recovery may fail dramatically. In this paper we
propose an algorithm inspired by the Median-of-Means (MOM). Our algorithm
guarantees recovery for heavy-tailed data, even in the presence of outliers.
Theoretically, our results show our novel MOM-based algorithm enjoys the same
sample complexity guarantees as ERM under sub-Gaussian assumptions. Our
experiments validate both aspects of our claims: other algorithms are indeed
fragile and fail under heavy-tailed and/or corrupted data, while our approach
exhibits the predicted robustness.</span>

differential privacy is an integral component of various private data analysis
tasks. In this paper, we present the oneshot Laplace mechanism, which
generalizes the well-known Report Noisy Max mechanism to reporting noisy
top-$k$ elements. We show that the oneshot Laplace mechanism with a noise level
of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k}/\eps)$ is approximately differentially private.
Compared to the previous peeling approach of running Report Noisy Max $k$
times, the oneshot Laplace mechanism only adds noises and computes the top $k$
elements once, hence much more efficient for large $k$. In addition, our proof
of privacy relies on a novel coupling technique that bypasses the use of
composition theorems. Finally, we present a novel application of efficient
top-$k$ selection in the classical problem of ranking from pairwise

                                        <span>The renaissance of artificial neural networks was catalysed by the success of
classification models, tagged by the community with the broader term supervised
learning. The extraordinary results gave rise to a hype loaded with ambitious
promises and overstatements. Soon the community realised that the success owed
much to the availability of thousands of labelled examples and supervised
learning went, for many, from glory to shame: Some criticised deep learning as
a whole and others proclaimed that the way forward had to be alternatives to
supervised learning: predictive, unsupervised, semi-supervised and, more
recently, self-supervised learning. However, all these seem brand names, rather
than actual categories of a theoretically grounded taxonomy. Moreover, the call
to banish supervised learning was motivated by the questionable claim that
humans learn with little or no supervision and are capable of robust
out-of-distribution generalisation. Here, we review insights about learning and
supervision in nature, revisit the notion that learning and generalisation are
not possible without supervision or inductive biases and argue that we will
make better progress if we just call it by its name.</span>

libraries, data science and machine learning due to its importance in keeping
pace with the significant increase of published papers every year from one side
and to the inherent challenges from the other side. This processing has several
aspects including but not limited to I) Automatic extraction of references from
PDF documents, II) Building an accurate citation graph, III) Author name

in both structured (e.g. citation graph) and unstructured (e.g. publications)

online learning when forecasting in financial time series. We consider the
sequential and continual learning sub-genres of online learning. The
experiments we conduct show that there is a benefit to online transfer
learning, in the form of radial basis function networks, beyond the sequential
updating of recursive least-squares models. We show that the radial basis
function networks, which make use of clustering algorithms to construct a
kernel Gram matrix, are more beneficial than treating each training vector as
separate basis functions, as occurs with kernel Ridge regression. We
demonstrate quantitative procedures to determine the very structure of the
radial basis function networks. Finally, we conduct experiments on the log
returns of financial time series and show that the online learning models,
particularly the radial basis function networks, are able to outperform a
random walk baseline, whereas the offline learning models struggle to do so.</span>

                                        <span>This work tackles the issue of fairness in the context of generative
procedures, such as image super-resolution, which entail different definitions
from the standard classification setting. Moreover, while traditional group
fairness definitions are typically defined with respect to specified protected
groups -- camouflaging the fact that these groupings are artificial and carry
historical and political motivations -- we emphasize that there are no ground
truth identities. For instance, should South and East Asians be viewed as a
single group or separate groups? Should we consider one race as a whole or
further split by gender? Choosing which groups are valid and who belongs in
them is an impossible dilemma and being &#x60;&#x60;fair&#x27;&#x27; with respect to Asians may
require being &#x60;&#x60;unfair&#x27;&#x27; with respect to South Asians. This motivates the
introduction of definitions that allow algorithms to be \emph{oblivious} to the
relevant groupings.

We define several intuitive notions of group fairness and study their
incompatibilities and trade-offs. We show that the natural extension of
demographic parity is strongly dependent on the grouping, and \emph{impossible}
to achieve obliviously. On the other hand, the conceptually new definition we
introduce, Conditional Proportional Representation, can be achieved obliviously
through Posterior Sampling. Our experiments validate our theoretical results
and achieve fair image reconstruction using state-of-the-art generative models.</span>

                                        <span>The move from boxed products to services and the widespread adoption of cloud
computing has had a huge impact on the software development life cycle and
DevOps processes. Particularly, incident management has become critical for
developing and operating large-scale services. Prior work on incident
management has heavily focused on the challenges with incident triaging and
de-duplication. In this work, we address the fundamental problem of structured
knowledge extraction from service incidents. We have built SoftNER, a framework
for mining Knowledge Graphs from incident reports. First, we build a novel
multi-task learning based BiLSTM-CRF model which leverages not just the
semantic context but also the data-types for extracting factual information in
the form of named entities. Next, we present an approach to mine relations
between the named entities for automatically constructing knowledge graphs. We
have deployed SoftNER at Microsoft, a major cloud service provider and have
evaluated it on more than 2 months of cloud incidents. We show that the
unsupervised machine learning pipeline has a high precision of 0.96. Our
multi-task learning based deep learning model also outperforms the
state-of-the-art NER models. Lastly, using the knowledge extracted by SoftNER,
we are able to build accurate models for applications such as incident triaging
and recommending entities based on their relevance to incident titles.</span>

constraints for articulated rigid body simulation. Our differentiable physics
engine offers a complete set of features that are typically only available in
non-differentiable physics simulators commonly used by robotics applications.
We solve contact constraints precisely using linear complementarity problems

formulation of inelastic contact that exploit the sparsity of the LCP solution.
We support complex contact geometry, and gradients approximating
continuous-time elastic collision. We also introduce a novel method to compute
complementarity-aware gradients that help downstream optimization tasks avoid
stalling in saddle points. We show that an implementation of this combination

learning by conducting a larger scale experiment. Second, we introduce an

asymptotic properties of the marginal effects estimators and finite-sample
regret guarantees of the policy. Finally, we illustrate the method&#x27;s advantage

                                        <span>A deep learning approach is proposed to detect data and system anomalies
using high-resolution continuous point-on-wave (CPOW) or phasor measurements.
Both the anomaly and anomaly-free measurement models are assumed to have
unknown temporal dependencies and probability distributions. Historical
training samples are assumed for the anomaly-free model, while no training
samples are available for the anomaly measurements. By transforming the
anomaly-free observations into uniform independent and identically distributed
sequences via a generative adversarial network, the proposed approach deploys a
uniformity test for anomaly detection at the sensor level. A distributed
detection scheme that combines sensor level detections at the control center is
also proposed that combines local detections to form more reliable detections.
Numerical results demonstrate significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
solutions for various bad-data cases using real and synthetic CPOW and PMU data

                                        <span>As machine learning models grow more complex and their applications become
more high-stakes, tools for explaining model predictions have become
increasingly important. Despite the widespread use of explainability
techniques, evaluating and comparing different feature attribution methods
remains challenging: evaluations ideally require human studies, and empirical
evaluation metrics are often computationally prohibitive on real-world
datasets. In this work, we address this issue by releasing XAI-Bench: a suite
of synthetic datasets along with a library for benchmarking feature attribution
algorithms. Unlike real-world datasets, synthetic datasets allow the efficient
computation of conditional expected values that are needed to evaluate
ground-truth Shapley values and other metrics. The synthetic datasets we
release offer a wide variety of parameters that can be configured to simulate
real-world data. We demonstrate the power of our library by benchmarking
popular explainability techniques across several evaluation metrics and
identifying failure modes for popular explainers. The efficiency of our library
will help bring new explainability methods from development to deployment.</span>

                                        <span>Recently, visual Transformer (ViT) and its following works abandon the
convolution and exploit the self-attention operation, attaining a comparable or
even higher accuracy than CNNs. More recently, MLP-Mixer abandons both the
convolution and the self-attention operation, proposing an architecture
containing only MLP layers. To achieve cross-patch communications, it devises
an additional token-mixing MLP besides the channel-mixing MLP. It achieves
promising results when training on an extremely large-scale dataset. But it
cannot achieve as outstanding performance as its CNN and ViT counterparts when
training on medium-scale datasets such as ImageNet1K and ImageNet21K. The
performance drop of MLP-Mixer motivates us to rethink the token-mixing MLP. We
discover that the token-mixing MLP is a variant of the depthwise convolution
with a global reception field and spatial-specific configuration. But the
global reception field and the spatial-specific property make token-mixing MLP
prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel pure MLP architecture,
spatial-shift MLP (S$^2$-MLP). Different from MLP-Mixer, our S$^2$-MLP only
contains channel-mixing MLP. We utilize a spatial-shift operation for
communications between patches. It has a local reception field and is
spatial-agnostic. It is parameter-free and efficient for computation. The
proposed S$^2$-MLP attains higher recognition accuracy than MLP-Mixer when
training on ImageNet-1K dataset. Meanwhile, S$^2$-MLP accomplishes as excellent
performance as ViT on ImageNet-1K dataset with considerably simpler
architecture and fewer FLOPs and parameters.</span>

                                        <span>Deep neural networks are behind many of the recent successes in machine
learning applications. However, these models can produce overconfident
decisions while encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) examples or making a
wrong prediction. This inconsistent predictive confidence limits the
integration of independently-trained learning models into a larger system. This
paper introduces separable concept learning framework to realistically measure
the performance of classifiers in presence of OOD examples. In this setup,
several instances of a classifier are trained on different parts of a partition
of the set of classes. Later, the performance of the combination of these
models is evaluated on a separate test set. Unlike current OOD detection
techniques, this framework does not require auxiliary OOD datasets and does not
separate classification from detection performance. Furthermore, we present a
new strong baseline for more consistent predictive confidence in deep models,
called fitted ensembles, where overconfident predictions are rectified by
transformed versions of the original classification task. Fitted ensembles can
naturally detect OOD examples without requiring auxiliary data by observing
contradicting predictions among its components. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN,
CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet show fitted ensemble significantly outperform
conventional ensembles on OOD examples and are possible to scale.</span>

                                        <span>Multimodal VAEs seek to model the joint distribution over heterogeneous data
(e.g.\ vision, language), whilst also capturing a shared representation across
such modalities. Prior work has typically combined information from the
modalities by reconciling idiosyncratic representations directly in the
recognition model through explicit products, mixtures, or other such
factorisations. Here we introduce a novel alternative, the MEME, that avoids
such explicit combinations by repurposing semi-supervised VAEs to combine
information between modalities implicitly through mutual supervision. This
formulation naturally allows learning from partially-observed data where some
modalities can be entirely missing -- something that most existing approaches
either cannot handle, or do so to a limited extent. We demonstrate that MEME
outperforms baselines on standard metrics across both partial and complete
observation schemes on the MNIST-SVHN (image--image) and CUB (image--text)
datasets. We also contrast the quality of the representations learnt by mutual
supervision against standard approaches and observe interesting trends in its
ability to capture relatedness between data.</span>

researchers increasingly resort to machine learning to aid original scientific
discovery. Given large amounts of observational data about a system, can we
uncover the rules that govern its evolution? Solving this task holds the great
promise of fully understanding the causal interactions and being able to make
reliable predictions about the system&#x27;s behavior under interventions. We take a
step towards answering this question for time-series data generated from
systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While the governing ODEs
might not be identifiable from data alone, we show that combining simple
regularization schemes with flexible neural ODEs can robustly recover the
dynamics and causal structures from time-series data. Our results on a variety
of (non)-linear first and second order systems as well as real data validate
our method. We conclude by showing that we can also make accurate predictions
under interventions on variables or the system itself.</span>

diabetic patients. DR is a microvascular disease that affects the eye retina,
which causes vessel blockage and therefore cuts the main source of nutrition
for the retina tissues. Treatment for this visual disorder is most effective
when it is detected in its earliest stages, as severe DR can result in
irreversible blindness. Nonetheless, DR identification requires the expertise
of Ophthalmologists which is often expensive and time-consuming. Therefore,
automatic detection systems were introduced aiming to facilitate the
identification process, making it available globally in a time and
cost-efficient manner. However, due to the limited reliable datasets and
medical records for this particular eye disease, the obtained predictions
accuracies were relatively unsatisfying for eye specialists to rely on them as
diagnostic systems. Thus, we explored an ensemble-based learning strategy,
merging a substantial selection of well-known classification algorithms in one
sophisticated diagnostic model. The proposed framework achieved the highest
accuracy rates among all other common classification algorithms in the area. 4
subdatasets were generated to contain the top 5 and top 10 features of the

                                        <span>The formation of precipitation in state-of-the-art weather and climate models
is an important process. The understanding of its relationship with other
variables can lead to endless benefits, particularly for the world&#x27;s monsoon
regions dependent on rainfall as a support for livelihood. Various factors play
a crucial role in the formation of rainfall, and those physical processes are
leading to significant biases in the operational weather forecasts. We use the
UNET architecture of a deep convolutional neural network with residual learning
as a proof of concept to learn global data-driven models of precipitation. The
models are trained on reanalysis datasets projected on the cubed-sphere
projection to minimize errors due to spherical distortion. The results are
compared with the operational dynamical model used by the India Meteorological
Department. The theoretical deep learning-based model shows doubling of the
grid point, as well as area averaged skill measured in Pearson correlation
coefficients relative to operational system. This study is a proof-of-concept
showing that residual learning-based UNET can unravel physical relationships to
target precipitation, and those physical constraints can be used in the
dynamical operational models towards improved precipitation forecasts. Our
results pave the way for the development of online, hybrid models in the
future.</span>

nodes, a phenomenon that is only partially alleviated by backfill scheduling
methods that promote small jobs to run before large jobs. Here we describe how
to realize a novel use for these otherwise wasted resources, namely, deep
neural network (DNN) training. This important workload is easily organized as
many small fragments that can be configured dynamically to fit essentially any
node*time hole in a supercomputer&#x27;s schedule. We describe how the task of
rescaling suitable DNN training tasks to fit dynamically changing holes can be
formulated as a deterministic mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based
resource allocation algorithm, and show that this MILP problem can be solved
efficiently at run time. We show further how this MILP problem can be adapted
to optimize for administrator- or user-defined metrics. We validate our method
with supercomputer scheduler logs and different DNN training scenarios, and
demonstrate efficiencies of up to 93% compared with running the same training
tasks on dedicated nodes. Our method thus enables substantial supercomputer
resources to be allocated to DNN training with no impact on other applications.</span>

                                        <span>Self-training based unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has shown great
potential to address the problem of domain shift, when applying a trained deep
learning model in a source domain to unlabeled target domains. However, while
the self-training UDA has demonstrated its effectiveness on discriminative
tasks, such as classification and segmentation, via the reliable pseudo-label
selection based on the softmax discrete histogram, the self-training UDA for
generative tasks, such as image synthesis, is not fully investigated. In this
work, we propose a novel generative self-training (GST) UDA framework with
continuous value prediction and regression objective for cross-domain image
synthesis. Specifically, we propose to filter the pseudo-label with an
uncertainty mask, and quantify the predictive confidence of generated images
with practical variational Bayes learning. The fast test-time adaptation is
achieved by a round-based alternative optimization scheme. We validated our
framework on the tagged-to-cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) synthesis
problem, where datasets in the source and target domains were acquired from
different scanners or centers. Extensive validations were carried out to verify
our framework against popular adversarial training UDA methods. Results show
that our GST, with tagged MRI of test subjects in new target domains, improved
the synthesis quality by a large margin, compared with the adversarial training
UDA methods.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MUDA) is a recently explored
learning framework, where the goal is to address the challenge of labeled data
scarcity in a target domain via transferring knowledge from multiple source
domains with annotated data. Since the source data is distributed, the privacy
of source domains&#x27; data can be a natural concern. We benefit from the idea of
domain alignment in an embedding space to address the privacy concern for MUDA.
Our method is based on aligning the sources and target distributions indirectly
via internally learned distributions, without communicating data samples
between domains. We justify our approach theoretically and perform extensive
experiments to demonstrate that our method is effective and compares favorably
against existing methods.</span>

establish a connection to their command and control (C2) server. Counteracting
DGAs, several machine learning classifiers have been proposed enabling the
identification of the DGA that generated a specific domain name and thus
triggering targeted remediation measures. However, the proposed
state-of-the-art classifiers are based on deep learning models. The black box
nature of these makes it difficult to evaluate their reasoning. The resulting
lack of confidence makes the utilization of such models impracticable. In this
paper, we propose EXPLAIN, a feature-based and contextless DGA multiclass
classifier. We comparatively evaluate several combinations of feature sets and
hyperparameters for our approach against several state-of-the-art classifiers
in a unified setting on the same real-world data. Our classifier achieves
competitive results, is real-time capable, and its predictions are easier to
trace back to features than the predictions made by the DGA multiclass

                                        <span>Many machine learning techniques incorporate identity-preserving
transformations into their models to generalize their performance to previously
unseen data. These transformations are typically selected from a set of
functions that are known to maintain the identity of an input when applied
(e.g., rotation, translation, flipping, and scaling). However, there are many
natural variations that cannot be labeled for supervision or defined through
examination of the data. As suggested by the manifold hypothesis, many of these
natural variations live on or near a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold.
Several techniques represent manifold variations through a set of learned Lie
group operators that define directions of motion on the manifold. However
theses approaches are limited because they require transformation labels when
training their models and they lack a method for determining which regions of
the manifold are appropriate for applying each specific operator. We address
these limitations by introducing a learning strategy that does not require
transformation labels and developing a method that learns the local regions
where each operator is likely to be used while preserving the identity of
inputs. Experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST highlight our model&#x27;s ability to
learn identity-preserving transformations on multi-class datasets.
Additionally, we train on CelebA to showcase our model&#x27;s ability to learn
semantically meaningful transformations on complex datasets in an unsupervised
manner.</span>

synthesis process of typical generative adversarial networks depends on
absolute pixel coordinates in an unhealthy manner. This manifests itself as,
e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces
of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that
causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals in the
network as continuous, we derive generally applicable, small architectural
changes that guarantee that unwanted information cannot leak into the
hierarchical synthesis process. The resulting networks match the FID of
StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they
are fully equivariant to translation and rotation even at subpixel scales. Our

representation learning with graph data. It follows the previous methods that
generate two views of an input graph through data augmentation. However, unlike
contrastive methods that focus on instance-level discrimination, we optimize an
innovative feature-level objective inspired by classical Canonical Correlation
Analysis. Compared with other works, our approach requires none of the
parameterized mutual information estimator, additional projector, asymmetric
structures, and most importantly, negative samples which can be costly. We show
that the new objective essentially 1) aims at discarding augmentation-variant
information by learning invariant representations, and 2) can prevent
degenerated solutions by decorrelating features in different dimensions. Our
theoretical analysis further provides an understanding for the new objective
which can be equivalently seen as an instantiation of the Information
Bottleneck Principle under the self-supervised setting. Despite its simplicity,
our method performs competitively on seven public graph datasets.</span>

(DCNNs) in practice, the study of theoretical behaviors of DCNNs lags heavily
behind. In particular, the universal consistency of DCNNs remains open. In this
paper, we prove that implementing empirical risk minimization on DCNNs with
expansive convolution (with zero-padding) is strongly universally consistent.
Motivated by the universal consistency, we conduct a series of experiments to
show that without any fully connected layers, DCNNs with expansive convolution
perform not worse than the widely used deep neural networks with hybrid
structure containing contracting (without zero-padding) convolution layers and
several fully connected layers.</span>

between the kinds of knowledge or skill levels we can achieve on different
tasks at the same time. When it comes to Neural Networks, that is not the case,
the major breakthroughs in the field are extremely task and domain specific.
Vision and language are dealt with in separate manners, using separate methods
and different datasets. In this work, we propose to use knowledge acquired by
benchmark Vision Models which are trained on ImageNet to help a much smaller
architecture learn to classify text. After transforming the textual data
contained in the IMDB dataset to gray scale images. An analysis of different
domains and the Transfer Learning method is carried out. Despite the challenge
posed by the very different datasets, promising results are achieved. The main
contribution of this work is a novel approach which links large pretrained
models on both language and vision to achieve state-of-the-art results in
different sub-fields from the original task. Without needing high compute
capacity resources. Specifically, Sentiment Analysis is achieved after
transferring knowledge between vision and language models. BERT embeddings are
transformed into grayscale images, these images are then used as training
examples for pretrained vision models such as VGG16 and ResNet

                                        <span>Shapley values has established itself as one of the most appropriate and
theoretically sound frameworks for explaining predictions from complex machine
learning models. The popularity of Shapley values in the explanation setting is
probably due to its unique theoretical properties. The main drawback with
Shapley values, however, is that its computational complexity grows
exponentially in the number of input features, making it unfeasible in many
real world situations where there could be hundreds or thousands of features.
Furthermore, with many (dependent) features, presenting/visualizing and
interpreting the computed Shapley values also becomes challenging. The present
paper introduces groupShapley: a conceptually simple approach for dealing with
the aforementioned bottlenecks. The idea is to group the features, for example
by type or dependence, and then compute and present Shapley values for these
groups instead of for all individual features. Reducing hundreds or thousands
of features to half a dozen or so, makes precise computations practically
feasible and the presentation and knowledge extraction greatly simplified. We
prove that under certain conditions, groupShapley is equivalent to summing the
feature-wise Shapley values within each feature group. Moreover, we provide a
simulation study exemplifying the differences when these conditions are not
met. We illustrate the usability of the approach in a real world car insurance
example, where groupShapley is used to provide simple and intuitive
explanations.</span>

                                        <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from
a labeled source domain to an unlabeled and unseen target domain, which is
usually trained on data from both domains. Access to the source domain data at
the adaptation stage, however, is often limited, due to data storage or privacy
issues. To alleviate this, in this work, we target source free UDA for
segmentation, and propose to adapt an &#x60;&#x60;off-the-shelf&quot; segmentation model
pre-trained in the source domain to the target domain, with an adaptive
batch-wise normalization statistics adaptation framework. Specifically, the
domain-specific low-order batch statistics, i.e., mean and variance, are
gradually adapted with an exponential momentum decay scheme, while the
consistency of domain shareable high-order batch statistics, i.e., scaling and
shifting parameters, is explicitly enforced by our optimization objective. The
transferability of each channel is adaptively measured first from which to
balance the contribution of each channel. Moreover, the proposed source free
UDA framework is orthogonal to unsupervised learning methods, e.g.,
self-entropy minimization, which can thus be simply added on top of our
framework. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 database show that our
source free UDA framework outperformed existing source-relaxed UDA methods for
the cross-subtype UDA segmentation task and yielded comparable results for the
cross-modality UDA segmentation task, compared with a supervised UDA methods
with the source data.</span>

representation can be much larger than the number of arms. To overcome the
curse of dimensionality, we propose to adaptively embed the feature
representation of each arm into a lower-dimensional space and carefully deal
with the induced model misspecifications. Our approach is conceptually very
different from existing works that can either only handle low-dimensional
linear bandits or passively deal with model misspecifications. We showcase the
application of our approach to two pure exploration settings that were
previously under-studied: (1) the reward function belongs to a possibly
infinite-dimensional Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, and (2) the reward
function is nonlinear and can be approximated by neural networks. Our main
results provide sample complexity guarantees that only depend on the effective
dimension of the feature spaces in the kernel or neural representations.

                                        <span>Intelligent systems are transforming the world, as well as our healthcare
system. We propose a deep learning-based cough sound classification model that
can distinguish between children with healthy versus pathological coughs such
as asthma, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and lower respiratory
tract infection (LRTI). In order to train a deep neural network model, we
collected a new dataset of cough sounds, labelled with clinician&#x27;s diagnosis.
The chosen model is a bidirectional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM)
based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features. The resulting
trained model when trained for classifying two classes of coughs -- healthy or
pathology (in general or belonging to a specific respiratory pathology),
reaches accuracy exceeding 84\% when classifying cough to the label provided by
the physicians&#x27; diagnosis. In order to classify subject&#x27;s respiratory pathology
condition, results of multiple cough epochs per subject were combined. The
resulting prediction accuracy exceeds 91\% for all three respiratory
pathologies. However, when the model is trained to classify and discriminate
among the four classes of coughs, overall accuracy dropped: one class of
pathological coughs are often misclassified as other. However, if one consider
the healthy cough classified as healthy and pathological cough classified to
have some kind of pathologies, then the overall accuracy of four class model is
above 84\%. A longitudinal study of MFCC feature space when comparing
pathological and recovered coughs collected from the same subjects revealed the
fact that pathological cough irrespective of the underlying conditions occupy
the same feature space making it harder to differentiate only using MFCC
features.</span>

learning (RL), in this paper we propose a novel uncertainty-aware model-based
RL (UA-MBRL) framework, and then implement and validate it in autonomous
driving under various task scenarios. First, an action-conditioned ensemble
model with the ability of uncertainty assessment is established as the virtual
environment model. Then, a novel uncertainty-aware model-based RL framework is
developed based on the adaptive truncation approach, providing virtual
interactions between the agent and environment model, and improving RL&#x27;s
training efficiency and performance. The developed algorithms are then
implemented in end-to-end autonomous vehicle control tasks, validated and
compared with state-of-the-art methods under various driving scenarios. The
validation results suggest that the proposed UA-MBRL method surpasses the
existing model-based and model-free RL approaches, in terms of learning
efficiency and achieved performance. The results also demonstrate the good

                                        <span>Frequently, population studies feature pyramidally-organized data represented
using Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBM) enriched with plates. These models can
become prohibitively large in settings such as neuroimaging, where a sample is
composed of a functional MRI signal measured on 64 thousand brain locations,
across 4 measurement sessions, and at least tens of subjects. Even a reduced
example on a specific cortical region of 300 brain locations features around 1
million parameters, hampering the usage of modern density estimation techniques
such as Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). To infer parameter posterior
distributions in this challenging class of problems, we designed a novel
methodology that automatically produces a variational family dual to a target
HBM. This variatonal family, represented as a neural network, consists in the
combination of an attention-based hierarchical encoder feeding summary
statistics to a set of normalizing flows. Our automatically-derived neural
network exploits exchangeability in the plate-enriched HBM and factorizes its
parameter space. The resulting architecture reduces by orders of magnitude its
parameterization with respect to that of a typical SBI representation, while
maintaining expressivity. Our method performs inference on the specified HBM in
an amortized setup: once trained, it can readily be applied to a new data
sample to compute the parameters&#x27; full posterior. We demonstrate the capability
of our method on simulated data, as well as a challenging high-dimensional
brain parcellation experiment. We also open up several questions that lie at
the intersection between SBI techniques and structured Variational Inference.</span>

                                        <span>In active learning, new labels are commonly acquired in batches. However,
common acquisition functions are only meant for one-sample acquisition rounds
at a time, and when their scores are used naively for batch acquisition, they
result in batches lacking diversity, which deteriorates performance. On the
other hand, state-of-the-art batch acquisition functions are costly to compute.
In this paper, we present a novel class of stochastic acquisition functions
that extend one-sample acquisition functions to the batch setting by observing
how one-sample acquisition scores change as additional samples are acquired and
modelling this difference for additional batch samples. We simply acquire new
samples by sampling from the pool set using a Gibbs distribution based on the
acquisition scores. Our acquisition functions are both vastly cheaper to
compute and out-perform other batch acquisition functions.</span>

                                        <span>Multi-layer feedforward networks have been used to approximate a wide range
of nonlinear functions. An important and fundamental problem is to understand
the learnability of a network model through its statistical risk, or the
expected prediction error on future data. To the best of our knowledge, the
rate of convergence of neural networks shown by existing works is bounded by at
most the order of $n^{-1/4}$ for a sample size of $n$. In this paper, we show
that a class of variation-constrained neural networks, with arbitrary width,
can achieve near-parametric rate $n^{-1/2+\delta}$ for an arbitrarily small
positive constant $\delta$. It is equivalent to $n^{-1 +2\delta}$ under the
mean squared error. This rate is also observed by numerical experiments. The
result indicates that the neural function space needed for approximating smooth
functions may not be as large as what is often perceived. Our result also
provides insight to the phenomena that deep neural networks do not easily
suffer from overfitting when the number of neurons and learning parameters
rapidly grow with $n$ or even surpass $n$. We also discuss the rate of
convergence regarding other network parameters, including the input dimension,
network layer, and coefficient norm.</span>

                                        <span>Gaussian processes are one of the dominant approaches in Bayesian learning.
Although the approach has been applied to numerous problems with great success,
it has a few fundamental limitations. Multiple methods in literature have
addressed these limitations. However, there has not been a comprehensive survey
of the topics as of yet. Most existing surveys focus on only one particular
variant of Gaussian processes and their derivatives. This survey details the
core motivations for using Gaussian processes, their mathematical formulations,
limitations, and research themes that have flourished over the years to address
said limitations. Furthermore, one particular research area is Deep Gaussian
Processes (DGPs), it has improved substantially in the past decade. The
significant publications that advanced the forefront of this research area are
outlined in their survey. Finally, a brief discussion on open problems and
research directions for future work is presented at the end.</span>

                                        <span>Intelligent systems are transforming the world, as well as our healthcare
system. We propose a deep learning-based cough sound classification model that
can distinguish between children with healthy versus pathological coughs such
as asthma, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and lower respiratory
tract infection (LRTI). In order to train a deep neural network model, we
collected a new dataset of cough sounds, labelled with clinician&#x27;s diagnosis.
The chosen model is a bidirectional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM)
based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features. The resulting
trained model when trained for classifying two classes of coughs -- healthy or
pathology (in general or belonging to a specific respiratory pathology),
reaches accuracy exceeding 84\% when classifying cough to the label provided by
the physicians&#x27; diagnosis. In order to classify subject&#x27;s respiratory pathology
condition, results of multiple cough epochs per subject were combined. The
resulting prediction accuracy exceeds 91\% for all three respiratory
pathologies. However, when the model is trained to classify and discriminate
among the four classes of coughs, overall accuracy dropped: one class of
pathological coughs are often misclassified as other. However, if one consider
the healthy cough classified as healthy and pathological cough classified to
have some kind of pathologies, then the overall accuracy of four class model is
above 84\%. A longitudinal study of MFCC feature space when comparing
pathological and recovered coughs collected from the same subjects revealed the
fact that pathological cough irrespective of the underlying conditions occupy
the same feature space making it harder to differentiate only using MFCC
features.</span>
