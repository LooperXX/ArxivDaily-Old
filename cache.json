          "description": "Knowledge Graph (KG) alignment is to discover the mappings (i.e., equivalent\nentities, relations, and others) between two KGs. The existing methods can be\ndivided into the embedding-based models, and the conventional reasoning and\nlexical matching based systems. The former compute the similarity of entities\nvia their cross-KG embeddings, but they usually rely on an ideal supervised\nlearning setting for good performance and lack appropriate reasoning to avoid\nlogically wrong mappings; while the latter address the reasoning issue but are\npoor at utilizing the KG graph structures and the entity contexts. In this\nstudy, we aim at combining the above two solutions and thus propose an\niterative framework named PRASE which is based on probabilistic reasoning and\nsemantic embedding. It learns the KG embeddings via entity mappings from a\nprobabilistic reasoning system named PARIS, and feeds the resultant entity\nmappings and embeddings back into PARIS for augmentation. The PRASE framework\nis compatible with different embedding-based models, and our experiments on\nmultiple datasets have demonstrated its state-of-the-art performance.",

          "description": "We introduce Korean Language Understanding Evaluation (KLUE) benchmark. KLUE\nis a collection of 8 Korean natural language understanding (NLU) tasks,\nincluding Topic Classification, SemanticTextual Similarity, Natural Language\nInference, Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Dependency Parsing,\nMachine Reading Comprehension, and Dialogue State Tracking. We build all of the\ntasks from scratch from diverse source corpora while respecting copyrights, to\nensure accessibility for anyone without any restrictions. With ethical\nconsiderations in mind, we carefully design annotation protocols. Along with\nthe benchmark tasks and data, we provide suitable evaluation metrics and\nfine-tuning recipes for pretrained language models for each task. We\nfurthermore release the pretrained language models (PLM), KLUE-BERT and\nKLUE-RoBERTa, to help reproducing baseline models on KLUE and thereby\nfacilitate future research. We make a few interesting observations from the\npreliminary experiments using the proposed KLUE benchmark suite, already\ndemonstrating the usefulness of this new benchmark suite. First, we find\nKLUE-RoBERTa-large outperforms other baselines, including multilingual PLMs and\nexisting open-source Korean PLMs. Second, we see minimal degradation in\nperformance even when we replace personally identifiable information from the\npretraining corpus, suggesting that privacy and NLU capability are not at odds\nwith each other. Lastly, we find that using BPE tokenization in combination\nwith morpheme-level pre-tokenization is effective in tasks involving\nmorpheme-level tagging, detection and generation. In addition to accelerating\nKorean NLP research, our comprehensive documentation on creating KLUE will\nfacilitate creating similar resources for other languages in the future.

          "description": "Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) systems parse speech into semantic\nstructures like dialog acts and slots. This involves the use of an Automatic\nSpeech Recognizer (ASR) to transcribe speech into multiple text alternatives\n(hypotheses). Transcription errors, common in ASRs, impact downstream SLU\nperformance negatively. Approaches to mitigate such errors involve using richer\ninformation from the ASR, either in form of N-best hypotheses or word-lattices.\nWe hypothesize that transformer models learn better with a simpler utterance\nrepresentation using the concatenation of the N-best ASR alternatives, where\neach alternative is separated by a special delimiter [SEP]. In our work, we\ntest our hypothesis by using concatenated N-best ASR alternatives as the input\nto transformer encoder models, namely BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, and achieve\nperformance equivalent to the prior state-of-the-art model on DSTC2 dataset. We\nalso show that our approach significantly outperforms the prior\nstate-of-the-art when subjected to the low data regime.

          "description": "Recent investigations into the inner-workings of state-of-the-art large-scale\npre-trained Transformer-based Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models\nindicate that they appear to know humanlike syntax, at least to some extent. We\nprovide novel evidence that complicates this claim: we find that\nstate-of-the-art Natural Language Inference (NLI) models assign the same labels\nto permuted examples as they do to the original, i.e. they are largely\ninvariant to random word-order permutations. This behavior notably differs from\nthat of humans; we struggle with ungrammatical sentences. To measure the\nseverity of this issue, we propose a suite of metrics and investigate which\nproperties of particular permutations lead models to be word-order invariant.\nIn the MNLI dataset, for example, we find almost all (98.7%) examples contain\nat least one permutation which elicits the gold label. Models are sometimes\neven able to assign gold labels to permutations that they originally failed to\npredict correctly. We provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation of this\nphenomenon, and further show that this issue exists for both Transformers and\npre-Transformer RNN / ConvNet based encoders, as well as across multiple\nlanguages (English and Mandarin Chinese).

          "description": "This work describes an encoder pre-training procedure using frame-wise label\nto improve the training of streaming recurrent neural network transducer\n(RNN-T) model. Streaming RNN-T trained from scratch usually performs worse than\nnon-streaming RNN-T. Although it is common to address this issue through\npre-training components of RNN-T with other criteria or frame-wise alignment\nguidance, the alignment is not easily available in end-to-end manner. In this\nwork, frame-wise alignment, used to pre-train streaming RNN-T's encoder, is\ngenerated without using a HMM-based system. Therefore an all-neural framework\nequipping HMM-free encoder pre-training is constructed. This is achieved by\nexpanding the spikes of CTC model to their left/right blank frames, and two\nexpanding strategies are proposed. To our best knowledge, this is the first\nwork to simulate HMM-based frame-wise label using CTC model for pre-training.\nExperiments conducted on LibriSpeech and MLS English tasks show the proposed\npre-training procedure, compared with random initialization, reduces the WER by\nrelatively 5%~11% and the emission latency by 60 ms. Besides, the method is\nlexicon-free, so it is friendly to new languages without manually designed\nlexicon.",

          "description": "Cross-document event coreference resolution (CDCR) is an NLP task in which\nmentions of events need to be identified and clustered throughout a collection\nof documents. CDCR aims to benefit downstream multi-document applications, but\ndespite recent progress on corpora and system development, downstream\nimprovements from applying CDCR have not been shown yet. We make the\nobservation that every CDCR system to date was developed, trained, and tested\nonly on a single respective corpus. This raises strong concerns on their\ngeneralizability -- a must-have for downstream applications where the magnitude\nof domains or event mentions is likely to exceed those found in a curated\ncorpus. To investigate this assumption, we define a uniform evaluation setup\ninvolving three CDCR corpora: ECB+, the Gun Violence Corpus and the Football\nCoreference Corpus (which we reannotate on token level to make our analysis\npossible). We compare a corpus-independent, feature-based system against a\nrecent neural system developed for ECB+. Whilst being inferior in absolute\nnumbers, the feature-based system shows more consistent performance across all\ncorpora whereas the neural system is hit-and-miss. Via model introspection, we\nfind that the importance of event actions, event time, etc. for resolving\ncoreference in practice varies greatly between the corpora. Additional analysis\nshows that several systems overfit on the structure of the ECB+ corpus. We\nconclude with recommendations on how to achieve generally applicable CDCR\nsystems in the future -- the most important being that evaluation on multiple\nCDCR corpora is strongly necessary.

Then, we\ninvestigate two possible sources of the deterioration: the semantic shift of\nexisting tokens and the sub-optimal or failed understanding of new tokens. To\nthis end, we both explore two different vocabulary composition methods, as well\nas propose three sampling methods which help in efficient incremental training\nfor BERT-like models. Compared to a new model trained from scratch offline, our\nincremental training (a) reduces the training costs, (b) achieves better\nperformance on evolving content, and (c) is suitable for online deployment. The\nsuperiority of our methods is validated using two downstream tasks. We\ndemonstrate significant improvements when incrementally evolving the model from\na particular base year, on the task of Country Hashtag Prediction, as well as\non the OffensEval 2019 task.",

We specifically constrain pretrained\nself-supervised vector-quantized (VQ) neural networks so that blocks of\ncontiguous feature vectors are assigned to the same code, thereby giving a\nvariable-rate segmentation of the speech into discrete units. Two segmentation\nmethods are considered. In the first, features are greedily merged until a\nprespecified number of segments are reached. The second uses dynamic\nprogramming to optimize a squared error with a penalty term to encourage fewer\nbut longer segments. We show that these VQ segmentation methods can be used\nwithout alteration across a wide range of tasks: unsupervised phone\nsegmentation, ABX phone discrimination, same-different word discrimination, and\nas inputs to a symbolic word segmentation algorithm. The penalized dynamic\nprogramming method generally performs best.

          "description": "Controlling neural network-based models for natural language generation (NLG)\nhas broad applications in numerous areas such as machine translation, document\nsummarization, and dialog systems. Approaches that enable such control in a\nzero-shot manner would be of great importance as, among other reasons, they\nremove the need for additional annotated data and training. In this work, we\npropose novel approaches for controlling encoder-decoder transformer-based NLG\nmodels in a zero-shot manner. This is done by introducing three control knobs;\nnamely, attention biasing, decoder mixing, and context augmentation, that are\napplied to these models at generation time. These knobs control the generation\nprocess by directly manipulating trained NLG models (e.g., biasing\ncross-attention layers) to realize the desired attributes in the generated\noutputs. We show that not only are these NLG models robust to such\nmanipulations, but also their behavior could be controlled without an impact on\ntheir generation performance. These results, to the best of our knowledge, are\nthe first of their kind. Through these control knobs, we also investigate the\nrole of transformer decoder's self-attention module and show strong evidence\nthat its primary role is maintaining fluency of sentences generated by these\nmodels. Based on this hypothesis, we show that alternative architectures for\ntransformer decoders could be viable options.

In this work, we study model-agnostic explanations of a\nrepresentative text generation task -- dialogue response generation. Dialog\nresponse generation is challenging with its open-ended sentences and multiple\nacceptable responses. To gain insights into the reasoning process of a\ngeneration model, we propose anew method, local explanation of response\ngeneration (LERG) that regards the explanations as the mutual interaction of\nsegments in input and output sentences. LERG views the sequence prediction as\nuncertainty estimation of a human response and then creates explanations by\nperturbing the input and calculating the certainty change over the human\nresponse. We show that LERG adheres to desired properties of explanations for\ntext generation including unbiased approximation, consistency and cause\nidentification. Empirically, our results show that our method consistently\nimproves other widely used methods on proposed automatic- and human- evaluation\nmetrics for this new task by 4.4-12.8%.

          "description": "Pre-trained representations are becoming crucial for many NLP and perception\ntasks. While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw\ntext without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations\nstill rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require\nexpert knowledge. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned\nusing datasets with explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For\nvision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all\ninvolve a non-trivial data collection (and cleaning) process. This costly\ncuration process limits the size of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of\ntrained models. In this paper, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion\nimage alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing\nsteps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple dual-encoder architecture\nlearns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs\nusing a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for\nits noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even with such a simple\nlearning scheme. Our visual representation achieves strong performance when\ntransferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned\nvisual and language representations enables zero-shot image classification and\nalso set new state-of-the-art results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO image-text\nretrieval benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated\ncross-attention models.

We demonstrate that this instability arises from the\nbias of language models towards predicting certain answers, e.g., those that\nare placed near the end of the prompt or are common in the pre-training data.\nTo mitigate this, we first estimate the model's bias towards each answer by\nasking for its prediction when given the training prompt and a content-free\ntest input such as \"N/A\". We then fit calibration parameters that cause the\nprediction for this input to be uniform across answers.

          "description": "The development of natural language processing (NLP) in general and machine\nreading comprehension in particular has attracted the great attention of the\nresearch community. In recent years, there are a few datasets for machine\nreading comprehension tasks in Vietnamese with large sizes, such as UIT-ViQuAD\nand UIT-ViNewsQA. However, the datasets are not diverse in answers to serve the\nresearch. In this paper, we introduce UIT-ViWikiQA, the first dataset for\nevaluating sentence extraction-based machine reading comprehension in the\nVietnamese language. The UIT-ViWikiQA dataset is converted from the UIT-ViQuAD\ndataset, consisting of comprises 23.074 question-answers based on 5.109\npassages of 174 Wikipedia Vietnamese articles. We propose a conversion\nalgorithm to create the dataset for sentence extraction-based machine reading\ncomprehension and three types of approaches for sentence extraction-based\nmachine reading comprehension in Vietnamese. Our experiments show that the best\nmachine model is XLM-R_Large, which achieves an exact match (EM) of 85.97% and\nan F1-score of 88.77% on our dataset. Besides, we analyze experimental results\nin terms of the question type in Vietnamese and the effect of context on the\nperformance of the MRC models, thereby showing the challenges from the\nUIT-ViWikiQA dataset that we propose to the language processing community.",

          "description": "Entity Recognition (ER) within a text is a fundamental exercise in Natural\nLanguage Processing, enabling further depending tasks such as Knowledge\nExtraction, Text Summarisation, or Keyphrase Extraction. An entity consists of\nsingle words or of a consecutive sequence of terms, constituting the basic\nbuilding blocks for communication. Mainstream ER approaches are mainly limited\nto flat structures, concentrating on the outermost entities while ignoring the\ninner ones. This paper introduces a partly-layered network architecture that\ndeals with the complexity of overlapping and nested cases. The proposed\narchitecture consists of two parts: (1) a shared Sequence Layer and (2) a\nstacked component with multiple Tagging Layers. The adoption of such an\narchitecture has the advantage of preventing overfit to a specific word-length,\nthus maintaining performance for longer entities despite their lower frequency.\nTo verify the proposed architecture's effectiveness, we train and evaluate this\narchitecture to recognise two kinds of entities - Concepts (CR) and Named\nEntities (NER). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art NER performances, while\nit outperforms previous CR approaches. Considering these promising results, we\nsee the possibility to evolve the architecture for other cases such as the\nextraction of events or the detection of argumentative components.",

          "description": "A good translation should not only translate the original content\nsemantically, but also incarnate personal traits of the original text. For a\nreal-world neural machine translation (NMT) system, these user traits (e.g.,\ntopic preference, stylistic characteristics and expression habits) can be\npreserved in user behavior (e.g., historical inputs). However, current NMT\nsystems marginally consider the user behavior due to: 1) the difficulty of\nmodeling user portraits in zero-shot scenarios, and 2) the lack of\nuser-behavior annotated parallel dataset. To fill this gap, we introduce a\nnovel framework called user-driven NMT. Specifically, a cache-based module and\na user-driven contrastive learning method are proposed to offer NMT the ability\nto capture potential user traits from their historical inputs under a zero-shot\nlearning fashion. Furthermore, we contribute the first Chinese-English parallel\ncorpus annotated with user behavior called UDT-Corpus. Experimental results\nconfirm that the proposed user-driven NMT can generate user-specific\ntranslations.",

Specifically, we\nreformulate semantic parsing as a constrained paraphrasing problem: given an\nutterance, our model synchronously generates its canonical utterance and\nmeaning representation. During synchronous decoding: the utterance paraphrasing\nis constrained by the structure of the logical form, therefore the canonical\nutterance can be paraphrased controlledly; the semantic decoding is guided by\nthe semantics of the canonical utterance, therefore its logical form can be\ngenerated unsupervisedly.

This work is grounded in very low-resource language\ndocumentation scenario where only few minutes of recording have been\ntranscribed for a given language so far.Experiments on two oral languages show\nthat a pretrained universal phone recognizer, fine-tuned with only a few\nminutes of target language speech, can be used for spoken term detection with a\nbetter overall performance than a dynamic time warping approach. In addition,\nwe show that representing phoneme recognition ambiguity in a graph structure\ncan further boost the recall while maintaining high precision in the low\nresource spoken term detection task.",

This allows users to interact with uploaded\nmodels in real time to assess their quality, and permits the collection of\nadditional metrics such as memory use, throughput, and robustness, which --\ndespite their importance to practitioners -- have traditionally been absent\nfrom leaderboards. On each task, models are ranked according to the Dynascore,\na novel utility-based aggregation of these statistics, which users can\ncustomize to better reflect their preferences, placing more/less weight on a\nparticular axis of evaluation or dataset.

Towards approaching\nthis problem, we extend the vanilla pretrain-finetune pipeline with an extra\nembedding transfer step. Specifically, a plug-and-play embedding generator is\nintroduced to produce the representation of any input token, according to\npre-trained embeddings of its morphologically similar ones. Thus, embeddings of\nmismatch tokens in downstream tasks can also be efficiently initialized. We\nconduct experiments on a variety of NLG tasks under the pretrain-finetune\nfashion.

          "description": "Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a key component in a task-oriented\ndialogue system, which converts the structured meaning representation (MR) to\nthe natural language. For large-scale conversational systems, where it is\ncommon to have over hundreds of intents and thousands of slots, neither\ntemplate-based approaches nor model-based approaches are scalable. Recently,\nneural NLGs started leveraging transfer learning and showed promising results\nin few-shot settings. This paper proposes AUGNLG, a novel data augmentation\napproach that combines a self-trained neural retrieval model with a few-shot\nlearned NLU model, to automatically create MR-to-Text data from open-domain\ntexts. The proposed system mostly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on\nthe FewShotWOZ data in both BLEU and Slot Error Rate. We further confirm\nimproved results on the FewShotSGD data and provide comprehensive analysis\nresults on key components of our system.

          "description": "End-to-end approaches open a new way for more accurate and efficient spoken\nlanguage understanding (SLU) systems by alleviating the drawbacks of\ntraditional pipeline systems. Previous works exploit textual information for an\nSLU model via pre-training with automatic speech recognition or fine-tuning\nwith knowledge distillation. To utilize textual information more effectively,\nthis work proposes a two-stage textual knowledge distillation method that\nmatches utterance-level representations and predicted logits of two modalities\nduring pre-training and fine-tuning, sequentially. We use vq-wav2vec BERT as a\nspeech encoder because it captures general and rich features. Furthermore, we\nimprove the performance, especially in a low-resource scenario, with data\naugmentation methods by randomly masking spans of discrete audio tokens and\ncontextualized hidden representations.

          "description": "Non-autoregressive translation (NAT) significantly accelerates the inference\nprocess via predicting the entire target sequence. However, recent studies show\nthat NAT is weak at learning high-mode of knowledge such as one-to-many\ntranslations. We argue that modes can be divided into various granularities\nwhich can be learned from easy to hard. In this study, we empirically show that\nNAT models are prone to learn fine-grained lower-mode knowledge, such as words\nand phrases, compared with sentences. Based on this observation, we propose\nprogressive multi-granularity training for NAT. More specifically, to make the\nmost of the training data, we break down the sentence-level examples into three\ntypes, i.e. words, phrases, sentences, and with the training goes, we\nprogressively increase the granularities. Experiments on Romanian-English,\nEnglish-German, Chinese-English, and Japanese-English demonstrate that our\napproach improves the phrase translation accuracy and model reordering ability,\ntherefore resulting in better translation quality against strong NAT baselines.\nAlso, we show that more deterministic fine-grained knowledge can further\nenhance performance.",

We model\nretrieval decisions as latent variables over sets of relevant documents. Since\nmarginalizing over sets of retrieved documents is computationally hard, we\napproximate this using an expectation-maximization algorithm. We iteratively\nestimate the value of our latent variable (the set of relevant documents for a\ngiven question) and then use this estimate to update the retriever and reader\nparameters. We hypothesize that such end-to-end training allows training\nsignals to flow to the reader and then to the retriever better than staged-wise\ntraining. This results in a retriever that is able to select more relevant\ndocuments for a question and a reader that is trained on more accurate\ndocuments to generate an answer. Experiments on three benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our proposed method outperforms all existing approaches of\ncomparable size by 2-3% absolute exact match points, achieving new\nstate-of-the-art results.

The crux of the problem for a reinforcement learning agent in such\nTBGs is identifying the objects in the world, and those objects' relations with\nthat world. While the recent use of text-based resources for increasing an\nagent's knowledge and improving its generalization have shown promise, we posit\nin this paper that there is much yet to be learned from visual representations\nof these same worlds.

This improves the agent's overall understanding of the\ngame 'scene' and objects' relationships to the world around them, and the\nvariety of visual representations on offer allow the agent to generate a better\ngeneralization of a relationship.

          "description": "We introduce a new type of programming challenge called programming puzzles,\nas an objective and comprehensive evaluation of program synthesis, and release\nan open-source dataset of Python Programming Puzzles (P3). Each puzzle is\ndefined by a short Python program $f$, and the goal is to find an input $x$\nwhich makes $f$ output \"True\". The puzzles are objective in that each one is\nspecified entirely by the source code of its verifier $f$, so evaluating $f(x)$\nis all that is needed to test a candidate solution $x$. They do not require an\nanswer key or input/output examples, nor do they depend on natural language\nunderstanding. The dataset is comprehensive in that it spans problems of a\nrange of difficulties and domains, ranging from trivial string manipulation\nproblems that are immediately obvious to human programmers (but not necessarily\nto AI), to classic programming puzzles (e.g., Towers of Hanoi), to\ninterview/competitive-programming problems (e.g., dynamic programming), to\nlongstanding open problems in algorithms and mathematics (e.g., factoring). The\nobjective nature of P3 readily supports self-supervised bootstrapping. We\ndevelop baseline enumerative program synthesis and GPT-3 solvers that are\ncapable of solving easy puzzles -- even without access to any reference\nsolutions -- by learning from their own past solutions.

To tackle this\nproblem, we propose a simple yet effective DA method based on a stochastic\nnoise generator, which learns to perturb the word embedding of the input\nquestions and context without changing their semantics. We validate the\nperformance of the QA models trained with our word embedding perturbation on a\nsingle source dataset, on five different target domains.The results show that\nour method significantly outperforms the baselineDA methods.

          "description": "Recent advances in Transformer models allow for unprecedented sequence\nlengths, due to linear space and time complexity. In the meantime, relative\npositional encoding (RPE) was proposed as beneficial for classical Transformers\nand consists in exploiting lags instead of absolute positions for inference.\nStill, RPE is not available for the recent linear-variants of the Transformer,\nbecause it requires the explicit computation of the attention matrix, which is\nprecisely what is avoided by such methods. In this paper, we bridge this gap\nand present Stochastic Positional Encoding as a way to generate PE that can be\nused as a replacement to the classical additive (sinusoidal) PE and provably\nbehaves like RPE. The main theoretical contribution is to make a connection\nbetween positional encoding and cross-covariance structures of correlated\nGaussian processes.

In this study, we survey\nmethods to improve ST performance without using source transcription, and\npropose a learning framework that utilizes a language-independent universal\nphone recognizer. The framework is based on an attention-based\nsequence-to-sequence model, where the encoder generates the phonetic embeddings\nand phone-aware acoustic representations, and the decoder controls the fusion\nof the two embedding streams to produce the target token sequence. In addition\nto investigating different fusion strategies, we explore the specific usage of\nbyte pair encoding (BPE), which compresses a phone sequence into a\nsyllable-like segmented sequence. Due to the conversion of symbols, a segmented\nsequence represents not only pronunciation but also language-dependent\ninformation lacking in phones. Experiments conducted on the Fisher\nSpanish-English and Taigi-Mandarin drama corpora show that our method\noutperforms the conformer-based baseline, and the performance is close to that\nof the existing best method using source transcription.",

Previous methods are typically node-centric and merely\nutilize different weight matrices to parameterize edge types, which 1) ignore\nthe rich semantics embedded in the topological structure of edges, and 2) fail\nto distinguish local and non-local relations for each node. To this end, we\npropose a Line Graph Enhanced Text-to-SQL (LGESQL) model to mine the underlying\nrelational features without constructing meta-paths. By virtue of the line\ngraph, messages propagate more efficiently through not only connections between\nnodes, but also the topology of directed edges. Furthermore, both local and\nnon-local relations are integrated distinctively during the graph iteration. We\nalso design an auxiliary task called graph pruning to improve the\ndiscriminative capability of the encoder.

          "description": "Training datasets for semantic parsing are typically small due to the higher\nexpertise required for annotation than most other NLP tasks. As a result,\nmodels for this application usually need additional prior knowledge to be built\ninto the architecture or algorithm. The increased dependency on human experts\nhinders automation and raises the development and maintenance costs in\npractice. This work investigates whether a generic transformer-based seq2seq\nmodel can achieve competitive performance with minimal code-generation-specific\ninductive bias design. By exploiting a relatively sizeable monolingual corpus\nof the target programming language, which is cheap to mine from the web, we\nachieved 81.03% exact match accuracy on Django and 32.57 BLEU score on CoNaLa.\nBoth are SOTA to the best of our knowledge.

Despite the fact that debiased word embeddings do not\nexplicitly address equalized odds of protected groups, we show that a\ntext-specific approach to fairness may simultaneously achieve a good balance of\nperformance and classical notions of fairness.

Moreover, via an analysis\nof generated sequences, we find that UID-regularized language models have other\ndesirable properties, e.g., they generate text that is more lexically diverse.\nOur results not only suggest that UID is a reasonable inductive bias for\nlanguage modeling, but also provide an alternative validation of the UID\nhypothesis using modern-day NLP tools.",

Our method, called Aligned Data Augmentation (ADA) for ASR,\nreplaces transcribed tokens and the speech representations in an aligned manner\nto generate previously unseen training pairs. The speech representations are\nsampled from an audio dictionary that has been extracted from the training\ncorpus and inject speaker variations into the training examples. The\ntranscribed tokens are either predicted by a language model such that the\naugmented data pairs are semantically close to the original data, or randomly\nsampled. Both strategies result in training pairs that improve robustness in\nASR training. Our experiments on a Seq-to-Seq architecture show that ADA can be\napplied on top of SpecAugment, and achieves about 9-23% and 4-15% relative\nimprovements in WER over SpecAugment alone on LibriSpeech 100h and LibriSpeech\n960h test datasets, respectively.",

We show that both text- and\nvisual- enrichment improves model performance, with the multimodal model\n(0.771) outperforming other models' F1 scores (0.544, 0.737, and 0.754). While\nthe unimodal-text context-aware (transformer) model was the most accurate on\nthe subtask of implicit hate detection, the multimodal model outperformed it\noverall because of a lower propensity towards false positives. We find that all\nmodels perform better on content with full annotator agreement and that\nmultimodal models are best at classifying the content where annotators\ndisagree. To conduct these investigations, we undertook high-quality annotation\nof a sample of 5,000 multimodal entries. Tweets were annotated for primary\ncategory, modality, and strategy.

          "description": "Recently, knowledge distillation (KD) has shown great success in BERT\ncompression. Instead of only learning from the teacher's soft label as in\nconventional KD, researchers find that the rich information contained in the\nhidden layers of BERT is conducive to the student's performance. To better\nexploit the hidden knowledge, a common practice is to force the student to\ndeeply mimic the teacher's hidden states of all the tokens in a layer-wise\nmanner. In this paper, however, we observe that although distilling the\nteacher's hidden state knowledge (HSK) is helpful, the performance gain\n(marginal utility) diminishes quickly as more HSK is distilled. To understand\nthis effect, we conduct a series of analysis. Specifically, we divide the HSK\nof BERT into three dimensions, namely depth, length and width. We first\ninvestigate a variety of strategies to extract crucial knowledge for each\nsingle dimension and then jointly compress the three dimensions. In this way,\nwe show that 1) the student's performance can be improved by extracting and\ndistilling the crucial HSK, and 2) using a tiny fraction of HSK can achieve the\nsame performance as extensive HSK distillation. Based on the second finding, we\nfurther propose an efficient KD paradigm to compress BERT, which does not\nrequire loading the teacher during the training of student. For two kinds of\nstudent models and computing devices, the proposed KD paradigm gives rise to\ntraining speedup of 2.7x ~ 3.4x.",

          "description": "Recent work on speech self-supervised learning (speech SSL) demonstrated the\nbenefits of scale in learning rich and transferable representations for\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with limited parallel data. It is then\nnatural to investigate the existence of sparse and transferrable subnetworks in\npre-trained speech SSL models that can achieve even better low-resource ASR\nperformance. However, directly applying widely adopted pruning methods such as\nthe Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) is suboptimal in the computational cost\nneeded. Moreover, contrary to what LTH predicts, the discovered subnetworks\nyield minimal performance gain compared to the original dense network. In this\nwork, we propose Prune-Adjust- Re-Prune (PARP), which discovers and finetunes\nsubnetworks for much better ASR performance, while only requiring a single\ndownstream finetuning run. PARP is inspired by our surprising observation that\nsubnetworks pruned for pre-training tasks only needed to be slightly adjusted\nto achieve a sizeable performance boost in downstream ASR tasks. Extensive\nexperiments on low-resource English and multi-lingual ASR show (1) sparse\nsubnetworks exist in pre-trained speech SSL, and (2) the computational\nadvantage and performance gain of PARP over baseline pruning methods. On the\n10min Librispeech split without LM decoding, PARP discovers subnetworks from\nwav2vec 2.0 with an absolute 10.9%/12.6% WER decrease compared to the full\nmodel. We demonstrate PARP mitigates performance degradation in cross-lingual\nmask transfer, and investigate the possibility of discovering a single\nsubnetwork for 10 spoken languages in one run.",

          "description": "Symbolic music understanding, which refers to the understanding of music from\nthe symbolic data (e.g., MIDI format, but not audio), covers many music\napplications such as genre classification, emotion classification, and music\npieces matching. While good music representations are beneficial for these\napplications, the lack of training data hinders representation learning.\nInspired by the success of pre-training models in natural language processing,\nin this paper, we develop MusicBERT, a large-scale pre-trained model for music\nunderstanding. To this end, we construct a large-scale symbolic music corpus\nthat contains more than 1 million music songs. Since symbolic music contains\nmore structural (e.g., bar, position) and diverse information (e.g., tempo,\ninstrument, and pitch), simply adopting the pre-training techniques from NLP to\nsymbolic music only brings marginal gains. Therefore, we design several\nmechanisms, including OctupleMIDI encoding and bar-level masking strategy, to\nenhance pre-training with symbolic music data.

          "description": "Unsupervised cross-lingual pretraining has achieved strong results in neural\nmachine translation (NMT), by drastically reducing the need for large parallel\ndata. Most approaches adapt masked-language modeling (MLM) to\nsequence-to-sequence architectures, by masking parts of the input and\nreconstructing them in the decoder. In this work, we systematically compare\nmasking with alternative objectives that produce inputs resembling real (full)\nsentences, by reordering and replacing words based on their context. We\npretrain models with different methods on English$\\leftrightarrow$German,\nEnglish$\\leftrightarrow$Nepali and English$\\leftrightarrow$Sinhala monolingual\ndata, and evaluate them on NMT. In (semi-) supervised NMT, varying the\npretraining objective leads to surprisingly small differences in the finetuned\nperformance, whereas unsupervised NMT is much more sensitive to it. To\nunderstand these results, we thoroughly study the pretrained models using a\nseries of probes and verify that they encode and use information in different\nways. We conclude that finetuning on parallel data is mostly sensitive to few\nproperties that are shared by most models, such as a strong decoder, in\ncontrast to unsupervised NMT that also requires models with strong\ncross-lingual abilities.",

          "description": "Text-to-speech systems recently achieved almost indistinguishable quality\nfrom human speech. However, the prosody of those systems is generally flatter\nthan natural speech, producing samples with low expressiveness. Disentanglement\nof speaker id and prosody is crucial in text-to-speech systems to improve on\nnaturalness and produce more variable syntheses. This paper proposes a new\nneural text-to-speech model that approaches the disentanglement problem by\nconditioning a Tacotron2-like architecture on flow-normalized speaker\nembeddings, and by substituting the reference encoder with a new learned latent\ndistribution responsible for modeling the intra-sentence variability due to the\nprosody. By removing the reference encoder dependency, the speaker-leakage\nproblem typically happening in this kind of systems disappears, producing more\ndistinctive syntheses at inference time. The new model achieves significantly\nhigher prosody variance than the baseline in a set of quantitative prosody\nfeatures, as well as higher speaker distinctiveness, without decreasing the\nspeaker intelligibility. Finally, we observe that the normalized speaker\nembeddings enable much richer speaker interpolations, substantially improving\nthe distinctiveness of the new interpolated speakers.",

          "description": "Increasing attention has been drawn to the sentiment analysis of financial\ndocuments. The most popular examples of such documents include analyst reports\nand economic news, the analysis of which is frequently used to capture the\ntrends in market sentiments. On the other hand, the significance of the role\nsentiment analysis plays in the financial domain has given rise to the efforts\nto construct a financial domain-specific sentiment lexicon. Sentiment lexicons\nlend a hand for solving various text mining tasks, such as unsupervised\nclassification of text data, while alleviating the arduous human labor required\nfor manual labeling. One of the challenges in the construction of an effective\nsentiment lexicon is that the semantic orientation of a word may change\ndepending on the context in which it appears. For instance, the word ``profit\"\nusually conveys positive sentiments; however, when the word is juxtaposed with\nanother word ``decrease,\" the sentiment associated with the phrase ``profit\ndecreases\" now becomes negative. Hence, the sentiment of a given word may shift\nas one begins to consider the context surrounding the word. In this paper, we\naddress this issue by incorporating context when building sentiment lexicon\nfrom a given corpus. Specifically, we construct a lexicon named Senti-DD for\nthe Sentiment lexicon composed of Direction-Dependent words, which expresses\neach term a pair of a directional word and a direction-dependent word.\nExperiment results show that higher classification performance is achieved with\nSenti-DD, proving the effectiveness of our method for automatically\nconstructing a context-aware sentiment lexicon in the financial domain.",

We answer this question by\nadapting an encoder-decoder transfer learning method from computer vision to\ninvestigate the structure among 100 different feature spaces extracted from\nhidden representations of various networks trained on language tasks. This\nmethod reveals a low-dimensional structure where language models and\ntranslation models smoothly interpolate between word embeddings, syntactic and\nsemantic tasks, and future word embeddings. We call this low-dimensional\nstructure a language representation embedding because it encodes the\nrelationships between representations needed to process language for a variety\nof NLP tasks. We find that this representation embedding can predict how well\neach individual feature space maps to human brain responses to natural language\nstimuli recorded using fMRI.

Due to the lack of such large\ncorpora in low-resource language pairs, NMT systems often exhibit poor\nperformance. Extra relevant monolingual data often helps, but acquiring it\ncould be quite expensive, especially for low-resource languages. Moreover,\ndomain mismatch between bitext (train/test) and monolingual data might degrade\nthe performance. To alleviate such issues, we propose AUGVIC, a novel data\naugmentation framework for low-resource NMT which exploits the vicinal samples\nof the given bitext without using any extra monolingual data explicitly. It can\ndiversify the in-domain bitext data with finer level control. Through extensive\nexperiments on four low-resource language pairs comprising data from different\ndomains, we have shown that our method is comparable to the traditional\nback-translation that uses extra in-domain monolingual data. When we combine\nthe synthetic parallel data generated from AUGVIC with the ones from the extra\nmonolingual data, we achieve further improvements.

          "description": "Recent advances in Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation (UNMT) have\nminimized the gap between supervised and unsupervised machine translation\nperformance for closely related language pairs. However, the situation is very\ndifferent for distant language pairs. Lack of lexical overlap and low syntactic\nsimilarities such as between English and Indo-Aryan languages leads to poor\ntranslation quality in existing UNMT systems. In this paper, we show that\ninitializing the embedding layer of UNMT models with cross-lingual embeddings\nshows significant improvements in BLEU score over existing approaches with\nembeddings randomly initialized. Further, static embeddings (freezing the\nembedding layer weights) lead to better gains compared to updating the\nembedding layer weights during training (non-static). We experimented using\nMasked Sequence to Sequence (MASS) and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) UNMT\napproaches for three distant language pairs. The proposed cross-lingual\nembedding initialization yields BLEU score improvement of as much as ten times\nover the baseline for English-Hindi, English-Bengali, and English-Gujarati. Our\nanalysis shows the importance of cross-lingual embedding, comparisons between\napproaches, and the scope of improvements in these systems.",

          "description": "Language is an outcome of our complex and dynamic human-interactions and the\ntechnique of natural language processing (NLP) is hence built on human\nlinguistic activities. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n(BERT) has recently gained its popularity by establishing the state-of-the-art\nscores in several NLP benchmarks. A Lite BERT (ALBERT) is literally\ncharacterized as a lightweight version of BERT, in which the number of BERT\nparameters is reduced by repeatedly applying the same neural network called\nTransformer's encoder layer. By pre-training the parameters with a massive\namount of natural language data, ALBERT can convert input sentences into\nversatile high-dimensional vectors potentially capable of solving multiple NLP\ntasks. In that sense, ALBERT can be regarded as a well-designed\nhigh-dimensional dynamical system whose operator is the Transformer's encoder,\nand essential structures of human language are thus expected to be encapsulated\nin its dynamics. In this study, we investigated the embedded properties of\nALBERT to reveal how NLP tasks are effectively solved by exploiting its\ndynamics. We thereby aimed to explore the nature of human language from the\ndynamical expressions of the NLP model. Our short-term analysis clarified that\nthe pre-trained model stably yields trajectories with higher dimensionality,\nwhich would enhance the expressive capacity required for NLP tasks. Also, our\nlong-term analysis revealed that ALBERT intrinsically shows transient chaos, a\ntypical nonlinear phenomenon showing chaotic dynamics only in its transient,\nand the pre-trained ALBERT model tends to produce the chaotic trajectory for a\nsignificantly longer time period compared to a randomly-initialized one. Our\nresults imply that local chaoticity would contribute to improving NLP\nperformance, uncovering a novel aspect in the role of chaotic dynamics in human\nlanguage behaviors.",

          "description": "Many task-oriented dialogue systems use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to\nlearn policies that respond to the user appropriately and complete the tasks\nsuccessfully. Training DRL agents with diverse dialogue trajectories prepare\nthem well for rare user requests and unseen situations. One effective\ndiversification method is to let the agent interact with a diverse set of\nlearned user models. However, trajectories created by these artificial user\nmodels may contain generation errors, which can quickly propagate into the\nagent's policy. It is thus important to control the quality of the\ndiversification and resist the noise. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndialogue diversification method for task-oriented dialogue systems trained in\nsimulators. Our method, Intermittent Short Extension Ensemble (I-SEE),\nconstrains the intensity to interact with an ensemble of diverse user models\nand effectively controls the quality of the diversification. Evaluations on the\nMultiwoz dataset show that I-SEE successfully boosts the performance of several\nstate-of-the-art DRL dialogue agents.",

          "description": "End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) has recently attracted\nincreasing interest. Compared to the conventional tandem-based approach that\ncombines speech recognition and language understanding as separate modules, the\nnew approach extracts users' intentions directly from the speech signals,\nresulting in joint optimization and low latency. Such an approach, however, is\ntypically designed to process one intention at a time, which leads users to\ntake multiple rounds to fulfill their requirements while interacting with a\ndialogue system. In this paper, we propose a streaming end-to-end framework\nthat can process multiple intentions in an online and incremental way. The\nbackbone of our framework is a unidirectional RNN trained with the\nconnectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an\nintention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and\nmultiple intentions can be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on\nthe Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the intent detection accuracy is\nabout 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the\nperformance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an\nonline and incremental way. We also employ our model to a keyword spotting task\nusing the Google Speech Commands dataset and the results are also highly\npromising.",

A critical problem\nbehind these limitations is that the representations of unseen intents cannot\nbe learned in the training stage. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nframework that utilizes unseen class labels to learn Class-Transductive Intent\nRepresentations (CTIR).

Also, the Phraseformer treats the key-phrase\nextraction task as a sequence labeling problem solved using classification\ntask.\n\nResults: We analyze the performance of Phraseformer on three datasets\nincluding Inspec, SemEval2010 and SemEval 2017 by F1-score. Also, we\ninvestigate the performance of different classifiers on Phraseformer method\nover Inspec dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nPhraseformer method over the three datasets used. Additionally, the Random\nForest classifier gain the highest F1-score among all classifiers.\n\nConclusions: Due to the fact that the combination of BERT and ExEm is more\nmeaningful and can better represent the semantic of words. Hence, Phraseformer\nsignificantly outperforms single-modality methods.",

          "description": "After their successful debut in natural language processing, Transformer\narchitectures are now becoming the de-facto standard in many domains. An\nobstacle for their deployment over new modalities is the architectural\nconfiguration: the optimal depth-to-width ratio has been shown to dramatically\nvary across data types (e.g., $10$x larger over images than over language). We\ntheoretically predict the existence of an embedding rank bottleneck that limits\nthe contribution of self-attention width to the Transformer expressivity. We\nthus directly tie the input vocabulary size and rank to the optimal\ndepth-to-width ratio, since a small vocabulary size or rank dictates an added\nadvantage of depth over width. We empirically demonstrate the existence of this\nbottleneck and its implications on the depth-to-width interplay of Transformer\narchitectures, linking the architecture variability across domains to the often\nglossed-over usage of different vocabulary sizes or embedding ranks in\ndifferent domains. As an additional benefit, our rank bottlenecking framework\nallows us to identify size redundancies of $25\\%-50\\%$ in leading NLP models\nsuch as ALBERT and T5.",

          "description": "While task-specific finetuning of pretrained networks has led to significant\nempirical advances in NLP, the large size of networks makes finetuning\ndifficult to deploy in multi-task, memory-constrained settings. We propose diff\npruning as a simple approach to enable parameter-efficient transfer learning\nwithin the pretrain-finetune framework. This approach views finetuning as\nlearning a task-specific diff vector that is applied on top of the pretrained\nparameter vector, which remains fixed and is shared across different tasks. The\ndiff vector is adaptively pruned during training with a differentiable\napproximation to the L0-norm penalty to encourage sparsity. Diff pruning\nbecomes parameter-efficient as the number of tasks increases, as it requires\nstoring only the nonzero positions and weights of the diff vector for each\ntask, while the cost of storing the shared pretrained model remains constant.\nIt further does not require access to all tasks during training, which makes it\nattractive in settings where tasks arrive in stream or the set of tasks is\nunknown. We find that models finetuned with diff pruning can match the\nperformance of fully finetuned baselines on the GLUE benchmark while only\nmodifying 0.5% of the pretrained model's parameters per task.",

In this paper, we\npropose a network named decomposed attention (DA) as a replacement of MA.

          "description": "Neural Transfer Learning (TL) is becoming ubiquitous in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), thanks to its high performance on many tasks, especially in\nlow-resourced scenarios. Notably, TL is widely used for neural domain\nadaptation to transfer valuable knowledge from high-resource to low-resource\ndomains. In the standard fine-tuning scheme of TL, a model is initially\npre-trained on a source domain and subsequently fine-tuned on a target domain\nand, therefore, source and target domains are trained using the same\narchitecture. In this paper, we show through interpretation methods that such\nscheme, despite its efficiency, is suffering from a main limitation. Indeed,\nalthough capable of adapting to new domains, pre-trained neurons struggle with\nlearning certain patterns that are specific to the target domain. Moreover, we\nshed light on the hidden negative transfer occurring despite the high\nrelatedness between source and target domains, which may mitigate the final\ngain brought by transfer learning. To address these problems, we propose to\naugment the pre-trained model with normalised, weighted and randomly\ninitialised units that foster a better adaptation while maintaining the\nvaluable source knowledge. We show that our approach exhibits significant\nimprovements to the standard fine-tuning scheme for neural domain adaptation\nfrom the news domain to the social media domain on four NLP tasks:\npart-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition and morphosyntactic\ntagging.",

          "description": "We propose a new training objective named order-agnostic cross entropy (OaXE)\nfor fully non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models. OaXE improves the\nstandard cross-entropy loss to ameliorate the effect of word reordering, which\nis a common source of the critical multimodality problem in NAT. Concretely,\nOaXE removes the penalty for word order errors, and computes the cross entropy\nloss based on the best possible alignment between model predictions and target\ntokens. Since the log loss is very sensitive to invalid references, we leverage\ncross entropy initialization and loss truncation to ensure the model focuses on\na good part of the search space. Extensive experiments on major WMT benchmarks\nshow that OaXE substantially improves translation performance, setting new\nstate of the art for fully NAT models. Further analyses show that OaXE\nalleviates the multimodality problem by reducing token repetitions and\nincreasing prediction confidence.

          "description": "Most of the recent work on personality detection from online posts adopts\nmultifarious deep neural networks to represent the posts and builds predictive\nmodels in a data-driven manner, without the exploitation of psycholinguistic\nknowledge that may unveil the connections between one's language usage and his\npsychological traits. In this paper, we propose a psycholinguistic\nknowledge-based tripartite graph network, TrigNet, which consists of a\ntripartite graph network and a BERT-based graph initializer. The graph network\ninjects structural psycholinguistic knowledge from LIWC, a computerized\ninstrument for psycholinguistic analysis, by constructing a heterogeneous\ntripartite graph. The graph initializer is employed to provide initial\nembeddings for the graph nodes. To reduce the computational cost in graph\nlearning, we further propose a novel flow graph attention network (GAT) that\nonly transmits messages between neighboring parties in the tripartite graph.\nBenefiting from the tripartite graph, TrigNet can aggregate post information\nfrom a psychological perspective, which is a novel way of exploiting domain\nknowledge. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that TrigNet outperforms\nthe existing state-of-art model by 3.47 and 2.10 points in average F1.\nMoreover, the flow GAT reduces the FLOPS and Memory measures by 38% and 32%,\nrespectively, in comparison to the original GAT in our setting.",

          "description": "Sentence semantic matching requires an agent to determine the semantic\nrelation between two sentences, where much recent progress has been made by the\nadvancement of representation learning techniques and inspiration of human\nbehaviors. Among all these methods, attention mechanism plays an essential role\nby selecting important parts effectively. However, current attention methods\neither focus on all the important parts in a static way or only select one\nimportant part at one attention step dynamically, which leaves a large space\nfor further improvement. To this end, in this paper, we design a novel Dynamic\nGaussian Attention Network (DGA-Net) to combine the advantages of current\nstatic and dynamic attention methods. More specifically, we first leverage\npre-trained language model to encode the input sentences and construct semantic\nrepresentations from a global perspective. Then, we develop a Dynamic Gaussian\nAttention (DGA) to dynamically capture the important parts and corresponding\nlocal contexts from a detailed perspective. Finally, we combine the global\ninformation and detailed local information together to decide the semantic\nrelation of sentences comprehensively and precisely.

          "description": "We analysed sentiment and frequencies related to smell, taste and temperature\nexpressed by food tweets in the Latvian language. To get a better understanding\nof the role of smell, taste and temperature in the mental map of food\nassociations, we looked at such categories as 'tasty' and 'healthy', which\nturned out to be mutually exclusive. By analysing the occurrence frequency of\nwords associated with these categories, we discovered that food discourse\noverall was permeated by `tasty' while the category of 'healthy' was relatively\nsmall. Finally, we used the analysis of temporal dynamics to see if we can\ntrace seasonality or other temporal aspects in smell, taste and temperature as\nreflected in food tweets. Understanding the composition of social media content\nwith relation to smell, taste and temperature in food tweets allows us to\ndevelop our work further - on food culture/seasonality and its relation to\ntemperature, on our limited capacity to express smell-related sentiments, and\nthe lack of the paradigm of taste in discussing food healthiness.",

          "description": "With proliferation of user generated contents in social media platforms,\nestablishing mechanisms to automatically identify toxic and abusive content\nbecomes a prime concern for regulators, researchers, and society. Keeping the\nbalance between freedom of speech and respecting each other dignity is a major\nconcern of social media platform regulators. Although, automatic detection of\noffensive content using deep learning approaches seems to provide encouraging\nresults, training deep learning-based models requires large amounts of\nhigh-quality labeled data, which is often missing. In this regard, we present\nin this paper a new deep learning-based method that fuses a Back Translation\nmethod, and a Paraphrasing technique for data augmentation. Our pipeline\ninvestigates different word-embedding-based architectures for classification of\nhate speech. The back translation technique relies on an encoder-decoder\narchitecture pre-trained on a large corpus and mostly used for machine\ntranslation. In addition, paraphrasing exploits the transformer model and the\nmixture of experts to generate diverse paraphrases. Finally, LSTM, and CNN are\ncompared to seek enhanced classification results. We evaluate our proposal on\nfive publicly available datasets; namely, AskFm corpus, Formspring dataset,\nWarner and Waseem dataset, Olid, and Wikipedia toxic comments dataset. The\nperformance of the proposal together with comparison to some related\nstate-of-art results demonstrate the effectiveness and soundness of our\nproposal.",

In this paper, we analyze the\nusefulness of a crowd-sourced system on WhatsApp through which users can submit\n\"tips\" containing messages they want fact-checked. We compare the tips sent to\na WhatsApp tipline run during the 2019 Indian national elections with the\nmessages circulating in large, public groups on WhatsApp and other social media\nplatforms during the same period. We find that tiplines are a very useful lens\ninto WhatsApp conversations: a significant fraction of messages and images sent\nto the tipline match with the content being shared on public WhatsApp groups\nand other social media. Our analysis also shows that tiplines cover the most\npopular content well, and a majority of such content is often shared to the\ntipline before appearing in large, public WhatsApp groups. Overall, the\nanalysis suggests tiplines can be an effective source for discovering content\nto fact-check.",

          "description": "Understanding product attributes plays an important role in improving online\nshopping experience for customers and serves as an integral part for\nconstructing a product knowledge graph. Most existing methods focus on\nattribute extraction from text description or utilize visual information from\nproduct images such as shape and color. Compared to the inputs considered in\nprior works, a product image in fact contains more information, represented by\na rich mixture of words and visual clues with a layout carefully designed to\nimpress customers. This work proposes a more inclusive framework that fully\nutilizes these different modalities for attribute extraction. Inspired by\nrecent works in visual question answering, we use a transformer based sequence\nto sequence model to fuse representations of product text, Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) tokens and visual objects detected in the product image. The\nframework is further extended with the capability to extract attribute value\nacross multiple product categories with a single model, by training the decoder\nto predict both product category and attribute value and conditioning its\noutput on product category. The model provides a unified attribute extraction\nsolution desirable at an e-commerce platform that offers numerous product\ncategories with a diverse body of product attributes. We evaluated the model on\ntwo product attributes, one with many possible values and one with a small set\nof possible values, over 14 product categories and found the model could\nachieve 15% gain on the Recall and 10% gain on the F1 score compared to\nexisting methods using text-only features.",

          "description": "Adapting large-scale pretrained language models to downstream tasks via\nfine-tuning is the standard method for achieving state-of-the-art performance\non NLP benchmarks. However, fine-tuning all weights of models with millions or\nbillions of parameters is sample-inefficient, unstable in low-resource\nsettings, and wasteful as it requires storing a separate copy of the model for\neach task. Recent work has developed parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,\nbut these approaches either still require a relatively large number of\nparameters or underperform standard fine-tuning. In this work, we propose\nCompacter, a method for fine-tuning large-scale language models with a better\ntrade-off between task performance and the number of trainable parameters than\nprior work. Compacter accomplishes this by building on top of ideas from\nadapters, low-rank optimization, and parameterized hypercomplex multiplication\nlayers.\n\nSpecifically, Compacter inserts task-specific weight matrices into a\npretrained model's weights, which are computed efficiently as a sum of\nKronecker products between shared ``slow'' weights and ``fast'' rank-one\nmatrices defined per Compacter layer. By only training 0.047% of a pretrained\nmodel's parameters, Compacter performs on par with standard fine-tuning on GLUE\nand outperforms fine-tuning in low-resource settings.

Such approaches allow for the extraction of semantic information\ndirectly from the speech signal, thus bypassing the need for a transcript from\nan automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. In this paper, we propose a\ncompact e2e SLU architecture for streaming scenarios, where chunks of the\nspeech signal are processed continuously to predict intent and slot values. Our\nmodel is based on a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) and a\nunidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). We compare the performance of two\nalignment-free losses: the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) method\nand its adapted version, namely connectionist temporal localization (CTL). The\nlatter performs not only the classification but also localization of sequential\naudio events. The proposed solution is evaluated on the Fluent Speech Command\ndataset and results show our model ability to process incoming speech signal,\nreaching accuracy as high as 98.97 % for CTC and 98.78 % for CTL on\nsingle-label classification, and as high as 95.69 % for CTC and 95.28 % for CTL\non two-label prediction.",

          "description": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems learn harmful societal biases that\ncause them to amplify inequality as they are deployed in more and more\nsituations. To guide efforts at debiasing these systems, the NLP community\nrelies on a variety of metrics that quantify bias in models. Some of these\nmetrics are intrinsic, measuring bias in word embedding spaces, and some are\nextrinsic, measuring bias in downstream tasks that the word embeddings enable.\nDo these intrinsic and extrinsic metrics correlate with each other? We compare\nintrinsic and extrinsic metrics across hundreds of trained models covering\ndifferent tasks and experimental conditions. Our results show no reliable\ncorrelation between these metrics that holds in all scenarios across tasks and\nlanguages. We urge researchers working on debiasing to focus on extrinsic\nmeasures of bias, and to make using these measures more feasible via creation\nof new challenge sets and annotated test data. To aid this effort, we release\ncode, a new intrinsic metric, and an annotated test set focused on gender bias\nin hate speech.",

Although multilingual LMs were also introduced to\nserve many languages, these have limitations such as being costly at inference\ntime and the size and diversity of non-English data involved in their\npre-training. We remedy these issues for a collection of diverse Arabic\nvarieties by introducing two powerful deep bidirectional transformer-based\nmodels, ARBERT and MARBERT. To evaluate our models, we also introduce ARLUE, a\nnew benchmark for multi-dialectal Arabic language understanding evaluation.\nARLUE is built using 42 datasets targeting six different task clusters,\nallowing us to offer a series of standardized experiments under rich\nconditions. When fine-tuned on ARLUE, our models collectively achieve new\nstate-of-the-art results across the majority of tasks (37 out of 48\nclassification tasks, on the 42 datasets). Our best model acquires the highest\nARLUE score (77.40) across all six task clusters, outperforming all other\nmodels including XLM-R Large (~ 3.4 x larger size).

          "description": "Building a question-answering agent currently requires large annotated\ndatasets, which are prohibitively expensive. This paper proposes Schema2QA, an\nopen-source toolkit that can generate a Q&A system from a database schema\naugmented with a few annotations for each field. The key concept is to cover\nthe space of possible compound queries on the database with a large number of\nin-domain questions synthesized with the help of a corpus of generic query\ntemplates. The synthesized data and a small paraphrase set are used to train a\nnovel neural network based on the BERT pretrained model. We use Schema2QA to\ngenerate Q&A systems for five Schema.org domains, restaurants, people, movies,\nbooks and music, and obtain an overall accuracy between 64% and 75% on\ncrowdsourced questions for these domains. Once annotations and paraphrases are\nobtained for a Schema.org schema, no additional manual effort is needed to\ncreate a Q&A agent for any website that uses the same schema. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that learning can be transferred from the restaurant to the hotel\ndomain, obtaining a 64% accuracy on crowdsourced questions with no manual\neffort. Schema2QA achieves an accuracy of 60% on popular restaurant questions\nthat can be answered using Schema.org. Its performance is comparable to Google\nAssistant, 7% lower than Siri, and 15% higher than Alexa. It outperforms all\nthese assistants by at least 18% on more complex, long-tail questions.",

          "description": "Transfer learning has become the dominant paradigm for many natural language\nprocessing tasks. In addition to models being pretrained on large datasets,\nthey can be further trained on intermediate (supervised) tasks that are similar\nto the target task. For small Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets,\nlanguage modelling is typically followed by pretraining on a large (labelled)\nNLI dataset before fine-tuning with each NLI subtask. In this work, we explore\nGradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) as an alternative to the commonly used\nMulti-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classification head. GBDTs have desirable\nproperties such as good performance on dense, numerical features and are\neffective where the ratio of the number of samples w.r.t the number of features\nis low. We then introduce FreeGBDT, a method of fitting a GBDT head on the\nfeatures computed during fine-tuning to increase performance without additional\ncomputation by the neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod on several NLI datasets using a strong baseline model (RoBERTa-large\nwith MNLI pretraining).

LORL builds upon recent advances in unsupervised object\ndiscovery and segmentation, notably MONet and Slot Attention. While these\nalgorithms learn an object-centric representation just by reconstructing the\ninput image, LORL enables them to further learn to associate the learned\nrepresentations to concepts, i.e., words for object categories, properties, and\nspatial relationships, from language input. These object-centric concepts\nderived from language facilitate the learning of object-centric\nrepresentations. LORL can be integrated with various unsupervised object\ndiscovery algorithms that are language-agnostic. Experiments show that the\nintegration of LORL consistently improves the performance of unsupervised\nobject discovery methods on two datasets via the help of language.

However, English is the predominant\nlanguage for online resources and technical knowledge, journals, and\ndocumentation. Consequently, many Bangla-speaking people, who have limited\ncommand of English, face hurdles to utilize English resources. To bridge the\ngap between limited support and increasing demand, researchers conducted many\nexperiments and developed valuable tools and techniques to create and process\nBangla language materials. Many efforts are also ongoing to make it easy to use\nthe Bangla language in the online and technical domains. There are some review\npapers to understand the past, previous, and future Bangla Natural Language\nProcessing (BNLP) trends. The studies are mainly concentrated on the specific\ndomains of BNLP, such as sentiment analysis, speech recognition, optical\ncharacter recognition, and text summarization. There is an apparent scarcity of\nresources that contain a comprehensive study of the recent BNLP tools and\nmethods. Therefore, in this paper, we present a thorough review of 71 BNLP\nresearch papers and categorize them into 11 categories, namely Information\nExtraction, Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition, Parsing, Parts of\nSpeech Tagging, Question Answering System, Sentiment Analysis, Spam and Fake\nDetection, Text Summarization, Word Sense Disambiguation, and Speech Processing\nand Recognition. We study articles published between 1999 to 2021, and 50% of\nthe papers were published after 2015. We discuss Classical, Machine Learning\nand Deep Learning approaches with different datasets while addressing the\nlimitations and current and future trends of the BNLP.",

          "description": "Transformer based models, like BERT and RoBERTa, have achieved\nstate-of-the-art results in many Natural Language Processing tasks. However,\ntheir memory footprint, inference latency, and power consumption are\nprohibitive efficient inference at the edge, and even at the data center. While\nquantization can be a viable solution for this, previous work on quantizing\nTransformer based models use floating-point arithmetic during inference, which\ncannot efficiently utilize integer-only logical units such as the recent Turing\nTensor Cores, or traditional integer-only ARM processors. In this work, we\npropose I-BERT, a novel quantization scheme for Transformer based models that\nquantizes the entire inference with integer-only arithmetic. Based on\nlightweight integer-only approximation methods for nonlinear operations, e.g.,\nGELU, Softmax, and Layer Normalization, I-BERT performs an end-to-end\ninteger-only BERT inference without any floating point calculation. We evaluate\nour approach on GLUE downstream tasks using RoBERTa-Base/Large. We show that\nfor both cases, I-BERT achieves similar (and slightly higher) accuracy as\ncompared to the full-precision baseline. Furthermore, our preliminary\nimplementation of I-BERT shows a speedup of 2.4-4.0x for INT8 inference on a T4\nGPU system as compared to FP32 inference.

In this\npaper, we study such a collection of tickets, which is referred to as ``winning\ntickets'', in extremely over-parametrized models, e.g., pre-trained language\nmodels. We observe that at certain compression ratios, the generalization\nperformance of the winning tickets can not only match but also exceed that of\nthe full model. In particular, we observe a phase transition phenomenon: As the\ncompression ratio increases, generalization performance of the winning tickets\nfirst improves then deteriorates after a certain threshold. We refer to the\ntickets on the threshold as ``super tickets''. We further show that the phase\ntransition is task and model dependent -- as the model size becomes larger and\nthe training data set becomes smaller, the transition becomes more pronounced.\nOur experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that the super tickets improve\nsingle task fine-tuning by $0.9$ points on BERT-base and $1.0$ points on\nBERT-large, in terms of task-average score. We also demonstrate that adaptively\nsharing the super tickets across tasks benefits multi-task learning.",

Existing models for ECE tend to\nexplore such relative position information and suffer from the dataset bias. To\ninvestigate the degree of reliance of existing ECE models on clause relative\npositions, we propose a novel strategy to generate adversarial examples in\nwhich the relative position information is no longer the indicative feature of\ncause clauses. We test the performance of existing models on such adversarial\nexamples and observe a significant performance drop. To address the dataset\nbias, we propose a novel graph-based method to explicitly model the emotion\ntriggering paths by leveraging the commonsense knowledge to enhance the\nsemantic dependencies between a candidate clause and an emotion clause.\nExperimental results show that our proposed approach performs on par with the\nexisting state-of-the-art methods on the original ECE dataset, and is more\nrobust against adversarial attacks compared to existing models.",

          "description": "Scene graphs are semantic abstraction of images that encourage visual\nunderstanding and reasoning. However, the performance of Scene Graph Generation\n(SGG) is unsatisfactory when faced with biased data in real-world scenarios.\nConventional debiasing research mainly studies from the view of balancing data\ndistribution or learning unbiased models and representations, ignoring the\ncorrelations among the biased classes. In this work, we analyze this problem\nfrom a novel cognition perspective: automatically building a hierarchical\ncognitive structure from the biased predictions and navigating that hierarchy\nto locate the relationships, making the tail relationships receive more\nattention in a coarse-to-fine mode. To this end, we propose a novel debiasing\nCognition Tree (CogTree) loss for unbiased SGG. We first build a cognitive\nstructure CogTree to organize the relationships based on the prediction of a\nbiased SGG model. The CogTree distinguishes remarkably different relationships\nat first and then focuses on a small portion of easily confused ones. Then, we\npropose a debiasing loss specially for this cognitive structure, which supports\ncoarse-to-fine distinction for the correct relationships. The loss is\nmodel-agnostic and consistently boosting the performance of several\nstate-of-the-art models. The code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/CYVincent/Scene-Graph-Transformer-CogTree.",

However, their high model\ncomplexity requires enormous computation resources and extremely long training\ntime for both pre-training and fine-tuning. Many works have studied model\ncompression on large NLP models, but only focusing on reducing inference time\nwhile still requiring an expensive training process. Other works use extremely\nlarge batch sizes to shorten the pre-training time, at the expense of higher\ncomputational resource demands. In this paper, inspired by the Early-Bird\nLottery Tickets recently studied for computer vision tasks, we propose\nEarlyBERT, a general computationally-efficient training algorithm applicable to\nboth pre-training and fine-tuning of large-scale language models. By slimming\nthe self-attention and fully-connected sub-layers inside a transformer, we are\nthe first to identify structured winning tickets in the early stage of BERT\ntraining. We apply those tickets towards efficient BERT training, and conduct\ncomprehensive pre-training and fine-tuning experiments on GLUE and SQuAD\ndownstream tasks.

In this paper, we present the first study to\ninvestigate pre-trained LMs for their temporal reasoning capabilities in\ndialogs by introducing a new task and a crowd-sourced English challenge set,\nTIMEDIAL.

          "description": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies today are primarily optimized\nfor given datasets; thus, any changes in the application environment (e.g.,\nacoustic conditions or topic domains) may inevitably degrade the performance.\nWe can collect new data describing the new environment and fine-tune the\nsystem, but this naturally leads to higher error rates for the earlier\ndatasets, referred to as catastrophic forgetting. The concept of lifelong\nlearning (LLL) aiming to enable a machine to sequentially learn new tasks from\nnew datasets describing the changing real world without forgetting the\npreviously learned knowledge is thus brought to attention. This paper reports,\nto our knowledge, the first effort to extensively consider and analyze the use\nof various approaches of LLL in end-to-end (E2E) ASR, including proposing novel\nmethods in saving data for past domains to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting\nproblem. An overall relative reduction of 28.7% in WER was achieved compared to\nthe fine-tuning baseline when sequentially learning on three very different\nbenchmark corpora. This can be the first step toward the highly desired ASR\ntechnologies capable of synchronizing with the continuously changing real\nworld.",

To understand and better\nmeasure the generalization capabilities of VQA systems, we look at their\nrobustness to counterfactually augmented data. Our proposed augmentations are\ndesigned to make a focused intervention on a specific property of the question\nsuch that the answer changes. Using these augmentations, we propose a new\nrobustness measure, Robustness to Augmented Data (RAD), which measures the\nconsistency of model predictions between original and augmented examples.\nThrough extensive experimentation, we show that RAD, unlike classical accuracy\nmeasures, can quantify when state-of-the-art systems are not robust to\ncounterfactuals.

To unify different datasets and\ntrain a single model for them, we investigate the use of Multi-Task Learning\n(MTL) architectures. We experiment with five datasets (Geoquery, NLMaps, TOP,\nOvernight, AMR). We find that an MTL architecture that shares the entire\nnetwork across datasets yields competitive or better parsing accuracies than\nthe single-task baselines, while reducing the total number of parameters by\n68%. We further provide evidence that MTL has also better compositional\ngeneralization than single-task models.

          "description": "Attention mechanisms have become a standard tool for sequence modeling tasks,\nin particular by stacking self-attention layers over the entire input sequence\nas in the Transformer architecture. In this work we introduce a novel attention\nprocedure called staircase attention that, unlike self-attention, operates\nacross the sequence (in time) recurrently processing the input by adding\nanother step of processing. A step in the staircase comprises of backward\ntokens (encoding the sequence so far seen) and forward tokens (ingesting a new\npart of the sequence), or an extreme Ladder version with a forward step of zero\nthat simply repeats the Transformer on each step of the ladder, sharing the\nweights. We thus describe a family of such models that can trade off\nperformance and compute, by either increasing the amount of recurrence through\ntime, the amount of sequential processing via recurrence in depth, or both.\nStaircase attention is shown to be able to solve tasks that involve tracking\nthat conventional Transformers cannot, due to this recurrence. Further, it is\nshown to provide improved modeling power for the same size model (number of\nparameters) compared to self-attentive Transformers on large language modeling\nand dialogue tasks, yielding significant perplexity gains.",

          "description": "Multilingual transformers (XLM, mT5) have been shown to have remarkable\ntransfer skills in zero-shot settings. Most transfer studies, however, rely on\nautomatically translated resources (XNLI, XQuAD), making it hard to discern the\nparticular linguistic knowledge that is being transferred, and the role of\nexpert annotated monolingual datasets when developing task-specific models. We\ninvestigate the cross-lingual transfer abilities of XLM-R for Chinese and\nEnglish natural language inference (NLI), with a focus on the recent\nlarge-scale Chinese dataset OCNLI. To better understand linguistic transfer, we\ncreated 4 categories of challenge and adversarial tasks (totaling 17 new\ndatasets) for Chinese that build on several well-known resources for English\n(e.g., HANS, NLI stress-tests). We find that cross-lingual models trained on\nEnglish NLI do transfer well across our Chinese tasks (e.g., in 3/4 of our\nchallenge categories, they perform as well/better than the best monolingual\nmodels, even on 3/5 uniquely Chinese linguistic phenomena such as idioms, pro\ndrop). These results, however, come with important caveats: cross-lingual\nmodels often perform best when trained on a mixture of English and high-quality\nmonolingual NLI data (OCNLI), and are often hindered by automatically\ntranslated resources (XNLI-zh). For many phenomena, all models continue to\nstruggle, highlighting the need for our new diagnostics to help benchmark\nChinese and cross-lingual models.

In the research, we collected tweet posts by the UK and US residents\nfrom the Twitter API during the pandemic and designed experiments to answer\nthree main questions concerning vaccination. To get the dominant sentiment of\nthe civics, we performed sentiment analysis by VADER and proposed a new method\nthat can count the individual's influence. This allows us to go a step further\nin sentiment analysis and explain some of the fluctuations in the data\nchanging. The results indicated that celebrities could lead the opinion shift\non social media in vaccination progress. Moreover, at the peak, nearly 40\\% of\nthe population in both countries have a negative attitude towards COVID-19\nvaccines. Besides, we investigated how people's opinions toward different\nvaccine brands are. We found that the Pfizer vaccine enjoys the most popular\namong people. By applying the sentiment analysis tool, we discovered most\npeople hold positive views toward the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by most\nbrands. In the end, we carried out topic modelling by using the LDA model. We\nfound residents in the two countries are willing to share their views and\nfeelings concerning the vaccine. Several death cases have occurred after\nvaccination. Due to these negative events, US residents are more worried about\nthe side effects and safety of the vaccine.",

          "description": "Natural language is compositional; the meaning of a sentence is a function of\nthe meaning of its parts. This property allows humans to create and interpret\nnovel sentences, generalizing robustly outside their prior experience. Neural\nnetworks have been shown to struggle with this kind of generalization, in\nparticular performing poorly on tasks designed to assess compositional\ngeneralization (i.e. where training and testing distributions differ in ways\nthat would be trivial for a compositional strategy to resolve). Their poor\nperformance on these tasks may in part be due to the nature of supervised\nlearning which assumes training and testing data to be drawn from the same\ndistribution. We implement a meta-learning augmented version of supervised\nlearning whose objective directly optimizes for out-of-distribution\ngeneralization. We construct pairs of tasks for meta-learning by sub-sampling\nexisting training data. Each pair of tasks is constructed to contain relevant\nexamples, as determined by a similarity metric, in an effort to inhibit models\nfrom memorizing their input. Experimental results on the COGS and SCAN datasets\nshow that our similarity-driven meta-learning can improve generalization\nperformance.",

This seemingly\nstraightforward question can be challenging for data-driven language models,\neven if trained at scale. However, we would expect such generic language models\nto possess some mathematical abilities in addition to typical linguistic\ncompetence. Towards this goal, we investigate if a commonly used language\nmodel, BERT, possesses such mathematical abilities and, if so, to what degree.\nFor that, we fine-tune BERT on a popular dataset for word math problems,\nAQuA-RAT, and conduct several tests to understand learned representations\nbetter. Since we teach models trained on natural language to do formal\nmathematics, we hypothesize that such models would benefit from training on\nsemi-formal steps that explain how math results are derived. To better\naccommodate such training, we also propose new pretext tasks for learning\nmathematical rules. We call them (Neighbor) Reasoning Order Prediction (ROP or\nNROP). With this new model, we achieve significantly better outcomes than\ndata-driven baselines and even on-par with more tailored models. We also show\nhow to reduce positional bias in such models.",

          "description": "Recent research in multilingual language models (LM) has demonstrated their\nability to effectively handle multiple languages in a single model. This holds\npromise for low web-resource languages (LRL) as multilingual models can enable\ntransfer of supervision from high resource languages to LRLs. However,\nincorporating a new language in an LM still remains a challenge, particularly\nfor languages with limited corpora and in unseen scripts. In this paper we\nargue that relatedness among languages in a language family may be exploited to\novercome some of the corpora limitations of LRLs, and propose RelateLM. We\nfocus on Indian languages, and exploit relatedness along two dimensions: (1)\nscript (since many Indic scripts originated from the Brahmic script), and (2)\nsentence structure. RelateLM uses transliteration to convert the unseen script\nof limited LRL text into the script of a Related Prominent Language (RPL)\n(Hindi in our case). While exploiting similar sentence structures, RelateLM\nutilizes readily available bilingual dictionaries to pseudo translate RPL text\ninto LRL corpora. Experiments on multiple real-world benchmark datasets provide\nvalidation to our hypothesis that using a related language as pivot, along with\ntransliteration and pseudo translation based data augmentation, can be an\neffective way to adapt LMs for LRLs, rather than direct training or pivoting\nthrough English.",

          "description": "Recently, there is an effort to extend fine-grained entity typing by using a\nricher and ultra-fine set of types, and labeling noun phrases including\npronouns and nominal nouns instead of just named entity mentions. A key\nchallenge for this ultra-fine entity typing task is that human annotated data\nare extremely scarce, and the annotation ability of existing distant or weak\nsupervision approaches is very limited. To remedy this problem, in this paper,\nwe propose to obtain training data for ultra-fine entity typing by using a BERT\nMasked Language Model (MLM). Given a mention in a sentence, our approach\nconstructs an input for the BERT MLM so that it predicts context dependent\nhypernyms of the mention, which can be used as type labels. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that, with the help of these automatically generated\nlabels, the performance of an ultra-fine entity typing model can be improved\nsubstantially. We also show that our approach can be applied to improve\ntraditional fine-grained entity typing after performing simple type mapping.",

In some cases,\nreinforcement learning has been added to train the models with an objective\nthat is closer to their evaluation measures (e.g. ROUGE). However, the reward\nfunction to be used within the reinforcement learning approach can play a key\nrole for performance and is still partially unexplored. For this reason, in\nthis paper, we propose two reward functions for the task of abstractive\nsummarisation: the first function, referred to as RwB-Hinge, dynamically\nselects the samples for the gradient update. The second function, nicknamed\nRISK, leverages a small pool of strong candidates to inform the reward. In the\nexperiments, we probe the proposed approach by fine-tuning an NLL pre trained\nmodel over nine summarisation datasets of diverse size and nature.

This year's\nshared task on robust spoken language identification sought to investigate just\nthis scenario: systems were to be trained on largely single-speaker speech from\none domain, but evaluated on data in other domains recorded from speakers under\ndifferent recording circumstances, mimicking realistic low-resource scenarios.\nWe see that domain and speaker mismatch proves very challenging for current\nmethods which can perform above 95% accuracy in-domain, which domain adaptation\ncan address to some degree, but that these conditions merit further\ninvestigation to make spoken language identification accessible in many\nscenarios.",

To assist humans with\nwriting, lexical substitution systems can suggest words that humans cannot\neasily think of.

To this end, we use a context-free thesaurus to produce candidates\nand rely on human judgement to determine contextual appropriateness.

We propose a framework for computationally measuring\nuptake, by (1) releasing a dataset of student-teacher exchanges extracted from\nUS math classroom transcripts annotated for uptake by experts; (2) formalizing\nuptake as pointwise Jensen-Shannon Divergence (pJSD), estimated via next\nutterance classification; (3) conducting a linguistically-motivated comparison\nof different unsupervised measures and (4) correlating these measures with\neducational outcomes. We find that although repetition captures a significant\npart of uptake, pJSD outperforms repetition-based baselines, as it is capable\nof identifying a wider range of uptake phenomena like question answering and\nreformulation. We apply our uptake measure to three different educational\ndatasets with outcome indicators.

          "description": "Abductive reasoning starts from some observations and aims at finding the\nmost plausible explanation for these observations. To perform abduction, humans\noften make use of temporal and causal inferences, and knowledge about how some\nhypothetical situation can result in different outcomes. This work offers the\nfirst study of how such knowledge impacts the Abductive NLI task -- which\nconsists in choosing the more likely explanation for given observations. We\ntrain a specialized language model LMI that is tasked to generate what could\nhappen next from a hypothetical scenario that evolves from a given event. We\nthen propose a multi-task model MTL to solve the Abductive NLI task, which\npredicts a plausible explanation by a) considering different possible events\nemerging from candidate hypotheses -- events generated by LMI -- and b)\nselecting the one that is most similar to the observed outcome. We show that\nour MTL model improves over prior vanilla pre-trained LMs fine-tuned on\nAbductive NLI. Our manual evaluation and analysis suggest that learning about\npossible next events from different hypothetical scenarios supports abductive\ninference.",

          "description": "Personalization of natural language generation plays a vital role in a large\nspectrum of tasks, such as explainable recommendation, review summarization and\ndialog systems.

Transformer, which is demonstrated with strong language\nmodeling capability, however, is not personalized and fails to make use of the\nuser and item IDs since the ID tokens are not even in the same semantic space\nas the words. To address this problem, we present a PErsonalized Transformer\nfor Explainable Recommendation (PETER), on which we design a simple and\neffective learning objective that utilizes the IDs to predict the words in the\ntarget explanation, so as to endow the IDs with linguistic meanings and to\nachieve personalized Transformer. Besides generating explanations, PETER can\nalso make recommendations, which makes it a unified model for the whole\nrecommendation-explanation pipeline.

To ensure a content-based model\ngeneralize well to a broad range of applications, it is critical to have a\ntraining dataset that is large beyond the scale of human labels while achieving\ndesired quality. In this work, we address those two challenges by proposing a\nnovel approach to mine semantically-relevant fresh documents, and their topic\nlabels, with little human supervision. Meanwhile, we design a multitask model\ncalled NewsEmbed that alternatively trains a contrastive learning with a\nmulti-label classification to derive a universal document encoder.

We study the\nefficacy of KGPool by evaluating it with different neural models and KGs\n(Wikidata and NYT Freebase).

          "description": "Inverted indexes continue to be a mainstay of text search engines, allowing\nefficient querying of large document collections. While there are a number of\npossible organizations, document-ordered indexes are the most common, since\nthey are amenable to various query types, support index updates, and allow for\nefficient dynamic pruning operations. One disadvantage with document-ordered\nindexes is that high-scoring documents can be distributed across the document\nidentifier space, meaning that index traversal algorithms that terminate early\nmight put search effectiveness at risk. The alternative is impact-ordered\nindexes, which primarily support top-k disjunctions, but also allow for anytime\nquery processing, where the search can be terminated at any time, with search\nquality improving as processing latency increases. Anytime query processing can\nbe used to effectively reduce high-percentile tail latency which is essential\nfor operational scenarios in which a service level agreement (SLA) imposes\nresponse time requirements. In this work, we show how document-ordered indexes\ncan be organized such that they can be queried in an anytime fashion, enabling\nstrict latency control with effective early termination. Our experiments show\nthat processing document-ordered topical segments selected by a simple score\nestimator outperforms existing anytime algorithms, and allows query runtimes to\nbe accurately limited in order to comply with SLA requirements.",

          "description": "Metric learning algorithms aim to learn a distance function that brings the\nsemantically similar data items together and keeps dissimilar ones at a\ndistance. The traditional Mahalanobis distance learning is equivalent to find a\nlinear projection. In contrast, Deep Metric Learning (DML) methods are proposed\nthat automatically extract features from data and learn a non-linear\ntransformation from input space to a semantically embedding space. Recently,\nmany DML methods are proposed focused to enhance the discrimination power of\nthe learned metric by providing novel sampling strategies or loss functions.\nThis approach is very helpful when both the training and test examples are\ncoming from the same set of categories. However, it is less effective in many\napplications of DML such as image retrieval and person-reidentification. Here,\nthe DML should learn general semantic concepts from observed classes and employ\nthem to rank or identify objects from unseen categories. Neglecting the\ngeneralization ability of the learned representation and just emphasizing to\nlearn a more discriminative embedding on the observed classes may lead to the\noverfitting problem. To address this limitation, we propose a framework to\nenhance the generalization power of existing DML methods in a Zero-Shot\nLearning (ZSL) setting by general yet discriminative representation learning\nand employing a class adversarial neural network. To learn a more general\nrepresentation, we propose to employ feature maps of intermediate layers in a\ndeep neural network and enhance their discrimination power through an attention\nmechanism. Besides, a class adversarial network is utilized to enforce the deep\nmodel to seek class invariant features for the DML task. We evaluate our work\non widely used machine vision datasets in a ZSL setting.",

          "description": "The sequential patterns within the user interactions are pivotal for\nrepresenting the user's preference and capturing latent relationships among\nitems. The recent advancements of sequence modeling by Transformers advocate\nthe community to devise more effective encoders for the sequential\nrecommendation. Most existing sequential methods assume users are\ndeterministic. However, item-item transitions might fluctuate significantly in\nseveral item aspects and exhibit randomness of user interests. This\n\\textit{stochastic characteristics} brings up a solid demand to include\nuncertainties in representing sequences and items. Additionally, modeling\nsequences and items with uncertainties expands users' and items' interaction\nspaces, thus further alleviating cold-start problems.\n\nIn this work, we propose a Distribution-based Transformer for Sequential\nRecommendation (DT4SR), which injects uncertainties into sequential modeling.\nWe use Elliptical Gaussian distributions to describe items and sequences with\nuncertainty. We describe the uncertainty in items and sequences as Elliptical\nGaussian distribution. And we adopt Wasserstein distance to measure the\nsimilarity between distributions. We devise two novel Trans-formers for\nmodeling mean and covariance, which guarantees the positive-definite property\nof distributions. The proposed method significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The experiments on three benchmark datasets also\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in alleviating cold-start issues.

An entity consists of\nsingle words or of a consecutive sequence of terms, constituting the basic\nbuilding blocks for communication. Mainstream ER approaches are mainly limited\nto flat structures, concentrating on the outermost entities while ignoring the\ninner ones. This paper introduces a partly-layered network architecture that\ndeals with the complexity of overlapping and nested cases. The proposed\narchitecture consists of two parts: (1) a shared Sequence Layer and (2) a\nstacked component with multiple Tagging Layers. The adoption of such an\narchitecture has the advantage of preventing overfit to a specific word-length,\nthus maintaining performance for longer entities despite their lower frequency.\nTo verify the proposed architecture's effectiveness, we train and evaluate this\narchitecture to recognise two kinds of entities - Concepts (CR) and Named\nEntities (NER). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art NER performances, while\nit outperforms previous CR approaches. Considering these promising results, we\nsee the possibility to evolve the architecture for other cases such as the\nextraction of events or the detection of argumentative components.",

          "description": "News recommendation is important for improving news reading experience of\nusers. Users' news click behaviors are widely used for inferring user interests\nand predicting future clicks. However, click behaviors are heavily affected by\nthe biases brought by the positions of news displayed on the webpage. It is\nimportant to eliminate the effect of position biases on the recommendation\nmodel to accurately target user interests. In this paper, we propose a news\nrecommendation method named DebiasGAN that can effectively eliminate the effect\nof position biases via adversarial learning. We use a bias-aware click model to\ncapture the influence of position bias on click behaviors, and we use a\nbias-invariant click model with random candidate news positions to estimate the\nideally unbiased click scores. We apply adversarial learning techniques to the\nhidden representations learned by the two models to help the bias-invariant\nclick model capture the bias-independent interest of users on news.\nExperimental results on two real-world datasets show that DebiasGAN can\neffectively improve the accuracy of news recommendation by eliminating position\nbiases.",

          "description": "For IoT to reach its full potential, the sharing and reuse of information in\ndifferent applications and across verticals is of paramount importance.\nHowever, there are a plethora of IoT platforms using different representations,\nprotocols and interaction patterns. To address this issue, the Fed4IoT project\nhas developed an IoT virtualization platform that, on the one hand, integrates\ninformation from many different source platforms and, on the other hand, makes\nthe information required by the respective users available in the target\nplatform of choice. To enable this, information is translated into a common,\nneutral exchange format. The format of choice is NGSI-LD, which is being\nstandardized by the ETSI Industry Specification Group on Context Information\nManagement (ETSI ISG CIM). Thing Visors are the components that translate the\nsource information to NGSI-LD, which is then delivered to the target platform\nand translated into the target format. ThingVisors can be implemented by hand,\nbut this requires significant human effort, especially considering the\nheterogeneity of low level information produced by a multitude of sensors.\nThus, supporting the human developer and, ideally, fully automating the process\nof extracting and enriching data and translating it to NGSI-LD is a crucial\nstep. Machine learning is a promising approach for this, but it typically\nrequires large amounts of hand-labelled data for training, an effort that makes\nit unrealistic in many IoT scenarios. A programmatic labelling approach called\nknowledge infusion that encodes expert knowledge is used for matching a schema\nor ontology extracted from the data with a target schema or ontology, providing\nthe basis for annotating the data and facilitating the translation to NGSI-LD.",

          "description": "Personalized news recommendation methods are widely used in online news\nservices. These methods usually recommend news based on the matching between\nnews content and user interest inferred from historical behaviors. However,\nthese methods usually have difficulties in making accurate recommendations to\ncold-start users, and tend to recommend similar news with those users have\nread. In general, popular news usually contain important information and can\nattract users with different interests. Besides, they are usually diverse in\ncontent and topic. Thus, in this paper we propose to incorporate news\npopularity information to alleviate the cold-start and diversity problems for\npersonalized news recommendation. In our method, the ranking score for\nrecommending a candidate news to a target user is the combination of a\npersonalized matching score and a news popularity score. The former is used to\ncapture the personalized user interest in news. The latter is used to measure\ntime-aware popularity of candidate news, which is predicted based on news\ncontent, recency, and real-time CTR using a unified framework. Besides, we\npropose a popularity-aware user encoder to eliminate the popularity bias in\nuser behaviors for accurate interest modeling. Experiments on two real-world\ndatasets show our method can effectively improve the accuracy and diversity for\nnews recommendation.",

          "description": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online\nadvertising and recommender systems. In practice, the training of CTR models\ndepends on click data which is intrinsically biased towards higher positions\nsince higher position has higher CTR by nature. Existing methods such as actual\nposition training with fixed position inference and inverse propensity weighted\ntraining with no position inference alleviate the bias problem to some extend.\nHowever, the different treatment of position information between training and\ninference will inevitably lead to inconsistency and sub-optimal online\nperformance. Meanwhile, the basic assumption of these methods, i.e., the click\nprobability is the product of examination probability and relevance\nprobability, is oversimplified and insufficient to model the rich interaction\nbetween position and other information. In this paper, we propose a Deep\nPosition-wise Interaction Network (DPIN) to efficiently combine all candidate\nitems and positions for estimating CTR at each position, achieving consistency\nbetween offline and online as well as modeling the deep non-linear interaction\namong position, user, context and item under the limit of serving performance.\nFollowing our new treatment to the position bias in CTR prediction, we propose\na new evaluation metrics named PAUC (position-wise AUC) that is suitable for\nmeasuring the ranking quality at a given position. Through extensive\nexperiments on a real world dataset, we show empirically that our method is\nboth effective and efficient in solving position bias problem. We have also\ndeployed our method in production and observed statistically significant\nimprovement over a highly optimized baseline in a rigorous A/B test.",

          "description": "We present an end-to-end differentiable training method for\nretrieval-augmented open-domain question answering systems that combine\ninformation from multiple retrieved documents when generating answers. We model\nretrieval decisions as latent variables over sets of relevant documents. Since\nmarginalizing over sets of retrieved documents is computationally hard, we\napproximate this using an expectation-maximization algorithm. We iteratively\nestimate the value of our latent variable (the set of relevant documents for a\ngiven question) and then use this estimate to update the retriever and reader\nparameters. We hypothesize that such end-to-end training allows training\nsignals to flow to the reader and then to the retriever better than staged-wise\ntraining. This results in a retriever that is able to select more relevant\ndocuments for a question and a reader that is trained on more accurate\ndocuments to generate an answer. Experiments on three benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our proposed method outperforms all existing approaches of\ncomparable size by 2-3% absolute exact match points, achieving new\nstate-of-the-art results. Our results also demonstrate the feasibility of\nlearning to retrieve to improve answer generation without explicit supervision\nof retrieval decisions.",

          "description": "Symbolic music understanding, which refers to the understanding of music from\nthe symbolic data (e.g., MIDI format, but not audio), covers many music\napplications such as genre classification, emotion classification, and music\npieces matching. While good music representations are beneficial for these\napplications, the lack of training data hinders representation learning.\nInspired by the success of pre-training models in natural language processing,\nin this paper, we develop MusicBERT, a large-scale pre-trained model for music\nunderstanding. To this end, we construct a large-scale symbolic music corpus\nthat contains more than 1 million music songs. Since symbolic music contains\nmore structural (e.g., bar, position) and diverse information (e.g., tempo,\ninstrument, and pitch), simply adopting the pre-training techniques from NLP to\nsymbolic music only brings marginal gains. Therefore, we design several\nmechanisms, including OctupleMIDI encoding and bar-level masking strategy, to\nenhance pre-training with symbolic music data. Experiments demonstrate the\nadvantages of MusicBERT on four music understanding tasks, including melody\ncompletion, accompaniment suggestion, genre classification, and style\nclassification.

Our\nmodel enables inductive representation learning for users and meanwhile\nguarantees equivalent representation capacity as matrix factorization.\nExperiments demonstrate that our model achieves promising results for\nrecommendation on few-shot users with limited training ratings and new unseen\nusers which are commonly encountered in open-world recommender systems.",

          "description": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) is a challenging task, which aims at\nrecommending items based on anonymous behavior sequences. Almost all the\nexisting solutions for SBR model user preference only based on the current\nsession without exploiting the other sessions, which may contain both relevant\nand irrelevant item-transitions to the current session. This paper proposes a\nnovel approach, called Global Context Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (GCE-GNN)\nto exploit item transitions over all sessions in a more subtle manner for\nbetter inferring the user preference of the current session. Specifically,\nGCE-GNN learns two levels of item embeddings from session graph and global\ngraph, respectively: (i) Session graph, which is to learn the session-level\nitem embedding by modeling pairwise item-transitions within the current\nsession; and (ii) Global graph, which is to learn the global-level item\nembedding by modeling pairwise item-transitions over all sessions. In GCE-GNN,\nwe propose a novel global-level item representation learning layer, which\nemploys a session-aware attention mechanism to recursively incorporate the\nneighbors' embeddings of each node on the global graph. We also design a\nsession-level item representation learning layer, which employs a GNN on the\nsession graph to learn session-level item embeddings within the current\nsession. Moreover, GCE-GNN aggregates the learnt item representations in the\ntwo levels with a soft attention mechanism. Experiments on three benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that GCE-GNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\nconsistently.",

          "description": "Recommender systems are often asked to serve multiple recommendation\nscenarios or domains. Fine-tuning a pre-trained CTR model from source domains\nand adapting it to a target domain allows knowledge transferring. However,\noptimizing all the parameters of the pre-trained network may result in\nover-fitting if the target dataset is small and the number of parameters is\nlarge. This leads us to think of directly reusing parameters in the pre-trained\nmodel which represent more general features learned from multiple domains.\nHowever, the design of freezing or fine-tuning layers of parameters requires\nmuch manual effort since the decision highly depends on the pre-trained model\nand target instances. In this work, we propose an end-to-end transfer learning\nframework, called Automatic Fine-Tuning (AutoFT), for CTR prediction. AutoFT\nconsists of a field-wise transfer policy and a layer-wise transfer policy. The\nfield-wise transfer policy decides how the pre-trained embedding\nrepresentations are frozen or fine-tuned based on the given instance from the\ntarget domain. The layer-wise transfer policy decides how the high?order\nfeature representations are transferred layer by layer. Extensive experiments\non two public benchmark datasets and one private industrial dataset demonstrate\nthat AutoFT can significantly improve the performance of CTR prediction\ncompared with state-of-the-art transferring approaches.",

In this problem, there is a user\nthat wishes to obtain $L$ independent linear combinations of a $D$-subset of\nmessages belonging to a dataset of $K$ messages stored on a single server. The\ngoal is to minimize the download cost while keeping the identity of each\nmessage required for the computation individually private. The individual\nprivacy requirement ensures that the identity of each individual message\nrequired for the computation is kept private. This is in contrast to the\nstricter notion of joint privacy that protects the entire set of identities of\nall messages used for the computation, including the correlations between these\nidentities. The notion of individual privacy captures a broad set of practical\napplications. For example, such notion is relevant when the dataset contains\ninformation about individuals, each of them requires privacy guarantees for\ntheir data access patterns. We focus on the setting in which the required\nlinear transformation is associated with a maximum distance separable (MDS)\nmatrix. In particular, we require that the matrix of coefficients pertaining to\nthe required linear combinations is the generator matrix of an MDS code.

          "description": "Data scientists across disciplines are increasingly in need of exploratory\nanalysis tools for data sets with a high volume of features. We expand upon\ngraph mining approaches for exploratory analysis of high-dimensional data to\nintroduce Sirius, a visualization package for researchers to explore feature\nrelationships among mixed data types using mutual information and network\nbackbone sparsification. Visualizations of feature relationships aid data\nscientists in finding meaningful dependence among features, which can engender\nfurther analysis for feature selection, feature extraction, projection,\nidentification of proxy variables, or insight into temporal variation at the\nmacro scale. Graph mining approaches for feature analysis exist, such as\nassociation networks of binary features, or correlation networks of\nquantitative features, but mixed data types present a unique challenge for\ndeveloping comprehensive feature networks for exploratory analysis. Using an\ninformation theoretic approach, Sirius supports heterogeneous data sets\nconsisting of binary, continuous quantitative, and discrete categorical data\ntypes, and provides a user interface exploring feature pairs with high mutual\ninformation scores. We leverage a backbone sparsification approach from network\ntheory as a dimensionality reduction technique, which probabilistically trims\nedges according to the local network context. Sirius is an open source Python\npackage and Django web application for exploratory visualization, which can be\ndeployed in data analysis pipelines. The Sirius codebase and exemplary data\nsets can be found at: https://github.com/compstorylab/sirius",

The PLT problem includes one or more remote server(s)\nstoring (identical copies of) $K$ messages and a user who wants to compute $L$\nindependent linear combinations of a $D$-subset of messages. The objective of\nthe user is to perform the computation by downloading minimum possible amount\nof information from the server(s), while protecting the identities of the $D$\nmessages required for the computation. In this work, we focus on the\nsingle-server setting of the PLT problem when the identities of the $D$\nmessages required for the computation must be protected jointly. We consider\ntwo different models, depending on whether the coefficient matrix of the\nrequired $L$ linear combinations generates a Maximum Distance Separable (MDS)\ncode. We prove that the capacity for both models is given by $L/(K-D+L)$, where\nthe capacity is defined as the supremum of all achievable download rates. Our\nconverse proofs are based on linear-algebraic and information-theoretic\narguments that establish connections between PLT schemes and linear codes.

          "description": "Proper initialization is crucial to the optimization and the generalization\nof neural networks. However, most existing neural recommendation systems\ninitialize the user and item embeddings randomly. In this work, we propose a\nnew initialization scheme for user and item embeddings called Laplacian\nEigenmaps with Popularity-based Regularization for Isolated Data (LEPORID).\nLEPORID endows the embeddings with information regarding multi-scale\nneighborhood structures on the data manifold and performs adaptive\nregularization to compensate for high embedding variance on the tail of the\ndata distribution. Exploiting matrix sparsity, LEPORID embeddings can be\ncomputed efficiently. We evaluate LEPORID in a wide range of neural\nrecommendation models. In contrast to the recent surprising finding that the\nsimple K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) method often outperforms neural recommendation\nsystems, we show that existing neural systems initialized with LEPORID often\nperform on par or better than KNN. To maximize the effects of the\ninitialization, we propose the Dual-Loss Residual Recommendation (DLR2)\nnetwork, which, when initialized with LEPORID, substantially outperforms both\ntraditional and state-of-the-art neural recommender systems.",

          "description": "CTR prediction, which aims to estimate the probability that a user will click\nan item, plays a crucial role in online advertising and recommender system.\nFeature interaction modeling based and user interest mining based methods are\nthe two kinds of most popular techniques that have been extensively explored\nfor many years and have made great progress for CTR prediction. However, (1)\nfeature interaction based methods which rely heavily on the co-occurrence of\ndifferent features, may suffer from the feature sparsity problem (i.e., many\nfeatures appear few times); (2) user interest mining based methods which need\nrich user behaviors to obtain user's diverse interests, are easy to encounter\nthe behavior sparsity problem (i.e., many users have very short behavior\nsequences). To solve these problems, we propose a novel module named Dual Graph\nenhanced Embedding, which is compatible with various CTR prediction models to\nalleviate these two problems. We further propose a Dual Graph enhanced\nEmbedding Neural Network (DG-ENN) for CTR prediction. Dual Graph enhanced\nEmbedding exploits the strengths of graph representation with two carefully\ndesigned learning strategies (divide-and-conquer, curriculum-learning-inspired\norganized learning) to refine the embedding. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world industrial datasets. The experimental results\nshow that our proposed DG-ENN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CTR\nprediction models. Moreover, when applying to state-of-the-art CTR prediction\nmodels, Dual graph enhanced embedding always obtains better performance.\nFurther case studies prove that our proposed dual graph enhanced embedding\ncould alleviate the feature sparsity and behavior sparsity problems. Our\nframework will be open-source based on MindSpore in the near future.",

Previous queries in the user session can provide useful context for the\nuser's intent and can be leveraged to suggest auto-completions that are more\nrelevant while adhering to the user's prefix. Such session-aware QACs can be\ngenerated by recent sequence-to-sequence deep learning models; however, these\ngenerative approaches often do not meet the stringent latency requirements of\nresponding to each user keystroke. Moreover, these generative approaches pose\nthe risk of showing nonsensical queries.\n\nIn this paper, we provide a solution to this problem: we take the novel\napproach of modeling session-aware QAC as an eXtreme Multi-Label Ranking (XMR)\nproblem where the input is the previous query in the session and the user's\ncurrent prefix, while the output space is the set of tens of millions of\nqueries entered by users in the recent past. We adapt a popular XMR algorithm\nfor this purpose by proposing several modifications to the key steps in the\nalgorithm. The proposed modifications yield a 10x improvement in terms of Mean\nReciprocal Rank (MRR) over the baseline XMR approach on a public search logs\ndataset.

          "description": "Static recommendation methods like collaborative filtering suffer from the\ninherent limitation of performing real-time personalization for cold-start\nusers. Online recommendation, e.g., multi-armed bandit approach, addresses this\nlimitation by interactively exploring user preference online and pursuing the\nexploration-exploitation (EE) trade-off. However, existing bandit-based methods\nmodel recommendation actions homogeneously. Specifically, they only consider\nthe items as the arms, being incapable of handling the item attributes, which\nnaturally provide interpretable information of user's current demands and can\neffectively filter out undesired items. In this work, we consider the\nconversational recommendation for cold-start users, where a system can both ask\nthe attributes from and recommend items to a user interactively. This important\nscenario was studied in a recent work. However, it employs a hand-crafted\nfunction to decide when to ask attributes or make recommendations. Such\nseparate modeling of attributes and items makes the effectiveness of the system\nhighly rely on the choice of the hand-crafted function, thus introducing\nfragility to the system. To address this limitation, we seamlessly unify\nattributes and items in the same arm space and achieve their EE trade-offs\nautomatically using the framework of Thompson Sampling. Our Conversational\nThompson Sampling (ConTS) model holistically solves all questions in\nconversational recommendation by choosing the arm with the maximal reward to\nplay. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that ConTS\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods Conversational UCB (ConUCB) and\nEstimation-Action-Reflection model in both metrics of success rate and average\nnumber of conversation turns.",

          "description": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been integrated in several models of\nrecommendation to augment the informational value of an item by means of its\nrelated entities in the graph. Yet, existing datasets only provide explicit\nratings on items and no information is provided about user opinions of other\n(non-recommendable) entities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new\ndataset, called the MindReader, providing explicit user ratings both for items\nand for KG entities. In this first version, the MindReader dataset provides\nmore than 102 thousands explicit ratings collected from 1,174 real users on\nboth items and entities from a KG in the movie domain. This dataset has been\ncollected through an online interview application that we also release open\nsource. As a demonstration of the importance of this new dataset, we present a\ncomparative study of the effect of the inclusion of ratings on non-item KG\nentities in a variety of state-of-the-art recommendation models. In particular,\nwe show that most models, whether designed specifically for graph data or not,\nsee improvements in recommendation quality when trained on explicit non-item\nratings. Moreover, for some models, we show that non-item ratings can\neffectively replace item ratings without loss of recommendation quality.

          "description": "With the popularity of Machine Learning (ML) solutions, algorithms and data\nhave been released faster than the capacity of processing them. In this\ncontext, the problem of Algorithm Recommendation (AR) is receiving a\nsignificant deal of attention recently. This problem has been addressed in the\nliterature as a learning task, often as a Meta-Learning problem where the aim\nis to recommend the best alternative for a specific dataset. For such, datasets\nencoded by meta-features are explored by ML algorithms that try to learn the\nmapping between meta-representations and the best technique to be used. One of\nthe challenges for the successful use of ML is to define which features are the\nmost valuable for a specific dataset since several meta-features can be used,\nwhich increases the meta-feature dimension. This paper presents an empirical\nanalysis of Feature Selection and Feature Extraction in the meta-level for the\nAR problem. The present study was focused on three criteria: predictive\nperformance, dimensionality reduction, and pipeline runtime. As we verified,\napplying Dimensionality Reduction (DR) methods did not improve predictive\nperformances in general. However, DR solutions reduced about 80% of the\nmeta-features, obtaining pretty much the same performance as the original setup\nbut with lower runtimes. The only exception was PCA, which presented about the\nsame runtime as the original meta-features. Experimental results also showed\nthat various datasets have many non-informative meta-features and that it is\npossible to obtain high predictive performance using around 20% of the original\nmeta-features. Therefore, due to their natural trend for high dimensionality,\nDR methods should be used for Meta-Feature Selection and Meta-Feature\nExtraction.",

The Edge Intelligence (EI) has led to the emergence of edge devices in\nvarious application domains. The EI can provide efficient services to\ndelay-sensitive applications, where the edge devices are deployed as edge nodes\nto host the majority of execution, which can effectively manage services and\nimprove service discovery efficiency. The multilevel index model is a\nwell-known model used for indexing service, such a model is being introduced\nand optimized in the edge environments to efficiently services discovery whilst\nmanaging large volumes of data.

Addressing this issue, this paper\nproposes a designated key selection method to improve the efficiency of adding\nservices in the multilevel index models. Our experimental results show that in\nthe partial index and the full index of multilevel index model, our method\nreduces the service addition time by around 84% and 76%, respectively when\ncompared with the original key selection method and by around 78% and 66%,\nrespectively when compared with the random selection method.

In this work, we address those two challenges by proposing a\nnovel approach to mine semantically-relevant fresh documents, and their topic\nlabels, with little human supervision. Meanwhile, we design a multitask model\ncalled NewsEmbed that alternatively trains a contrastive learning with a\nmulti-label classification to derive a universal document encoder.

          "description": "In this paper, we propose a highly practical fully online multi-object\ntracking and segmentation (MOTS) method that uses instance segmentation results\nas an input. The proposed method is based on the Gaussian mixture probability\nhypothesis density (GMPHD) filter, a hierarchical data association (HDA), and a\nmask-based affinity fusion (MAF) model to achieve high-performance online\ntracking. The HDA consists of two associations: segment-to-track and\ntrack-to-track associations. One affinity, for position and motion, is computed\nby using the GMPHD filter, and the other affinity, for appearance is computed\nby using the responses from a single object tracker such as a kernalized\ncorrelation filter. These two affinities are simply fused by using a\nscore-level fusion method such as min-max normalization referred to as MAF. In\naddition, to reduce the number of false positive segments, we adopt mask\nIoU-based merging (mask merging). The proposed MOTS framework with the key\nmodules: HDA, MAF, and mask merging, is easily extensible to simultaneously\ntrack multiple types of objects with CPU only execution in parallel processing.\nIn addition, the developed framework only requires simple parameter tuning\nunlike many existing MOTS methods that need intensive hyperparameter\noptimization. In the experiments on the two popular MOTS datasets, the key\nmodules show some improvements. For instance, ID-switch decreases by more than\nhalf compared to a baseline method in the training sets. In conclusion, our\ntracker achieves state-of-the-art MOTS performance in the test sets.",

          "description": "As a crucial part of video compression, intra prediction utilizes local\ninformation of images to eliminate the redundancy in spatial domain. In both\nH.265/HEVC and H.266/VVC, multiple directional prediction modes are employed to\nfind the texture trend of each small block and then the prediction is made\nbased on reference samples in the selected direction. Recently, the intra\nprediction schemes based on neural networks have achieved great success. In\nthese methods, the networks are trained and applied to intra prediction in\naddition to the directional prediction modes. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndata clustering-driven neural network (dubbed DCDNN) for intra prediction,\nwhich can learn deep features of the clustered data. In DCDNN, each network can\nbe split into two networks by adding or subtracting Gaussian random noise. Then\na data clustering-driven training is applied to train all the derived networks\nrecursively. In each iteration, the entire training dataset is partitioned\naccording to the recovery qualities of the derived networks. For the\nexperiment, DCDNN is implemented into HEVC reference software HM-16.9. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that DCDNN can reach an average of 4.2%\nBjontegaard distortion rate (BDrate) improvement (up to 7.0%) over HEVC with\nall intra configuration.

          "description": "Recently, with the introduction of JPEG phase-aware steganalysis features,\ne.g., GFR, the design of JPEG steganographic distortion cost function turns to\nmaintain not only the statistical undetectability in DCT domain but also in\nspatial domain. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a novel paradigm for\nthe design of JPEG steganographic distortion cost function, which calculates\nthe distortion cost via a generalized Distortion Cost Domain Transformation\n(DCDT) function. The proposed function comprises the decompressed pixel block\nembedding changes and their corresponding embedding distortion costs for unit\nchange, where the pixel embedding distortion costs are represented in a more\ngeneral exponential model, aiming to flexibly allocate the embedding data. In\nthis way, the JPEG steganography could be formulated as the optimization\nproblem of minimizing the overall distortion cost in its decompressed spatial\ndomain, which is equivalent to maximizing its statistical undetectability\nagainst JPEG phase-aware steganalysis features. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed DCDT equipped with HiLL (a spatial steganographic distortion cost\nfunction) is superior to other state-of-the-art JPEG steganographic schemes,\ne.g., UERD, J-UNIWARD, and GUED in resisting the detection of JPEG phase-aware\nfeature-based steganalyzers GFR and SCA-GFR, and rivals BET-HiLL with one order\nof magnitude lower computational complexity, along with the possibility of\nbeing further improved by considering the mutually dependent embedding\ninteractions.

In the experiment, we consider practical domain\ngeneralization problems, such as the variations in printing/imaging devices,\nsubstrates, recapturing channels, and document types. To evaluate the\nrobustness of different approaches, we benchmark some popular off-the-shelf\nmachine learning-based approaches, a state-of-the-art document image detection\nscheme, and the proposed schemes with different network backbones under various\nexperimental protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed schemes\nwith different network backbones have consistently outperformed the\nstate-of-the-art approaches under different experimental settings.\nSpecifically, under the most challenging scenario in our experiment, i.e.,\nevaluation across different types of documents that produced by different\ndevices, we have achieved less than 5.00% APCER (Attack Presentation\nClassification Error Rate) and 5.56% BPCER (Bona Fide Presentation\nClassification Error Rate) by the proposed network with ResNeXt101 backbone at\n5% BPCER decision threshold.",

          "description": "Scene graphs are semantic abstraction of images that encourage visual\nunderstanding and reasoning. However, the performance of Scene Graph Generation\n(SGG) is unsatisfactory when faced with biased data in real-world scenarios.\nConventional debiasing research mainly studies from the view of balancing data\ndistribution or learning unbiased models and representations, ignoring the\ncorrelations among the biased classes. In this work, we analyze this problem\nfrom a novel cognition perspective: automatically building a hierarchical\ncognitive structure from the biased predictions and navigating that hierarchy\nto locate the relationships, making the tail relationships receive more\nattention in a coarse-to-fine mode. To this end, we propose a novel debiasing\nCognition Tree (CogTree) loss for unbiased SGG. We first build a cognitive\nstructure CogTree to organize the relationships based on the prediction of a\nbiased SGG model. The CogTree distinguishes remarkably different relationships\nat first and then focuses on a small portion of easily confused ones. Then, we\npropose a debiasing loss specially for this cognitive structure, which supports\ncoarse-to-fine distinction for the correct relationships. The loss is\nmodel-agnostic and consistently boosting the performance of several\nstate-of-the-art models. The code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/CYVincent/Scene-Graph-Transformer-CogTree.",

          "description": "In this paper, we are tackling the weakly-supervised referring expression\ngrounding task, for the localization of a referent object in an image according\nto a query sentence, where the mapping between image regions and queries are\nnot available during the training stage. In traditional methods, an object\nregion that best matches the referring expression is picked out, and then the\nquery sentence is reconstructed from the selected region, where the\nreconstruction difference serves as the loss for back-propagation. The existing\nmethods, however, conduct both the matching and the reconstruction\napproximately as they ignore the fact that the matching correctness is unknown.\nTo overcome this limitation, a discriminative triad is designed here as the\nbasis to the solution, through which a query can be converted into one or\nmultiple discriminative triads in a very scalable way. Based on the\ndiscriminative triad, we further propose the triad-level matching and\nreconstruction modules which are lightweight yet effective for the\nweakly-supervised training, making it three times lighter and faster than the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods. One important merit of our work is its\nsuperior performance despite the simple and neat design.

          "description": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to generalize the knowledge learned\nfrom a well-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recently,\nadversarial domain adaptation with two distinct classifiers (bi-classifier) has\nbeen introduced into UDA which is effective to align distributions between\ndifferent domains. Previous bi-classifier adversarial learning methods only\nfocus on the similarity between the outputs of two distinct classifiers.\nHowever, the similarity of the outputs cannot guarantee the accuracy of target\nsamples, i.e., target samples may match to wrong categories even if the\ndiscrepancy between two classifiers is small. To challenge this issue, in this\npaper, we propose a cross-domain gradient discrepancy minimization (CGDM)\nmethod which explicitly minimizes the discrepancy of gradients generated by\nsource samples and target samples. Specifically, the gradient gives a cue for\nthe semantic information of target samples so it can be used as a good\nsupervision to improve the accuracy of target samples. In order to compute the\ngradient signal of target samples, we further obtain target pseudo labels\nthrough a clustering-based self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on\nthree widely used UDA datasets show that our method surpasses many previous\nstate-of-the-arts. Codes are available at https://github.com/lijin118/CGDM.",

First, it is aimed to analyse the\nbehaviour and performance of variant vision models ranging from Inception to\nNAS networks with the appropriate fine-tuning procedure. Second, the behaviour\nof these models is visually analysed by plotting CAMs for individual networks\nand determining classification performance with AUCROC curves. Thirdly, stacked\nensembles techniques are imparted to provide higher generalisation on combining\nthe fine-tuned models, in which six ensemble neural networks are designed by\ncombining the existing fine-tuned networks. Implying these stacked ensembles\nprovides a great generalization to the models. The ensemble model designed by\ncombining all the fine-tuned networks obtained a state-of-the-art accuracy\nscore of 99.17%.

View-attribute is then\ndelivered back to shallow network layers for supervising deep feature\nextraction. To explore the location of a view-attribute, regional attention is\nintroduced to aggregate spatial information of the input attribute feature in\nheight and width direction for constraining the image into a narrow range.\nMoreover, the inter-channel dependency of view-feature is embedded in the above\ntwo spatial directions.

          "description": "Recently, many methods based on hand-designed convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) have achieved promising results in automatic retinal vessel\nsegmentation. However, these CNNs remain constrained in capturing retinal\nvessels in complex fundus images. To improve their segmentation performance,\nthese CNNs tend to have many parameters, which may lead to overfitting and high\ncomputational complexity. Moreover, the manual design of competitive CNNs is\ntime-consuming and requires extensive empirical knowledge. Herein, a novel\nautomated design method, called Genetic U-Net, is proposed to generate a\nU-shaped CNN that can achieve better retinal vessel segmentation but with fewer\narchitecture-based parameters, thereby addressing the above issues. First, we\ndevised a condensed but flexible search space based on a U-shaped\nencoder-decoder. Then, we used an improved genetic algorithm to identify\nbetter-performing architectures in the search space and investigated the\npossibility of finding a superior network architecture with fewer parameters.\nThe experimental results show that the architecture obtained using the proposed\nmethod offered a superior performance with less than 1% of the number of the\noriginal U-Net parameters in particular and with significantly fewer parameters\nthan other state-of-the-art models.

Fundamentally, training a network is a parameter estimation problem.\nIn adaptive control theory, maintaining persistency of excitation (PoE) is\nintegral to ensuring convergence of parameter estimates in dynamical systems to\ntheir robust optima. In this work, we show that network training using gradient\ndescent is equivalent to a dynamical system parameter estimation problem.\nLeveraging this relationship, we prove a sufficient condition for PoE of\ngradient descent is achieved when the learning rate is less than the inverse of\nthe Lipschitz constant of the gradient of loss function. We provide an\nefficient technique for estimating the corresponding Lipschitz constant using\nextreme value theory and demonstrate that by only scaling the learning rate\nschedule we can increase adversarial accuracy by up to 15% points on benchmark\ndatasets. Our approach also universally increases the adversarial accuracy by\n0.1% to 0.3% points in various state-of-the-art adversarially trained models on\nthe AutoAttack benchmark, where every small margin of improvement is\nsignificant.",

In this paper, we prove a quantitative trade-off\nbetween spatial and adversarial robustness in a simple statistical setting. We\ncomplement this empirically by showing that: (a) as the spatial robustness of\nequivariant models improves by training augmentation with progressively larger\ntransformations, their adversarial robustness worsens progressively, and (b) as\nthe state-of-the-art robust models are adversarially trained with progressively\nlarger pixel-wise perturbations, their spatial robustness drops progressively.\nTowards achieving pareto-optimality in this trade-off, we propose a method\nbased on curriculum learning that trains gradually on more difficult\nperturbations (both spatial and adversarial) to improve spatial and adversarial\nrobustness simultaneously.",

However, this rules out the possibility of adjusting operation\nweights to cater for different paths, which limits the reliability of the\nevaluation results. In this paper, instead of counting on a single supernet, we\nintroduce $K$-shot supernets and take their weights for each operation as a\ndictionary. The operation weight for each path is represented as a convex\ncombination of items in a dictionary with a simplex code. This enables a matrix\napproximation of the stand-alone weight matrix with a higher rank ($K>1$). A\n\\textit{simplex-net} is introduced to produce architecture-customized code for\neach path. As a result, all paths can adaptively learn how to share weights in\nthe $K$-shot supernets and acquire corresponding weights for better evaluation.\n$K$-shot supernets and simplex-net can be iteratively trained, and we further\nextend the search to the channel dimension. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets validate that K-shot NAS significantly improves the evaluation\naccuracy of paths and thus brings in impressive performance improvements.",

          "description": "In this paper, we propose a highly practical fully online multi-object\ntracking and segmentation (MOTS) method that uses instance segmentation results\nas an input. The proposed method is based on the Gaussian mixture probability\nhypothesis density (GMPHD) filter, a hierarchical data association (HDA), and a\nmask-based affinity fusion (MAF) model to achieve high-performance online\ntracking. The HDA consists of two associations: segment-to-track and\ntrack-to-track associations. One affinity, for position and motion, is computed\nby using the GMPHD filter, and the other affinity, for appearance is computed\nby using the responses from a single object tracker such as a kernalized\ncorrelation filter. These two affinities are simply fused by using a\nscore-level fusion method such as min-max normalization referred to as MAF. In\naddition, to reduce the number of false positive segments, we adopt mask\nIoU-based merging (mask merging). The proposed MOTS framework with the key\nmodules: HDA, MAF, and mask merging, is easily extensible to simultaneously\ntrack multiple types of objects with CPU only execution in parallel processing.\nIn addition, the developed framework only requires simple parameter tuning\nunlike many existing MOTS methods that need intensive hyperparameter\noptimization. In the experiments on the two popular MOTS datasets, the key\nmodules show some improvements. For instance, ID-switch decreases by more than\nhalf compared to a baseline method in the training sets. In conclusion, our\ntracker achieves state-of-the-art MOTS performance in the test sets.",

In contrast, biological systems have\ncascaded dynamics: information propagates from neurons at all layers in\nparallel but transmission occurs gradually over time, leading to speed-accuracy\ntrade offs even in feedforward architectures. We explore the consequences of\nbiologically inspired parallel hardware by constructing cascaded ResNets in\nwhich each residual block has propagation delays but all blocks update in\nparallel in a stateful manner. Because information transmitted through skip\nconnections avoids delays, the functional depth of the architecture increases\nover time, yielding anytime predictions that improve with internal-processing\ntime. We introduce a temporal-difference training loss that achieves a strictly\nsuperior speed-accuracy profile over standard losses and enables the cascaded\narchitecture to outperform state-of-the-art anytime-prediction methods. The\ncascaded architecture has intriguing properties, including: it classifies\ntypical instances more rapidly than atypical instances; it is more robust to\nboth persistent and transient noise than is a conventional ResNet; and its\ntime-varying output trace provides a signal that can be exploited to improve\ninformation processing and inference.",

Recent work has\nchallenged this belief, showing that, on standard benchmarks, complex\nencoder-decoder architectures perform similarly to nearest-neighbor baselines\nor simple linear decoder models that exploit large amounts of per-category\ndata. However, building large collections of 3D shapes for supervised training\nis a laborious process; a more realistic and less constraining task is\ninferring 3D shapes for categories with few available training examples,\ncalling for a model that can successfully generalize to novel object classes.\nIn this work we experimentally demonstrate that naive baselines fail in this\nfew-shot learning setting, in which the network must learn informative shape\npriors for inference of new categories. We propose three ways to learn a\nclass-specific global shape prior, directly from data. Using these techniques,\nwe are able to capture multi-scale information about the 3D shape, and account\nfor intra-class variability by virtue of an implicit compositional structure.\nExperiments on the popular ShapeNet dataset show that our method outperforms a\nzero-shot baseline by over 40%, and the current state-of-the-art by over 10%,\nin terms of relative performance, in the few-shot setting.12",

          "description": "Pre-trained representations are becoming crucial for many NLP and perception\ntasks. While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw\ntext without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations\nstill rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require\nexpert knowledge. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned\nusing datasets with explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For\nvision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all\ninvolve a non-trivial data collection (and cleaning) process. This costly\ncuration process limits the size of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of\ntrained models. In this paper, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion\nimage alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing\nsteps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple dual-encoder architecture\nlearns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs\nusing a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for\nits noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even with such a simple\nlearning scheme. Our visual representation achieves strong performance when\ntransferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned\nvisual and language representations enables zero-shot image classification and\nalso set new state-of-the-art results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO image-text\nretrieval benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated\ncross-attention models. The representations also enable cross-modality search\nwith complex text and text + image queries.",

          "description": "Metric learning algorithms aim to learn a distance function that brings the\nsemantically similar data items together and keeps dissimilar ones at a\ndistance. The traditional Mahalanobis distance learning is equivalent to find a\nlinear projection. In contrast, Deep Metric Learning (DML) methods are proposed\nthat automatically extract features from data and learn a non-linear\ntransformation from input space to a semantically embedding space. Recently,\nmany DML methods are proposed focused to enhance the discrimination power of\nthe learned metric by providing novel sampling strategies or loss functions.\nThis approach is very helpful when both the training and test examples are\ncoming from the same set of categories. However, it is less effective in many\napplications of DML such as image retrieval and person-reidentification. Here,\nthe DML should learn general semantic concepts from observed classes and employ\nthem to rank or identify objects from unseen categories. Neglecting the\ngeneralization ability of the learned representation and just emphasizing to\nlearn a more discriminative embedding on the observed classes may lead to the\noverfitting problem. To address this limitation, we propose a framework to\nenhance the generalization power of existing DML methods in a Zero-Shot\nLearning (ZSL) setting by general yet discriminative representation learning\nand employing a class adversarial neural network. To learn a more general\nrepresentation, we propose to employ feature maps of intermediate layers in a\ndeep neural network and enhance their discrimination power through an attention\nmechanism. Besides, a class adversarial network is utilized to enforce the deep\nmodel to seek class invariant features for the DML task. We evaluate our work\non widely used machine vision datasets in a ZSL setting.",

However, there is still a severe lack of algorithmic solutions to\nproperly process the infrared images from these cameras that has led to several\nkey limitations: a lack of online monitoring capabilities for the laser tracks,\ninsufficient pre-processing of the infrared images for data-driven methods, and\nlarge memory requirements for storing the infrared images. To address these\nlimitations, we study over 30 segmentation algorithms that segment each\ninfrared image into a foreground and background. By evaluating each algorithm\nbased on its segmentation accuracy, computational speed, and spatter detection\ncharacteristics, we identify promising algorithmic solutions. The identified\nalgorithms can be readily applied to the laser powder bed fusion machines to\naddress each of the above limitations and thus, significantly improve process\ncontrol.",

          "description": "This work attempts to provide a plausible theoretical framework that aims to\ninterpret modern deep (convolutional) networks from the principles of data\ncompression and discriminative representation. We argue that for\nhigh-dimensional multi-class data, the optimal linear discriminative\nrepresentation maximizes the coding rate difference between the whole dataset\nand the average of all the subsets. We show that the basic iterative gradient\nascent scheme for optimizing the rate reduction objective naturally leads to a\nmulti-layer deep network, named ReduNet, which shares common characteristics of\nmodern deep networks. The deep layered architectures, linear and nonlinear\noperators, and even parameters of the network are all explicitly constructed\nlayer-by-layer via forward propagation, although they are amenable to\nfine-tuning via back propagation. All components of so-obtained ``white-box''\nnetwork have precise optimization, statistical, and geometric interpretation.\nMoreover, all linear operators of the so-derived network naturally become\nmulti-channel convolutions when we enforce classification to be rigorously\nshift-invariant. The derivation in the invariant setting suggests a trade-off\nbetween sparsity and invariance, and also indicates that such a deep\nconvolution network is significantly more efficient to construct and learn in\nthe spectral domain. Our preliminary simulations and experiments clearly verify\nthe effectiveness of both the rate reduction objective and the associated\nReduNet.

The point cloud is represented as an octree, with each\nresolution layer being sequentially encoded and decoded using arithmetic\ncoding, starting from the lowest resolution, until the final resolution is\nreached. The occupancy probability of each voxel of the splitting pattern at\neach node of the octree is modeled by a neural network, having at its input the\nalready encoded occupancy status of several octree nodes (belonging to the past\nand current resolutions), corresponding to a 3D context surrounding the node to\nbe encoded. The algorithm has a fast and a slow version, the fast version\nselecting differently several voxels of the context, which allows an increased\nparallelization by sending larger batches of templates to be estimated by the\nneural network, at both encoder and decoder.

In contrast to previous approaches\nthat either lack the ability to generalize to arbitrary identity or fail to\npreserve attributes like facial expression and gaze direction, our framework is\ncapable of transferring the identity of an arbitrary source face into an\narbitrary target face while preserving the attributes of the target face. We\novercome the above defects in the following two ways. First, we present the ID\nInjection Module (IIM) which transfers the identity information of the source\nface into the target face at feature level. By using this module, we extend the\narchitecture of an identity-specific face swapping algorithm to a framework for\narbitrary face swapping. Second, we propose the Weak Feature Matching Loss\nwhich efficiently helps our framework to preserve the facial attributes in an\nimplicit way. Extensive experiments on wild faces demonstrate that our SimSwap\nis able to achieve competitive identity performance while preserving attributes\nbetter than previous state-of-the-art methods.

However, in an open world, the unlabeled test images probably contain\nunknown categories and have different distributions from the labeled images.\nHence, in this paper, we consider a new, more realistic, and more challenging\nproblem setting where the pixel-level classifier has to be trained with labeled\nimages and unlabeled open-world images -- we name it open world semantic\nsegmentation (OSS). In OSS, the trained classifier is expected to identify\nunknown-class pixels and classify known-class pixels well. To solve OSS, we\nfirst investigate which distribution that unknown-class pixels obey. Then,\nmotivated by the goodness-of-fit test, we use statistical measurements to show\nhow a pixel fits the distribution of an unknown class and select highly-fitted\npixels to form the unknown region in each image. Eventually, we propose an\nend-to-end learning framework, known-region-aware domain alignment (KRADA), to\ndistinguish unknown classes while aligning distributions of known classes in\nlabeled and unlabeled open-world images.

We propose Spectral UDA (SUDA), an\nefficient yet effective UDA technique that works in the spectral space and is\ngeneric across different visual recognition tasks in detection, classification\nand segmentation. SUDA addresses UDA challenges from two perspectives. First,\nit mitigates inter-domain discrepancies by a spectrum transformer (ST) that\nmaps source and target images into spectral space and learns to enhance\ndomain-invariant spectra while suppressing domain-variant spectra\nsimultaneously. To this end, we design novel adversarial multi-head spectrum\nattention that leverages contextual information to identify domain-variant and\ndomain-invariant spectra effectively. Second, it mitigates the lack of\nannotations in target domain by introducing multi-view spectral learning which\naims to learn comprehensive yet confident target representations by maximizing\nthe mutual information among multiple ST augmentations capturing different\nspectral views of each target sample. Extensive experiments over different\nvisual tasks (e.g., detection, classification and segmentation) show that SUDA\nachieves superior accuracy and it is also complementary with state-of-the-art\nUDA methods with consistent performance boosts but little extra computation.",

          "description": "This paper introduces PyGAD, an open-source easy-to-use Python library for\nbuilding the genetic algorithm. PyGAD supports a wide range of parameters to\ngive the user control over everything in its life cycle. This includes, but is\nnot limited to, population, gene value range, gene data type, parent selection,\ncrossover, and mutation. PyGAD is designed as a general-purpose optimization\nlibrary that allows the user to customize the fitness function. Its usage\nconsists of 3 main steps: build the fitness function, create an instance of the\npygad.GA class, and calling the pygad.GA.run() method. The library supports\ntraining deep learning models created either with PyGAD itself or with\nframeworks like Keras and PyTorch. Given its stable state, PyGAD is also in\nactive development to respond to the user's requested features and enhancement\nreceived on GitHub https://github.com/ahmedfgad/GeneticAlgorithmPython. PyGAD\ncomes with documentation https://pygad.readthedocs.io for further details and\nexamples.",

          "description": "This work presents twelve fine-tuned deep learning architectures to solve the\nbacterial classification problem over the Digital Image of Bacterial Species\nDataset. The base architectures were mainly published as mobile or efficient\nsolutions to the ImageNet challenge, and all experiments presented in this work\nconsisted of making several modifications to the original designs, in order to\nmake them able to solve the bacterial classification problem by using\nfine-tuning and transfer learning techniques. This work also proposes a novel\ndata augmentation technique for this dataset, which is based on the idea of\nartificial zooming, strongly increasing the performance of every tested\narchitecture, even doubling it in some cases. In order to get robust and\ncomplete evaluations, all experiments were performed with 10-fold\ncross-validation and evaluated with five different metrics: top-1 and top-5\naccuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This paper presents a complete\ncomparison of the twelve different architectures, cross-validated with the\noriginal and the augmented version of the dataset, the results are also\ncompared with several literature methods. Overall, eight of the eleven\narchitectures surpassed the 0.95 scores in top-1 accuracy with our data\naugmentation method, being 0.9738 the highest top-1 accuracy. The impact of the\ndata augmentation technique is reported with relative improvement scores.",

          "description": "There is considerable evidence that deep neural networks are vulnerable to\nadversarial perturbations applied directly to their digital inputs. However, it\nremains an open question whether this translates to vulnerabilities in real\nsystems. For example, an attack on self-driving cars would in practice entail\nmodifying the driving environment, which then impacts the video inputs to the\ncar's controller, thereby indirectly leading to incorrect driving decisions.\nSuch attacks require accounting for system dynamics and tracking viewpoint\nchanges. We propose a scalable approach for finding adversarial modifications\nof a simulated autonomous driving environment using a differentiable\napproximation for the mapping from environmental modifications (rectangles on\nthe road) to the corresponding video inputs to the controller neural network.\nGiven the parameters of the rectangles, our proposed differentiable mapping\ncomposites them onto pre-recorded video streams of the original environment,\naccounting for geometric and color variations. Moreover, we propose a multiple\ntrajectory sampling approach that enables our attacks to be robust to a car's\nself-correcting behavior. When combined with a neural network-based controller,\nour approach allows the design of adversarial modifications through end-to-end\ngradient-based optimization. Using the Carla autonomous driving simulator, we\nshow that our approach is significantly more scalable and far more effective at\nidentifying autonomous vehicle vulnerabilities in simulation experiments than a\nstate-of-the-art approach based on Bayesian Optimization.",

In this work, we propose GFP-GAN that leverages rich and\ndiverse priors encapsulated in a pretrained face GAN for blind face\nrestoration. This Generative Facial Prior (GFP) is incorporated into the face\nrestoration process via novel channel-split spatial feature transform layers,\nwhich allow our method to achieve a good balance of realness and fidelity.\nThanks to the powerful generative facial prior and delicate designs, our\nGFP-GAN could jointly restore facial details and enhance colors with just a\nsingle forward pass, while GAN inversion methods require expensive\nimage-specific optimization at inference.

Current computer vision methods can do this, too,\nbut suffer from view generalization problems - the models inferred tend to make\npoor predictions of appearance in novel views. As for generalization problems\nin machine learning, the difficulty is balancing single-view accuracy (cf.\ntraining error; bias) with novel view accuracy (cf. test error; variance). We\ndescribe a class of models whose geometric rigidity is easily controlled to\nmanage this tradeoff. We describe a cycle consistency loss that improves view\ngeneralization (roughly, a model from a generated view should predict the\noriginal view well). View generalization of textures requires that models share\ntexture information, so a car seen from the back still has headlights because\nother cars have headlights.

          "description": "The ability to handle large scale variations is crucial for many real world\nvisual tasks. A straightforward approach for handling scale in a deep network\nis to process an image at several scales simultaneously in a set of scale\nchannels. Scale invariance can then, in principle, be achieved by using weight\nsharing between the scale channels together with max or average pooling over\nthe outputs from the scale channels. The ability of such scale channel networks\nto generalise to scales not present in the training set over significant scale\nranges has, however, not previously been explored.\n\nIn this paper, we present a systematic study of this methodology by\nimplementing different types of scale channel networks and evaluating their\nability to generalise to previously unseen scales. We develop a formalism for\nanalysing the covariance and invariance properties of scale channel networks,\nand explore how different design choices, unique to scaling transformations,\naffect the overall performance of scale channel networks. We first show that\ntwo previously proposed scale channel network designs do not generalise well to\nscales not present in the training set. We explain theoretically and\ndemonstrate experimentally why generalisation fails in these cases.\n\nWe then propose a new type of foveated scale channel architecture}, where the\nscale channels process increasingly larger parts of the image with decreasing\nresolution. This new type of scale channel network is shown to generalise\nextremely well, provided sufficient image resolution and the absence of\nboundary effects. Our proposed FovMax and FovAvg networks perform almost\nidentically over a scale range of 8, also when training on single scale\ntraining data, and do also give improved performance when learning from\ndatasets with large scale variations in the small sample regime.",

Most approaches rely on losses that only take the relations between\npairs or triplets of samples into account, which either belong to the same\nclass or two different classes. However, these methods do not explore the\nembedding space in its entirety. To this end, we propose an approach based on\nmessage passing networks that takes all the relations in a mini-batch into\naccount. We refine embedding vectors by exchanging messages among all samples\nin a given batch allowing the training process to be aware of its overall\nstructure. Since not all samples are equally important to predict a decision\nboundary, we use an attention mechanism during message passing to allow samples\nto weigh the importance of each neighbor accordingly. We achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on clustering and image retrieval on the CUB-200-2011,\nCars196, Stanford Online Products, and In-Shop Clothes datasets. To facilitate\nfurther research, we make available the code and the models at\nhttps://github.com/dvl-tum/intra_batch_connections.",

On the other hand, applying traditional clustering and\nfeature reduction techniques to the highly dimensional pixel space can be\nineffective. To address these issues, in this paper we propose DELIUS: a DEep\nlearning approach to cLustering vIsUal artS. The method uses a pre-trained\nconvolutional network to extract features and then feeds these features into a\ndeep embedded clustering model, where the task of mapping the raw input data to\na latent space is jointly optimized with the task of finding a set of cluster\ncentroids in this latent space. Quantitative and qualitative experimental\nresults show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

With\ntheoretical justifications and in-depth analysis, our BiPointNet introduces\nEntropy-Maximizing Aggregation (EMA) to modulate the distribution before\naggregation for the maximum information entropy, and Layer-wise Scale Recovery\n(LSR) to efficiently restore feature representation capacity. Extensive\nexperiments show that BiPointNet outperforms existing binarization methods by\nconvincing margins, at the level even comparable with the full precision\ncounterpart. We highlight that our techniques are generic, guaranteeing\nsignificant improvements on various fundamental tasks and mainstream backbones.\nMoreover, BiPointNet gives an impressive 14.7x speedup and 18.9x storage saving\non real-world resource-constrained devices.",

Existing techniques that invert global\nlight transport require image capture under multiplexed controlled lighting, or\nonly enable the decomposition of a single image at slow off-line frame rates.\nIn contrast, our approach works for regular videos and produces temporally\ncoherent decomposition layers at real-time frame rates.

The resulting variational\ndecomposition problem uses a new formulation based on sparse and dense sets of\nnon-linear equations that we solve efficiently using a novel alternating\ndata-parallel optimization strategy. We evaluate our approach qualitatively and\nquantitatively, and show improvements over the state of the art in this field,\nin both quality and runtime.

          "description": "Multi-modal MRIs are widely used in neuroimaging applications since different\nMR sequences provide complementary information about brain structures. Recent\nworks have suggested that multi-modal deep learning analysis can benefit from\nexplicitly disentangling anatomical (shape) and modality (appearance)\ninformation into separate image presentations. In this work, we challenge\nmainstream strategies by showing that they do not naturally lead to\nrepresentation disentanglement both in theory and in practice. To address this\nissue, we propose a margin loss that regularizes the similarity in\nrelationships of the representations across subjects and modalities. To enable\nrobust training, we further use a conditional convolution to design a single\nmodel for encoding images of all modalities. Lastly, we propose a fusion\nfunction to combine the disentangled anatomical representations as a set of\nmodality-invariant features for downstream tasks. We evaluate the proposed\nmethod on three multi-modal neuroimaging datasets. Experiments show that our\nproposed method can achieve superior disentangled representations compared to\nexisting disentanglement strategies. Results also indicate that the fused\nanatomical representation has potential in the downstream task of zero-dose PET\nreconstruction and brain tumor segmentation.

          "description": "Sparse adversarial attacks can fool deep neural networks (DNNs) by only\nperturbing a few pixels (regularized by l_0 norm). Recent efforts combine it\nwith another l_infty imperceptible on the perturbation magnitudes. The\nresultant sparse and imperceptible attacks are practically relevant, and\nindicate an even higher vulnerability of DNNs that we usually imagined.\nHowever, such attacks are more challenging to generate due to the optimization\ndifficulty by coupling the l_0 regularizer and box constraints with a\nnon-convex objective. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a\nhomotopy algorithm, to jointly tackle the sparsity and the perturbation bound\nin one unified framework. Each iteration, the main step of our algorithm is to\noptimize an l_0-regularized adversarial loss, by leveraging the nonmonotone\nAccelerated Proximal Gradient Method (nmAPG) for nonconvex programming; it is\nfollowed by an l_0 change control step, and an optional post-attack step\ndesigned to escape bad local minima. We also extend the algorithm to handling\nthe structural sparsity regularizer. We extensively examine the effectiveness\nof our proposed homotopy attack for both targeted and non-targeted attack\nscenarios, on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, our homotopy attack leads to significantly fewer perturbations, e.g.,\nreducing 42.91% on CIFAR-10 and 75.03% on ImageNet (average case, targeted\nattack), at similar maximal perturbation magnitudes, when still achieving 100%\nattack success rates.

At each\noptimization step, neurons at a given layer receive feedback from neurons\nbelonging to higher layers of the hierarchy. In this paper, we propose to\ncomplement this traditional 'between-layer' feedback with additional\n'within-layer' feedback to encourage diversity of the activations within the\nsame layer. To this end, we measure the pairwise similarity between the outputs\nof the neurons and use it to model the layer's overall diversity. By penalizing\nsimilarities and promoting diversity, we encourage each neuron to learn a\ndistinctive representation and, thus, to enrich the data representation learned\nwithin the layer and to increase the total capacity of the model. We\ntheoretically study how the within-layer activation diversity affects the\ngeneralization performance of a neural network and prove that increasing the\ndiversity of hidden activations reduces the estimation error. In addition to\nthe theoretical guarantees, we present an empirical study on three datasets\nconfirming that the proposed approach enhances the performance of\nstate-of-the-art neural network models and decreases the generalization gap.",

          "description": "Clustering is one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision and pattern\nrecognition. Recently, deep clustering methods (algorithms based on deep\nlearning) have attracted wide attention with their impressive performance. Most\nof these algorithms combine deep unsupervised representation learning and\nstandard clustering together. However, the separation of representation\nlearning and clustering will lead to suboptimal solutions because the two-stage\nstrategy prevents representation learning from adapting to subsequent tasks\n(e.g., clustering according to specific cues). To overcome this issue, efforts\nhave been made in the dynamic adaption of representation and cluster\nassignment, whereas current state-of-the-art methods suffer from heuristically\nconstructed objectives with representation and cluster assignment alternatively\noptimized. To further standardize the clustering problem, we audaciously\nformulate the objective of clustering as finding a precise feature as the cue\nfor cluster assignment. Based on this, we propose a general-purpose deep\nclustering framework which radically integrates representation learning and\nclustering into a single pipeline for the first time. The proposed framework\nexploits the powerful ability of recently developed generative models for\nlearning intrinsic features, and imposes an entropy minimization on the\ndistribution of the cluster assignment by a dedicated variational algorithm.\nExperimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is\nsuperior, or at least comparable to, the state-of-the-art methods on the\nhandwritten digit recognition, fashion recognition, face recognition and object\nrecognition benchmark datasets.",

          "description": "Motivated by the vast success of deep convolutional networks, there is a\ngreat interest in generalizing convolutions to non-Euclidean manifolds. A major\ncomplication in comparison to flat spaces is that it is unclear in which\nalignment a convolution kernel should be applied on a manifold. The underlying\nreason for this ambiguity is that general manifolds do not come with a\ncanonical choice of reference frames (gauge). Kernels and features therefore\nhave to be expressed relative to arbitrary coordinates. We argue that the\nparticular choice of coordinatization should not affect a network's inference\n-- it should be coordinate independent. A simultaneous demand for coordinate\nindependence and weight sharing is shown to result in a requirement on the\nnetwork to be equivariant under local gauge transformations (changes of local\nreference frames). The ambiguity of reference frames depends thereby on the\nG-structure of the manifold, such that the necessary level of gauge\nequivariance is prescribed by the corresponding structure group G. Coordinate\nindependent convolutions are proven to be equivariant w.r.t. those isometries\nthat are symmetries of the G-structure. The resulting theory is formulated in a\ncoordinate free fashion in terms of fiber bundles. To exemplify the design of\ncoordinate independent convolutions, we implement a convolutional network on\nthe M\\\"obius strip. The generality of our differential geometric formulation of\nconvolutional networks is demonstrated by an extensive literature review which\nexplains a large number of Euclidean CNNs, spherical CNNs and CNNs on general\nsurfaces as specific instances of coordinate independent convolutions.",

To this end, we\nintroduce a method to estimate arbitrary, non-parametric distributions on\nSO(3). Our key idea is to represent the distributions implicitly, with a neural\nnetwork that estimates the probability given the input image and a candidate\npose.

The task of reliably spotting such expressions in\nvideo sequences is currently unsolved.

The spatial pooling\npurpose is to combine neighbouring descriptors to obtain a single descriptor\nfor a given region (local or global). The resultant combined vector must be as\ndiscriminant as possible, in other words, must contain relevant information,\nwhile removing irrelevant and confusing details. Maximum and average are the\nmost common aggregation functions used in the pooling step. To improve the\naggregation of relevant information without degrading their discriminative\npower for image classification, we introduce a simple but effective scheme\nbased on Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) aggregation operators. We present a\nmethod to learn the weights of the OWA aggregation operator in a Bag-of-Words\nframework and in Convolutional Neural Networks, and provide an extensive\nevaluation showing that OWA based pooling outperforms classical aggregation\noperators.",

Existing methods heavily rely on accurate demographic annotations.\nHowever, such annotations are usually unavailable in real scenarios. Moreover,\nthese methods are typically designed for a specific demographic group and are\nnot general enough. In this paper, we propose a false positive rate penalty\nloss, which mitigates face recognition bias by increasing the consistency of\ninstance False Positive Rate (FPR). Specifically, we first define the instance\nFPR as the ratio between the number of the non-target similarities above a\nunified threshold and the total number of the non-target similarities. The\nunified threshold is estimated for a given total FPR. Then, an additional\npenalty term, which is in proportion to the ratio of instance FPR overall FPR,\nis introduced into the denominator of the softmax-based loss. The larger the\ninstance FPR, the larger the penalty. By such unequal penalties, the instance\nFPRs are supposed to be consistent. Compared with the previous debiasing\nmethods, our method requires no demographic annotations. Thus, it can mitigate\nthe bias among demographic groups divided by various attributes, and these\nattributes are not needed to be previously predefined during training.\nExtensive experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method over state-of-the-art competitors.

This typically requires complex multi-camera\nsetups and controlled conditions, which in turn creates a domain gap that is\nhard to bridge to fully unconstrained settings. Encouraged by the success of\ncontrastive learning on image classification tasks, we propose a new\nself-supervised method for the structured regression task of 3D hand pose\nestimation. Contrastive learning makes use of unlabeled data for the purpose of\nrepresentation learning via a loss formulation that encourages the learned\nfeature representations to be invariant under any image transformation. For 3D\nhand pose estimation, it too is desirable to have invariance to appearance\ntransformation such as color jitter. However, the task requires equivariance\nunder affine transformations, such as rotation and translation. To address this\nissue, we propose an equivariant contrastive objective and demonstrate its\neffectiveness in the context of 3D hand pose estimation. We experimentally\ninvestigate the impact of invariant and equivariant contrastive objectives and\nshow that learning equivariant features leads to better representations for the\ntask of 3D hand pose estimation.

The success of weight-sharing NAS\nheavily relies on distilling the knowledge of the supernet to the sub-networks.\nHowever, we find that the widely used distillation divergence, i.e., KL\ndivergence, may lead to student sub-networks that over-estimate or\nunder-estimate the uncertainty of the teacher supernet, leading to inferior\nperformance of the sub-networks. In this work, we propose to improve the\nsupernet training with a more generalized alpha-divergence. By adaptively\nselecting the alpha-divergence, we simultaneously prevent the over-estimation\nor under-estimation of the uncertainty of the teacher model. We apply the\nproposed alpha-divergence based supernets training to both slimmable neural\nnetworks and weight-sharing NAS, and demonstrate significant improvements.\nSpecifically, our discovered model family, AlphaNet, outperforms prior-art\nmodels on a wide range of FLOPs regimes, including BigNAS, Once-for-All\nnetworks, and AttentiveNAS. We achieve ImageNet top-1 accuracy of 80.0% with\nonly 444M FLOPs. Our code and pretrained models are available at\nhttps://github.com/facebookresearch/AlphaNet.",

To counter these costs, interest has\nsurged in learning from cheaper data sources, such as unlabeled images. In this\npaper we go a step further and ask if we can do away with real image datasets\nentirely, instead learning from noise processes. We investigate a suite of\nimage generation models that produce images from simple random processes. These\nare then used as training data for a visual representation learner with a\ncontrastive loss. We study two types of noise processes, statistical image\nmodels and deep generative models under different random initializations. Our\nfindings show that it is important for the noise to capture certain structural\nproperties of real data but that good performance can be achieved even with\nprocesses that are far from realistic.

          "description": "Surface comparison and matching is a challenging problem in computer vision.\nWhile reparametrization-invariant Sobolev metrics provide meaningful elastic\ndistances and point correspondences via the geodesic boundary value problem,\nsolving this problem numerically tends to be difficult. Square root normal\nfields (SRNF) considerably simplify the computation of certain elastic\ndistances between parametrized surfaces. Yet they leave open the issue of\nfinding optimal reparametrizations, which induce elastic distances between\nunparametrized surfaces. This issue has concentrated much effort in recent\nyears and led to the development of several numerical frameworks. In this\npaper, we take an alternative approach which bypasses the direct estimation of\nreparametrizations: we relax the geodesic boundary constraint using an\nauxiliary parametrization-blind varifold fidelity metric. This reformulation\nhas several notable benefits. By avoiding altogether the need for\nreparametrizations, it provides the flexibility to deal with simplicial meshes\nof arbitrary topologies and sampling patterns. Moreover, the problem lends\nitself to a coarse-to-fine multi-resolution implementation, which makes the\nalgorithm scalable to large meshes. Furthermore, this approach extends readily\nto higher-order feature maps such as square root curvature fields and is also\nable to include surface textures in the matching problem.

          "description": "The capability of the traditional semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods is\nfar from real-world application since they do not consider (1) class imbalance\nand (2) class distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data. This\npaper addresses such a relatively under-explored problem, imbalanced\nsemi-supervised learning, where heavily biased pseudo-labels can harm the model\nperformance. Interestingly, we find that the semantic pseudo-labels from a\nsimilarity-based classifier in feature space and the traditional pseudo-labels\nfrom the linear classifier show the complementary property. To this end, we\npropose a general pseudo-labeling framework to address the bias motivated by\nthis observation. The key idea is to class-adaptively blend the semantic\npseudo-label to the linear one, depending on the current pseudo-label\ndistribution. Thereby, the increased semantic pseudo-label component suppresses\nthe false positives in the majority classes and vice versa. We term the novel\npseudo-labeling framework for imbalanced SSL as Distribution-Aware\nSemantics-Oriented (DASO) Pseudo-label. Extensive evaluation on CIFAR10/100-LT\nand STL10-LT shows that DASO consistently outperforms both recently proposed\nre-balancing methods for label and pseudo-label. Moreover, we demonstrate that\ntypical SSL algorithms can effectively benefit from unlabeled data with DASO,\nespecially when (1) class imbalance and (2) class distribution mismatch exist\nand even on recent real-world Semi-Aves benchmark.",

          "description": "Neural networks are prone to catastrophic forgetting when trained\nincrementally on different tasks. In order to prevent forgetting, most existing\nmethods retain a small subset of previously seen samples, which in turn can be\nused for joint training with new tasks. While this is indeed effective, it may\nnot always be possible to store such samples, e.g., due to data protection\nregulations. In these cases, one can instead employ generative models to create\nartificial samples or features representing memories from previous tasks.\nFollowing a similar direction, we propose GenIFeR (Generative Implicit Feature\nReplay) for class-incremental learning. The main idea is to train a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to generate images that contain realistic features.\nWhile the generator creates images at full resolution, the discriminator only\nsees the corresponding features extracted by the continually trained\nclassifier. Since the classifier compresses raw images into features that are\nactually relevant for classification, the GAN can match this target\ndistribution more accurately. On the other hand, allowing the generator to\ncreate full resolution images has several benefits: In contrast to previous\napproaches, the feature extractor of the classifier does not have to be frozen.\nIn addition, we can employ augmentations on generated images, which not only\nboosts classification performance, but also mitigates discriminator overfitting\nduring GAN training. We empirically show that GenIFeR is superior to both\nconventional generative image and feature replay. In particular, we\nsignificantly outperform the state-of-the-art in generative replay for various\nsettings on the CIFAR-100 and CUB-200 datasets.",

          "description": "Hand pose estimation is difficult due to different environmental conditions,\nobject- and self-occlusion as well as diversity in hand shape and appearance.\nExhaustively covering this wide range of factors in fully annotated datasets\nhas remained impractical, posing significant challenges for generalization of\nsupervised methods. Embracing this challenge, we propose to combine ideas from\nadversarial training and motion modelling to tap into unlabeled videos. To this\nend we propose what to the best of our knowledge is the first motion model for\nhands and show that an adversarial formulation leads to better generalization\nproperties of the hand pose estimator via semi-supervised training on unlabeled\nvideo sequences. In this setting, the pose predictor must produce a valid\nsequence of hand poses, as determined by a discriminative adversary. This\nadversary reasons both on the structural as well as temporal domain,\neffectively exploiting the spatio-temporal structure in the task. The main\nadvantage of our approach is that we can make use of unpaired videos and joint\nsequence data both of which are much easier to attain than paired training\ndata. We perform extensive evaluation, investigating essential components\nneeded for the proposed framework and empirically demonstrate in two\nchallenging settings that the proposed approach leads to significant\nimprovements in pose estimation accuracy.

The high intrinsic similarities between the concealed objects and\ntheir background make COD far more challenging than traditional object\ndetection/segmentation. To better understand this task, we collect a\nlarge-scale dataset, called COD10K, which consists of 10,000 images covering\nconcealed objects in diverse real-world scenarios from 78 object categories.\nFurther, we provide rich annotations including object categories, object\nboundaries, challenging attributes, object-level labels, and instance-level\nannotations. Our COD10K is the largest COD dataset to date, with the richest\nannotations, which enables comprehensive concealed object understanding and can\neven be used to help progress several other vision tasks, such as detection,\nsegmentation, classification, etc. Motivated by how animals hunt in the wild,\nwe also design a simple but strong baseline for COD, termed the Search\nIdentification Network (SINet). Without any bells and whistles, SINet\noutperforms 12 cutting-edge baselines on all datasets tested, making them\nrobust, general architectures that could serve as catalysts for future research\nin COD.

          "description": "The ultrasound (US) screening of the infant hip is vital for the early\ndiagnosis of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The US diagnosis of DDH\nrefers to measuring alpha and beta angles that quantify hip joint development.\nThese two angles are calculated from key anatomical landmarks and structures of\nthe hip. However, this measurement process is not trivial for sonographers and\nusually requires a thorough understanding of complex anatomical structures. In\nthis study, we propose a multi-task framework to learn the relationships among\nlandmarks and structures jointly and automatically evaluate DDH. Our multi-task\nnetworks are equipped with three novel modules. Firstly, we adopt Mask R-CNN as\nthe basic framework to detect and segment key anatomical structures and add one\nlandmark detection branch to form a new multi-task framework. Secondly, we\npropose a novel shape similarity loss to refine the incomplete anatomical\nstructure prediction robustly and accurately. Thirdly, we further incorporate\nthe landmark-structure consistent prior to ensure the consistency of the bony\nrim estimated from the segmented structure and the detected landmark. In our\nexperiments, 1,231 US images of the infant hip from 632 patients are collected,\nof which 247 images from 126 patients are tested. The average errors in alpha\nand beta angles are 2.221 degrees and 2.899 degrees. About 93% and 85%\nestimates of alpha and beta angles have errors less than 5 degrees,\nrespectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can\naccurately and robustly realize the automatic evaluation of DDH, showing great\npotential for clinical application.",

However, directly training the vision transformers may\nyield unstable and sub-optimal results. Recent works propose to improve the\nperformance of the vision transformers by modifying the transformer structures,\ne.g., incorporating convolution layers. In contrast, we investigate an\northogonal approach to stabilize the vision transformer training without\nmodifying the networks. We observe the instability of the training can be\nattributed to the significant similarity across the extracted patch\nrepresentations. More specifically, for deep vision transformers, the\nself-attention blocks tend to map different patches into similar latent\nrepresentations, yielding information loss and performance degradation. To\nalleviate this problem, in this work, we introduce novel loss functions in\nvision transformer training to explicitly encourage diversity across patch\nrepresentations for more discriminative feature extraction. We empirically show\nthat our proposed techniques stabilize the training and allow us to train wider\nand deeper vision transformers. We further show the diversified features\nsignificantly benefit the downstream tasks in transfer learning.

This procedure is\nparticularly challenging due to limited field of view, poor manoeuvrability of\nthe fetoscope, poor visibility due to fluid turbidity, variability in light\nsource, and unusual position of the placenta. This may lead to increased\nprocedural time and incomplete ablation, resulting in persistent TTTS.\nComputer-assisted intervention may help overcome these challenges by expanding\nthe fetoscopic field of view through video mosaicking and providing better\nvisualization of the vessel network. However, the research and development in\nthis domain remain limited due to unavailability of high-quality data to encode\nthe intra- and inter-procedure variability. Through the Fetoscopic Placental\nVessel Segmentation and Registration (FetReg) challenge, we present a\nlarge-scale multi-centre dataset for the development of generalized and robust\nsemantic segmentation and video mosaicking algorithms for the fetal environment\nwith a focus on creating drift-free mosaics from long duration fetoscopy\nvideos.

          "description": "Spine-related diseases have high morbidity and cause a huge burden of social\ncost. Spine imaging is an essential tool for noninvasively visualizing and\nassessing spinal pathology. Segmenting vertebrae in computed tomography (CT)\nimages is the basis of quantitative medical image analysis for clinical\ndiagnosis and surgery planning of spine diseases. Current publicly available\nannotated datasets on spinal vertebrae are small in size. Due to the lack of a\nlarge-scale annotated spine image dataset, the mainstream deep learning-based\nsegmentation methods, which are data-driven, are heavily restricted. In this\npaper, we introduce a large-scale spine CT dataset, called CTSpine1K, curated\nfrom multiple sources for vertebra segmentation, which contains 1,005 CT\nvolumes with over 11,100 labeled vertebrae belonging to different spinal\nconditions. Based on this dataset, we conduct several spinal vertebrae\nsegmentation experiments to set the first benchmark. We believe that this\nlarge-scale dataset will facilitate further research in many spine-related\nimage analysis tasks, including but not limited to vertebrae segmentation,\nlabeling, 3D spine reconstruction from biplanar radiographs, image\nsuper-resolution, and enhancement.",

          "description": "Recently, lane detection has made great progress with the rapid development\nof deep neural networks and autonomous driving. However, there exist three\nmainly problems including characterizing lanes, modeling the structural\nrelationship between scenes and lanes, and supporting more attributes (e.g.,\ninstance and type) of lanes. In this paper, we propose a novel structure guided\nframework to solve these problems simultaneously. In the framework, we first\nintroduce a new lane representation to characterize each instance. Then a\ntopdown vanishing point guided anchoring mechanism is proposed to produce\nintensive anchors, which efficiently capture various lanes. Next, multi-level\nstructural constraints are used to improve the perception of lanes. In the\nprocess, pixel-level perception with binary segmentation is introduced to\npromote features around anchors and restore lane details from bottom up, a\nlane-level relation is put forward to model structures (i.e., parallel) around\nlanes, and an image-level attention is used to adaptively attend different\nregions of the image from the perspective of scenes. With the help of\nstructural guidance, anchors are effectively classified and regressed to obtain\nprecise locations and shapes. Extensive experiments on public benchmark\ndatasets show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nwith 117 FPS on a single GPU.",

          "description": "Convolutional architectures have proven extremely successful for vision\ntasks. Their hard inductive biases enable sample-efficient learning, but come\nat the cost of a potentially lower performance ceiling. Vision Transformers\n(ViTs) rely on more flexible self-attention layers, and have recently\noutperformed CNNs for image classification. However, they require costly\npre-training on large external datasets or distillation from pre-trained\nconvolutional networks. In this paper, we ask the following question: is it\npossible to combine the strengths of these two architectures while avoiding\ntheir respective limitations? To this end, we introduce gated positional\nself-attention (GPSA), a form of positional self-attention which can be\nequipped with a ``soft\" convolutional inductive bias. We initialise the GPSA\nlayers to mimic the locality of convolutional layers, then give each attention\nhead the freedom to escape locality by adjusting a gating parameter regulating\nthe attention paid to position versus content information. The resulting\nconvolutional-like ViT architecture, ConViT, outperforms the DeiT on ImageNet,\nwhile offering a much improved sample efficiency. We further investigate the\nrole of locality in learning by first quantifying how it is encouraged in\nvanilla self-attention layers, then analysing how it is escaped in GPSA layers.\nWe conclude by presenting various ablations to better understand the success of\nthe ConViT.

In this paper, we define a new problem, Network Space Search\n(NSS), as searching for favorable network spaces instead of a single\narchitecture. We propose an NSS method to directly search for efficient-aware\nnetwork spaces automatically, reducing the manual effort and immense cost in\ndiscovering satisfactory ones. The resultant network spaces, named Elite\nSpaces, are discovered from Expanded Search Space with minimal human expertise\nimposed. The Pareto-efficient Elite Spaces are aligned with the Pareto front\nunder various complexity constraints and can be further served as NAS search\nspaces, benefiting differentiable NAS approaches (e.g. In CIFAR-100, an\naveragely 2.3% lower error rate and 3.7% closer to target constraint than the\nbaseline with around 90% fewer samples required to find satisfactory networks).\nMoreover, our NSS approach is capable of searching for superior spaces in\nfuture unexplored spaces, revealing great potential in searching for network\nspaces automatically.",

          "description": "Accurate characterisation of visual attributes such as spiculation,\nlobulation, and calcification of lung nodules is critical in cancer management.\nThe characterisation of these attributes is often subjective, which may lead to\nhigh inter- and intra-observer variability. Furthermore, lung nodules are often\nheterogeneous in the cross-sectional image slices of a 3D volume. Current\nstate-of-the-art methods that score multiple attributes rely on deep\nlearning-based multi-task learning (MTL) schemes. These methods, however,\nextract shared visual features across attributes and then examine each\nattribute without explicitly leveraging their inherent intercorrelations.\nFurthermore, current methods either treat each slice with equal importance\nwithout considering their relevance or heterogeneity, which limits performance.\nIn this study, we address these challenges with a new convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN)-based MTL model that incorporates multiple attention-based\nlearning modules to simultaneously score 9 visual attributes of lung nodules in\ncomputed tomography (CT) image volumes. Our model processes entire nodule\nvolumes of arbitrary depth and uses a slice attention module to filter out\nirrelevant slices. We also introduce cross-attribute and attribute\nspecialisation attention modules that learn an optimal amalgamation of\nmeaningful representations to leverage relationships between attributes. We\ndemonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods at\nscoring attributes using the well-known public LIDC-IDRI dataset of pulmonary\nnodules from over 1,000 patients.

          "description": "We address the detection of material defects, which are inside a layered\nmaterial structure using compressive sensing based multiple-output (MIMO)\nwireless radar. Here, the strong clutter due to the reflection of the layered\nstructure's surface often makes the detection of the defects challenging. Thus,\nsophisticated signal separation methods are required for improved defect\ndetection. In many scenarios, the number of defects that we are interested in\nis limited and the signaling response of the layered structure can be modeled\nas a low-rank structure. Therefore, we propose joint rank and sparsity\nminimization for defect detection. In particular, we propose a non-convex\napproach based on the iteratively reweighted nuclear and $\\ell_1-$norm (a\ndouble-reweighted approach) to obtain a higher accuracy compared to the\nconventional nuclear norm and $\\ell_1-$norm minimization. To this end, an\niterative algorithm is designed to estimate the low-rank and sparse\ncontributions. Further, we propose deep learning to learn the parameters of the\nalgorithm (i.e., algorithm unfolding) to improve the accuracy and the speed of\nconvergence of the algorithm. Our numerical results show that the proposed\napproach outperforms the conventional approaches in terms of mean square errors\nof the recovered low-rank and sparse components and the speed of convergence.",

          "description": "Large-scale datasets are the cornerstone of representation learning. Existing\nself-supervised approaches extract learning signals by making certain\nassumptions about the data, e.g., spatio-temporal continuity and multimodal\ncorrespondence. However, finding large amounts of data that satisfy such\nassumptions is not straightforward, and this restricts the community to rely on\ndatasets collected through laborious annotation and/or manual filtering\nprocesses. In this paper, we propose a subset optimization approach for\nautomatic dataset curation. Focusing on audio-visual representation learning,\nwe find a subset that provides the maximum mutual information between audio and\nvisual channels in videos. We show that self-supervised models trained on our\ndata, despite being automatically constructed, achieve competitive downstream\nperformances compared to existing datasets that require annotation and/or\nmanual filtering. The most significant benefit of our approach is scalability.\nWe release a dataset of 100M videos with high audio-visual correspondence.",

Furthermore, we\nprove that under a mild assumption, adversarially robust classifiers can be\nachieved, and can have an arbitrarily large Lipschitz constant.

          "description": "Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods are proposed for\nhyperspectral images (HSIs) denoising. Among them, unsupervised methods such as\nthe deep image prior (DIP) have received much attention because these methods\ndo not require any training data. However, DIP suffers from the\nsemi-convergence behavior, i.e., the iteration of DIP needs to terminate by\nreferring to the ground-truth image at the optimal iteration point. In this\npaper, we propose the spatial-spectral constrained deep image prior (S2DIP) for\nHSI mixed noise removal. Specifically, we incorporate DIP with a\nspatial-spectral total variation (SSTV) term to fully preserve the\nspatial-spectral local smoothness of the HSI and an $\\ell_1$-norm term to\ncapture the complex sparse noise. The proposed S2DIP jointly leverages the\nexpressive power brought from the deep CNN without any training data and\nexploits the HSI and noise structures via hand-crafted priors. Thus, our method\navoids the semi-convergence behavior, showing higher stabilities than DIP.\nMeanwhile, our method largely enhances the HSI denoising ability of DIP. To\ntackle the proposed denoising model, we develop an alternating direction\nmultiplier method algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed S2DIP outperforms optimization-based and supervised CNN-based\nstate-of-the-art HSI denoising methods.",

Our key insight is that by seeking approximate\ncorrespondence between elements of different sets, we learn strong\nrepresentations that exclude the inactive factors of variation and isolate the\nactive factors which vary within all sets.

          "description": "This paper provides a comprehensive and exhaustive study of adversarial\nattacks on human pose estimation models and the evaluation of their robustness.\nBesides highlighting the important differences between well-studied\nclassification and human pose-estimation systems w.r.t. adversarial attacks, we\nalso provide deep insights into the design choices of pose-estimation systems\nto shape future work. We benchmark the robustness of several 2D single person\npose-estimation architectures trained on multiple datasets, MPII and COCO. In\ndoing so, we also explore the problem of attacking non-classification networks\nincluding regression based networks, which has been virtually unexplored in the\npast.\n\n\\par We find that compared to classification and semantic segmentation, human\npose estimation architectures are relatively robust to adversarial attacks with\nthe single-step attacks being surprisingly ineffective. Our study shows that\nthe heatmap-based pose-estimation models are notably robust than their direct\nregression-based systems and that the systems which explicitly model\nanthropomorphic semantics of human body fare better than their other\ncounterparts. Besides, targeted attacks are more difficult to obtain than\nun-targeted ones and some body-joints are easier to fool than the others. We\npresent visualizations of universal perturbations to facilitate unprecedented\ninsights into their workings on pose-estimation. Additionally, we show them to\ngeneralize well across different networks. Finally we perform a user study\nabout perceptibility of these examples.",

          "description": "When in a new situation or geographical location, human drivers have an\nextraordinary ability to watch others and learn maneuvers that they themselves\nmay have never performed. In contrast, existing techniques for learning to\ndrive preclude such a possibility as they assume direct access to an\ninstrumented ego-vehicle with fully known observations and expert driver\nactions. However, such measurements cannot be directly accessed for the non-ego\nvehicles when learning by watching others. Therefore, in an application where\ndata is regarded as a highly valuable asset, current approaches completely\ndiscard the vast portion of the training data that can be potentially obtained\nthrough indirect observation of surrounding vehicles. Motivated by this key\ninsight, we propose the Learning by Watching (LbW) framework which enables\nlearning a driving policy without requiring full knowledge of neither the state\nnor expert actions. To increase its data, i.e., with new perspectives and\nmaneuvers, LbW makes use of the demonstrations of other vehicles in a given\nscene by (1) transforming the ego-vehicle's observations to their points of\nview, and (2) inferring their expert actions. Our LbW agent learns more robust\ndriving policies while enabling data-efficient learning, including quick\nadaptation of the policy to rare and novel scenarios. In particular, LbW drives\nrobustly even with a fraction of available driving data required by existing\nmethods, achieving an average success rate of 92% on the original CARLA\nbenchmark with only 30 minutes of total driving data and 82% with only 10\nminutes.",

          "description": "Text recognition is a popular research subject with many associated\nchallenges. Despite the considerable progress made in recent years, the text\nrecognition task itself is still constrained to solve the problem of reading\ncropped line text images and serves as a subtask of optical character\nrecognition (OCR) systems. As a result, the final text recognition result is\nlimited by the performance of the text detector. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple, elegant and effective paradigm called Implicit Feature Alignment (IFA),\nwhich can be easily integrated into current text recognizers, resulting in a\nnovel inference mechanism called IFAinference. This enables an ordinary text\nrecognizer to process multi-line text such that text detection can be\ncompletely freed. Specifically, we integrate IFA into the two most prevailing\ntext recognition streams (attention-based and CTC-based) and propose\nattention-guided dense prediction (ADP) and Extended CTC (ExCTC). Furthermore,\nthe Wasserstein-based Hollow Aggregation Cross-Entropy (WH-ACE) is proposed to\nsuppress negative predictions to assist in training ADP and ExCTC. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that IFA achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nend-to-end document recognition tasks while maintaining the fastest speed, and\nADP and ExCTC complement each other on the perspective of different application\nscenarios.

Very recent attempts\nin this area have demonstrated promising results in terms of recognition\naccuracy, yet they have been also shown to induce, in many cases, significant\ncomputational overheads due to the additional modelling of the temporal\ninformation. In this work, we propose a Video Transformer model the complexity\nof which scales linearly with the number of frames in the video sequence and\nhence induces \\textit{no overhead} compared to an image-based Transformer\nmodel. To achieve this, our model makes two approximations to the full\nspace-time attention used in Video Transformers: (a) It restricts time\nattention to a local temporal window and capitalizes on the Transformer's depth\nto obtain full temporal coverage of the video sequence. (b) It uses efficient\nspace-time mixing to attend \\textit{jointly} spatial and temporal locations\nwithout inducing any additional cost on top of a spatial-only attention model.\nWe also show how to integrate 2 very lightweight mechanisms for global\ntemporal-only attention which provide additional accuracy improvements at\nminimal computational cost. We demonstrate that our model produces very high\nrecognition accuracy on the most popular video recognition datasets while at\nthe same time being significantly more efficient than other Video Transformer\nmodels.

          "description": "Since Transformer has found widespread use in NLP, the potential of\nTransformer in CV has been realized and has inspired many new approaches.\nHowever, the computation required for replacing word tokens with image patches\nfor Transformer after the tokenization of the image is vast(e.g., ViT), which\nbottlenecks model training and inference. In this paper, we propose a new\nattention mechanism in Transformer termed Cross Attention, which alternates\nattention inner the image patch instead of the whole image to capture local\ninformation and apply attention between image patches which are divided from\nsingle-channel feature maps capture global information. Both operations have\nless computation than standard self-attention in Transformer. By alternately\napplying attention inner patch and between patches, we implement cross\nattention to maintain the performance with lower computational cost and build a\nhierarchical network called Cross Attention Transformer(CAT) for other vision\ntasks. Our base model achieves state-of-the-arts on ImageNet-1K, and improves\nthe performance of other methods on COCO and ADE20K, illustrating that our\nnetwork has the potential to serve as general backbones.

          "description": "Inspired by BatchNorm, there has been an explosion of normalization layers in\ndeep learning. Recent works have identified a multitude of beneficial\nproperties in BatchNorm to explain its success. However, given the pursuit of\nalternative normalization techniques, these properties need to be generalized\nso that any given layer's success/failure can be accurately predicted. In this\nwork, we take a first step towards this goal by extending known properties of\nBatchNorm in randomly initialized deep neural networks (DNNs) to nine recently\nproposed normalization layers. Our primary findings follow: (i) Similar to\nBatchNorm, activations-based normalization layers can avoid exploding\nactivations in ResNets; (ii) Use of GroupNorm ensures rank of activations is at\nleast $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{width}}{\\text{Group Size}}})$, thus explaining\nwhy LayerNorm witnesses slow optimization speed; (iii) Small group sizes result\nin large gradient norm in earlier layers, hence justifying training instability\nissues in Instance Normalization and illustrating a speed-stability tradeoff in\nGroupNorm. Overall, our analysis reveals several general mechanisms that\nexplain the success of normalization techniques in deep learning, providing us\nwith a compass to systematically explore the vast design space of DNN\nnormalization layers.",

          "description": "Recently, a surge of advanced facial editing techniques have been proposed\nthat leverage the generative power of a pre-trained StyleGAN. To successfully\nedit an image this way, one must first project (or invert) the image into the\npre-trained generator's domain. As it turns out, however, StyleGAN's latent\nspace induces an inherent tradeoff between distortion and editability, i.e.\nbetween maintaining the original appearance and convincingly altering some of\nits attributes. Practically, this means it is still challenging to apply\nID-preserving facial latent-space editing to faces which are out of the\ngenerator's domain. In this paper, we present an approach to bridge this gap.\nOur technique slightly alters the generator, so that an out-of-domain image is\nfaithfully mapped into an in-domain latent code. The key idea is pivotal tuning\n- a brief training process that preserves the editing quality of an in-domain\nlatent region, while changing its portrayed identity and appearance. In Pivotal\nTuning Inversion (PTI), an initial inverted latent code serves as a pivot,\naround which the generator is fined-tuned. At the same time, a regularization\nterm keeps nearby identities intact, to locally contain the effect. This\nsurgical training process ends up altering appearance features that represent\nmostly identity, without affecting editing capabilities. We validate our\ntechnique through inversion and editing metrics, and show preferable scores to\nstate-of-the-art methods. We further qualitatively demonstrate our technique by\napplying advanced edits (such as pose, age, or expression) to numerous images\nof well-known and recognizable identities. Finally, we demonstrate resilience\nto harder cases, including heavy make-up, elaborate hairstyles and/or headwear,\nwhich otherwise could not have been successfully inverted and edited by\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Hotel recognition is an important task for human trafficking investigations\nsince victims are often photographed in hotel rooms. Identifying these hotels\nis vital to trafficking investigations since they can help track down current\nand future victims who might be taken to the same places. Hotel recognition is\na challenging fine grained visual classification task as there can be little\nsimilarity between different rooms within the same hotel, and high similarity\nbetween rooms from different hotels (especially if they are from the same\nchain). Hotel recognition to combat human trafficking poses additional\nchallenges as investigative images are often low quality, contain uncommon\ncamera angles and are highly occluded. Here, we present the 2021 Hotel-ID\ndataset to help raise awareness for this problem and generate novel approaches.\nThe dataset consists of hotel room images that have been crowd-sourced and\nuploaded through the TraffickCam mobile application. The quality of these\nimages is similar to investigative images and hence models trained on these\nimages have good chances of accurately narrowing down on the correct hotel.",

          "description": "International challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative\nassessment of image analysis algorithms given a specific task. Segmentation is\nso far the most widely investigated medical image processing task, but the\nvarious segmentation challenges have typically been organized in isolation,\nsuch that algorithm development was driven by the need to tackle a single\nspecific clinical problem. We hypothesized that a method capable of performing\nwell on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and\npotentially outperform a custom-designed solution. To investigate the\nhypothesis, we organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) - a\nbiomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude\nof both tasks and modalities. The underlying data set was designed to explore\nthe axis of difficulties typically encountered when dealing with medical\nimages, such as small data sets, unbalanced labels, multi-site data and small\nobjects. The MSD challenge confirmed that algorithms with a consistent good\nperformance on a set of tasks preserved their good average performance on a\ndifferent set of previously unseen tasks. Moreover, by monitoring the MSD\nwinner for two years, we found that this algorithm continued generalizing well\nto a wide range of other clinical problems, further confirming our hypothesis.\nThree main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image\nsegmentation algorithms are mature, accurate, and generalize well when\nretrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across\nmultiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the\ntraining of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to non AI\nexperts.",

          "description": "Deep neural representations of 3D shapes as implicit functions have been\nshown to produce high fidelity models surpassing the resolution-memory\ntrade-off faced by the explicit representations using meshes and point clouds.\nHowever, most such approaches focus on representing closed shapes. Unsigned\ndistance function (UDF) based approaches have been proposed recently as a\npromising alternative to represent both open and closed shapes. However, since\nthe gradients of UDFs vanish on the surface, it is challenging to estimate\nlocal (differential) geometric properties like the normals and tangent planes\nwhich are needed for many downstream applications in vision and graphics. There\nare additional challenges in computing these properties efficiently with a\nlow-memory footprint. This paper presents a novel approach that models such\nsurfaces using a new class of implicit representations called the closest\nsurface-point (CSP) representation. We show that CSP allows us to represent\ncomplex surfaces of any topology (open or closed) with high fidelity. It also\nallows for accurate and efficient computation of local geometric properties. We\nfurther demonstrate that it leads to efficient implementation of downstream\nalgorithms like sphere-tracing for rendering the 3D surface as well as to\ncreate explicit mesh-based representations. Extensive experimental evaluation\non the ShapeNet dataset validate the above contributions with results\nsurpassing the state-of-the-art.",

          "description": "Executing computer vision models on streaming visual data, or streaming\nperception is an emerging problem, with applications in self-driving, embodied\nagents, and augmented/virtual reality. The development of such systems is\nlargely governed by the accuracy and latency of the processing pipeline. While\npast work has proposed numerous approximate execution frameworks, their\ndecision functions solely focus on optimizing latency, accuracy, or energy,\netc. This results in sub-optimum decisions, affecting the overall system\nperformance. We argue that the streaming perception systems should holistically\nmaximize the overall system performance (i.e., considering both accuracy and\nlatency simultaneously). To this end, we describe a new approach based on deep\nreinforcement learning to learn these tradeoffs at runtime for streaming\nperception. This tradeoff optimization is formulated as a novel deep contextual\nbandit problem and we design a new reward function that holistically integrates\nlatency and accuracy into a single metric. We show that our agent can learn a\ncompetitive policy across multiple decision dimensions, which outperforms\nstate-of-the-art policies on public datasets.",

          "description": "Adversarial algorithms have shown to be effective against neural networks for\na variety of tasks. Some adversarial algorithms perturb all the pixels in the\nimage minimally for the image classification task in image classification. In\ncontrast, some algorithms perturb few pixels strongly. However, very little\ninformation is available regarding why these adversarial samples so diverse\nfrom each other exist. Recently, Vargas et al. showed that the existence of\nthese adversarial samples might be due to conflicting saliency within the\nneural network. We test this hypothesis of conflicting saliency by analysing\nthe Saliency Maps (SM) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAM)\nof original and few different types of adversarial samples. We also analyse how\ndifferent adversarial samples distort the attention of the neural network\ncompared to original samples. We show that in the case of Pixel Attack,\nperturbed pixels either calls the network attention to themselves or divert the\nattention from them. Simultaneously, the Projected Gradient Descent Attack\nperturbs pixels so that intermediate layers inside the neural network lose\nattention for the correct class. We also show that both attacks affect the\nsaliency map and activation maps differently. Thus, shedding light on why some\ndefences successful against some attacks remain vulnerable against other\nattacks. We hope that this analysis will improve understanding of the existence\nand the effect of adversarial samples and enable the community to develop more\nrobust neural networks.",

          "description": "An essential factor to achieve high accuracies in fingerprint recognition\nsystems is the quality of its samples. Previous works mainly proposed\nsupervised solutions based on image properties that neglects the minutiae\nextraction process, despite that most fingerprint recognition techniques are\nbased on detected minutiae. Consequently, a fingerprint image might be assigned\na high quality even if the utilized minutia extractor produces unreliable\ninformation. In this work, we propose a novel concept of assessing minutia and\nfingerprint quality based on minutia detection confidence (MiDeCon). MiDeCon\ncan be applied to an arbitrary deep learning based minutia extractor and does\nnot require quality labels for learning. We propose using the detection\nreliability of the extracted minutia as its quality indicator. By combining the\nhighest minutia qualities, MiDeCon also accurately determines the quality of a\nfull fingerprint. Experiments are conducted on the publicly available databases\nof the FVC 2006 and compared against several baselines, such as NIST's\nwidely-used fingerprint image quality software NFIQ1 and NFIQ2. The results\ndemonstrate a significantly stronger quality assessment performance of the\nproposed MiDeCon-qualities as related works on both, minutia- and\nfingerprint-level.

          "description": "Underwater object detection for robot picking has attracted a lot of\ninterest. However, it is still an unsolved problem due to several challenges.\nWe take steps towards making it more realistic by addressing the following\nchallenges. Firstly, the currently available datasets basically lack the test\nset annotations, causing researchers must compare their method with other SOTAs\non a self-divided test set (from the training set). Training other methods lead\nto an increase in workload and different researchers divide different datasets,\nresulting there is no unified benchmark to compare the performance of different\nalgorithms. Secondly, these datasets also have other shortcomings, e.g., too\nmany similar images or incomplete labels. Towards these challenges we introduce\na dataset, Detecting Underwater Objects (DUO), and a corresponding benchmark,\nbased on the collection and re-annotation of all relevant datasets. DUO\ncontains a collection of diverse underwater images with more rational\nannotations. The corresponding benchmark provides indicators of both efficiency\nand accuracy of SOTAs (under the MMDtection framework) for academic research\nand industrial applications, where JETSON AGX XAVIER is used to assess detector\nspeed to simulate the robot-embedded environment.",

          "description": "We study the widely used hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC)\nalgorithm on edge-weighted graphs. We define an algorithmic framework for\nhierarchical agglomerative graph clustering that provides the first efficient\n$\\tilde{O}(m)$ time exact algorithms for classic linkage measures, such as\ncomplete- and WPGMA-linkage, as well as other measures. Furthermore, for\naverage-linkage, arguably the most popular variant of HAC, we provide an\nalgorithm that runs in $\\tilde{O}(n\\sqrt{m})$ time. For this variant, this is\nthe first exact algorithm that runs in subquadratic time, as long as\n$m=n^{2-\\epsilon}$ for some constant $\\epsilon > 0$. We complement this result\nwith a simple $\\epsilon$-close approximation algorithm for average-linkage in\nour framework that runs in $\\tilde{O}(m)$ time. As an application of our\nalgorithms, we consider clustering points in a metric space by first using\n$k$-NN to generate a graph from the point set, and then running our algorithms\non the resulting weighted graph. We validate the performance of our algorithms\non publicly available datasets, and show that our approach can speed up\nclustering of point datasets by a factor of 20.7--76.5x.",

          "description": "Transformer has been widely used for self-supervised pre-training in Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) and achieved great success. However, it has not been\nfully explored in visual self-supervised learning. Meanwhile, previous methods\nonly consider the high-level feature and learning representation from a global\nperspective, which may fail to transfer to the downstream dense prediction\ntasks focusing on local features. In this paper, we present a novel Masked\nSelf-supervised Transformer approach named MST, which can explicitly capture\nthe local context of an image while preserving the global semantic information.\nSpecifically, inspired by the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) in NLP, we propose\na masked token strategy based on the multi-head self-attention map, which\ndynamically masks some tokens of local patches without damaging the crucial\nstructure for self-supervised learning. More importantly, the masked tokens\ntogether with the remaining tokens are further recovered by a global image\ndecoder, which preserves the spatial information of the image and is more\nfriendly to the downstream dense prediction tasks. The experiments on multiple\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method.\nFor instance, MST achieves Top-1 accuracy of 76.9% with DeiT-S only using\n300-epoch pre-training by linear evaluation, which outperforms supervised\nmethods with the same epoch by 0.4% and its comparable variant DINO by 1.0\\%.\nFor dense prediction tasks, MST also achieves 42.7% mAP on MS COCO object\ndetection and 74.04% mIoU on Cityscapes segmentation only with 100-epoch\npre-training.",

It\nhas been recently shown that better reasoning patterns emerge in attention\nlayers of a state-of-the-art VQA model when they are trained on perfect\n(oracle) visual inputs. This provides evidence that deep neural networks can\nlearn to reason when training conditions are favorable enough. However,\ntransferring this learned knowledge to deployable models is a challenge, as\nmuch of it is lost during the transfer. We propose a method for knowledge\ntransfer based on a regularization term in our loss function, supervising the\nsequence of required reasoning operations. We provide a theoretical analysis\nbased on PAC-learning, showing that such program prediction can lead to\ndecreased sample complexity under mild hypotheses.

          "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed accepted norms globally. Within\nthe past year, masks have been used as a public health response to limit the\nspread of the virus. This sudden change has rendered many face recognition\nbased access control, authentication and surveillance systems ineffective.\nOfficial documents such as passports, driving license and national identity\ncards are enrolled with fully uncovered face images. However, in the current\nglobal situation, face matching systems should be able to match these reference\nimages with masked face images. As an example, in an airport or security\ncheckpoint it is safer to match the unmasked image of the identifying document\nto the masked person rather than asking them to remove the mask. We find that\ncurrent facial recognition techniques are not robust to this form of occlusion.\n\nTo address this unique requirement presented due to the current circumstance,\nwe propose a set of re-purposed datasets and a benchmark for researchers to\nuse. We also propose a contrastive visual representation learning based\npre-training workflow which is specialized to masked vs unmasked face matching.\nWe ensure that our method learns robust features to differentiate people across\nvarying data collection scenarios. We achieve this by training over many\ndifferent datasets and validating our result by testing on various holdout\ndatasets. The specialized weights trained by our method outperform standard\nface recognition features for masked to unmasked face matching. We believe the\nprovided synthetic mask generating code, our novel training approach and the\ntrained weights from the masked face models will help in adopting existing face\nrecognition systems to operate in the current global environment.

In this work, we explore new dimensions of\nunsupervised learning by proposing the Progressive Stage-wise Learning (PSL)\nframework. For a given unsupervised task, we design multilevel tasks and define\ndifferent learning stages for the deep network. Early learning stages are\nforced to focus on lowlevel tasks while late stages are guided to extract\ndeeper information through harder tasks.

An attractive solution\nis synthetic data generation. However, most such methods are overly\nsophisticated, focusing on high-quality, realistic data in the input space. It\nis unclear whether adapting them to the few-shot regime and using them for the\ndownstream task of classification is the right approach. Previous works on\nsynthetic data generation for few-shot classification focus on exploiting\ncomplex models, e.g. a Wasserstein GAN with multiple regularizers or a network\nthat transfers latent diversities from known to novel classes.\n\nWe follow a different approach and investigate how a simple and\nstraightforward synthetic data generation method can be used effectively. We\nmake two contributions, namely we show that: (1) using a simple loss function\nis more than enough for training a feature generator in the few-shot setting;\nand (2) learning to generate tensor features instead of vector features is\nsuperior.

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial noise. A range of\nadversarial defense techniques have been proposed to mitigate the interference\nof adversarial noise, among which the input pre-processing methods are scalable\nand show great potential to safeguard DNNs. However, pre-processing methods may\nsuffer from the robustness degradation effect, in which the defense reduces\nrather than improving the adversarial robustness of a target model in a\nwhite-box setting. A potential cause of this negative effect is that\nadversarial training examples are static and independent to the pre-processing\nmodel. To solve this problem, we investigate the influence of full adversarial\nexamples which are crafted against the full model, and find they indeed have a\npositive impact on the robustness of defenses. Furthermore, we find that simply\nchanging the adversarial training examples in pre-processing methods does not\ncompletely alleviate the robustness degradation effect. This is due to the\nadversarial risk of the pre-processed model being neglected, which is another\ncause of the robustness degradation effect. Motivated by above analyses, we\npropose a method called Joint Adversarial Training based Pre-processing (JATP)\ndefense. Specifically, we formulate a feature similarity based adversarial risk\nfor the pre-processing model by using full adversarial examples found in a\nfeature space. Unlike standard adversarial training, we only update the\npre-processing model, which prompts us to introduce a pixel-wise loss to\nimprove its cross-model transferability. We then conduct a joint adversarial\ntraining on the pre-processing model to minimize this overall risk. Empirical\nresults show that our method could effectively mitigate the robustness\ndegradation effect across different target models in comparison to previous\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

This happens when the weights of\na network are overwritten during the training of a new task causing forgetting\nof old information. To address this issue, we propose MetA Reusable Knowledge\nor MARK, a new method that fosters weight reusability instead of overwriting\nwhen learning a new task. Specifically, MARK keeps a set of shared weights\namong tasks. We envision these shared weights as a common Knowledge Base (KB)\nthat is not only used to learn new tasks, but also enriched with new knowledge\nas the model learns new tasks. Key components behind MARK are two-fold. On the\none hand, a metalearning approach provides the key mechanism to incrementally\nenrich the KB with new knowledge and to foster weight reusability among tasks.\nOn the other hand, a set of trainable masks provides the key mechanism to\nselectively choose from the KB relevant weights to solve each task.

Most\nexisting UDA methods learn domain-invariant feature representations by\nminimizing feature distances across domains.

Exploring the same set of\ncategories shared by both domains, we introduce a simple yet effective\nframework CDCL, for domain alignment. In particular, given an anchor image from\none domain, we minimize its distances to cross-domain samples from the same\nclass relative to those from different categories. Since target labels are\nunavailable, we use a clustering-based approach with carefully initialized\ncenters to produce pseudo labels. In addition, we demonstrate that CDCL is a\ngeneral framework and can be adapted to the data-free setting, where the source\ndata are unavailable during training, with minimal modification. We conduct\nexperiments on two widely used domain adaptation benchmarks, i.e., Office-31\nand VisDA-2017, and demonstrate that CDCL achieves state-of-the-art performance\non both datasets.",

          "description": "Recently, the combination of robust one-dimensional convolutional neural\nnetworks (1-D CNNs) and Raman spectroscopy has shown great promise in rapid\nidentification of unknown substances with good accuracy. Using this technique,\nresearchers can recognize a pure compound and distinguish it from unknown\nsubstances in a mixture. The novelty of this approach is that the trained\nneural network operates automatically without any pre- or post-processing of\ndata. Some studies have attempted to extend this technique to the\nclassification of pure compounds in an unknown mixture. However, the\napplication of 1-D CNNs has typically been restricted to binary classifications\nof pure compounds. Here we will highlight a new approach in spectral\nrecognition and quantification of chemical components in a multicomponent\nmixture. Two 1-D CNN models, RaMixNet I and II, have been developed for this\npurpose. The former is for rapid classification of components in a mixture\nwhile the latter is for quantitative determination of those constituents. In\nthe proposed method, there is no limit to the number of compounds in a mixture.\nA data augmentation method is also introduced by adding random baselines to the\nRaman spectra. The experimental results revealed that the classification\naccuracy of RaMixNet I and II is 100% for analysis of unknown test mixtures; at\nthe same time, the RaMixNet II model may achieve a regression accuracy of 88%\nfor the quantification of each component.",

We systematically design the proposed\nsystem by combining multiple reinforcement learning agents in a hierarchical\nmanner, where each agent focuses only on a specific task while preserving\ndependency between agents. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the episodic\ntask setting of reinforcement learning can efficiently manage a combination of\nmerge and split errors concurrently presented in the input. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of the proposed system by comparing it with state-of-the-art\nproofreading methods using various testing examples.",

A common practice is to perform data augmentation via\nhand-crafted transformations intended to leave the semantics of the data\ninvariant. We seek to understand the empirical success of this approach from a\ntheoretical perspective. We formulate the augmentation process as a latent\nvariable model by postulating a partition of the latent representation into a\ncontent component, which is assumed invariant to augmentation, and a style\ncomponent, which is allowed to change. Unlike prior work on disentanglement and\nindependent component analysis, we allow for both nontrivial statistical and\ncausal dependencies in the latent space. We study the identifiability of the\nlatent representation based on pairs of views of the observations and prove\nsufficient conditions that allow us to identify the invariant content partition\nup to an invertible mapping in both generative and discriminative settings. We\nfind numerical simulations with dependent latent variables are consistent with\nour theory.

          "description": "Understanding product attributes plays an important role in improving online\nshopping experience for customers and serves as an integral part for\nconstructing a product knowledge graph. Most existing methods focus on\nattribute extraction from text description or utilize visual information from\nproduct images such as shape and color. Compared to the inputs considered in\nprior works, a product image in fact contains more information, represented by\na rich mixture of words and visual clues with a layout carefully designed to\nimpress customers. This work proposes a more inclusive framework that fully\nutilizes these different modalities for attribute extraction. Inspired by\nrecent works in visual question answering, we use a transformer based sequence\nto sequence model to fuse representations of product text, Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) tokens and visual objects detected in the product image. The\nframework is further extended with the capability to extract attribute value\nacross multiple product categories with a single model, by training the decoder\nto predict both product category and attribute value and conditioning its\noutput on product category. The model provides a unified attribute extraction\nsolution desirable at an e-commerce platform that offers numerous product\ncategories with a diverse body of product attributes. We evaluated the model on\ntwo product attributes, one with many possible values and one with a small set\nof possible values, over 14 product categories and found the model could\nachieve 15% gain on the Recall and 10% gain on the F1 score compared to\nexisting methods using text-only features.",

However, when fed\nwith a flat input, current CNN models may fail to generate vivid results due to\nthe spatially shared convolution kernels. We call it the flatness degradation\nof CNNs. Unfortunately, such degradation is the greatest obstacles to generate\na spatially-variant output from a flat input, which has been barely discussed\nin the previous literature. To tackle this problem, we propose a model agnostic\nsolution, i.e. Noise Incentive Block (NIB), which serves as a generic plug-in\nfor any CNN generation model. The key idea is to break the flat input condition\nwhile keeping the intactness of the original information. Specifically, the NIB\nperturbs the input data symmetrically with a noise map and reassembles them in\nthe feature domain as driven by the objective function. Extensive experiments\nshow that existing CNN models equipped with NIB survive from the flatness\ndegradation and are able to generate visually better results with richer\ndetails in some specific image generation tasks given flat inputs, e.g.\nsemantic image synthesis, data-hidden image generation, and deep neural\ndithering.",

We show here how identifiability can be\nobtained in the absence of this side-information, rendering possible\nfully-unsupervised identifiable non-linear ICA. While previous theoretical\nresults have established the impossibility of identifiable non-linear ICA in\nthe presence of infinitely-flexible universal function approximators, here we\nrely on the intrinsically-finite modelling capacity of any particular chosen\nparameterisation of a deep generative model. In particular, we focus on\ngenerative models which perform clustering in their latent space -- a model\nstructure which matches previous identifiable models, but with the learnt\nclustering providing a synthetic form of auxiliary information. We evaluate our\nproposals using VAEs, on synthetic and image datasets, and find that the\nlearned clusterings function effectively: deep generative models with latent\nclusterings are empirically identifiable, to the same degree as models which\nrely on side information.",

          "description": "Gait recognition is a promising video-based biometric for identifying\nindividual walking patterns from a long distance. At present, most gait\nrecognition methods use silhouette images to represent a person in each frame.\nHowever, silhouette images can lose fine-grained spatial information, and most\npapers do not regard how to obtain these silhouettes in complex scenes.\nFurthermore, silhouette images contain not only gait features but also other\nvisual clues that can be recognized. Hence these approaches can not be\nconsidered as strict gait recognition.\n\nWe leverage recent advances in human pose estimation to estimate robust\nskeleton poses directly from RGB images to bring back model-based gait\nrecognition with a cleaner representation of gait. Thus, we propose GaitGraph\nthat combines skeleton poses with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to obtain a\nmodern model-based approach for gait recognition. The main advantages are a\ncleaner, more elegant extraction of the gait features and the ability to\nincorporate powerful spatio-temporal modeling using GCN. Experiments on the\npopular CASIA-B gait dataset show that our method archives state-of-the-art\nperformance in model-based gait recognition.\n\nThe code and models are publicly available.",

          "description": "Multispectral and multimodal image processing is important in the community\nof computer vision and computational photography. As the acquired multispectral\nand multimodal data are generally misaligned due to the alternation or movement\nof the image device, the image registration procedure is necessary. The\nregistration of multispectral or multimodal image is challenging due to the\nnon-linear intensity and gradient variation. To cope with this challenge, we\npropose the phase congruency network (PCNet), which is able to enhance the\nstructure similarity and alleviate the non-linear intensity and gradient\nvariation. The images can then be aligned using the similarity enhanced\nfeatures produced by the network. PCNet is constructed under the guidance of\nthe phase congruency prior. The network contains three trainable layers\naccompany with the modified learnable Gabor kernels according to the phase\ncongruency theory. Thanks to the prior knowledge, PCNet is extremely\nlight-weight and can be trained on quite a small amount of multispectral data.\nPCNet can be viewed to be fully convolutional and hence can take input of\narbitrary sizes. Once trained, PCNet is applicable on a variety of\nmultispectral and multimodal data such as RGB/NIR and flash/no-flash images\nwithout additional further tuning. Experimental results validate that PCNet\noutperforms current state-of-the-art registration algorithms, including the\ndeep-learning based ones that have the number of parameters hundreds times\ncompared to PCNet. Thanks to the similarity enhancement training, PCNet\noutperforms the original phase congruency algorithm with two-thirds less\nfeature channels.",

It is completely curable if diagnosed in an early stage, but the\ntedious and costly detection procedure makes it unviable to conduct\npopulation-wise screening. Thus, to augment the effort of the clinicians, in\nthis paper, we propose a fully automated framework that utilizes Deep Learning\nand feature selection using evolutionary optimization for cytology image\nclassification. The proposed framework extracts Deep feature from several\nConvolution Neural Network models and uses a two-step feature reduction\napproach to ensure reduction in computation cost and faster convergence. The\nfeatures extracted from the CNN models form a large feature space whose\ndimensionality is reduced using Principal Component Analysis while preserving\n99% of the variance. A non-redundant, optimal feature subset is selected from\nthis feature space using an evolutionary optimization algorithm, the Grey Wolf\nOptimizer, thus improving the classification performance. Finally, the selected\nfeature subset is used to train an SVM classifier for generating the final\npredictions. The proposed framework is evaluated on three publicly available\nbenchmark datasets: Mendeley Liquid Based Cytology (4-class) dataset, Herlev\nPap Smear (7-class) dataset, and the SIPaKMeD Pap Smear (5-class) dataset\nachieving classification accuracies of 99.47%, 98.32% and 97.87% respectively,\nthus justifying the reliability of the approach.

The core approach is to render individual rays by\nquerying a neural network at points sampled along the ray to obtain the density\nand colour of the sampled points, and integrating this information using the\nrendering equation. Since dense sampling is computationally prohibitive, a\ncommon solution is to perform coarse-to-fine sampling.\n\nIn this work we address a clear limitation of the vanilla coarse-to-fine\napproach -- that it is based on a heuristic and not trained end-to-end for the\ntask at hand.

Training the proposal module\nfrom scratch can be unstable due to lack of supervision, so an effective\npre-training strategy is also put forward. The approach, named `NeRF in detail'\n(NeRF-ID), achieves superior view synthesis quality over NeRF and the\nstate-of-the-art on the synthetic Blender benchmark and on par or better\nperformance on the real LLFF-NeRF scenes.

In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient two-stream\nframework to recognize multi-category objects from global image to local\nregions, similar to how human beings perceive objects. To bridge the gap\nbetween global and local streams, we propose a multi-class attentional region\nmodule which aims to make the number of attentional regions as small as\npossible and keep the diversity of these regions as high as possible. Our\nmethod can efficiently and effectively recognize multi-class objects with an\naffordable computation cost and a parameter-free region localization module.\nOver three benchmarks on multi-label image classification, we create new\nstate-of-the-art results with a single model only using image semantics without\nlabel dependency. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method is\nextensively demonstrated under different factors such as global pooling\nstrategy, input size and network architecture.

          "description": "Reasoning the human-object interactions (HOI) is essential for deeper scene\nunderstanding, while object affordances (or functionalities) are of great\nimportance for human to discover unseen HOIs with novel objects. Inspired by\nthis, we introduce an affordance transfer learning approach to jointly detect\nHOIs with novel objects and recognize affordances. Specifically, HOI\nrepresentations can be decoupled into a combination of affordance and object\nrepresentations, making it possible to compose novel interactions by combining\naffordance representations and novel object representations from additional\nimages, i.e. transferring the affordance to novel objects. With the proposed\naffordance transfer learning, the model is also capable of inferring the\naffordances of novel objects from known affordance representations. The\nproposed method can thus be used to 1) improve the performance of HOI\ndetection, especially for the HOIs with unseen objects; and 2) infer the\naffordances of novel objects. Experimental results on two datasets, HICO-DET\nand HOI-COCO (from V-COCO), demonstrate significant improvements over recent\nstate-of-the-art methods for HOI detection and object affordance detection.\nCode is available at https://github.com/zhihou7/HOI-CL",

          "description": "Recent progress in self-supervised learning has resulted in models that are\ncapable of extracting rich representations from image collections without\nrequiring any explicit label supervision. However, to date the vast majority of\nthese approaches have restricted themselves to training on standard benchmark\ndatasets such as ImageNet. We argue that fine-grained visual categorization\nproblems, such as plant and animal species classification, provide an\ninformative testbed for self-supervised learning. In order to facilitate\nprogress in this area we present two new natural world visual classification\ndatasets, iNat2021 and NeWT. The former consists of 2.7M images from 10k\ndifferent species uploaded by users of the citizen science application\niNaturalist. We designed the latter, NeWT, in collaboration with domain experts\nwith the aim of benchmarking the performance of representation learning\nalgorithms on a suite of challenging natural world binary classification tasks\nthat go beyond standard species classification. These two new datasets allow us\nto explore questions related to large-scale representation and transfer\nlearning in the context of fine-grained categories. We provide a comprehensive\nanalysis of feature extractors trained with and without supervision on ImageNet\nand iNat2021, shedding light on the strengths and weaknesses of different\nlearned features across a diverse set of tasks. We find that features produced\nby standard supervised methods still outperform those produced by\nself-supervised approaches such as SimCLR.

However, biological\nneurons have an internal state governed by complex dynamics that plays a\ncrucial role in learning, adaptation and the overall network activity and\nbehaviour. This paper presents the Membrane Potential and Activation Threshold\nHomeostasis (MPATH) neuron model, which combines several biologically inspired\nmechanisms to efficiently simulate internal neuron dynamics with a single\nparameter analogous to the membrane time constant in biological neurons. The\nmodel allows neurons to maintain a form of dynamic equilibrium by automatically\nregulating their activity when presented with fluctuating input. One\nconsequence of the MPATH model is that it imbues neurons with a sense of time\nwithout recurrent connections, paving the way for modelling processes that\ndepend on temporal aspects of neuron activity. Experiments demonstrate the\nmodel's ability to adapt to and continually learn from its input.",

It\nis a crucial problem from the perspective of the models' safety, especially for\nobject detection in the autonomous driving setting, which is considered in this\nwork. It was shown in the paper that the sensitivity of compressed models to\ndifferent distortion types is nuanced, and some of the corruptions are heavily\nimpacted by the compression methods (i.e., additive noise), while others (blur\neffect) are only slightly affected. A common way to improve the robustness of\nmodels is to use data augmentation, which was confirmed to positively affect\nmodels' robustness, also for highly compressed models. It was further shown\nthat while data imbalance methods brought only a slight increase in accuracy\nfor the baseline model (without compression), the impact was more striking at\nhigher compression rates for the structured pruning.

The attackers holding a specially\ncrafted patch can hide themselves from the state-of-the-art person detectors,\ne.g., YOLO, even in the physical world. This kind of attack can bring serious\nsecurity threats, such as escaping from surveillance cameras. In this paper, we\ndeeply explore the detection problems about the adversarial patch attacks to\nthe object detection. First, we identify a leverageable signature of existing\nadversarial patches from the point of the visualization explanation. A fast\nsignature-based defense method is proposed and demonstrated to be effective.\nSecond, we design an improved patch generation algorithm to reveal the risk\nthat the signature-based way may be bypassed by the techniques emerging in the\nfuture. The newly generated adversarial patches can successfully evade the\nproposed signature-based defense. Finally, we present a novel\nsignature-independent detection method based on the internal content semantics\nconsistency rather than any attack-specific prior knowledge. The fundamental\nintuition is that the adversarial object can appear locally but disappear\nglobally in an input image. The experiments demonstrate that the\nsignature-independent method can effectively detect the existing and improved\nattacks.

We challenge this\nhypothesis through an extensive empirical study for which we train 500 sampled\nCNN architectures on ImageNet as well as 8 other image classification datasets\nfrom a wide array of application domains. The relationship between architecture\nand performance varies wildly, depending on the datasets. For some of them, the\nperformance correlation with ImageNet is even negative. Clearly, it is not\nenough to optimize architectures solely for ImageNet when aiming for progress\nthat is relevant for all applications. Therefore, we identify two\ndataset-specific performance indicators: the cumulative width across layers as\nwell as the total depth of the network. Lastly, we show that the range of\ndataset variability covered by ImageNet can be significantly extended by adding\nImageNet subsets restricted to few classes.",

          "description": "Estimating 3D hand and object pose from a single image is an extremely\nchallenging problem: hands and objects are often self-occluded during\ninteractions, and the 3D annotations are scarce as even humans cannot directly\nlabel the ground-truths from a single image perfectly. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a unified framework for estimating the 3D hand and\nobject poses with semi-supervised learning. We build a joint learning framework\nwhere we perform explicit contextual reasoning between hand and object\nrepresentations by a Transformer. Going beyond limited 3D annotations in a\nsingle image, we leverage the spatial-temporal consistency in large-scale\nhand-object videos as a constraint for generating pseudo labels in\nsemi-supervised learning. Our method not only improves hand pose estimation in\nchallenging real-world dataset, but also substantially improve the object pose\nwhich has fewer ground-truths per instance.

          "description": "Generative models are now capable of producing highly realistic images that\nlook nearly indistinguishable from the data on which they are trained. This\nraises the question: if we have good enough generative models, do we still need\ndatasets? We investigate this question in the setting of learning\ngeneral-purpose visual representations from a black-box generative model rather\nthan directly from data. Given an off-the-shelf image generator without any\naccess to its training data, we train representations from the samples output\nby this generator. We compare several representation learning methods that can\nbe applied to this setting, using the latent space of the generator to generate\nmultiple \"views\" of the same semantic content. We show that for contrastive\nmethods, this multiview data can naturally be used to identify positive pairs\n(nearby in latent space) and negative pairs (far apart in latent space). We\nfind that the resulting representations rival those learned directly from real\ndata, but that good performance requires care in the sampling strategy applied\nand the training method. Generative models can be viewed as a compressed and\norganized copy of a dataset, and we envision a future where more and more\n\"model zoos\" proliferate while datasets become increasingly unwieldy, missing,\nor private. This paper suggests several techniques for dealing with visual\nrepresentation learning in such a future. Code is released on our project page:\nhttps://ali-design.github.io/GenRep/",

We analyze the connection between these information-theoretic\nquantities and classification performance on the test set by cumulatively\nablating neurons in networks trained on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10.

We provide explanations for\nthis phenomenon and conclude that it is ill-advised to compare the proposed\ninformation-theoretic quantities across layers. Furthermore, we show that\ncumulative ablation of neurons with ascending or descending\ninformation-theoretic quantities can be used to formulate hypotheses regarding\nthe joint behavior of multiple neurons, such as redundancy and synergy, with\ncomparably low computational cost.

          "description": "Transfer learning aims to exploit pre-trained models for more efficient\nfollow-up training on wide range of downstream tasks and datasets, enabling\nsuccessful training also on small data. Recent line of work posits strong\nbenefits for model generalization and transfer when model size, data size, and\ncompute budget are increased for the pre-training. It remains however still\nlargely unclear whether the observed transfer improvement due to increase in\nscale also holds when source and target data distributions are far apart from\neach other. In this work we conduct large-scale pre-training on large source\ndatasets of either natural (ImageNet-21k/1k) or medical chest X-Ray images and\ncompare full and few-shot transfer using different target datasets from both\nnatural and medical imaging domains. Our observations provide evidence that\nwhile pre-training and transfer on closely related datasets do show clear\nbenefit of increasing model and data size during pre-training, such benefits\nare not clearly visible when source and target datasets are further apart.\nThese observations hold across both full and few-shot transfer and indicate\nthat scaling laws pointing to improvement of generalization and transfer with\nincreasing model and data size are incomplete and should be revised by taking\ninto account the type and proximity of the source and target data, to correctly\npredict the effect of model and data scale during pre-training on transfer.\nRemarkably, in full shot transfer to a large X-Ray chest imaging target\n(PadChest), the largest model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k slightly outperforms\nbest models pre-trained on large X-Ray chest imaging data. This indicates\npossibility to obtain high quality models for domain-specific transfer even\nwithout access to large domain-specific data, by pre-training instead on\ncomparably very large, generic source data.",

          "description": "Hierarchy and compositionality are common latent properties in many natural\nand scientific datasets. Determining when a deep network's hidden activations\nrepresent hierarchy and compositionality is important both for understanding\ndeep representation learning and for applying deep networks in domains where\ninterpretability is crucial. However, current benchmark machine learning\ndatasets either have little hierarchical or compositional structure, or the\nstructure is not known. This gap impedes precise analysis of a network's\nrepresentations and thus hinders development of new methods that can learn such\nproperties. To address this gap, we developed a new benchmark dataset with\nknown hierarchical and compositional structure. The Hangul Fonts Dataset (HFD)\nis comprised of 35 fonts from the Korean writing system (Hangul), each with\n11,172 blocks (syllables) composed from the product of initial consonant,\nmedial vowel, and final consonant glyphs. All blocks can be grouped into a few\ngeometric types which induces a hierarchy across blocks. In addition, each\nblock is composed of individual glyphs with rotations, translations, scalings,\nand naturalistic style variation across fonts. We find that both shallow and\ndeep unsupervised methods only show modest evidence of hierarchy and\ncompositionality in their representations of the HFD compared to supervised\ndeep networks. Supervised deep network representations contain structure\nrelated to the geometrical hierarchy of the characters, but the compositional\nstructure of the data is not evident. Thus, HFD enables the identification of\nshortcomings in existing methods, a critical first step toward developing new\nmachine learning algorithms to extract hierarchical and compositional structure\nin the context of naturalistic variability.",

Unlike most\nexisting approaches, we establish correspondences directly between frames\nwithout re-encoding the mask features for every object, leading to a highly\nefficient and robust framework. With the correspondences, every node in the\ncurrent query frame is inferred by aggregating features from the past in an\nassociative fashion. We cast the aggregation process as a voting problem and\nfind that the existing inner-product affinity leads to poor use of memory with\na small (fixed) subset of memory nodes dominating the votes, regardless of the\nquery. In light of this phenomenon, we propose using the negative squared\nEuclidean distance instead to compute the affinities. We validated that every\nmemory node now has a chance to contribute, and experimentally showed that such\ndiversified voting is beneficial to both memory efficiency and inference\naccuracy.

For a vision\ntransformer with 26M learnable parameters serving as an example, with token\nlabeling, the model can achieve 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. The result\ncan be further increased to 86.4% by slightly scaling the model size up to\n150M, delivering the minimal-sized model among previous models (250M+) reaching\n86%.

          "description": "In the past few years, significant advancements were made in reconstruction\nof observed natural images from fMRI brain recordings using deep-learning\ntools. Here, for the first time, we show that dense 3D depth maps of observed\n2D natural images can also be recovered directly from fMRI brain recordings. We\nuse an off-the-shelf method to estimate the unknown depth maps of natural\nimages. This is applied to both: (i) the small number of images presented to\nsubjects in an fMRI scanner (images for which we have fMRI recordings -\nreferred to as \"paired\" data), and (ii) a very large number of natural images\nwith no fMRI recordings (\"unpaired data\"). The estimated depth maps are then\nused as an auxiliary reconstruction criterion to train for depth reconstruction\ndirectly from fMRI. We propose two main approaches: Depth-only recovery and\njoint image-depth RGBD recovery. Because the number of available \"paired\"\ntraining data (images with fMRI) is small, we enrich the training data via\nself-supervised cycle-consistent training on many \"unpaired\" data (natural\nimages & depth maps without fMRI). This is achieved using our newly defined and\ntrained Depth-based Perceptual Similarity metric as a reconstruction criterion.\nWe show that predicting the depth map directly from fMRI outperforms its\nindirect sequential recovery from the reconstructed images. We further show\nthat activations from early cortical visual areas dominate our depth\nreconstruction results, and propose means to characterize fMRI voxels by their\ndegree of depth-information tuning. This work adds an important layer of\ndecoded information, extending the current envelope of visual brain decoding\ncapabilities.",

Deep Learning (DL) algorithms provide an intelligent\nworkflow in which the system can learn from sequential training experiments.\nThis study applies a method using DL algorithms towards generating demanded\ndesign options. In this study, an object recognition problem is investigated to\ninitially predict the label of unseen sample images based on training dataset\nconsisting of different types of synthetic 2D shapes; later, a generative DL\nalgorithm is applied to be trained and generate new shapes for given labels. In\nthe next step, the algorithm is trained to generate a window/wall pattern for\ndesired light/shadow performance based on the spatial daylight autonomy (sDA)\nmetrics. The experiments show promising results both in predicting unseen\nsample shapes and generating new design options.",

          "description": "The output of text-to-image synthesis systems should be coherent, clear,\nphoto-realistic scenes with high semantic fidelity to their conditioned text\ndescriptions. Our Cross-Modal Contrastive Generative Adversarial Network\n(XMC-GAN) addresses this challenge by maximizing the mutual information between\nimage and text. It does this via multiple contrastive losses which capture\ninter-modality and intra-modality correspondences. XMC-GAN uses an attentional\nself-modulation generator, which enforces strong text-image correspondence, and\na contrastive discriminator, which acts as a critic as well as a feature\nencoder for contrastive learning. The quality of XMC-GAN's output is a major\nstep up from previous models, as we show on three challenging datasets. On\nMS-COCO, not only does XMC-GAN improve state-of-the-art FID from 24.70 to 9.33,\nbut--more importantly--people prefer XMC-GAN by 77.3 for image quality and 74.1\nfor image-text alignment, compared to three other recent models. XMC-GAN also\ngeneralizes to the challenging Localized Narratives dataset (which has longer,\nmore detailed descriptions), improving state-of-the-art FID from 48.70 to\n14.12.

          "description": "Instance segmentation can detect where the objects are in an image, but hard\nto understand the relationship between them. We pay attention to a typical\nrelationship, relative saliency. A closely related task, salient object\ndetection, predicts a binary map highlighting a visually salient region while\nhard to distinguish multiple objects. Directly combining two tasks by\npost-processing also leads to poor performance. There is a lack of research on\nrelative saliency at present, limiting the practical applications such as\ncontent-aware image cropping, video summary, and image labeling.\n\nIn this paper, we study the Salient Object Ranking (SOR) task, which manages\nto assign a ranking order of each detected object according to its visual\nsaliency. We propose the first end-to-end framework of the SOR task and solve\nit in a multi-task learning fashion. The framework handles instance\nsegmentation and salient object ranking simultaneously. In this framework, the\nSOR branch is independent and flexible to cooperate with different detection\nmethods, so that easy to use as a plugin. We also introduce a\nPosition-Preserved Attention (PPA) module tailored for the SOR branch. It\nconsists of the position embedding stage and feature interaction stage.\nConsidering the importance of position in saliency comparison, we preserve\nabsolute coordinates of objects in ROI pooling operation and then fuse\npositional information with semantic features in the first stage. In the\nfeature interaction stage, we apply the attention mechanism to obtain\nproposals' contextualized representations to predict their relative ranking\norders. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the ASR dataset. Without\nbells and whistles, our proposed method outperforms the former state-of-the-art\nmethod significantly.

Prior to our work,\nproducing rewards from self-supervised embeddings has typically required\nalignment with a reference trajectory, which may be difficult to acquire. We\nshow empirically that if the embeddings are aware of task-progress, simply\ntaking the negative distance between the current state and goal state in the\nlearned embedding space is useful as a reward for training policies with\nreinforcement learning. We find our learned reward function not only works for\nembodiments seen during training, but also generalizes to entirely new\nembodiments. We also find that XIRL policies are more sample efficient than\nbaselines, and in some cases exceed the sample efficiency of the same agent\ntrained with ground truth sparse rewards.",

          "description": "Wide-field and high-resolution (HR) imaging is essential for various\napplications such as aviation reconnaissance, topographic mapping and safety\nmonitoring. The existing techniques require a large-scale detector array to\ncapture HR images of the whole field, resulting in high complexity and heavy\ncost. In this work, we report an agile wide-field imaging framework with\nselective high resolution that requires only two detectors. It builds on the\nstatistical sparsity prior of natural scenes that the important targets locate\nonly at small regions of interests (ROI), instead of the whole field. Under\nthis assumption, we use a short-focal camera to image wide field with a certain\nlow resolution, and use a long-focal camera to acquire the HR images of ROI. To\nautomatically locate ROI in the wide field in real time, we propose an\nefficient deep-learning based multiscale registration method that is robust and\nblind to the large setting differences (focal, white balance, etc) between the\ntwo cameras. Using the registered location, the long-focal camera mounted on a\ngimbal enables real-time tracking of the ROI for continuous HR imaging. We\ndemonstrated the novel imaging framework by building a proof-of-concept setup\nwith only 1181 gram weight, and assembled it on an unmanned aerial vehicle for\nair-to-ground monitoring.

In this paper, we proposed a dual-modality\nmodularized methodology for the robust detection of abnormal vehicles. We\nintroduced an integrated anomaly detection framework comprising the following\nmodules: background modeling, vehicle tracking with detection, mask\nconstruction, Region of Interest (ROI) backtracking, and dual-modality tracing.\nConcretely, we employed background modeling to filter the motion information\nand left the static information for later vehicle detection. For the vehicle\ndetection and tracking module, we adopted YOLOv5 and multi-scale tracking to\nlocalize the anomalies. Besides, we utilized the frame difference and tracking\nresults to identify the road and obtain the mask. In addition, we introduced\nmultiple similarity estimation metrics to refine the anomaly period via\nbacktracking. Finally, we proposed a dual-modality bilateral tracing module to\nrefine the time further.

          "description": "Multi-organ segmentation of X-ray images is of fundamental importance for\ncomputer aided diagnosis systems. However, the most advanced semantic\nsegmentation methods rely on deep learning and require a huge amount of labeled\nimages, which are rarely available due to both the high cost of human resources\nand the time required for labeling. In this paper, we present a novel\nmulti-stage generation algorithm based on Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) that can produce synthetic images along with their semantic labels and\ncan be used for data augmentation. The main feature of the method is that,\nunlike other approaches, generation occurs in several stages, which simplifies\nthe procedure and allows it to be used on very small datasets. The method has\nbeen evaluated on the segmentation of chest radiographic images, showing\npromising results. The multistage approach achieves state-of-the-art and, when\nvery few images are used to train the GANs, outperforms the corresponding\nsingle-stage approach.",

Since\nthe core issue in semi-supervised setting lies in effective and efficient\nutilization of unlabeled data, we notice that increasing the diversity and\nhardness of unlabeled data is crucial to performance improvement. Being aware\nof this fact, we propose to adopt the most plain self-training scheme coupled\nwith appropriate strong data augmentations on unlabeled data (namely ST) for\nthis task, which surprisingly outperforms previous methods under various\nsettings without any bells and whistles. Moreover, to alleviate the negative\nimpact of the wrongly pseudo labeled images, we further propose an advanced\nself-training framework (namely ST++), that performs selective re-training via\nselecting and prioritizing the more reliable unlabeled images. As a result, the\nproposed ST++ boosts the performance of semi-supervised model significantly and\nsurpasses existing methods by a large margin on the Pascal VOC 2012 and\nCityscapes benchmark. Overall, we hope this straightforward and simple\nframework will serve as a strong baseline or competitor for future works. Code\nis available at https://github.com/LiheYoung/ST-PlusPlus.",

          "description": "The self-attention mechanism has attracted wide publicity for its most\nimportant advantage of modeling long dependency, and its variations in computer\nvision tasks, the non-local block tries to model the global dependency of the\ninput feature maps. Gathering global contextual information will inevitably\nneed a tremendous amount of memory and computing resources, which has been\nextensively studied in the past several years. However, there is a further\nproblem with the self-attention scheme: is all information gathered from the\nglobal scope helpful for the contextual modelling? To our knowledge, few\nstudies have focused on the problem. Aimed at both questions this paper\nproposes the salient positions-based attention scheme SPANet, which is inspired\nby some interesting observations on the attention maps and affinity matrices\ngenerated in self-attention scheme. We believe these observations are\nbeneficial for better understanding of the self-attention. SPANet uses the\nsalient positions selection algorithm to select only a limited amount of\nsalient points to attend in the attention map computing. This approach will not\nonly spare a lot of memory and computing resources, but also try to distill the\npositive information from the transformation of the input feature maps. In the\nimplementation, considering the feature maps with channel high dimensions,\nwhich are completely different from the general visual image, we take the\nsquared power of the feature maps along the channel dimension as the saliency\nmetric of the positions. In general, different from the non-local block method,\nSPANet models the contextual information using only the selected positions\ninstead of all, along the channel dimension instead of space dimension.

While prior work has focused on synthetic data, we attempt here\nto characterize the factors of variation in a real dataset, ImageNet, and study\nthe invariance of both standard residual networks and the recently proposed\nvision transformer with respect to changes in these factors. We show standard\naugmentation relies on a precise combination of translation and scale, with\ntranslation recapturing most of the performance improvement -- despite the\n(approximate) translation invariance built in to convolutional architectures,\nsuch as residual networks. In fact, we found that scale and translation\ninvariance was similar across residual networks and vision transformer models\ndespite their markedly different inductive biases. We show the training data\nitself is the main source of invariance, and that data augmentation only\nfurther increases the learned invariances. Interestingly, the invariances\nbrought from the training process align with the ImageNet factors of variation\nwe found. Finally, we find that the main factors of variation in ImageNet\nmostly relate to appearance and are specific to each class.",

          "description": "A central challenge in training classification models in the real-world\nfederated system is learning with non-IID data. To cope with this, most of the\nexisting works involve enforcing regularization in local optimization or\nimproving the model aggregation scheme at the server. Other works also share\npublic datasets or synthesized samples to supplement the training of\nunder-represented classes or introduce a certain level of personalization.\nThough effective, they lack a deep understanding of how the data heterogeneity\naffects each layer of a deep classification model. In this paper, we bridge\nthis gap by performing an experimental analysis of the representations learned\nby different layers. Our observations are surprising: (1) there exists a\ngreater bias in the classifier than other layers, and (2) the classification\nperformance can be significantly improved by post-calibrating the classifier\nafter federated training. Motivated by the above findings, we propose a novel\nand simple algorithm called Classifier Calibration with Virtual Representations\n(CCVR), which adjusts the classifier using virtual representations sampled from\nan approximated gaussian mixture model. Experimental results demonstrate that\nCCVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular federated learning\nbenchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10. We hope that our simple\nyet effective method can shed some light on the future research of federated\nlearning with non-IID data.",

          "description": "Tracking-by-detection is a very popular framework for single object tracking\nwhich attempts to search the target object within a local search window for\neach frame. Although such local search mechanism works well on simple videos,\nhowever, it makes the trackers sensitive to extremely challenging scenarios,\nsuch as heavy occlusion and fast motion. In this paper, we propose a novel and\ngeneral target-aware attention mechanism (termed TANet) and integrate it with\ntracking-by-detection framework to conduct joint local and global search for\nrobust tracking. Specifically, we extract the features of target object patch\nand continuous video frames, then we concatenate and feed them into a decoder\nnetwork to generate target-aware global attention maps. More importantly, we\nresort to adversarial training for better attention prediction. The appearance\nand motion discriminator networks are designed to ensure its consistency in\nspatial and temporal views. In the tracking procedure, we integrate the\ntarget-aware attention with multiple trackers by exploring candidate search\nregions for robust tracking. Extensive experiments on both short-term and\nlong-term tracking benchmark datasets all validated the effectiveness of our\nalgorithm.

State-of-the-art methods focus mostly\non sophisticated loss functions or mining strategies. On the one hand, metric\nlearning losses consider two or more examples at a time. On the other hand,\nmodern data augmentation methods for classification consider two or more\nexamples at a time. The combination of the two ideas is under-studied.\n\nIn this work, we aim to bridge this gap and improve representations using\nmixup, which is a powerful data augmentation approach interpolating two or more\nexamples and corresponding target labels at a time. This task is challenging\nbecause, unlike classification, the loss functions used in metric learning are\nnot additive over examples, so the idea of interpolating target labels is not\nstraightforward. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate\nmixing examples and target labels for deep metric learning.

          "description": "Face recognition has made significant progress in recent years due to deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN). In many face recognition (FR) scenarios,\nface images are acquired from a sequence with huge intra-variations. These\nintra-variations, which are mainly affected by the low-quality face images,\ncause instability of recognition performance. Previous works have focused on\nad-hoc methods to select frames from a video or use face image quality\nassessment (FIQA) methods, which consider only a particular or combination of\nseveral distortions.\n\nIn this work, we present an efficient non-reference image quality assessment\nfor FR that directly links image quality assessment (IQA) and FR. More\nspecifically, we propose a new measurement to evaluate image quality without\nany reference. Based on the proposed quality measurement, we propose a deep\nTiny Face Quality network (tinyFQnet) to learn a quality prediction function\nfrom data.\n\nWe evaluate the proposed method for different powerful FR models on two\nclassical video-based (or template-based) benchmark: IJB-B and YTF. Extensive\nexperiments show that, although the tinyFQnet is much smaller than the others,\nthe proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment methods in\nterms of effectiveness and efficiency.",

          "description": "The unpaired training can be the only option available for fast deep\nlearning-based ghost imaging, where obtaining a high signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) image copy of each low SNR ghost image could be practically\ntime-consuming and challenging. This paper explores the capabilities of deep\nlearning to leverage computational ghost imaging when there is a lack of paired\ntraining images. The deep learning approach proposed here enables fast ghost\nimaging through reconstruction of high SNR images from faint and hastily shot\nghost images using a constrained Wasserstein generative adversarial network. In\nthe proposed approach, the objective function is regularized to enforce the\ngeneration of faithful and relevant high SNR images to the ghost copies. This\nregularization measures the distance between reconstructed images and the faint\nghost images in a low-noise manifold generated by a shadow network. The\nperformance of the constrained network is shown to be particularly important\nfor ghost images with low SNR. The proposed pipeline is able to reconstruct\nhigh-quality images from the ghost images with SNR values not necessarily equal\nto the SNR of the training set.",

          "description": "While sophisticated Visual Question Answering models have achieved remarkable\nsuccess, they tend to answer questions only according to superficial\ncorrelations between question and answer. Several recent approaches have been\ndeveloped to address this language priors problem. However, most of them\npredict the correct answer according to one best output without checking the\nauthenticity of answers. Besides, they only explore the interaction between\nimage and question, ignoring the semantics of candidate answers. In this paper,\nwe propose a select-and-rerank (SAR) progressive framework based on Visual\nEntailment. Specifically, we first select the candidate answers relevant to the\nquestion or the image, then we rerank the candidate answers by a visual\nentailment task, which verifies whether the image semantically entails the\nsynthetic statement of the question and each candidate answer. Experimental\nresults show the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which establishes a\nnew state-of-the-art accuracy on VQA-CP v2 with a 7.55% improvement.",

          "description": "Monte Carlo (MC) dropout is a simple and efficient ensembling method that can\nimprove the accuracy and confidence calibration of high-capacity deep neural\nnetwork models. However, MC dropout is not as effective as more\ncompute-intensive methods such as deep ensembles. This performance gap can be\nattributed to the relatively poor quality of individual models in the MC\ndropout ensemble and their lack of diversity. These issues can in turn be\ntraced back to the coupled training and substantial parameter sharing of the\ndropout models. Motivated by this perspective, we propose a strategy to compute\nan ensemble of subnetworks, each corresponding to a non-overlapping dropout\nmask computed via a pruning strategy and trained independently. We show that\nthe proposed subnetwork ensembling method can perform as well as standard deep\nensembles in both accuracy and uncertainty estimates, yet with a computational\nefficiency similar to MC dropout. Lastly, using several computer vision\ndatasets like CIFAR10/100, CUB200, and Tiny-Imagenet, we experimentally\ndemonstrate that subnetwork ensembling also consistently outperforms recently\nproposed approaches that efficiently ensemble neural networks.",

Hence, we\npropose to reduce the cost of NAS using proxy data, i.e., a representative\nsubset of the target data, without sacrificing search performance. Even though\ndata selection has been used across various fields, our evaluation of existing\nselection methods for NAS algorithms offered by NAS-Bench-1shot1 reveals that\nthey are not always appropriate for NAS and a new selection method is\nnecessary. By analyzing proxy data constructed using various selection methods\nthrough data entropy, we propose a novel proxy data selection method tailored\nfor NAS. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness, we conduct thorough\nexperiments across diverse datasets, search spaces, and NAS algorithms.\nConsequently, NAS algorithms with the proposed selection discover architectures\nthat are competitive with those obtained using the entire dataset. It\nsignificantly reduces the search cost: executing DARTS with the proposed\nselection requires only 40 minutes on CIFAR-10 and 7.5 hours on ImageNet with a\nsingle GPU. Additionally, when the architecture searched on ImageNet using the\nproposed selection is inversely transferred to CIFAR-10, a state-of-the-art\ntest error of 2.4\\% is yielded.

However, one limitation of\nthe most of graph-based methods is that they assume the graph structure to\noperate is fixed and reliable. And there are inevitably some edges in the graph\nthat are not conducive to graph clustering, which we call spurious edges. This\npaper is the first attempt to employ graph pooling technique for node\nclustering and we propose a novel dual graph embedding network (DGEN), which is\ndesigned as a two-step graph encoder connected by a graph pooling layer to\nlearn the graph embedding. In our model, it is assumed that if a node and its\nnearest neighboring node are close to the same clustering center, this node is\nan informative node and this edge can be considered as a cluster-friendly edge.\nBased on this assumption, the neighbor cluster pooling (NCPool) is devised to\nselect the most informative subset of nodes and the corresponding edges based\non the distance of nodes and their nearest neighbors to the cluster centers.\nThis can effectively alleviate the impact of the spurious edges on the\nclustering. Finally, to obtain the clustering assignment of all nodes, a\nclassifier is trained using the clustering results of the selected nodes.\nExperiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed method over state-of-the-art algorithms.",

          "description": "The goal of image style transfer is to render an image with artistic features\nguided by a style reference while maintaining the original content. Due to the\nlocality and spatial invariance in CNNs, it is difficult to extract and\nmaintain the global information of input images. Therefore, traditional neural\nstyle transfer methods are usually biased and content leak can be observed by\nrunning several times of the style transfer process with the same reference\nstyle image. To address this critical issue, we take long-range dependencies of\ninput images into account for unbiased style transfer by proposing a\ntransformer-based approach, namely StyTr^2. In contrast with visual\ntransformers for other vision tasks, our StyTr^2 contains two different\ntransformer encoders to generate domain-specific sequences for content and\nstyle, respectively. Following the encoders, a multi-layer transformer decoder\nis adopted to stylize the content sequence according to the style sequence. In\naddition, we analyze the deficiency of existing positional encoding methods and\npropose the content-aware positional encoding (CAPE) which is scale-invariant\nand more suitable for image style transfer task. Qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed StyTr^2 compared to\nstate-of-the-art CNN-based and flow-based approaches.",

          "description": "Domain generalization (DG) methods aim to achieve generalizability to an\nunseen target domain by using only training data from the source domains.\nAlthough a variety of DG methods have been proposed, a recent study shows that\nunder a fair evaluation protocol, called DomainBed, the simple empirical risk\nminimization (ERM) approach works comparable to or even outperforms previous\nmethods. Unfortunately, simply solving ERM on a complex, non-convex loss\nfunction can easily lead to sub-optimal generalizability by seeking sharp\nminima. In this paper, we theoretically show that finding flat minima results\nin a smaller domain generalization gap. We also propose a simple yet effective\nmethod, named Stochastic Weight Averaging Densely (SWAD), to find flat minima.\nSWAD finds flatter minima and suffers less from overfitting than does the\nvanilla SWA by a dense and overfit-aware stochastic weight sampling strategy.\nSWAD shows state-of-the-art performances on five DG benchmarks, namely PACS,\nVLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet, with consistent and large\nmargins of +1.6% averagely on out-of-domain accuracy. We also compare SWAD with\nconventional generalization methods, such as data augmentation and consistency\nregularization methods, to verify that the remarkable performance improvements\nare originated from by seeking flat minima, not from better in-domain\ngeneralizability. Last but not least, SWAD is readily adaptable to existing DG\nmethods without modification; the combination of SWAD and an existing DG method\nfurther improves DG performances.",

Generally, most methods\ndirectly use neural networks and ignore certain constraints (e.g., reprojection\nconstraints and joint angle and bone length constraints). This paper proposes a\nweakly supervised GAN-based model for 3D human pose estimation that considers\n3D information along with 2D information simultaneously, in which a\nreprojection network is employed to learn the mapping of the distribution from\n3D poses to 2D poses. In particular, we train the reprojection network and the\ngenerative adversarial network synchronously. Furthermore, inspired by the\ntypical kinematic chain space (KCS) matrix, we propose a weighted KCS matrix,\nwhich is added into the discriminator's input to impose joint angle and bone\nlength constraints.

Very effective representations are obtained when\npowerful externally trained feature extractors (e.g. ResNets pre-trained on\nImageNet) are fine-tuned on the training data which consists of normal samples\nand no anomalies. However, this is a difficult task that can suffer from\ncatastrophic collapse, i.e. it is prone to learning trivial and non-specific\nfeatures. In this paper, we propose a new loss function which can overcome\nfailure modes of both center-loss and contrastive-loss methods.

          "description": "Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across\nvarious machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head\nself-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image\npatches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such\nflexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can\nfacilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain\nshifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We\nsystematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments\nencompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following\nintriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe\nocclusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.\n(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local\ntextures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to\nCNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate\nshape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,\npreviously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape\nrepresentation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic\nsegmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a\nsingle ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high\naccuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional\nand few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to\nflexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention\nmechanism.",

          "description": "Although great progress has been made on adversarial attacks for deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs), their transferability is still unsatisfactory, especially for\ntargeted attacks. There are two problems behind that have been long overlooked:\n1) the conventional setting of $T$ iterations with the step size of\n$\\epsilon/T$ to comply with the $\\epsilon$-constraint. In this case, most of\nthe pixels are allowed to add very small noise, much less than $\\epsilon$; and\n2) usually manipulating pixel-wise noise. However, features of a pixel\nextracted by DNNs are influenced by its surrounding regions, and different DNNs\ngenerally focus on different discriminative regions in recognition. To tackle\nthese issues, our previous work proposes a patch-wise iterative method (PIM)\naimed at crafting adversarial examples with high transferability. Specifically,\nwe introduce an amplification factor to the step size in each iteration, and\none pixel's overall gradient overflowing the $\\epsilon$-constraint is properly\nassigned to its surrounding regions by a project kernel. But targeted attacks\naim to push the adversarial examples into the territory of a specific class,\nand the amplification factor may lead to underfitting. Thus, we introduce the\ntemperature and propose a patch-wise++ iterative method (PIM++) to further\nimprove transferability without significantly sacrificing the performance of\nthe white-box attack. Our method can be generally integrated to any\ngradient-based attack methods.

          "description": "Batch Normalization (BN) is a popular technique for training Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs). BN uses scaling and shifting to normalize activations of\nmini-batches to accelerate convergence and improve generalization. The recently\nproposed Iterative Normalization (IterNorm) method improves these properties by\nwhitening the activations iteratively using Newton's method. However, since\nNewton's method initializes the whitening matrix independently at each training\nstep, no information is shared between consecutive steps. In this work, instead\nof exact computation of whitening matrix at each time step, we estimate it\ngradually during training in an online fashion, using our proposed Stochastic\nWhitening Batch Normalization (SWBN) algorithm. We show that while SWBN\nimproves the convergence rate and generalization of DNNs, its computational\noverhead is less than that of IterNorm. Due to the high efficiency of the\nproposed method, it can be easily employed in most DNN architectures with a\nlarge number of layers. We provide comprehensive experiments and comparisons\nbetween BN, IterNorm, and SWBN layers to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed technique in conventional (many-shot) image classification and\nfew-shot classification tasks.",

          "description": "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) raises keen attention to identifying sparse\ntrainable subnetworks, or winning tickets, of training, which can be trained in\nisolation to achieve similar or even better performance compared to the full\nmodels. Despite many efforts being made, the most effective method to identify\nsuch winning tickets is still Iterative Magnitude-based Pruning (IMP), which is\ncomputationally expensive and has to be run thoroughly for every different\nnetwork. A natural question that comes in is: can we \"transform\" the winning\nticket found in one network to another with a different architecture, yielding\na winning ticket for the latter at the beginning, without re-doing the\nexpensive IMP? Answering this question is not only practically relevant for\nefficient \"once-for-all\" winning ticket finding, but also theoretically\nappealing for uncovering inherently scalable sparse patterns in networks. We\nconduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and propose a variety\nof strategies to tweak the winning tickets found from different networks of the\nsame model family (e.g., ResNets). Based on these results, we articulate the\nElastic Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (E-LTH): by mindfully replicating (or\ndropping) and re-ordering layers for one network, its corresponding winning\nticket could be stretched (or squeezed) into a subnetwork for another deeper\n(or shallower) network from the same family, whose performance is nearly the\nsame competitive as the latter's winning ticket directly found by IMP. We have\nalso thoroughly compared E-LTH with pruning-at-initialization and dynamic\nsparse training methods, and discuss the generalizability of E-LTH to different\nmodel families, layer types, or across datasets.

          "description": "Despite their impressive performance in object recognition and other tasks\nunder standard testing conditions, deep networks often fail to generalize to\nout-of-distribution (o.o.d.) samples. One cause for this shortcoming is that\nmodern architectures tend to rely on \"shortcuts\" - superficial features that\ncorrelate with categories without capturing deeper invariants that hold across\ncontexts. Real-world concepts often possess a complex structure that can vary\nsuperficially across contexts, which can make the most intuitive and promising\nsolutions in one context not generalize to others. One potential way to improve\no.o.d. generalization is to assume simple solutions are unlikely to be valid\nacross contexts and avoid them, which we refer to as the too-good-to-be-true\nprior. A low-capacity network (LCN) with a shallow architecture should only be\nable to learn surface relationships, including shortcuts. We find that LCNs can\nserve as shortcut detectors. Furthermore, an LCN's predictions can be used in a\ntwo-stage approach to encourage a high-capacity network (HCN) to rely on deeper\ninvariant features that should generalize broadly. In particular, items that\nthe LCN can master are downweighted when training the HCN. Using a modified\nversion of the CIFAR-10 dataset in which we introduced shortcuts, we found that\nthe two-stage LCN-HCN approach reduced reliance on shortcuts and facilitated\no.o.d. generalization.",

          "description": "Noise and low quality of ECG signals acquired from Holter or wearable devices\ndeteriorate the accuracy and robustness of R-peak detection algorithms. This\npaper presents a generic and robust system for R-peak detection in Holter ECG\nsignals. While many proposed algorithms have successfully addressed the problem\nof ECG R-peak detection, there is still a notable gap in the performance of\nthese detectors on such low-quality ECG records. Therefore, in this study, a\nnovel implementation of the 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used\nintegrated with a verification model to reduce the number of false alarms. This\nCNN architecture consists of an encoder block and a corresponding decoder block\nfollowed by a sample-wise classification layer to construct the 1D segmentation\nmap of R- peaks from the input ECG signal. Once the proposed model has been\ntrained, it can solely be used to detect R-peaks possibly in a single channel\nECG data stream quickly and accurately, or alternatively, such a solution can\nbe conveniently employed for real-time monitoring on a lightweight portable\ndevice. The model is tested on two open-access ECG databases: The China\nPhysiological Signal Challenge (2020) database (CPSC-DB) with more than one\nmillion beats, and the commonly used MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MIT-DB).\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed systematic approach achieves\n99.30% F1-score, 99.69% recall, and 98.91% precision in CPSC-DB, which is the\nbest R-peak detection performance ever achieved. Compared to all competing\nmethods, the proposed approach can reduce the false-positives and\nfalse-negatives in Holter ECG signals by more than 54% and 82%, respectively.\nResults also demonstrate similar or better performance than most competing\nalgorithms on MIT-DB with 99.83% F1-score, 99.85% recall, and 99.82% precision.",

Previous bi-classifier adversarial learning methods only\nfocus on the similarity between the outputs of two distinct classifiers.\nHowever, the similarity of the outputs cannot guarantee the accuracy of target\nsamples, i.e., target samples may match to wrong categories even if the\ndiscrepancy between two classifiers is small. To challenge this issue, in this\npaper, we propose a cross-domain gradient discrepancy minimization (CGDM)\nmethod which explicitly minimizes the discrepancy of gradients generated by\nsource samples and target samples. Specifically, the gradient gives a cue for\nthe semantic information of target samples so it can be used as a good\nsupervision to improve the accuracy of target samples. In order to compute the\ngradient signal of target samples, we further obtain target pseudo labels\nthrough a clustering-based self-supervised learning.

          "description": "Collecting annotated data for semantic segmentation is time-consuming and\nhard to scale up. In this paper, we for the first time propose a unified\nframework, termed as Multi-Dataset Pretraining, to take full advantage of the\nfragmented annotations of different datasets. The highlight is that the\nannotations from different domains can be efficiently reused and consistently\nboost performance for each specific domain. This is achieved by first\npretraining the network via the proposed pixel-to-prototype contrastive loss\nover multiple datasets regardless of their taxonomy labels, and followed by\nfine-tuning the pretrained model over specific dataset as usual. In order to\nbetter model the relationship among images and classes from different datasets,\nwe extend the pixel level embeddings via cross dataset mixing and propose a\npixel-to-class sparse coding strategy that explicitly models the pixel-class\nsimilarity over the manifold embedding space. In this way, we are able to\nincrease intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, as well as\nconsidering inter-class similarity across different datasets for better\ntransferability. Experiments conducted on several benchmarks demonstrate its\nsuperior performance. Notably, MDP consistently outperforms the pretrained\nmodels over ImageNet by a considerable margin, while only using less than 10%\nsamples for pretraining.",

          "description": "Vision Transformer (ViT) attains state-of-the-art performance in visual\nrecognition, and the variant, Local Vision Transformer, makes further\nimprovements. The major component in Local Vision Transformer, local attention,\nperforms the attention separately over small local windows. We rephrase local\nattention as a channel-wise locally-connected layer and analyze it from two\nnetwork regularization manners, sparse connectivity and weight sharing, as well\nas weight computation. Sparse connectivity: there is no connection across\nchannels, and each position is connected to the positions within a small local\nwindow. Weight sharing: the connection weights for one position are shared\nacross channels or within each group of channels. Dynamic weight: the\nconnection weights are dynamically predicted according to each image instance.\nWe point out that local attention resembles depth-wise convolution and its\ndynamic version in sparse connectivity. The main difference lies in weight\nsharing - depth-wise convolution shares connection weights (kernel weights)\nacross spatial positions. We empirically observe that the models based on\ndepth-wise convolution and the dynamic variant with lower computation\ncomplexity perform on-par with or sometimes slightly better than Swin\nTransformer, an instance of Local Vision Transformer, for ImageNet\nclassification, COCO object detection and ADE semantic segmentation.

          "description": "Achieving super-human performance in recognizing human speech has been a goal\nfor several decades, as researchers have worked on increasingly challenging\ntasks. In the 1990's it was discovered, that conversational speech between two\nhumans turns out to be considerably more difficult than read speech as\nhesitations, disfluencies, false starts and sloppy articulation complicate\nacoustic processing and require robust handling of acoustic, lexical and\nlanguage context, jointly. Early attempts with statistical models could only\nreach error rates over 50% and far from human performance (WER of around 5.5%).\nNeural hybrid models and recent attention-based encoder-decoder models have\nconsiderably improved performance as such contexts can now be learned in an\nintegral fashion. However, processing such contexts requires an entire\nutterance presentation and thus introduces unwanted delays before a recognition\nresult can be output. In this paper, we address performance as well as latency.\nWe present results for a system that can achieve super-human performance (at a\nWER of 5.0%, over the Switchboard conversational benchmark) at a word based\nlatency of only 1 second behind a speaker's speech. The system uses multiple\nattention-based encoder-decoder networks integrated within a novel low latency\nincremental inference approach.",

Yet, recent work has found that they often assign a higher\nlikelihood to data from outside the training distribution. This seemingly\nparadoxical behavior has caused concerns over the quality of the attained\ndensity estimates. In the context of hierarchical variational autoencoders, we\nprovide evidence to explain this behavior by out-of-distribution data having\nin-distribution low-level features. We argue that this is both expected and\ndesirable behavior. With this insight in hand, we develop a fast, scalable and\nfully unsupervised likelihood-ratio score for OOD detection that requires data\nto be in-distribution across all feature-levels. We benchmark the method on a\nvast set of data and model combinations and achieve state-of-the-art results on\nout-of-distribution detection.",

          "description": "The nucleus of white blood cells (WBCs) plays a significant role in their\ndetection and classification. Appropriate feature extraction of the nucleus is\nnecessary to fit a suitable artificial intelligence model to classify WBCs.\nTherefore, designing a method is needed to segment the nucleus accurately.\nThere should be a comparison between the ground truths distinguished by a\nhematologist and the detected nuclei to evaluate the performance of the nucleus\nsegmentation method accurately. It is a time-consuming and tedious task for\nexperts to establish the ground truth manually. This paper presents an\nintelligent open-source software called Easy-GT to create the ground truth of\nWBCs' nucleus faster and easier. This software first detects the nucleus by\nemploying a new Otsu's thresholding-based method with a dice similarity\ncoefficient (DSC) of 95.42 %; the hematologist can then create a more accurate\nground truth, using the designed buttons to modify the threshold value.

          "description": "The latent space of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been shown to\nencode rich semantics within some subspaces. To identify these subspaces,\nresearchers typically analyze the statistical information from a collection of\nsynthesized data, and the identified subspaces tend to control image attributes\nglobally (i.e., manipulating an attribute causes the change of an entire\nimage). By contrast, this work introduces low-rank subspaces that enable more\nprecise control of GAN generation. Concretely, given an arbitrary image and a\nregion of interest (e.g., eyes of face images), we manage to relate the latent\nspace to the image region with the Jacobian matrix and then use low-rank\nfactorization to discover steerable latent subspaces. There are three\ndistinguishable strengths of our approach that can be aptly called LowRankGAN.\nFirst, compared to analytic algorithms in prior work, our low-rank\nfactorization of Jacobians is able to find the low-dimensional representation\nof attribute manifold, making image editing more precise and controllable.\nSecond, low-rank factorization naturally yields a null space of attributes such\nthat moving the latent code within it only affects the outer region of\ninterest. Therefore, local image editing can be simply achieved by projecting\nan attribute vector into the null space without relying on a spatial mask as\nexisting methods do. Third, our method can robustly work with a local region\nfrom one image for analysis yet well generalize to other images, making it much\neasy to use in practice. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art GAN models\n(including StyleGAN2 and BigGAN) trained on various datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our LowRankGAN.",

In this paper we\npropose a novel method where from first principles we combine a certifiable OOD\ndetector with a standard classifier into an OOD aware classifier.

          "description": "Machine learning models are commonly trained end-to-end and in a supervised\nsetting, using paired (input, output) data. Examples include recent\nsuper-resolution methods that train on pairs of (low-resolution,\nhigh-resolution) images. However, these end-to-end approaches require\nre-training every time there is a distribution shift in the inputs (e.g., night\nimages vs daylight) or relevant latent variables (e.g., camera blur or hand\nmotion). In this work, we leverage state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models\n(here StyleGAN2) for building powerful image priors, which enable application\nof Bayes' theorem for many downstream reconstruction tasks. Our method,\nBayesian Reconstruction through Generative Models (BRGM), uses a single\npre-trained generator model to solve different image restoration tasks, i.e.,\nsuper-resolution and in-painting, by combining it with different forward\ncorruption models. We keep the weights of the generator model fixed, and\nreconstruct the image by estimating the Bayesian maximum a-posteriori (MAP)\nestimate over the input latent vector that generated the reconstructed image.\nWe further use variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution\nover the latent vectors, from which we sample multiple solutions. We\ndemonstrate BRGM on three large and diverse datasets: (i) 60,000 images from\nthe Flick Faces High Quality dataset (ii) 240,000 chest X-rays from MIMIC III\nand (iii) a combined collection of 5 brain MRI datasets with 7,329 scans.\nAcross all three datasets and without any dataset-specific hyperparameter\ntuning, our simple approach yields performance competitive with current\ntask-specific state-of-the-art methods on super-resolution and in-painting,\nwhile being more generalisable and without requiring any training.

The present study attempted to explore the\nfull functionality of open Sentinel satellite data and ML models for detecting\nand classifying floating plastic debris in Mytilene (Greece), Limassol\n(Cyprus), Calabria (Italy), and Beirut (Lebanon). Two ML models, i.e. Support\nVector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) were utilized to carry out the\nclassification analysis. In-situ plastic location data was collected from the\ncontrol experiment conducted in Mytilene, Greece and Limassol, Cyprus, and the\nsame was considered for training the models. Both remote sensing bands and\nspectral indices were used for developing the ML models. A spectral signature\nprofile for plastic was created for discriminating the floating plastic from\nother marine debris. A newly developed index, kernel Normalized Difference\nVegetation Index (kNDVI), was incorporated into the modelling to examine its\ncontribution to model performances. Both SVM and RF were performed well in five\nmodels and test case combinations. Among the two ML models, the highest\nperformance was measured for the RF. The inclusion of kNDVI was found effective\nand increased the model performances, reflected by high balanced accuracy\nmeasured for model 2 (~80% to ~98 % for SVM and ~87% to ~97 % for RF). Using\nthe best-performed model, an automated floating plastic detection system was\ndeveloped and tested in Calabria and Beirut. For both sites, the trained model\nhad detected the floating plastic with ~99% accuracy. Among the six predictors,\nthe FDI was found the most important variable for detecting marine floating\nplastic. These findings collectively suggest that high-resolution remote\nsensing imagery and the automated ML models can be an effective alternative for\nthe cost-effective detection of marine floating plastic.",

Conventional\npost-training pruning often incurs higher training budgets. In contrast, this\npaper aims to trim down both the training memory overhead and the inference\ncomplexity, without scarifying the achievable accuracy. We launch and report\nthe first-of-its-kind comprehensive exploration, on taking a unified approach\nof integrating sparsity in ViTs \"from end to end\". Specifically, instead of\ntraining full ViTs, we dynamically extract and train sparse subnetworks, while\nsticking to a fixed small parameter budget. Our approach jointly optimizes\nmodel parameters and explores connectivity throughout training, ending up with\none sparse network as the final output. The approach is seamlessly extended\nfrom unstructured to structured sparsity, the latter by considering to guide\nthe prune-and-grow of self-attention heads inside ViTs. For additional\nefficiency gains, we further co-explore data and architecture sparsity, by\nplugging in a novel learnable token selector to adaptively determine the\ncurrently most vital patches. Extensive results validate the effectiveness of\nour proposals on ImageNet with diverse ViT backbones. For instance, at 40%\nstructured sparsity, our sparsified DeiT-Base can achieve 0.42% accuracy gain,\nat 33.13% and 24.70% running time} savings, compared to its dense counterpart.\nPerhaps most surprisingly, we find that the proposed sparse (co-)training can\neven improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it, making sparsity a\ntantalizing \"free lunch\".

          "description": "The common implementation of face recognition systems as a cascade of a\ndetection stage and a recognition or verification stage can cause problems\nbeyond failures of the detector. When the detector succeeds, it can detect\nfaces that cannot be recognized, no matter how capable the recognition system.\nRecognizability, a latent variable, should therefore be factored into the\ndesign and implementation of face recognition systems. We propose a measure of\nrecognizability of a face image that leverages a key empirical observation: an\nembedding of face images, implemented by a deep neural network trained using\nmostly recognizable identities, induces a partition of the hypersphere whereby\nunrecognizable identities cluster together. This occurs regardless of the\nphenomenon that causes a face to be unrecognizable, it be optical or motion\nblur, partial occlusion, spatial quantization, poor illumination. Therefore, we\nuse the distance from such an \"unrecognizable identity\" as a measure of\nrecognizability, and incorporate it in the design of the over-all system. We\nshow that accounting for recognizability reduces error rate of single-image\nface recognition by 58% at FAR=1e-5 on the IJB-C Covariate Verification\nbenchmark, and reduces verification error rate by 24% at FAR=1e-5 in set-based\nrecognition on the IJB-C benchmark.",

However, the previous\nbias identification pipeline overly relies on human experts to conjecture\npotential biases (e.g., gender), which may neglect other underlying biases not\nrealized by humans. To help human experts better find the AI algorithms'\nbiases, we study a new problem in this work -- for a classifier that predicts a\ntarget attribute of the input image, discover its unknown biased attribute.\n\nTo solve this challenging problem, we use a hyperplane in the generative\nmodel's latent space to represent an image attribute; thus, the original\nproblem is transformed to optimizing the hyperplane's normal vector and offset.\nWe propose a novel total-variation loss within this framework as the objective\nfunction and a new orthogonalization penalty as a constraint. The latter\nprevents trivial solutions in which the discovered biased attribute is\nidentical with the target or one of the known-biased attributes. Extensive\nexperiments on both disentanglement datasets and real-world datasets show that\nour method can discover biased attributes and achieve better disentanglement\nw.r.t. target attributes.

Our neural network\narchitecture consists of two main parts: a depth and feature fusion\nsub-network, which is followed by a translator sub-network to produce the final\nsurface representation (e.g. TSDF) for visualization or other tasks.

          "description": "Brain-inspired machine learning is gaining increasing consideration,\nparticularly in computer vision. Several studies investigated the inclusion of\ntop-down feedback connections in convolutional networks; however, it remains\nunclear how and when these connections are functionally helpful. Here we\naddress this question in the context of object recognition under noisy\nconditions. We consider deep convolutional networks (CNNs) as models of\nfeed-forward visual processing and implement Predictive Coding (PC) dynamics\nthrough feedback connections (predictive feedback) trained for reconstruction\nor classification of clean images. To directly assess the computational role of\npredictive feedback in various experimental situations, we optimize and\ninterpret the hyper-parameters controlling the network's recurrent dynamics.\nThat is, we let the optimization process determine whether top-down connections\nand predictive coding dynamics are functionally beneficial. Across different\nmodel depths and architectures (3-layer CNN, ResNet18, and EfficientNetB0) and\nagainst various types of noise (CIFAR100-C), we find that the network\nincreasingly relies on top-down predictions as the noise level increases; in\ndeeper networks, this effect is most prominent at lower layers. In addition,\nthe accuracy of the network implementing PC dynamics significantly increases\nover time-steps, compared to its equivalent forward network. All in all, our\nresults provide novel insights relevant to Neuroscience by confirming the\ncomputational role of feedback connections in sensory systems, and to Machine\nLearning by revealing how these can improve the robustness of current vision\nmodels.",

          "description": "Unsupervised pretraining has recently proven beneficial for computer vision\ntasks, including object detection. However, previous self-supervised approaches\nare not designed to handle a key aspect of detection: localizing objects. Here,\nwe present DETReg, an unsupervised pretraining approach for object DEtection\nwith TRansformers using Region priors. Motivated by the two tasks underlying\nobject detection: localization and categorization, we combine two complementary\nsignals for self-supervision. For an object localization signal, we use pseudo\nground truth object bounding boxes from an off-the-shelf unsupervised region\nproposal method, Selective Search, which does not require training data and can\ndetect objects at a high recall rate and very low precision. The categorization\nsignal comes from an object embedding loss that encourages invariant object\nrepresentations, from which the object category can be inferred. We show how to\ncombine these two signals to train the Deformable DETR detection architecture\nfrom large amounts of unlabeled data. DETReg improves the performance over\ncompetitive baselines and previous self-supervised methods on standard\nbenchmarks like MS COCO and PASCAL VOC. DETReg also outperforms previous\nsupervised and unsupervised baseline approaches on low-data regime when trained\nwith only 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% of the labeled data on MS COCO.

          "description": "Object-based attention is a key component of the visual system, relevant for\nperception, learning, and memory. Neurons tuned to features of attended objects\ntend to be more active than those associated with non-attended objects. There\nis a rich set of models of this phenomenon in computational neuroscience.\nHowever, there is currently a divide between models that successfully match\nphysiological data but can only deal with extremely simple problems and models\nof attention used in computer vision. For example, attention in the brain is\nknown to depend on top-down processing, whereas self-attention in deep learning\ndoes not. Here, we propose an artificial neural network model of object-based\nattention that captures the way in which attention is both top-down and\nrecurrent. Our attention model works well both on simple test stimuli, such as\nthose using images of handwritten digits, and on more complex stimuli, such as\nnatural images drawn from the COCO dataset. We find that our model replicates a\nrange of findings from neuroscience, including attention-invariant tuning,\ninhibition of return, and attention-mediated scaling of activity. Understanding\nobject based attention is both computationally interesting and a key problem\nfor computational neuroscience.",

          "description": "Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in the wild is an extremely challenging\ntask in computer vision due to variant backgrounds, low-quality facial images,\nand the subjectiveness of annotators. These uncertainties make it difficult for\nneural networks to learn robust features on limited-scale datasets. Moreover,\nthe networks can be easily distributed by the above factors and perform\nincorrect decisions. Recently, vision transformer (ViT) and data-efficient\nimage transformers (DeiT) present their significant performance in traditional\nclassification tasks. The self-attention mechanism makes transformers obtain a\nglobal receptive field in the first layer which dramatically enhances the\nfeature extraction capability. In this work, we first propose a novel pure\ntransformer-based mask vision transformer (MViT) for FER in the wild, which\nconsists of two modules: a transformer-based mask generation network (MGN) to\ngenerate a mask that can filter out complex backgrounds and occlusion of face\nimages, and a dynamic relabeling module to rectify incorrect labels in FER\ndatasets in the wild. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our MViT\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on RAF-DB with 88.62%, FERPlus with\n89.22%, and AffectNet-7 with 64.57%, respectively, and achieves a comparable\nresult on AffectNet-8 with 61.40%.",

          "description": "Fundamentally, super-resolution is ill-posed problem because a low-resolution\nimage can be obtained from many high-resolution images. Recent studies for\nsuper-resolution cannot create diverse super-resolution images. Although SRFlow\ntried to account for ill-posed nature of the super-resolution by predicting\nmultiple high-resolution images given a low-resolution image, there is room to\nimprove the diversity and visual quality. In this paper, we propose Noise\nConditional flow model for Super-Resolution, NCSR, which increases the visual\nquality and diversity of images through noise conditional layer. To learn more\ndiverse data distribution, we add noise to training data. However, low-quality\nimages are resulted from adding noise. We propose the noise conditional layer\nto overcome this phenomenon. The noise conditional layer makes our model\ngenerate more diverse images with higher visual quality than other works.\nFurthermore, we show that this layer can overcome data distribution mismatch, a\nproblem that arises in normalizing flow models. With these benefits, NCSR\noutperforms baseline in diversity and visual quality and achieves better visual\nquality than traditional GAN-based models.

In this paper, human's ability to predict lane\nchanges in highway scenarios is analyzed through the use of video sequences\nextracted from the PREVENTION dataset, a database focused on the development of\nresearch on vehicle intention and trajectory prediction. Thus, users had to\nindicate the moment at which they considered that a lane change maneuver was\ntaking place in a target vehicle, subsequently indicating its direction: left\nor right. The results retrieved have been carefully analyzed and compared to\nground truth labels, evaluating statistical models to understand whether humans\ncan actually predict. The study has revealed that most participants are unable\nto anticipate lane-change maneuvers, detecting them after they have started.\nThese results might serve as a baseline for AI's prediction ability evaluation,\ngrading if those systems can outperform human skills by analyzing hidden cues\nthat seem unnoticed, improving the detection time, and even anticipating\nmaneuvers in some cases.",

          "description": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have significantly advanced image\nsynthesis, however, the synthesis quality drops significantly given a limited\namount of training data. To improve the data efficiency of GAN training, prior\nwork typically employs data augmentation to mitigate the overfitting of the\ndiscriminator yet still learn the discriminator with a bi-classification (i.e.,\nreal vs. fake) task. In this work, we propose a data-efficient Instance\nGeneration (InsGen) method based on instance discrimination. Concretely,\nbesides differentiating the real domain from the fake domain, the discriminator\nis required to distinguish every individual image, no matter it comes from the\ntraining set or from the generator. In this way, the discriminator can benefit\nfrom the infinite synthesized samples for training, alleviating the overfitting\nproblem caused by insufficient training data. A noise perturbation strategy is\nfurther introduced to improve its discriminative power. Meanwhile, the learned\ninstance discrimination capability from the discriminator is in turn exploited\nto encourage the generator for diverse generation. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of datasets and\ntraining settings. Noticeably, on the setting of 2K training images from the\nFFHQ dataset, we outperform the state-of-the-art approach with 23.5% FID\nimprovement.",

To understand and better\nmeasure the generalization capabilities of VQA systems, we look at their\nrobustness to counterfactually augmented data. Our proposed augmentations are\ndesigned to make a focused intervention on a specific property of the question\nsuch that the answer changes. Using these augmentations, we propose a new\nrobustness measure, Robustness to Augmented Data (RAD), which measures the\nconsistency of model predictions between original and augmented examples.\nThrough extensive experimentation, we show that RAD, unlike classical accuracy\nmeasures, can quantify when state-of-the-art systems are not robust to\ncounterfactuals. We find substantial failure cases which reveal that current\nVQA systems are still brittle.

          "description": "The vicinal risk minimization (VRM) principle is an empirical risk\nminimization (ERM) variant that replaces Dirac masses with vicinal functions.\nThere is strong numerical and theoretical evidence showing that VRM outperforms\nERM in terms of generalization if appropriate vicinal functions are chosen.\nMixup Training (MT), a popular choice of vicinal distribution, improves the\ngeneralization performance of models by introducing globally linear behavior in\nbetween training examples. Apart from generalization, recent works have shown\nthat mixup trained models are relatively robust to input\nperturbations/corruptions and at the same time are calibrated better than their\nnon-mixup counterparts. In this work, we investigate the benefits of defining\nthese vicinal distributions like mixup in latent space of generative models\nrather than in input space itself. We propose a new approach - \\textit{VarMixup\n(Variational Mixup)} - to better sample mixup images by using the latent\nmanifold underlying the data. Our empirical studies on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nTiny-ImageNet demonstrate that models trained by performing mixup in the latent\nmanifold learned by VAEs are inherently more robust to various input\ncorruptions/perturbations, are significantly better calibrated, and exhibit\nmore local-linear loss landscapes.",

In this paper, we aim\nto unravel the non-trivial relationship between the probability distribution of\nthe data, perceptual distances, and unsupervised machine learning. To this end,\nwe show that perceptual sensitivity is correlated with the probability of an\nimage in its close neighborhood.

          "description": "Polyps in the colon are widely known as cancer precursors identified by\ncolonoscopy either related to diagnostic work-up for symptoms, colorectal\ncancer screening or systematic surveillance of certain diseases. Whilst most\npolyps are benign, the number, size and the surface structure of the polyp are\ntightly linked to the risk of colon cancer. There exists a high missed\ndetection rate and incomplete removal of colon polyps due to the variable\nnature, difficulties to delineate the abnormality, high recurrence rates and\nthe anatomical topography of the colon. In the past, several methods have been\nbuilt to automate polyp detection and segmentation. However, the key issue of\nmost methods is that they have not been tested rigorously on a large\nmulti-center purpose-built dataset. Thus, these methods may not generalise to\ndifferent population datasets as they overfit to a specific population and\nendoscopic surveillance. To this extent, we have curated a dataset from 6\ndifferent centers incorporating more than 300 patients. The dataset includes\nboth single frame and sequence data with 3446 annotated polyp labels with\nprecise delineation of polyp boundaries verified by six senior\ngastroenterologists. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive detection\nand pixel-level segmentation dataset curated by a team of computational\nscientists and expert gastroenterologists.

          "description": "Grapevine winter pruning is a complex task, that requires skilled workers to\nexecute it correctly. The complexity of this task is also the reason why it is\ntime consuming. Considering that this operation takes about 80-120 hours/ha to\nbe completed, and therefore is even more crucial in large-size vineyards, an\nautomated system can help to speed up the process. To this end, this paper\npresents a novel multidisciplinary approach that tackles this challenging task\nby performing object segmentation on grapevine images, used to create a\nrepresentative model of the grapevine plants. Second, a set of potential\npruning points is generated from this plant representation. We will describe\n(a) a methodology for data acquisition and annotation, (b) a neural network\nfine-tuning for grapevine segmentation, (c) an image processing based method\nfor creating the representative model of grapevines, starting from the inferred\nsegmentation and (d) potential pruning points detection and localization, based\non the plant model which is a simplification of the grapevine structure. With\nthis approach, we are able to identify a significant set of potential pruning\npoints on the canes, that can be used, with further selection, to derive the\nfinal set of the real pruning points.",

While human vision can understand both representations,\ncomputer vision models designed for 2D image and 3D point-cloud understanding\nare quite different. Our paper investigates the potential for transferability\nbetween these two representations by empirically investigating whether this\napproach works, what factors affect the transfer performance, and how to make\nit work even better. We discovered that we can indeed use the same neural net\nmodel architectures to understand both images and point-clouds. Moreover, we\ncan transfer pretrained weights from image models to point-cloud models with\nminimal effort. Specifically, based on a 2D ConvNet pretrained on an image\ndataset, we can transfer the image model to a point-cloud model by\n\\textit{inflating} 2D convolutional filters to 3D then finetuning its input,\noutput, and optionally normalization layers. The transferred model can achieve\ncompetitive performance on 3D point-cloud classification, indoor and driving\nscene segmentation, even beating a wide range of point-cloud models that adopt\ntask-specific architectures and use a variety of tricks.",

          "description": "Real-time semantic segmentation has received considerable attention due to\ngrowing demands in many practical applications, such as autonomous vehicles,\nrobotics, etc. Existing real-time segmentation approaches often utilize feature\nfusion to improve segmentation accuracy. However, they fail to fully consider\nthe feature information at different resolutions and the receptive fields of\nthe networks are relatively limited, thereby compromising the performance. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a light Cascaded Selective Resolution Network\n(CSRNet) to improve the performance of real-time segmentation through multiple\ncontext information embedding and enhanced feature aggregation. The proposed\nnetwork builds a three-stage segmentation system, which integrates feature\ninformation from low resolution to high resolution and achieves feature\nrefinement progressively. CSRNet contains two critical modules: the Shorted\nPyramid Fusion Module (SPFM) and the Selective Resolution Module (SRM). The\nSPFM is a computationally efficient module to incorporate the global context\ninformation and significantly enlarge the receptive field at each stage. The\nSRM is designed to fuse multi-resolution feature maps with various receptive\nfields, which assigns soft channel attentions across the feature maps and helps\nto remedy the problem caused by multi-scale objects. Comprehensive experiments\non two well-known datasets demonstrate that the proposed CSRNet effectively\nimproves the performance for real-time segmentation.",

On the one hand generative modeling has been extensively studied\nas a per time-frame static fitting problem for dense 3D models such as mesh\nrepresentations, where the temporal aspect is left out of the generative model.\nOn the other hand, temporal generative models exist for sparse human models\nsuch as marker-based capture representations, but have not to our knowledge\nbeen extended to dense 3D shapes. We propose to bridge this gap with a\ngenerative auto-encoder-based framework, which encodes morphology, global\nlocomotion including translation and rotation, and multi-frame temporal motion\nas a single latent space vector. To assess its generalization and factorization\nabilities, we train our model on a cyclic locomotion subset of AMASS,\nleveraging the dense surface models it provides for an extensive set of motion\ncaptures. Our results validate the ability of the model to reconstruct 4D\nsequences of human locomotions within a low error bound, and the meaningfulness\nof latent space interpolation between latent vectors representing different\nmulti-frame sequences and locomotion types. We also illustrate the benefits of\nthe approach for 4D human motion prediction of future frames from initial human\nlocomotion frames, showing promising abilities of our model to learn realistic\nspatio-temporal features of human motion.

          "description": "Vision transformers (ViTs) process input images as sequences of patches via\nself-attention; a radically different architecture than convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs). This makes it interesting to study the adversarial feature\nspace of ViT models and their transferability. In particular, we observe that\nadversarial patterns found via conventional adversarial attacks show very low\nblack-box transferability even for large ViT models. However, we show that this\nphenomenon is only due to the sub-optimal attack procedures that do not\nleverage the true representation potential of ViTs. A deep ViT is composed of\nmultiple blocks, with a consistent architecture comprising of self-attention\nand feed-forward layers, where each block is capable of independently producing\na class token. Formulating an attack using only the last class token\n(conventional approach) does not directly leverage the discriminative\ninformation stored in the earlier tokens, leading to poor adversarial\ntransferability of ViTs. Using the compositional nature of ViT models, we\nenhance the transferability of existing attacks by introducing two novel\nstrategies specific to the architecture of ViT models. (i) Self-Ensemble: We\npropose a method to find multiple discriminative pathways by dissecting a\nsingle ViT model into an ensemble of networks. This allows explicitly utilizing\nclass-specific information at each ViT block. (ii) Token Refinement: We then\npropose to refine the tokens to further enhance the discriminative capacity at\neach block of ViT. Our token refinement systematically combines the class\ntokens with structural information preserved within the patch tokens. An\nadversarial attack, when applied to such refined tokens within the ensemble of\nclassifiers found in a single vision transformer, has significantly higher\ntransferability.",

More\nroughly, they will fail in handling the third challenge, let alone addressing\nthe three jointly. In this paper, we aim at meeting these under the least\nassumption by building a concise yet effective model with just one\nhyper-parameter. To ease insufficiency of available labels, we exploit not only\nthe consensus of multiple views but also the global and local structures hidden\namong multiple labels. Specifically, we introduce an indicator matrix to tackle\nthe first two challenges in a regression form while aligning the same\nindividual labels and all labels of different views in a common label space to\nbattle the third challenge. In aligning, we characterize the global and local\nstructures of multiple labels to be high-rank and low-rank, respectively.\nSubsequently, an efficient algorithm with linear time complexity in the number\nof samples is established.

To do so, we propose a network that learns to\nestimate Temporal Similarity Matrices (TSMs) that model a fine-grained\nsimilarity pattern between pairs of videos (trimmed or untrimmed), and uses\nthem to generate Temporal Class Activation Maps (TCAMs) for seen or unseen\nclasses. The TCAMs serve as temporal attention mechanisms to extract\nvideo-level representations of untrimmed videos, and to temporally localize\nactions at test time. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose\na weakly-supervised, one/few-shot action localization network that can be\ntrained in an end-to-end fashion.

While this problem can be mitigated by using the\ntarget domain data to align the source and target domain feature\nrepresentations, the target domain data may be unavailable due to privacy\nconcerns. Consequently, there is a need for methods that generalize well\nwithout access to target domain data during training. In this work, we propose\nan adversarial hallucination approach, which combines a class-wise\nhallucination module and a semantic segmentation module. Since the segmentation\nperformance varies across different classes, we design a semantic-conditioned\nstyle hallucination layer to adaptively stylize each class. The classwise\nstylization parameters are generated from the semantic knowledge in the\nsegmentation probability maps of the source domain image.

          "description": "Medical image segmentation is one of the important tasks of computer-aided\ndiagnosis in medical image analysis. Since most medical images have the\ncharacteristics of blurred boundaries and uneven intensity distribution,\nthrough existing segmentation methods, the discontinuity within the target area\nand the discontinuity of the target boundary are likely to lead to rough or\neven erroneous boundary delineation. In this paper, we propose a new iterative\nrefined interactive segmentation method for medical images based on agent\nreinforcement learning, which focuses on the problem of target segmentation\nboundaries. We model the dynamic process of drawing the target contour in a\ncertain order as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based on a deep reinforcement\nlearning method. In the dynamic process of continuous interaction between the\nagent and the image, the agent tracks the boundary point by point in order\nwithin a limited length range until the contour of the target is completely\ndrawn. In this process, the agent can quickly improve the segmentation\nperformance by exploring an interactive policy in the image. The method we\nproposed is simple and effective. At the same time, we evaluate our method on\nthe cardiac MRI scan data set. Experimental results show that our method has a\nbetter segmentation effect on the left ventricle in a small number of medical\nimage data sets, especially in terms of segmentation boundaries, this method is\nbetter than existing methods. Based on our proposed method, the dynamic\ngeneration process of the predicted contour trajectory of the left ventricle\nwill be displayed online at https://github.com/H1997ym/LV-contour-trajectory.",

          "description": "3D complete renal structures(CRS) segmentation targets on segmenting the\nkidneys, tumors, renal arteries and veins in one inference. Once successful, it\nwill provide preoperative plans and intraoperative guidance for laparoscopic\npartial nephrectomy(LPN), playing a key role in the renal cancer treatment.\nHowever, no success has been reported in 3D CRS segmentation due to the complex\nshapes of renal structures, low contrast and large anatomical variation. In\nthis study, we utilize the adversarial ensemble learning and propose Ensemble\nMulti-condition GAN(EnMcGAN) for 3D CRS segmentation for the first time. Its\ncontribution is three-fold. 1)Inspired by windowing, we propose the\nmulti-windowing committee which divides CTA image into multiple narrow windows\nwith different window centers and widths enhancing the contrast for salient\nboundaries and soft tissues. And then, it builds an ensemble segmentation model\non these narrow windows to fuse the segmentation superiorities and improve\nwhole segmentation quality. 2)We propose the multi-condition GAN which equips\nthe segmentation model with multiple discriminators to encourage the segmented\nstructures meeting their real shape conditions, thus improving the shape\nfeature extraction ability. 3)We propose the adversarial weighted ensemble\nmodule which uses the trained discriminators to evaluate the quality of\nsegmented structures, and normalizes these evaluation scores for the ensemble\nweights directed at the input image, thus enhancing the ensemble results. 122\npatients are enrolled in this study and the mean Dice coefficient of the renal\nstructures achieves 84.6%. Extensive experiments with promising results on\nrenal structures reveal powerful segmentation accuracy and great clinical\nsignificance in renal cancer treatment.",

          "description": "The free-form deformation model can represent a wide range of non-rigid\ndeformations by manipulating a control point lattice over the image. However,\ndue to a large number of parameters, it is challenging to fit the free-form\ndeformation model directly to the deformed image for deformation estimation\nbecause of the complexity of the fitness landscape. In this paper, we cast the\nregistration task as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) according to\nthe fact that regions affected by each control point overlap with each other.\nSpecifically, by partitioning the template image into several regions and\nmeasuring the similarity of each region independently, multiple objectives are\nbuilt and deformation estimation can thus be realized by solving the MOP with\noff-the-shelf multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). In addition, a\ncoarse-to-fine strategy is realized by image pyramid combined with control\npoint mesh subdivision. Specifically, the optimized candidate solutions of the\ncurrent image level are inherited by the next level, which increases the\nability to deal with large deformation. Also, a post-processing procedure is\nproposed to generate a single output utilizing the Pareto optimal solutions.\nComparative experiments on both synthetic and real-world images show the\neffectiveness and usefulness of our deformation estimation method.",

In this paper, we present AutoPtosis, an artificial intelligence\nbased system with interpretable results for rapid diagnosis of ptosis. We\nutilize a diverse dataset collected at the University of Illinois Hospital and\nHealth to successfully develop a robust deep learning model for prediction and\nalso develop a clinically inspired model that calculates the marginal reflex\ndistance and iris ratio.

          "description": "In this paper, we are tackling the weakly-supervised referring expression\ngrounding task, for the localization of a referent object in an image according\nto a query sentence, where the mapping between image regions and queries are\nnot available during the training stage. In traditional methods, an object\nregion that best matches the referring expression is picked out, and then the\nquery sentence is reconstructed from the selected region, where the\nreconstruction difference serves as the loss for back-propagation. The existing\nmethods, however, conduct both the matching and the reconstruction\napproximately as they ignore the fact that the matching correctness is unknown.\nTo overcome this limitation, a discriminative triad is designed here as the\nbasis to the solution, through which a query can be converted into one or\nmultiple discriminative triads in a very scalable way. Based on the\ndiscriminative triad, we further propose the triad-level matching and\nreconstruction modules which are lightweight yet effective for the\nweakly-supervised training, making it three times lighter and faster than the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods. One important merit of our work is its\nsuperior performance despite the simple and neat design.

In model-level, Graph-MLP only includes multi-layer\nperceptrons, activation function, and layer normalization. In the loss level,\nwe design a neighboring contrastive (NContrast) loss to bridge the gap between\nGNNs and MLPs by utilizing the adjacency information implicitly. This design\nallows our model to be lighter and more robust when facing large-scale graph\ndata and corrupted adjacency information.

FEAR particularly excels at ranking high-performance architectures in\nthe search space. When used in the inner loop of discrete search algorithms\nlike random search, FEAR can cut down the search time by approximately 2.4X\nwithout losing accuracy. We additionally empirically study very recently\nproposed zero-cost measures for ranking and find that they breakdown in ranking\nperformance as training proceeds and also that data-agnostic ranking scores\nwhich ignore the dataset do not generalize across dissimilar datasets.",

          "description": "Deep Generative Models (DGMs) are known for their superior capability in\ngenerating realistic data. Extending purely data-driven approaches, recent\nspecialized DGMs may satisfy additional controllable requirements such as\nembedding a traffic sign in a driving scene, by manipulating patterns\n\\textit{implicitly} in the neuron or feature level. In this paper, we introduce\na novel method to incorporate domain knowledge \\textit{explicitly} in the\ngeneration process to achieve semantically controllable scene generation. We\ncategorize our knowledge into two types to be consistent with the composition\nof natural scenes, where the first type represents the property of objects and\nthe second type represents the relationship among objects. We then propose a\ntree-structured generative model to learn complex scene representation, whose\nnodes and edges are naturally corresponding to the two types of knowledge\nrespectively. Knowledge can be explicitly integrated to enable semantically\ncontrollable scene generation by imposing semantic rules on properties of nodes\nand edges in the tree structure. We construct a synthetic example to illustrate\nthe controllability and explainability of our method in a clean setting. We\nfurther extend the synthetic example to realistic autonomous vehicle driving\nenvironments and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method\nefficiently identifies adversarial traffic scenes against different\nstate-of-the-art 3D point cloud segmentation models satisfying the traffic\nrules specified as the explicit knowledge.",

In recent years, great progress has been made in applying\nSOD on many vision tasks. The depth map could provide additional spatial prior\nand boundary cues to boost the performance. Combining the depth information\nwith image data obtained from standard visual cameras has been widely used in\nrecent SOD works, however, introducing depth information in a suboptimal fusion\nstrategy may have negative influence in the performance of SOD. In this paper,\nwe discuss about the advantages of the so-called progressive multi-scale fusion\nmethod and propose a mask-guided feature aggregation module(MGFA). The proposed\nframework can effectively combine the two features of different modalities and,\nfurthermore, alleviate the impact of erroneous depth features, which are\ninevitably caused by the variation of depth quality. We further introduce a\nmask-guided refinement module(MGRM) to complement the high-level semantic\nfeatures and reduce the irrelevant features from multi-scale fusion, leading to\nan overall refinement of detection.

Yet, modeling long-range dependencies over normalizing flows\nremains understudied. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce two types of\ninvertible attention mechanisms for generative flow models. To be precise, we\npropose map-based and scaled dot-product attention for unconditional and\nconditional generative flow models. The key idea is to exploit split-based\nattention mechanisms to learn the attention weights and input representations\non every two splits of flow feature maps. Our method provides invertible\nattention modules with tractable Jacobian determinants, enabling seamless\nintegration of it at any positions of the flow-based models. The proposed\nattention mechanism can model the global data dependencies, leading to more\ncomprehensive flow models.

          "description": "There is a growing interest in the community in making an embodied AI agent\nperform a complicated task while interacting with an environment following\nnatural language directives. Recent studies have tackled the problem using\nALFRED, a well-designed dataset for the task, but achieved only very low\naccuracy. This paper proposes a new method, which outperforms the previous\nmethods by a large margin. It is based on a combination of several new ideas.\nOne is a two-stage interpretation of the provided instructions. The method\nfirst selects and interprets an instruction without using visual information,\nyielding a tentative action sequence prediction. It then integrates the\nprediction with the visual information etc., yielding the final prediction of\nan action and an object. As the object's class to interact is identified in the\nfirst stage, it can accurately select the correct object from the input image.\nMoreover, our method considers multiple egocentric views of the environment and\nextracts essential information by applying hierarchical attention conditioned\non the current instruction. This contributes to the accurate prediction of\nactions for navigation. A preliminary version of the method won the ALFRED\nChallenge 2020. The current version achieves the unseen environment's success\nrate of 4.45% with a single view, which is further improved to 8.37% with\nmultiple views.",

          "description": "Gaussian noise injections (GNIs) are a family of simple and widely-used\nregularisation methods for training neural networks, where one injects additive\nor multiplicative Gaussian noise to the network activations at every iteration\nof the optimisation algorithm, which is typically chosen as stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD). In this paper we focus on the so-called `implicit effect' of\nGNIs, which is the effect of the injected noise on the dynamics of SGD. We show\nthat this effect induces an asymmetric heavy-tailed noise on SGD gradient\nupdates. In order to model this modified dynamics, we first develop a\nLangevin-like stochastic differential equation that is driven by a general\nfamily of asymmetric heavy-tailed noise. Using this model we then formally\nprove that GNIs induce an `implicit bias', which varies depending on the\nheaviness of the tails and the level of asymmetry. Our empirical results\nconfirm that different types of neural networks trained with GNIs are\nwell-modelled by the proposed dynamics and that the implicit effect of these\ninjections induces a bias that degrades the performance of networks.",

          "description": "GPT-3 can perform numerous tasks when provided a natural language prompt that\ncontains a few training examples. We show that this type of few-shot learning\ncan be unstable: the choice of prompt format, training examples, and even the\norder of the training examples can cause accuracy to vary from near chance to\nnear state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that this instability arises from the\nbias of language models towards predicting certain answers, e.g., those that\nare placed near the end of the prompt or are common in the pre-training data.\nTo mitigate this, we first estimate the model's bias towards each answer by\nasking for its prediction when given the training prompt and a content-free\ntest input such as \"N/A\". We then fit calibration parameters that cause the\nprediction for this input to be uniform across answers. On a diverse set of\ntasks, this contextual calibration procedure substantially improves GPT-3 and\nGPT-2's average accuracy (up to 30.0% absolute) and reduces variance across\ndifferent choices of the prompt.",

Current computer vision methods can do this, too,\nbut suffer from view generalization problems - the models inferred tend to make\npoor predictions of appearance in novel views. As for generalization problems\nin machine learning, the difficulty is balancing single-view accuracy (cf.\ntraining error; bias) with novel view accuracy (cf. test error; variance). We\ndescribe a class of models whose geometric rigidity is easily controlled to\nmanage this tradeoff. We describe a cycle consistency loss that improves view\ngeneralization (roughly, a model from a generated view should predict the\noriginal view well). View generalization of textures requires that models share\ntexture information, so a car seen from the back still has headlights because\nother cars have headlights. We describe a cycle consistency loss that\nencourages model textures to be aligned, so as to encourage sharing.

          "description": "Neuron death is a complex phenomenon with implications for model\ntrainability: the deeper the network, the lower the probability of finding a\nvalid initialization. In this work, we derive both upper and lower bounds on\nthe probability that a ReLU network is initialized to a trainable point, as a\nfunction of model hyperparameters. We show that it is possible to increase the\ndepth of a network indefinitely, so long as the width increases as well.\nFurthermore, our bounds are asymptotically tight under reasonable assumptions:\nfirst, the upper bound coincides with the true probability for a single-layer\nnetwork with the largest possible input set. Second, the true probability\nconverges to our lower bound as the input set shrinks to a single point, or as\nthe network complexity grows under an assumption about the output variance. We\nconfirm these results by numerical simulation, showing rapid convergence to the\nlower bound with increasing network depth. Then, motivated by the theory, we\npropose a practical sign flipping scheme which guarantees that the ratio of\nliving data points in a $k$-layer network is at least $2^{-k}$. Finally, we\nshow how these issues are mitigated by network design features currently seen\nin practice, such as batch normalization, residual connections, dense networks\nand skip connections.

Motivated by the extreme\nnature of the current global health landscape, which is plagued by the\ncoronavirus pandemic, we seek to better understand and model extreme events.\nModeling extreme events is common in practice and plays an important role in\ntime-series prediction applications. Our goal is to (i) compare and investigate\nthe effect of some common extreme events modeling methods to explore which\nmethod can be practical in reality and (ii) accelerate the deep learning\ntraining process, which commonly uses deep recurrent neural network (RNN), by\nimplementing the asynchronous local Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) framework\namong multiple compute nodes. In order to verify our distributed extreme events\nmodeling, we evaluate our proposed framework on a stock data set S\\&P500, with\na standard recurrent neural network. Our intuition is to explore the (best)\nextreme events modeling method which could work well under the distributed deep\nlearning setting. Moreover, by using asynchronous distributed learning, we aim\nto significantly reduce the communication cost among the compute nodes and\ncentral server, which is the main bottleneck of almost all distributed learning\nframeworks.\n\nWe implement our proposed work and evaluate its performance on representative\ndata sets, such as S&P500 stock in $5$-year period.

In particular we\ndemonstrate that larger encoder variances reduce the high frequency content of\nthese functions. Our analysis allows us to show that increasing this variance\neffectively induces a soft Lipschitz constraint on the decoder network of a\nVAE, which is a core contributor to the adversarial robustness of VAEs. We\nfurther demonstrate that adding Gaussian noise to the input of a VAE allows us\nto more finely control the frequency content and the Lipschitz constant of the\nVAE encoder networks.

          "description": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from graph data\nand are widely used in various applications such as social network\nrecommendation, fraud detection, and graph search. The graphs in these\napplications are typically large, usually containing hundreds of millions of\nnodes. Training GNN models on such large graphs efficiently remains a big\nchallenge. Despite a number of sampling-based methods have been proposed to\nenable mini-batch training on large graphs, these methods have not been proved\nto work on truly industry-scale graphs, which require GPUs or mixed-CPU-GPU\ntraining. The state-of-the-art sampling-based methods are usually not optimized\nfor these real-world hardware setups, in which data movement between CPUs and\nGPUs is a bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose Global Neighborhood\nSampling that aims at training GNNs on giant graphs specifically for\nmixed-CPU-GPU training. The algorithm samples a global cache of nodes\nperiodically for all mini-batches and stores them in GPUs. This global cache\nallows in-GPU importance sampling of mini-batches, which drastically reduces\nthe number of nodes in a mini-batch, especially in the input layer, to reduce\ndata copy between CPU and GPU and mini-batch computation without compromising\nthe training convergence rate or model accuracy. We provide a highly efficient\nimplementation of this method and show that our implementation outperforms an\nefficient node-wise neighbor sampling baseline by a factor of 2X-4X on giant\ngraphs. It outperforms an efficient implementation of LADIES with small layers\nby a factor of 2X-14X while achieving much higher accuracy than LADIES.We also\ntheoretically analyze the proposed algorithm and show that with cached node\ndata of a proper size, it enjoys a comparable convergence rate as the\nunderlying node-wise sampling method.",

          "description": "Randomized smoothing is a general technique for computing sample-dependent\nrobustness guarantees against adversarial attacks for deep classifiers. Prior\nworks on randomized smoothing against L_1 adversarial attacks use additive\nsmoothing noise and provide probabilistic robustness guarantees. In this work,\nwe propose a non-additive and deterministic smoothing method, Deterministic\nSmoothing with Splitting Noise (DSSN). To develop DSSN, we first develop SSN, a\nrandomized method which involves generating each noisy smoothing sample by\nfirst randomly splitting the input space and then returning a representation of\nthe center of the subdivision occupied by the input sample. In contrast to\nuniform additive smoothing, the SSN certification does not require the random\nnoise components used to be independent. Thus, smoothing can be done\neffectively in just one dimension and can therefore be efficiently derandomized\nfor quantized data (e.g., images). To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work to provide deterministic \"randomized smoothing\" for a norm-based\nadversarial threat model while allowing for an arbitrary classifier (i.e., a\ndeep model) to be used as a base classifier and without requiring an\nexponential number of smoothing samples. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we\nprovide substantially larger L_1 robustness certificates compared to prior\nworks, establishing a new state-of-the-art. The determinism of our method also\nleads to significantly faster certificate computation. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/alevine0/smoothingSplittingNoise",

A popular\napproach to overcome this is Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED).\nHowever, BOED becomes infeasible in high-dimensional settings, as it involves\nintegration over all possible experimental outcomes. We propose a novel\ncriterion for experimental design based on a variational approximation of the\nexpected information gain.

By\ndoing so, we can replace sampling over experimental outcomes by solving the\nCTBNs master-equation, for which scalable approximations exist. This alleviates\nthe computational burden of sampling possible experimental outcomes in\nhigh-dimensions. We employ this framework in order to recommend interventional\nsequences.

          "description": "Models trained with offline data often suffer from continual distribution\nshifts and expensive labeling in changing environments. This calls for a new\nonline learning paradigm where the learner can continually adapt to changing\nenvironments with limited labels. In this paper, we propose a new online\nsetting -- Online Active Continual Adaptation, where the learner aims to\ncontinually adapt to changing distributions using both unlabeled samples and\nactive queries of limited labels. To this end, we propose Online Self-Adaptive\nMirror Descent (OSAMD), which adopts an online teacher-student structure to\nenable online self-training from unlabeled data, and a margin-based criterion\nthat decides whether to query the labels to track changing distributions.\nTheoretically, we show that, in the separable case, OSAMD has an $O({T}^{1/2})$\ndynamic regret bound under mild assumptions, which is even tighter than the\nlower bound $\\Omega(T^{2/3})$ of traditional online learning with full labels.\nIn the general case, we show a regret bound of $O({\\alpha^*}^{1/3} {T}^{2/3} +\n\\alpha^* T)$, where $\\alpha^*$ denotes the separability of domains and is\nusually small. Our theoretical results show that OSAMD can fast adapt to\nchanging environments with active queries.

          "description": "Improving adversarial robustness of neural networks remains a major\nchallenge. Fundamentally, training a network is a parameter estimation problem.\nIn adaptive control theory, maintaining persistency of excitation (PoE) is\nintegral to ensuring convergence of parameter estimates in dynamical systems to\ntheir robust optima. In this work, we show that network training using gradient\ndescent is equivalent to a dynamical system parameter estimation problem.\nLeveraging this relationship, we prove a sufficient condition for PoE of\ngradient descent is achieved when the learning rate is less than the inverse of\nthe Lipschitz constant of the gradient of loss function. We provide an\nefficient technique for estimating the corresponding Lipschitz constant using\nextreme value theory and demonstrate that by only scaling the learning rate\nschedule we can increase adversarial accuracy by up to 15% points on benchmark\ndatasets. Our approach also universally increases the adversarial accuracy by\n0.1% to 0.3% points in various state-of-the-art adversarially trained models on\nthe AutoAttack benchmark, where every small margin of improvement is\nsignificant.",

          "description": "Stock prediction, with the purpose of forecasting the future price trends of\nstocks, is crucial for maximizing profits from stock investments. While great\nresearch efforts have been devoted to exploiting deep neural networks for\nimproved stock prediction, two major issues still exist in recent studies.\nFirst, the capture of long-range dependencies in time series is not\nsufficiently addressed. Second, the chaotic property of financial time series\nfundamentally lowers prediction performance. In this study, we propose a novel\nframework to address both issues regarding stock prediction. Specifically, in\nterms of transforming time series into complex networks, we convert market\nprice series into graphs. Then, structural information, referring to\nassociations among temporal points and the node weights, is extracted from the\nmapped graphs to resolve the problems regarding long-range dependencies and the\nchaotic property. We take graph embeddings to represent the associations among\ntemporal points as the prediction model inputs. Node weights are used as a\npriori knowledge to enhance the learning of temporal attention. The\neffectiveness of our proposed framework is validated using real-world stock\ndata, and our approach obtains the best performance among several\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, in the conducted trading simulations,\nour framework further obtains the highest cumulative profits.

We argue that for\nhigh-dimensional multi-class data, the optimal linear discriminative\nrepresentation maximizes the coding rate difference between the whole dataset\nand the average of all the subsets. We show that the basic iterative gradient\nascent scheme for optimizing the rate reduction objective naturally leads to a\nmulti-layer deep network, named ReduNet, which shares common characteristics of\nmodern deep networks. The deep layered architectures, linear and nonlinear\noperators, and even parameters of the network are all explicitly constructed\nlayer-by-layer via forward propagation, although they are amenable to\nfine-tuning via back propagation. All components of so-obtained ``white-box''\nnetwork have precise optimization, statistical, and geometric interpretation.\nMoreover, all linear operators of the so-derived network naturally become\nmulti-channel convolutions when we enforce classification to be rigorously\nshift-invariant. The derivation in the invariant setting suggests a trade-off\nbetween sparsity and invariance, and also indicates that such a deep\nconvolution network is significantly more efficient to construct and learn in\nthe spectral domain.

          "description": "The ability to handle large scale variations is crucial for many real world\nvisual tasks. A straightforward approach for handling scale in a deep network\nis to process an image at several scales simultaneously in a set of scale\nchannels. Scale invariance can then, in principle, be achieved by using weight\nsharing between the scale channels together with max or average pooling over\nthe outputs from the scale channels. The ability of such scale channel networks\nto generalise to scales not present in the training set over significant scale\nranges has, however, not previously been explored.\n\nIn this paper, we present a systematic study of this methodology by\nimplementing different types of scale channel networks and evaluating their\nability to generalise to previously unseen scales. We develop a formalism for\nanalysing the covariance and invariance properties of scale channel networks,\nand explore how different design choices, unique to scaling transformations,\naffect the overall performance of scale channel networks. We first show that\ntwo previously proposed scale channel network designs do not generalise well to\nscales not present in the training set. We explain theoretically and\ndemonstrate experimentally why generalisation fails in these cases.\n\nWe then propose a new type of foveated scale channel architecture}, where the\nscale channels process increasingly larger parts of the image with decreasing\nresolution. This new type of scale channel network is shown to generalise\nextremely well, provided sufficient image resolution and the absence of\nboundary effects. Our proposed FovMax and FovAvg networks perform almost\nidentically over a scale range of 8, also when training on single scale\ntraining data, and do also give improved performance when learning from\ndatasets with large scale variations in the small sample regime.",

          "description": "The adversarial vulnerability of deep neural networks has attracted\nsignificant attention in machine learning. From a causal viewpoint, adversarial\nattacks can be considered as a specific type of distribution change on natural\ndata. As causal reasoning has an instinct for modeling distribution change, we\npropose to incorporate causality into mitigating adversarial vulnerability.\nHowever, causal formulations of the intuition of adversarial attack and the\ndevelopment of robust DNNs are still lacking in the literature. To bridge this\ngap, we construct a causal graph to model the generation process of adversarial\nexamples and define the adversarial distribution to formalize the intuition of\nadversarial attacks. From a causal perspective, we find that the label is\nspuriously correlated with the style (content-independent) information when an\ninstance is given. The spurious correlation implies that the adversarial\ndistribution is constructed via making the statistical conditional association\nbetween style information and labels drastically different from that in natural\ndistribution. Thus, DNNs that fit the spurious correlation are vulnerable to\nthe adversarial distribution. Inspired by the observation, we propose the\nadversarial distribution alignment method to eliminate the difference between\nthe natural distribution and the adversarial distribution.

          "description": "Partial-label (PL) learning is a typical weakly supervised classification\nproblem, where a PL of an instance is a set of candidate labels such that a\nfixed but unknown candidate is the true label. For PL learning, there are two\nlines of research: (a) the identification-based strategy (IBS) purifies each\nlabel set and extracts the true label; (b) the average-based strategy (ABS)\ntreats all candidates equally for training. In the past two decades, IBS was a\nmuch hotter topic than ABS, since it was believed that IBS is more promising.\nIn this paper, we theoretically analyze ABS and find it also promising in the\nsense of the robustness of its loss functions. Specifically, we consider five\nproblem settings for the generation of clean or noisy PLs, and we prove that\naverage PL losses with bounded multi-class losses are always robust under mild\nassumptions on the domination of true labels, while average PL losses with\nunbounded multi-class losses (e.g., the cross-entropy loss) may not be robust.\nWe also conduct experiments to validate our theoretical findings. Note that IBS\nis heuristic, and we cannot prove its robustness by a similar proof technique;\nhence, ABS is more advantageous from a theoretical point of view, and it is\nworth paying attention to the design of more advanced PL learning methods\nfollowing ABS.",

However, standard NNs are unable to capture their model uncertainty\nwhich is crucial for many safety-critical applications including healthcare and\nautonomous vehicles. In comparison, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are able to\nexpress uncertainty in their prediction via a mathematical grounding.\nNevertheless, BNNs have not been as widely used in industrial practice, mainly\nbecause of their expensive computational cost and limited hardware performance.\nThis work proposes a novel FPGA-based hardware architecture to accelerate BNNs\ninferred through Monte Carlo Dropout.

However, many drug discovery projects require a fixed\nscaffold to be present in the generated molecule, and incorporating that\nconstraint has only recently been explored. In this work, we propose a new\ngraph-based model that naturally supports scaffolds as initial seed of the\ngenerative procedure, which is possible because our model is not conditioned on\nthe generation history. At the same time, our generation procedure can flexibly\nchoose between adding individual atoms and entire fragments. We show that\ntraining using a randomized generation order is necessary for good performance\nwhen extending scaffolds, and that the results are further improved by\nincreasing the fragment vocabulary size.

          "description": "This paper illustrates an application of machine learning (ML) within a\ncomplex system that performs grade estimation. In surface mining, assay\nmeasurements taken from production drilling often provide useful information\nthat allows initially inaccurate surfaces created using sparse exploration data\nto be revised and subsequently improved. Recently, a Bayesian warping technique\nhas been proposed to reshape modeled surfaces using geochemical and spatial\nconstraints imposed by newly acquired blasthole data. This paper focuses on\nincorporating machine learning into this warping framework to make the\nlikelihood computation generalizable. The technique works by adjusting the\nposition of vertices on the surface to maximize the integrity of modeled\ngeological boundaries with respect to sparse geochemical observations. Its\nfoundation is laid by a Bayesian derivation in which the geological domain\nlikelihood given the chemistry, p(g|c), plays a similar role to p(y(c)|g). This\nobservation allows a manually calibrated process centered around the latter to\nbe automated since ML techniques may be used to estimate the former in a\ndata-driven way. Machine learning performance is evaluated for gradient\nboosting, neural network, random forest and other classifiers in a binary and\nmulti-class context using precision and recall rates. Once ML likelihood\nestimators are integrated in the surface warping framework, surface shaping\nperformance is evaluated using unseen data by examining the categorical\ndistribution of test samples located above and below the warped surface.\nLarge-scale validation experiments are performed to assess the overall efficacy\nof ML assisted surface warping as a fully integrated component within an ore\ngrade estimation system where the posterior mean is obtained via Gaussian\nProcess inference with a Matern 3/2 kernel.",

At its core, our classification\nscheme is based on whether the learner attempts to match (1) reward or (2)\naction-value moments of the expert's behavior, with each option leading to\ndiffering algorithmic approaches. By considering adversarially chosen\ndivergences between learner and expert behavior, we are able to derive bounds\non policy performance that apply for all algorithms in each of these classes,\nthe first to our knowledge. We also introduce the notion of moment\nrecoverability, implicit in many previous analyses of imitation learning, which\nallows us to cleanly delineate how well each algorithmic family is able to\nmitigate compounding errors. We derive three novel algorithm templates (AdVIL,\nAdRIL, and DAeQuIL) with strong guarantees, simple implementation, and\ncompetitive empirical performance.",

Drawing analogies from discrete and\ngraph signal processing, we introduce the building blocks for processing data\non simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, two common higher-order network\nabstractions that can incorporate polyadic relationships. We provide brief\nintroductions to simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, with a special emphasis\non the concepts needed for the processing of signals supported on these\nstructures. Specifically, we discuss Fourier analysis, signal denoising, signal\ninterpolation, node embeddings, and nonlinear processing through neural\nnetworks, using these two higher-order network models. In the context of\nsimplicial complexes, we specifically focus on signal processing using the\nHodge Laplacian matrix, a multi-relational operator that leverages the special\nstructure of simplicial complexes and generalizes desirable properties of the\nLaplacian matrix in graph signal processing. For hypergraphs, we present both\nmatrix and tensor representations, and discuss the trade-offs in adopting one\nor the other. We also highlight limitations and potential research avenues,\nboth to inform practitioners and to motivate the contribution of new\nresearchers to the area.",

          "description": "Pre-trained representations are becoming crucial for many NLP and perception\ntasks. While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw\ntext without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations\nstill rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require\nexpert knowledge. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned\nusing datasets with explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For\nvision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all\ninvolve a non-trivial data collection (and cleaning) process. This costly\ncuration process limits the size of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of\ntrained models. In this paper, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion\nimage alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing\nsteps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple dual-encoder architecture\nlearns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs\nusing a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for\nits noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even with such a simple\nlearning scheme. Our visual representation achieves strong performance when\ntransferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned\nvisual and language representations enables zero-shot image classification and\nalso set new state-of-the-art results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO image-text\nretrieval benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated\ncross-attention models. The representations also enable cross-modality search\nwith complex text and text + image queries.",

          "description": "Matrix reordering is a task to permute the rows and columns of a given\nobserved matrix such that the resulting reordered matrix shows meaningful or\ninterpretable structural patterns. Most existing matrix reordering techniques\nshare the common processes of extracting some feature representations from an\nobserved matrix in a predefined manner, and applying matrix reordering based on\nit. However, in some practical cases, we do not always have prior knowledge\nabout the structural pattern of an observed matrix. To address this problem, we\npropose a new matrix reordering method, called deep two-way matrix reordering\n(DeepTMR), using a neural network model. The trained network can automatically\nextract nonlinear row/column features from an observed matrix, which can then\nbe used for matrix reordering. Moreover, the proposed DeepTMR provides the\ndenoised mean matrix of a given observed matrix as an output of the trained\nnetwork. This denoised mean matrix can be used to visualize the global\nstructure of the reordered observed matrix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed DeepTMR by applying it to both synthetic and practical datasets.",

          "description": "It is well-known that standard neural networks, even with a high\nclassification accuracy, are vulnerable to small $\\ell_\\infty$-norm bounded\nadversarial perturbations. Although many attempts have been made, most previous\nworks either can only provide empirical verification of the defense to a\nparticular attack method, or can only develop a certified guarantee of the\nmodel robustness in limited scenarios. In this paper, we seek for a new\napproach to develop a theoretically principled neural network that inherently\nresists $\\ell_\\infty$ perturbations. In particular, we design a novel neuron\nthat uses $\\ell_\\infty$-distance as its basic operation (which we call\n$\\ell_\\infty$-dist neuron), and show that any neural network constructed with\n$\\ell_\\infty$-dist neurons (called $\\ell_{\\infty}$-dist net) is naturally a\n1-Lipschitz function with respect to $\\ell_\\infty$-norm. This directly provides\na rigorous guarantee of the certified robustness based on the margin of\nprediction outputs. We then prove that such networks have enough expressive\npower to approximate any 1-Lipschitz function with robust generalization\nguarantee. We further provide a holistic training strategy that can greatly\nalleviate optimization difficulties. Experimental results show that using\n$\\ell_{\\infty}$-dist nets as basic building blocks, we consistently achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on commonly used datasets: 93.09% certified\naccuracy on MNIST ($\\epsilon=0.3$), 35.42% on CIFAR-10 ($\\epsilon=8/255$) and\n16.31% on TinyImageNet ($\\epsilon=1/255$).",

          "description": "In large-scale time series forecasting, one often encounters the situation\nwhere the temporal patterns of time series, while drifting over time, differ\nfrom one another in the same dataset. In this paper, we provably show under\nsuch heterogeneity, training a forecasting model with commonly used stochastic\noptimizers (e.g. SGD) potentially suffers large variance on gradient\nestimation, and thus incurs long-time training. We show that this issue can be\nefficiently alleviated via stratification, which allows the optimizer to sample\nfrom pre-grouped time series strata. For better trading-off gradient variance\nand computation complexity, we further propose SCott (Stochastic Stratified\nControl Variate Gradient Descent), a variance reduced SGD-style optimizer that\nutilizes stratified sampling via control variate. In theory, we provide the\nconvergence guarantee of SCott on smooth non-convex objectives. Empirically, we\nevaluate SCott and other baseline optimizers on both synthetic and real-world\ntime series forecasting problems, and demonstrate SCott converges faster with\nrespect to both iterations and wall clock time.",

In this regime, we show that the behavior of a\nclass of sequentially randomized Markov experiments converges to a diffusion\nlimit, given as the solution of a stochastic differential equation. The\ndiffusion limit thus enables us to derive refined, instance-specific\ncharacterization of the stochastic dynamics of adaptive experiments. As an\napplication of this framework, we use the diffusion limit to obtain several new\ninsights on the regret and belief evolution of Thompson sampling. We show that\na version of Thompson sampling with an asymptotically uninformative prior\nvariance achieves nearly-optimal instance-specific regret scaling when the\nreward gaps are relatively large.

However,\nwhen the reward model is not well-specified, the bandit algorithm may incur\nunexpected regret, so recent work has focused on algorithms that are robust to\nmisspecification. We propose a simple family of contextual bandit algorithms\nthat adapt to misspecification error by reverting to a good safe policy when\nthere is evidence that misspecification is causing a regret increase. Our\nalgorithm requires only an offline regression oracle to ensure regret\nguarantees that gracefully degrade in terms of a measure of the average\nmisspecification level. Compared to prior work, we attain similar regret\nguarantees, but we do no rely on a master algorithm, and do not require more\nrobust oracles like online or constrained regression oracles (e.g., Foster et\nal.

DAD addresses this restriction by learning an\namortized design network upfront and then using this to rapidly run (multiple)\nadaptive experiments at deployment time. This network represents a design\npolicy which takes as input the data from previous steps, and outputs the next\ndesign using a single forward pass; these design decisions can be made in\nmilliseconds during the live experiment. To train the network, we introduce\ncontrastive information bounds that are suitable objectives for the sequential\nsetting, and propose a customized network architecture that exploits key\nsymmetries.

          "description": "Although deep feedforward neural networks share some characteristics with the\nprimate visual system, a key distinction is their dynamics. Deep nets typically\noperate in serial stages wherein each layer completes its computation before\nprocessing begins in subsequent layers. In contrast, biological systems have\ncascaded dynamics: information propagates from neurons at all layers in\nparallel but transmission occurs gradually over time, leading to speed-accuracy\ntrade offs even in feedforward architectures. We explore the consequences of\nbiologically inspired parallel hardware by constructing cascaded ResNets in\nwhich each residual block has propagation delays but all blocks update in\nparallel in a stateful manner. Because information transmitted through skip\nconnections avoids delays, the functional depth of the architecture increases\nover time, yielding anytime predictions that improve with internal-processing\ntime. We introduce a temporal-difference training loss that achieves a strictly\nsuperior speed-accuracy profile over standard losses and enables the cascaded\narchitecture to outperform state-of-the-art anytime-prediction methods. The\ncascaded architecture has intriguing properties, including: it classifies\ntypical instances more rapidly than atypical instances; it is more robust to\nboth persistent and transient noise than is a conventional ResNet; and its\ntime-varying output trace provides a signal that can be exploited to improve\ninformation processing and inference.",

          "description": "The early phase of training a deep neural network has a dramatic effect on\nthe local curvature of the loss function. For instance, using a small learning\nrate does not guarantee stable optimization because the optimization trajectory\nhas a tendency to steer towards regions of the loss surface with increasing\nlocal curvature. We ask whether this tendency is connected to the widely\nobserved phenomenon that the choice of the learning rate strongly influences\ngeneralization. We first show that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) implicitly\npenalizes the trace of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), a measure of the\nlocal curvature, from the start of training. We argue it is an implicit\nregularizer in SGD by showing that explicitly penalizing the trace of the FIM\ncan significantly improve generalization. We highlight that poor final\ngeneralization coincides with the trace of the FIM attaining a large value\nearly in training, to which we refer as catastrophic Fisher explosion. Finally,\nto gain insight into the regularization effect of penalizing the trace of the\nFIM, we show that it limits memorization by reducing the learning speed of\nexamples with noisy labels more than that of the examples with clean labels.",

          "description": "We propose the particle dual averaging (PDA) method, which generalizes the\ndual averaging method in convex optimization to the optimization over\nprobability distributions with quantitative runtime guarantee. The algorithm\nconsists of an inner loop and outer loop: the inner loop utilizes the Langevin\nalgorithm to approximately solve for a stationary distribution, which is then\noptimized in the outer loop. The method can thus be interpreted as an extension\nof the Langevin algorithm to naturally handle nonlinear functional on the\nprobability space. An important application of the proposed method is the\noptimization of neural network in the mean field regime, which is theoretically\nattractive due to the presence of nonlinear feature learning, but quantitative\nconvergence rate can be challenging to obtain. By adapting finite-dimensional\nconvex optimization theory into the space of distributions, we analyze PDA in\nregularized empirical / expected risk minimization, and establish quantitative\nglobal convergence in learning two-layer mean field neural networks under more\ngeneral settings. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical\nsimulations on neural networks with reasonable size.",

We first\ndiscover in theory that learning a distribution function of state-action\nreturns can effectively mitigate Q-value overestimations because it is capable\nof adaptively adjusting the update stepsize of the Q-value function. Then, a\ndistributional soft policy iteration (DSPI) framework is developed by embedding\nthe return distribution function into maximum entropy RL. Finally, we present a\ndeep off-policy actor-critic variant of DSPI, called DSAC, which directly\nlearns a continuous return distribution by keeping the variance of the\nstate-action returns within a reasonable range to address exploding and\nvanishing gradient problems.

In this paper, we prove a quantitative trade-off\nbetween spatial and adversarial robustness in a simple statistical setting. We\ncomplement this empirically by showing that: (a) as the spatial robustness of\nequivariant models improves by training augmentation with progressively larger\ntransformations, their adversarial robustness worsens progressively, and (b) as\nthe state-of-the-art robust models are adversarially trained with progressively\nlarger pixel-wise perturbations, their spatial robustness drops progressively.\nTowards achieving pareto-optimality in this trade-off, we propose a method\nbased on curriculum learning that trains gradually on more difficult\nperturbations (both spatial and adversarial) to improve spatial and adversarial\nrobustness simultaneously.",

          "description": "The ability to perform accurate prognosis of patients is crucial for\nproactive clinical decision making, informed resource management and\npersonalised care. Existing outcome prediction models suffer from a low recall\nof infrequent positive outcomes. We present a highly-scalable and robust\nmachine learning framework to automatically predict adversity represented by\nmortality and ICU admission from time-series vital signs and laboratory results\nobtained within the first 24 hours of hospital admission. The stacked platform\ncomprises two components: a) an unsupervised LSTM Autoencoder that learns an\noptimal representation of the time-series, using it to differentiate the less\nfrequent patterns which conclude with an adverse event from the majority\npatterns that do not, and b) a gradient boosting model, which relies on the\nconstructed representation to refine prediction, incorporating static features\nof demographics, admission details and clinical summaries. The model is used to\nassess a patient's risk of adversity over time and provides visual\njustifications of its prediction based on the patient's static features and\ndynamic signals. Results of three case studies for predicting mortality and ICU\nadmission show that the model outperforms all existing outcome prediction\nmodels, achieving PR-AUC of 0.891 (95$%$ CI: 0.878 - 0.969) in predicting\nmortality in ICU and general ward settings and 0.908 (95$%$ CI: 0.870-0.935) in\npredicting ICU admission.",

          "description": "A key problem in the theory of meta-learning is to understand how the task\ndistributions influence transfer risk, the expected error of a meta-learner on\na new task drawn from the unknown task distribution. In this paper, focusing on\nfixed design linear regression with Gaussian noise and a Gaussian task (or\nparameter) distribution, we give distribution-dependent lower bounds on the\ntransfer risk of any algorithm, while we also show that a novel, weighted\nversion of the so-called biased regularized regression method is able to match\nthese lower bounds up to a fixed constant factor. Notably, the weighting is\nderived from the covariance of the Gaussian task distribution. Altogether, our\nresults provide a precise characterization of the difficulty of meta-learning\nin this Gaussian setting. While this problem setting may appear simple, we show\nthat it is rich enough to unify the \"parameter sharing\" and \"representation\nlearning\" streams of meta-learning; in particular, representation learning is\nobtained as the special case when the covariance matrix of the task\ndistribution is unknown. For this case we propose to adopt the EM method, which\nis shown to enjoy efficient updates in our case. The paper is completed by an\nempirical study of EM. In particular, our experimental results show that the EM\nalgorithm can attain the lower bound as the number of tasks grows, while the\nalgorithm is also successful in competing with its alternatives when used in a\nrepresentation learning context.",

From theoretical and\nempirical lens, we show that generalized value estimates offered by PeVFA may\nhave lower initial approximation error to true values of successive policies,\nwhich is expected to improve consecutive value approximation during GPI. Based\non above clues, we introduce a new form of GPI with PeVFA which leverages the\nvalue generalization along policy improvement path.

          "description": "In one-shot weight sharing for NAS, the weights of each operation (at each\nlayer) are supposed to be identical for all architectures (paths) in the\nsupernet. However, this rules out the possibility of adjusting operation\nweights to cater for different paths, which limits the reliability of the\nevaluation results. In this paper, instead of counting on a single supernet, we\nintroduce $K$-shot supernets and take their weights for each operation as a\ndictionary. The operation weight for each path is represented as a convex\ncombination of items in a dictionary with a simplex code. This enables a matrix\napproximation of the stand-alone weight matrix with a higher rank ($K>1$). A\n\\textit{simplex-net} is introduced to produce architecture-customized code for\neach path. As a result, all paths can adaptively learn how to share weights in\nthe $K$-shot supernets and acquire corresponding weights for better evaluation.\n$K$-shot supernets and simplex-net can be iteratively trained, and we further\nextend the search to the channel dimension. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets validate that K-shot NAS significantly improves the evaluation\naccuracy of paths and thus brings in impressive performance improvements.",

This setting covers several inverse problems\nin imaging including denoising, deblurring, and X-ray tomography. Within the\nclassical framework of regularization, we focus on the case where the\nregularization functional is not given a priori but learned from data. Our\nfirst result is a characterization of the optimal generalized Tikhonov\nregularizer, with respect to the mean squared error. We find that it is\ncompletely independent of the forward operator $A$ and depends only on the mean\nand covariance of $x$. Then, we consider the problem of learning the\nregularizer from a finite training set in two different frameworks: one\nsupervised, based on samples of both $x$ and $y$, and one unsupervised, based\nonly on samples of $x$. In both cases, we prove generalization bounds, under\nsome weak assumptions on the distribution of $x$ and $\\epsilon$, including the\ncase of sub-Gaussian variables.

Most previous works have\nfocused on two extreme situations where any testing data point either is\ncompletely adversarial or always equally prefers the positive label. In this\npaper, we generalize both of these through a unified framework for strategic\nclassification, and introduce the notion of strategic VC-dimension (SVC) to\ncapture the PAC-learnability in our general strategic setup. SVC provably\ngeneralizes the recent concept of adversarial VC-dimension (AVC) introduced by\nCullina et al. arXiv:1806.01471. We instantiate our framework for the\nfundamental strategic linear classification problem. We fully characterize: (1)\nthe statistical learnability of linear classifiers by pinning down its SVC; (2)\nits computational tractability by pinning down the complexity of the empirical\nrisk minimization problem. Interestingly, the SVC of linear classifiers is\nalways upper bounded by its standard VC-dimension.

          "description": "Large width limits have been a recent focus of deep learning research: modulo\ncomputational practicalities, do wider networks outperform narrower ones?\nAnswering this question has been challenging, as conventional networks gain\nrepresentational power with width, potentially masking any negative effects.\nOur analysis in this paper decouples capacity and width via the generalization\nof neural networks to Deep Gaussian Processes (Deep GP), a class of\nhierarchical models that subsume neural nets. In doing so, we aim to understand\nhow width affects standard neural networks once they have sufficient capacity\nfor a given modeling task. Our theoretical and empirical results on Deep GP\nsuggest that large width is generally detrimental to hierarchical models.\nSurprisingly, we prove that even nonparametric Deep GP converge to Gaussian\nprocesses, effectively becoming shallower without any increase in\nrepresentational power. The posterior, which corresponds to a mixture of\ndata-adaptable basis functions, becomes less data-dependent with width. Our\ntail analysis demonstrates that width and depth have opposite effects: depth\naccentuates a model's non-Gaussianity, while width makes models increasingly\nGaussian. We find there is a \"sweet spot\" that maximizes test set performance\nbefore the limiting GP behavior prevents adaptability, occurring at width = 1\nor width = 2 for nonparametric Deep GP. These results make strong predictions\nabout the same phenomenon in conventional neural networks: we show empirically\nthat many neural network architectures need 10 - 500 hidden units for\nsufficient capacity - depending on the dataset - but further width degrades\ntest performance.",

Furthermore, the inclusion of Hurricast into an\noperational forecast consensus model leads to a significant improvement of 5% -\n15% over NHC's official forecast, thus highlighting the complementary\nproperties with existing approaches.

          "description": "Deep learning architectures with a huge number of parameters are often\ncompressed using pruning techniques to ensure computational efficiency of\ninference during deployment. Despite multitude of empirical advances, there is\na lack of theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of different pruning\nmethods. We inspect different pruning techniques under the statistical\nmechanics formulation of a teacher-student framework and derive their\ngeneralization error (GE) bounds. It has been shown that Determinantal Point\nProcess (DPP) based node pruning method is notably superior to competing\napproaches when tested on real datasets. Using GE bounds in the aforementioned\nsetup we provide theoretical guarantees for their empirical observations.\nAnother consistent finding in literature is that sparse neural networks (edge\npruned) generalize better than dense neural networks (node pruned) for a fixed\nnumber of parameters. We use our theoretical setup to prove this finding and\nshow that even the baseline random edge pruning method performs better than the\nDPP node pruning method. We also validate this empirically on real datasets.",

          "description": "For natural frequency optimization of engineering structures, cellular\ncomposites have been shown to possess an edge over solid. However, existing\nmultiscale design methods for cellular composites are either computationally\nexhaustive or confined to a single class of microstructures. In this paper, we\npropose a data-driven topology optimization (TO) approach to enable the\nmultiscale design of cellular structures with various choices of microstructure\nclasses. The key component is a newly proposed latent-variable Gaussian process\n(LVGP) model through which different classes of microstructures are mapped into\na low-dimensional continuous latent space. It provides an interpretable\ndistance metric between classes and captures their effects on the homogenized\nstiffness tensors. By introducing latent vectors as design variables, a\ndifferentiable transition of stiffness matrix between classes can be easily\nachieved with an analytical gradient. After integrating LVGP with the\ndensity-based TO, an efficient data-driven cellular composite optimization\nprocess is developed to enable concurrent exploration of microstructure\nconcepts and the associated volume fractions for natural frequency\noptimization. Examples reveal that the proposed cellular designs with\nmulticlass microstructures achieve higher natural frequencies than both\nsingle-scale and single-class designs. This framework can be easily extended to\nother multi-scale TO problems, such as thermal compliance and dynamic response\noptimization.",

          "description": "Tuning machine learning models with Bayesian optimization (BO) is a\nsuccessful strategy to find good hyperparameters.

In practice, however, an improvement of the validation metric\nmay not translate in better predictive performance on a test set, especially\nwhen tuning models trained on small datasets. In other words, unlike\nconventional wisdom dictates, BO can overfit. In this paper, we carry out the\nfirst systematic investigation of overfitting in BO and demonstrate that this\nissue is serious, yet often overlooked in practice. We propose a novel\ncriterion to early stop BO, which aims to maintain the solution quality while\nsaving the unnecessary iterations that can lead to overfitting.

We rectify this with a novel\nregularization-based update scheme that penalizes large joint action-values\nthat deviate from a baseline and demonstrate its effectiveness in stabilizing\nlearning. Furthermore, we propose to employ a softmax operator, which we\nefficiently approximate in a novel way in the multi-agent setting, to further\nreduce the potential overestimation bias. Our approach, Regularized Softmax\n(RES) Deep Multi-Agent $Q$-Learning, is general and can be applied to any\n$Q$-learning based MARL algorithm.

          "description": "Anomaly estimation, or the problem of finding a subset of a dataset that\ndiffers from the rest of the dataset, is a classic problem in machine learning\nand data mining. In both theoretical work and in applications, the anomaly is\nassumed to have a specific structure defined by membership in an\n$\\textit{anomaly family}$. For example, in temporal data the anomaly family may\nbe time intervals, while in network data the anomaly family may be connected\nsubgraphs. The most prominent approach for anomaly estimation is to compute the\nMaximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of the anomaly; however, it was recently\nobserved that for normally distributed data, the MLE is a $\\textit{biased}$\nestimator for some anomaly families. In this work, we demonstrate that in the\nnormal means setting, the bias of the MLE depends on the size of the anomaly\nfamily. We prove that if the number of sets in the anomaly family that contain\nthe anomaly is sub-exponential, then the MLE is asymptotically unbiased. We\nalso provide empirical evidence that the converse is true: if the number of\nsuch sets is exponential, then the MLE is asymptotically biased. Our analysis\nunifies a number of earlier results on the bias of the MLE for specific anomaly\nfamilies. Next, we derive a new anomaly estimator using a mixture model, and we\nprove that our anomaly estimator is asymptotically unbiased regardless of the\nsize of the anomaly family. We illustrate the advantages of our estimator\nversus the MLE on disease outbreak and highway traffic data.",

          "description": "In this paper, we propose a highly practical fully online multi-object\ntracking and segmentation (MOTS) method that uses instance segmentation results\nas an input. The proposed method is based on the Gaussian mixture probability\nhypothesis density (GMPHD) filter, a hierarchical data association (HDA), and a\nmask-based affinity fusion (MAF) model to achieve high-performance online\ntracking. The HDA consists of two associations: segment-to-track and\ntrack-to-track associations. One affinity, for position and motion, is computed\nby using the GMPHD filter, and the other affinity, for appearance is computed\nby using the responses from a single object tracker such as a kernalized\ncorrelation filter. These two affinities are simply fused by using a\nscore-level fusion method such as min-max normalization referred to as MAF. In\naddition, to reduce the number of false positive segments, we adopt mask\nIoU-based merging (mask merging). The proposed MOTS framework with the key\nmodules: HDA, MAF, and mask merging, is easily extensible to simultaneously\ntrack multiple types of objects with CPU only execution in parallel processing.\nIn addition, the developed framework only requires simple parameter tuning\nunlike many existing MOTS methods that need intensive hyperparameter\noptimization. In the experiments on the two popular MOTS datasets, the key\nmodules show some improvements. For instance, ID-switch decreases by more than\nhalf compared to a baseline method in the training sets.

          "description": "In this work we revisit two classic high-dimensional online learning\nproblems, namely linear regression and contextual bandits, from the perspective\nof adversarial robustness. Existing works in algorithmic robust statistics make\nstrong distributional assumptions that ensure that the input data is evenly\nspread out or comes from a nice generative model. Is it possible to achieve\nstrong robustness guarantees even without distributional assumptions\naltogether, where the sequence of tasks we are asked to solve is adaptively and\nadversarially chosen?\n\nWe answer this question in the affirmative for both linear regression and\ncontextual bandits. In fact our algorithms succeed where conventional methods\nfail. In particular we show strong lower bounds against Huber regression and\nmore generally any convex M-estimator. Our approach is based on a novel\nalternating minimization scheme that interleaves ordinary least-squares with a\nsimple convex program that finds the optimal reweighting of the distribution\nunder a spectral constraint. Our results obtain essentially optimal dependence\non the contamination level $\\eta$, reach the optimal breakdown point, and\nnaturally apply to infinite dimensional settings where the feature vectors are\nrepresented implicitly via a kernel map.",

          "description": "A commonly cited inefficiency of neural network training using\nback-propagation is the update locking problem: each layer must wait for the\nsignal to propagate through the full network before updating. Several\nalternatives that can alleviate this issue have been proposed. In this context,\nwe consider a simple alternative based on minimal feedback, which we call\nDecoupled Greedy Learning (DGL). It is based on a classic greedy relaxation of\nthe joint training objective, recently shown to be effective in the context of\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on large-scale image classification. We\nconsider an optimization of this objective that permits us to decouple the\nlayer training, allowing for layers or modules in networks to be trained with a\npotentially linear parallelization. With the use of a replay buffer we show\nthat this approach can be extended to asynchronous settings, where modules can\noperate and continue to update with possibly large communication delays. To\naddress bandwidth and memory issues we propose an approach based on online\nvector quantization. This allows to drastically reduce the communication\nbandwidth between modules and required memory for replay buffers. We show\ntheoretically and empirically that this approach converges and compare it to\nthe sequential solvers.

We can then use standard optimizers to identify\nsubstantive changes in relevant decisions made with a GP.

For example, the estimated likelihood of rain on a specific\nday changes by the hour as new information becomes available. Given a\ncollection of such probability paths, we introduce a Bayesian framework --\nwhich we call the Gaussian latent information martingale, or GLIM -- for\nmodeling the structure of dynamic predictions over time. Suppose, for example,\nthat the likelihood of rain in a week is 50%, and consider two hypothetical\nscenarios.

A time-sensitive decision-maker might\nselect a course of action immediately in the latter scenario, but may postpone\ntheir decision in the former, knowing that new information is imminent. We\nmodel these trajectories by assuming predictions update according to a latent\nprocess of information flow, which is inferred from historical data. In\ncontrast to general methods for time series analysis, this approach preserves\nthe martingale structure of probability paths and better quantifies future\nuncertainties around probability paths. We show that GLIM outperforms three\npopular baseline methods, producing better estimated posterior probability path\ndistributions measured by three different metrics. By elucidating the dynamic\nstructure of predictions over time, we hope to help individuals make more\ninformed choices.",

          "description": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) paradigm is becoming mainstream in\nmultiple clinical trials and healthcare procedures. It relies on novel very\naccurate and compact sensing devices and communication infrastructures, opening\npreviously unmatched possibilities of implementing data collection and\ncontinuous patient monitoring. Nevertheless, to fully exploit the potential of\nthis technology, some steps forwards are needed. First, the edge-computing\nparadigm must be added to the picture. A certain level of near-sensor\nprocessing has to be enabled, to improve the scalability, portability,\nreliability, responsiveness of the IoMT nodes. Second, novel, increasingly\naccurate, data analysis algorithms, such as those based on artificial\nintelligence and Deep Learning, must be exploited. To reach these objectives,\ndesigners, programmers of IoMT nodes, have to face challenging optimization\ntasks, in order to execute fairly complex computing tasks on low-power wearable\nand portable processing systems, with tight power and battery lifetime budgets.\nIn this work, we explore the implementation of cognitive data analysis\nalgorithm on resource-constrained computing platforms. To minimize power\nconsumption, we add an adaptivity layer that dynamically manages the hardware\nand software configuration of the device to adapt it at runtime to the required\noperating mode. We have assessed our approach on a use-case using a\nconvolutional neural network to classify electrocardiogram (ECG) traces on a\nlow-power microcontroller. Our experimental results show that adapting the node\nsetup to the workload at runtime can save up to 50% power consumption and a\nquantized neural network reaches an accuracy value higher than 98% for\narrhythmia disorders detection on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset.",

However, there are often many different reward functions that\nexplain the human feedback, leaving agents with uncertainty over what the true\nreward function is. While most policy optimization approaches handle this\nuncertainty by optimizing for expected performance, many applications demand\nrisk-averse behavior. We derive a novel policy gradient-style robust\noptimization approach, PG-BROIL, that optimizes a soft-robust objective that\nbalances expected performance and risk. To the best of our knowledge, PG-BROIL\nis the first policy optimization algorithm robust to a distribution of reward\nhypotheses which can scale to continuous MDPs. Results suggest that PG-BROIL\ncan produce a family of behaviors ranging from risk-neutral to risk-averse and\noutperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms when learning from\nambiguous demonstrations by hedging against uncertainty, rather than seeking to\nuniquely identify the demonstrator's reward function.",

          "description": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims at learning an optimal control from\na fixed dataset, without interactions with the system. An agent in this setting\nshould avoid selecting actions whose consequences cannot be predicted from the\ndata. This is the converse of exploration in RL, which favors such actions. We\nthus take inspiration from the literature on bonus-based exploration to design\na new offline RL agent. The core idea is to subtract a prediction-based\nexploration bonus from the reward, instead of adding it for exploration. This\nallows the policy to stay close to the support of the dataset. We connect this\napproach to a more common regularization of the learned policy towards the\ndata. Instantiated with a bonus based on the prediction error of a variational\nautoencoder, we show that our agent is competitive with the state of the art on\na set of continuous control locomotion and manipulation tasks.",

However,\ntraditional methods like uniform convergence are not powerful enough to fully\nexplain generalization because they may yield vacuous bounds even in\noverparameterized linear regression regimes. An alternative solution is to\nanalyze the generalization dynamics to derive algorithm-dependent bounds, e.g.,\nstability. Unfortunately, the stability-based bound is still far from\nexplaining the remarkable generalization ability of neural networks due to the\ncoarse-grained analysis of the signal and noise. Inspired by the observation\nthat neural networks show a slow convergence rate when fitting noise, we\npropose decomposing the excess risk dynamics and applying stability-based bound\nonly on the variance part (which measures how the model performs on pure\nnoise). We provide two applications for the framework, including a linear case\n(overparameterized linear regression with gradient descent) and a non-linear\ncase (matrix recovery with gradient flow). Under the decomposition framework,\nthe new bound accords better with the theoretical and empirical evidence\ncompared to the stability-based bound and uniform convergence bound.",

Generally speaking, TD learning updates states whenever\nthey are visited. When the agent lands in a state, its value can be used to\ncompute the TD-error, which is then propagated to other states. However, it may\nbe interesting, when computing updates, to take into account other information\nthan whether a state is visited or not. For example, some states might be more\nimportant than others (such as states which are frequently seen in a successful\ntrajectory). Or, some states might have unreliable value estimates (for\nexample, due to partial observability or lack of data), making their values\nless desirable as targets.

Motivated by empirical studies that demonstrate that\ntraining with noisy labels improves generalization, we study the implicit\nregularization effect of SGD with label noise. We show that SGD with label\nnoise converges to a stationary point of a regularized loss $L(\\theta) +\\lambda\nR(\\theta)$, where $L(\\theta)$ is the training loss, $\\lambda$ is an effective\nregularization parameter depending on the step size, strength of the label\nnoise, and the batch size, and $R(\\theta)$ is an explicit regularizer that\npenalizes sharp minimizers. Our analysis uncovers an additional regularization\neffect of large learning rates beyond the linear scaling rule that penalizes\nlarge eigenvalues of the Hessian more than small ones. We also prove extensions\nto classification with general loss functions, SGD with momentum, and SGD with\ngeneral noise covariance, significantly strengthening the prior work of Blanc\net al. to global convergence and large learning rates and of HaoChen et al. to\ngeneral models.",

One type of\ngenerative model is constructed by autoregressive neural networks, which\nsequentially add nodes and edges to generate a graph. However, the likelihood\nof a graph under the autoregressive model is intractable, as there are numerous\nsequences leading to the given graph; this makes maximum likelihood estimation\nchallenging. Instead, in this work we derive the exact joint probability over\nthe graph and the node ordering of the sequential process.

We train graph generative\nmodels by maximizing this bound, without using the ad-hoc node orderings of\nprevious methods. Our experiments show that the log-likelihood bound is\nsignificantly tighter than the bound of previous schemes.

New entities, issues,\nand ideas continuously emerge, while the semantics of the existing conversation\ntopics gradually shift. In recent years, pre-trained language models like BERT\ngreatly improved the state-of-the-art for a large spectrum of content\nunderstanding tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to study how these\nlanguage models can be adapted to better handle continuously evolving web\ncontent. In our study, we first analyze the evolution of 2013 - 2019 Twitter\ndata, and unequivocally confirm that a BERT model trained on past tweets would\nheavily deteriorate when directly applied to data from later years. Then, we\ninvestigate two possible sources of the deterioration: the semantic shift of\nexisting tokens and the sub-optimal or failed understanding of new tokens. To\nthis end, we both explore two different vocabulary composition methods, as well\nas propose three sampling methods which help in efficient incremental training\nfor BERT-like models. Compared to a new model trained from scratch offline, our\nincremental training (a) reduces the training costs, (b) achieves better\nperformance on evolving content, and (c) is suitable for online deployment.

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to various fields due\nto their powerful representations of graph-structured data. Despite the success\nof GNNs, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the\nfixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic\nwhen learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph\nthat consists of various types of nodes and edges. To address this limitations,\nwe propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new\ngraph structures, which preclude noisy connections and include useful\nconnections (e.g., meta-paths) for tasks, while learning effective node\nrepresentations on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. We further propose\nenhanced version of GTNs, Fast Graph Transformer Networks (FastGTNs), that\nimprove scalability of graph transformations. Compared to GTNs, FastGTNs are\n230x faster and use 100x less memory while allowing the identical graph\ntransformations as GTNs. In addition, we extend graph transformations to the\nsemantic proximity of nodes allowing non-local operations beyond meta-paths.\nExtensive experiments on both homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs show\nthat GTNs and FastGTNs with non-local operations achieve the state-of-the-art\nperformance for node classification tasks.

Several defenses\nhave been proposed against such attacks, while many of them have been\nadaptively attacked. In this work, we aim to enhance the ML robustness from a\ndifferent perspective by leveraging domain knowledge: We propose a Knowledge\nEnhanced Machine Learning Pipeline (KEMLP) to integrate domain knowledge (i.e.,\nlogic relationships among different predictions) into a probabilistic graphical\nmodel via first-order logic rules. In particular, we develop KEMLP by\nintegrating a diverse set of weak auxiliary models based on their logical\nrelationships to the main DNN model that performs the target task.\nTheoretically, we provide convergence results and prove that, under mild\nconditions, the prediction of KEMLP is more robust than that of the main DNN\nmodel. Empirically, we take road sign recognition as an example and leverage\nthe relationships between road signs and their shapes and contents as domain\nknowledge. We show that compared with adversarial training and other baselines,\nKEMLP achieves higher robustness against physical attacks, $\\mathcal{L}_p$\nbounded attacks, unforeseen attacks, and natural corruptions under both\nwhitebox and blackbox settings, while still maintaining high clean accuracy.",

          "description": "Metric learning algorithms aim to learn a distance function that brings the\nsemantically similar data items together and keeps dissimilar ones at a\ndistance. The traditional Mahalanobis distance learning is equivalent to find a\nlinear projection. In contrast, Deep Metric Learning (DML) methods are proposed\nthat automatically extract features from data and learn a non-linear\ntransformation from input space to a semantically embedding space. Recently,\nmany DML methods are proposed focused to enhance the discrimination power of\nthe learned metric by providing novel sampling strategies or loss functions.\nThis approach is very helpful when both the training and test examples are\ncoming from the same set of categories. However, it is less effective in many\napplications of DML such as image retrieval and person-reidentification. Here,\nthe DML should learn general semantic concepts from observed classes and employ\nthem to rank or identify objects from unseen categories. Neglecting the\ngeneralization ability of the learned representation and just emphasizing to\nlearn a more discriminative embedding on the observed classes may lead to the\noverfitting problem. To address this limitation, we propose a framework to\nenhance the generalization power of existing DML methods in a Zero-Shot\nLearning (ZSL) setting by general yet discriminative representation learning\nand employing a class adversarial neural network. To learn a more general\nrepresentation, we propose to employ feature maps of intermediate layers in a\ndeep neural network and enhance their discrimination power through an attention\nmechanism. Besides, a class adversarial network is utilized to enforce the deep\nmodel to seek class invariant features for the DML task. We evaluate our work\non widely used machine vision datasets in a ZSL setting.",

          "description": "In few-shot domain adaptation (FDA), classifiers for the target domain are\ntrained with accessible labeled data in the source domain (SD) and few labeled\ndata in the target domain (TD). However, data usually contain private\ninformation in the current era, e.g., data distributed on personal phones.\nThus, the private information will be leaked if we directly access data in SD\nto train a target-domain classifier (required by FDA methods). In this paper,\nto thoroughly prevent the privacy leakage in SD, we consider a very challenging\nproblem setting, where the classifier for the TD has to be trained using few\nlabeled target data and a well-trained SD classifier, named few-shot hypothesis\nadaptation (FHA). In FHA, we cannot access data in SD, as a result, the private\ninformation in SD will be protected well. To this end, we propose a target\norientated hypothesis adaptation network (TOHAN) to solve the FHA problem,\nwhere we generate highly-compatible unlabeled data (i.e., an intermediate\ndomain) to help train a target-domain classifier. TOHAN maintains two deep\nnetworks simultaneously, where one focuses on learning an intermediate domain\nand the other takes care of the intermediate-to-target distributional\nadaptation and the target-risk minimization. Experimental results show that\nTOHAN outperforms competitive baselines significantly.",

          "description": "The use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents in practical applications\nrequires the consideration of suboptimal outcomes, depending on the familiarity\nof the agent with its environment. This is especially important in\nsafety-critical environments, where errors can lead to high costs or damage. In\ndistributional RL, the risk-sensitivity can be controlled via different\ndistortion measures of the estimated return distribution. However, these\ndistortion functions require an estimate of the risk level, which is difficult\nto obtain and depends on the current state. In this work, we demonstrate the\nsuboptimality of a static risk level estimation and propose a method to\ndynamically select risk levels at each environment step. Our method ARA\n(Automatic Risk Adaptation) estimates the appropriate risk level in both known\nand unknown environments using a Random Network Distillation error.

          "description": "Deep Q Network (DQN) firstly kicked the door of deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) via combining deep learning (DL) with reinforcement learning (RL), which\nhas noticed that the distribution of the acquired data would change during the\ntraining process. DQN found this property might cause instability for training,\nso it proposed effective methods to handle the downside of the property.\nInstead of focusing on the unfavourable aspects, we find it critical for RL to\nease the gap between the estimated data distribution and the ground truth data\ndistribution while supervised learning (SL) fails to do so. From this new\nperspective, we extend the basic paradigm of RL called the Generalized Policy\nIteration (GPI) into a more generalized version, which is called the\nGeneralized Data Distribution Iteration (GDI). We see massive RL algorithms and\ntechniques can be unified into the GDI paradigm, which can be considered as one\nof the special cases of GDI. We provide theoretical proof of why GDI is better\nthan GPI and how it works. Several practical algorithms based on GDI have been\nproposed to verify the effectiveness and extensiveness of it. Empirical\nexperiments prove our state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Arcade Learning\nEnvironment (ALE), wherein our algorithm has achieved 9620.98% mean human\nnormalized score (HNS), 1146.39% median HNS and 22 human world record\nbreakthroughs (HWRB) using only 200 training frames.

          "description": "While adversarial training is considered as a standard defense method against\nadversarial attacks for image classifiers, adversarial purification, which\npurifies attacked images into clean images with a standalone purification\nmodel, has shown promises as an alternative defense method. Recently, an\nEnergy-Based Model (EBM) trained with Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) has been\nhighlighted as a purification model, where an attacked image is purified by\nrunning a long Markov-chain using the gradients of the EBM. Yet, the\npracticality of the adversarial purification using an EBM remains questionable\nbecause the number of MCMC steps required for such purification is too large.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel adversarial purification method based on an\nEBM trained with Denoising Score-Matching (DSM). We show that an EBM trained\nwith DSM can quickly purify attacked images within a few steps. We further\nintroduce a simple yet effective randomized purification scheme that injects\nrandom noises into images before purification. This process screens the\nadversarial perturbations imposed on images by the random noises and brings the\nimages to the regime where the EBM can denoise well. We show that our\npurification method is robust against various attacks and demonstrate its\nstate-of-the-art performances.",

          "description": "In recent times, it has been shown that one can use code as data to aid\nvarious applications such as automatic commit message generation, automatic\ngeneration of pull request descriptions and automatic program repair. Take for\ninstance the problem of commit message generation. Treating source code as a\nsequence of tokens, state of the art techniques generate commit messages using\nneural machine translation models. However, they tend to ignore the syntactic\nstructure of programming languages.\n\nPrevious work, i.e., code2seq has used structural information from Abstract\nSyntax Tree (AST) to represent source code and they use it to automatically\ngenerate method names. In this paper, we elaborate upon this state of the art\napproach and modify it to represent source code edits. We determine the effect\nof using such syntactic structure for the problem of classifying code edits.\nInspired by the code2seq approach, we evaluate how using structural information\nfrom AST, i.e., paths between AST leaf nodes can help with the task of code\nedit classification on two datasets of fine-grained syntactic edits.\n\nOur experiments shows that attempts of adding syntactic structure does not\nresult in any improvements over less sophisticated methods. The results suggest\nthat techniques such as code2seq, while promising, have a long way to go before\nthey can be generically applied to learning code edit representations.

          "description": "Recent studies show a close connection between neural networks (NN) and\nkernel methods. However, most of these analyses (e.g., NTK) focus on the\ninfluence of (infinite) width instead of the depth of NN models. There remains\na gap between theory and practical network designs that benefit from the depth.\nThis paper first proposes a novel kernel family named Neural Optimization\nKernel (NOK). Our kernel is defined as the inner product between two $T$-step\nupdated functionals in RKHS w.r.t. a regularized optimization problem.\nTheoretically, we proved the monotonic descent property of our update rule for\nboth convex and non-convex problems, and a $O(1/T)$ convergence rate of our\nupdates for convex problems. Moreover, we propose a data-dependent structured\napproximation of our NOK, which builds the connection between training deep NNs\nand kernel methods associated with NOK. The resultant computational graph is a\nResNet-type finite width NN. Our structured approximation preserved the\nmonotonic descent property and $O(1/T)$ convergence rate. Namely, a $T$-layer\nNN performs $T$-step monotonic descent updates. Notably, we show our\n$T$-layered structured NN with ReLU maintains a $O(1/T)$ convergence rate\nw.r.t. a convex regularized problem, which explains the success of ReLU on\ntraining deep NN from a NN architecture optimization perspective. For the\nunsupervised learning and the shared parameter case, we show the equivalence of\ntraining structured NN with GD and performing functional gradient descent in\nRKHS associated with a fixed (data-dependent) NOK at an infinity-width regime.\nFor finite NOKs, we prove generalization bounds. Remarkably, we show that\noverparameterized deep NN (NOK) can increase the expressive power to reduce\nempirical risk and reduce the generalization bound at the same time. Extensive\nexperiments verify the robustness of our structured NOK blocks.",

          "description": "Clustering is one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision and pattern\nrecognition. Recently, deep clustering methods (algorithms based on deep\nlearning) have attracted wide attention with their impressive performance. Most\nof these algorithms combine deep unsupervised representation learning and\nstandard clustering together. However, the separation of representation\nlearning and clustering will lead to suboptimal solutions because the two-stage\nstrategy prevents representation learning from adapting to subsequent tasks\n(e.g., clustering according to specific cues). To overcome this issue, efforts\nhave been made in the dynamic adaption of representation and cluster\nassignment, whereas current state-of-the-art methods suffer from heuristically\nconstructed objectives with representation and cluster assignment alternatively\noptimized. To further standardize the clustering problem, we audaciously\nformulate the objective of clustering as finding a precise feature as the cue\nfor cluster assignment. Based on this, we propose a general-purpose deep\nclustering framework which radically integrates representation learning and\nclustering into a single pipeline for the first time. The proposed framework\nexploits the powerful ability of recently developed generative models for\nlearning intrinsic features, and imposes an entropy minimization on the\ndistribution of the cluster assignment by a dedicated variational algorithm.\nExperimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is\nsuperior, or at least comparable to, the state-of-the-art methods on the\nhandwritten digit recognition, fashion recognition, face recognition and object\nrecognition benchmark datasets.",

          "description": "Unsupervised representation learning has recently received lots of interest\ndue to its powerful generalizability through effectively leveraging large-scale\nunlabeled data. There are two prevalent approaches for this, contrastive\nlearning and generative pre-training, where the former learns representations\nfrom instance-wise discrimination tasks and the latter learns them from\nestimating the likelihood. These seemingly orthogonal approaches have their own\nstrengths and weaknesses. Contrastive learning tends to extract semantic\ninformation and discards details irrelevant for classifying objects, making the\nrepresentations effective for discriminative tasks while degrading robustness\nto out-of-distribution data. On the other hand, the generative pre-training\ndirectly estimates the data distribution, so the representations tend to be\nrobust but not optimal for discriminative tasks. In this paper, we show that we\ncould achieve the best of both worlds by a hybrid training scheme.\nSpecifically, we demonstrated that a transformer-based encoder-decoder\narchitecture trained with both contrastive and generative losses can learn\nhighly discriminative and robust representations without hurting the generative\nperformance.

When\napplied to semi-supervised node classification, GNNs are widely believed to\nwork well due to the homophily assumption (``like attracts like''), and fail to\ngeneralize to heterophilous graphs where dissimilar nodes connect. Recent works\ndesign new architectures to overcome such heterophily-related limitations,\nciting poor baseline performance and new architecture improvements on a few\nheterophilous graph benchmark datasets as evidence for this notion. In our\nexperiments, we empirically find that standard graph convolutional networks\n(GCNs) can actually achieve better performance than such carefully designed\nmethods on some commonly used heterophilous graphs. This motivates us to\nreconsider whether homophily is truly necessary for good GNN performance. We\nfind that this claim is not quite true, and in fact, GCNs can achieve strong\nperformance on heterophilous graphs under certain conditions. Our work\ncarefully characterizes these conditions, and provides supporting theoretical\nunderstanding and empirical observations. Finally, we examine existing\nheterophilous graphs benchmarks and reconcile how the GCN (under)performs on\nthem based on this understanding.",

In this paper, we implement a new loss\nfunction based on metric learning to learn the distance relationship from each\nclass centroid in feature space for the binary classification model. The\nproposed multi-task learning of the binary classification and the metric\nlearning makes it possible to build the feature space where the within-class\nvariance is minimized and the between-class variance is maximized while keeping\nnormal and anomalous classes linearly separable. We also investigate the\neffectiveness of additionally using anomalous sound data for further improving\nthe binary classification model.

          "description": "In this paper we present the results of our experiments in training and\ndeploying a self-supervised retrieval-based chatbot trained with contrastive\nlearning for assisting customer support agents. In contrast to most existing\nresearch papers in this area where the focus is on solving just one component\nof a deployable chatbot, we present an end-to-end set of solutions to take the\nreader from an unlabelled chatlogs to a deployed chatbot. This set of solutions\nincludes creating a self-supervised dataset and a weakly labelled dataset from\nchatlogs, as well as a systematic approach to selecting a fixed list of canned\nresponses. We present a hierarchical-based RNN architecture for the response\nselection model, chosen for its ability to cache intermediate utterance\nembeddings, which helped to meet deployment inference speed requirements. We\ncompare the performance of this architecture across 3 different learning\nobjectives: self-supervised contrastive learning, binary classification, and\nmulti-class classification. We find that using a self-supervised contrastive\nlearning model outperforms training the binary and multi-class classification\nmodels on a weakly labelled dataset. Our results validate that the\nself-supervised contrastive learning approach can be effectively used for a\nreal-world chatbot scenario.",

          "description": "Many machine learning tasks involve subpopulation shift where the testing\ndata distribution is a subpopulation of the training distribution. For such\nsettings, a line of recent work has proposed the use of a variant of empirical\nrisk minimization(ERM) known as distributionally robust optimization (DRO). In\nthis work, we apply DRO to real, large-scale tasks with subpopulation shift,\nand observe that DRO performs relatively poorly, and moreover has severe\ninstability. We identify one direct cause of this phenomenon: sensitivity of\nDRO to outliers in the datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose the\nframework of DORO, for Distributional and Outlier Robust Optimization. At the\ncore of this approach is a refined risk function which prevents DRO from\noverfitting to potential outliers. We instantiate DORO for the Cressie-Read\nfamily of R\\'enyi divergence, and delve into two specific instances of this\nfamily: CVaR and $\\chi^2$-DRO. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of the\nproposed method, and empirically show that DORO improves the performance and\nstability of DRO with experiments on large modern datasets, thereby positively\naddressing the open question raised by Hashimoto et al., 2018.",

Herein, we propose a coordinate ascent algorithm for\nSBL termed Relevance Matching Pursuit (RMP) and show that, as its noise\nvariance parameter goes to zero, RMP exhibits a surprising connection to\nStepwise Regression. Further, we derive novel guarantees for Stepwise\nRegression algorithms, which also shed light on RMP. Our guarantees for Forward\nRegression improve on deterministic and probabilistic results for Orthogonal\nMatching Pursuit with noise. Our analysis of Backward Regression on determined\nsystems culminates in a bound on the residual of the optimal solution to the\nsubset selection problem that, if satisfied, guarantees the optimality of the\nresult. To our knowledge, this bound is the first that can be computed in\npolynomial time and depends chiefly on the smallest singular value of the\nmatrix.

          "description": "Recent works have shown that deep neural networks benefit from multi-task\nlearning by learning a shared representation across several related tasks.\nHowever, performance of such systems depend on relative weighting between\nvarious losses involved during training. Prior works on loss weighting schemes\nassume that instances are equally easy or hard for all tasks. In order to break\nthis assumption, we let the training process dictate the optimal weighting of\ntasks for every instance in the dataset. More specifically, we equip every\ninstance in the dataset with a set of learnable parameters (instance-level task\nparameters) where the cardinality is equal to the number of tasks learned by\nthe model. These parameters model the weighting of each task for an instance.\nThey are updated by gradient descent and do not require hand-crafted rules. We\nconduct extensive experiments on SURREAL and CityScapes datasets, for human\nshape and pose estimation, depth estimation and semantic segmentation tasks. In\nthese tasks, our approach outperforms recent dynamic loss weighting approaches,\ne.g. reducing surface estimation errors by 8.97% on SURREAL. When applied to\ndatasets where one or more tasks can have noisy annotations, the proposed\nmethod learns to prioritize learning from clean labels for a given task, e.g.\nreducing surface estimation errors by up to 60%. We also show that we can\nreliably detect corrupt labels for a given task as a by-product from learned\ninstance-level task parameters.",

In the overparameterized setting, we prove\nthat the error converges to zero exponentially fast, and also that\nregularization is necessary in order for the parameters to become aligned with\nthe random backpropagation weights. Simulations are given that are consistent\nwith this analysis and suggest further generalizations. These results\ncontribute to our understanding of how biologically plausible algorithms might\ncarry out weight learning in a manner different from Hebbian learning, with\nperformance that is comparable with the full non-local backpropagation\nalgorithm.",

          "description": "In recent years, many incidents have been reported where machine learning\nmodels exhibited discrimination among people based on race, sex, age, etc.\nResearch has been conducted to measure and mitigate unfairness in machine\nlearning models. For a machine learning task, it is a common practice to build\na pipeline that includes an ordered set of data preprocessing stages followed\nby a classifier. However, most of the research on fairness has considered a\nsingle classifier based prediction task. What are the fairness impacts of the\npreprocessing stages in machine learning pipeline? Furthermore, studies showed\nthat often the root cause of unfairness is ingrained in the data itself, rather\nthan the model. But no research has been conducted to measure the unfairness\ncaused by a specific transformation made in the data preprocessing stage. In\nthis paper, we introduced the causal method of fairness to reason about the\nfairness impact of data preprocessing stages in ML pipeline. We leveraged\nexisting metrics to define the fairness measures of the stages. Then we\nconducted a detailed fairness evaluation of the preprocessing stages in 37\npipelines collected from three different sources. Our results show that certain\ndata transformers are causing the model to exhibit unfairness. We identified a\nnumber of fairness patterns in several categories of data transformers.\nFinally, we showed how the local fairness of a preprocessing stage composes in\nthe global fairness of the pipeline.

The new techniques are evaluated on MNIST and\nFashion-MNIST, with no adversarial training. The MNIST classifier has 99%\nnatural accuracy, 70% measured robustness and 36.9% provable robustness, within\nL2 distance of 2. The Fashion-MNIST classifier has 90% natural accuracy, 54.5%\nmeasured robustness and 28.2% provable robustness, within L2 distance of 1.5.\nBoth results are new state of the art, and we also present new state-of-the-art\nbinary results on challenging label-pairs.",

          "description": "Recursive Neural Networks (RvNNs), which compose sequences according to their\nunderlying hierarchical syntactic structure, have performed well in several\nnatural language processing tasks compared to similar models without structural\nbiases. However, traditional RvNNs are incapable of inducing the latent\nstructure in a plain text sequence on their own. Several extensions have been\nproposed to overcome this limitation. Nevertheless, these extensions tend to\nrely on surrogate gradients or reinforcement learning at the cost of higher\nbias or variance. In this work, we propose Continuous Recursive Neural Network\n(CRvNN) as a backpropagation-friendly alternative to address the aforementioned\nlimitations. This is done by incorporating a continuous relaxation to the\ninduced structure. We demonstrate that CRvNN achieves strong performance in\nchallenging synthetic tasks such as logical inference and ListOps. We also show\nthat CRvNN performs comparably or better than prior latent structure models on\nreal-world tasks such as sentiment analysis and natural language inference.",

          "description": "Today's advanced Reinforcement Learning algorithms produce black-box\npolicies, that are often difficult to interpret and trust for a person. We\nintroduce a policy distilling algorithm, building on the CN2 rule mining\nalgorithm, that distills the policy into a rule-based decision system. At the\ncore of our approach is the fact that an RL process does not just learn a\npolicy, a mapping from states to actions, but also produces extra\nmeta-information, such as action values indicating the quality of alternative\nactions. This meta-information can indicate whether more than one action is\nnear-optimal for a certain state. We extend CN2 to make it able to leverage\nknowledge about equally-good actions to distill the policy into fewer rules,\nincreasing its interpretability by a person. Then, to ensure that the rules\nexplain a valid, non-degenerate policy, we introduce a refinement algorithm\nthat fine-tunes the rules to obtain good performance when executed in the\nenvironment. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm on the Mario AI\nbenchmark, a complex task that requires modern reinforcement learning\nalgorithms including neural networks. The explanations we produce capture the\nlearned policy in only a few rules, that allow a person to understand what the\nblack-box agent learned.

          "description": "Sparse adversarial attacks can fool deep neural networks (DNNs) by only\nperturbing a few pixels (regularized by l_0 norm). Recent efforts combine it\nwith another l_infty imperceptible on the perturbation magnitudes. The\nresultant sparse and imperceptible attacks are practically relevant, and\nindicate an even higher vulnerability of DNNs that we usually imagined.\nHowever, such attacks are more challenging to generate due to the optimization\ndifficulty by coupling the l_0 regularizer and box constraints with a\nnon-convex objective. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a\nhomotopy algorithm, to jointly tackle the sparsity and the perturbation bound\nin one unified framework. Each iteration, the main step of our algorithm is to\noptimize an l_0-regularized adversarial loss, by leveraging the nonmonotone\nAccelerated Proximal Gradient Method (nmAPG) for nonconvex programming; it is\nfollowed by an l_0 change control step, and an optional post-attack step\ndesigned to escape bad local minima. We also extend the algorithm to handling\nthe structural sparsity regularizer. We extensively examine the effectiveness\nof our proposed homotopy attack for both targeted and non-targeted attack\nscenarios, on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, our homotopy attack leads to significantly fewer perturbations, e.g.,\nreducing 42.91% on CIFAR-10 and 75.03% on ImageNet (average case, targeted\nattack), at similar maximal perturbation magnitudes, when still achieving 100%\nattack success rates.

          "description": "Motivated by the vast success of deep convolutional networks, there is a\ngreat interest in generalizing convolutions to non-Euclidean manifolds. A major\ncomplication in comparison to flat spaces is that it is unclear in which\nalignment a convolution kernel should be applied on a manifold. The underlying\nreason for this ambiguity is that general manifolds do not come with a\ncanonical choice of reference frames (gauge). Kernels and features therefore\nhave to be expressed relative to arbitrary coordinates. We argue that the\nparticular choice of coordinatization should not affect a network's inference\n-- it should be coordinate independent. A simultaneous demand for coordinate\nindependence and weight sharing is shown to result in a requirement on the\nnetwork to be equivariant under local gauge transformations (changes of local\nreference frames). The ambiguity of reference frames depends thereby on the\nG-structure of the manifold, such that the necessary level of gauge\nequivariance is prescribed by the corresponding structure group G. Coordinate\nindependent convolutions are proven to be equivariant w.r.t. those isometries\nthat are symmetries of the G-structure. The resulting theory is formulated in a\ncoordinate free fashion in terms of fiber bundles. To exemplify the design of\ncoordinate independent convolutions, we implement a convolutional network on\nthe M\\\"obius strip. The generality of our differential geometric formulation of\nconvolutional networks is demonstrated by an extensive literature review which\nexplains a large number of Euclidean CNNs, spherical CNNs and CNNs on general\nsurfaces as specific instances of coordinate independent convolutions.",

          "description": "Effective molecular representation learning is of great importance to\nfacilitate molecular property prediction, which is a fundamental task for the\ndrug and material industry. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs)\nhave shown great promise in applying GNNs for molecular representation\nlearning. Moreover, a few recent studies have also demonstrated successful\napplications of self-supervised learning methods to pre-train the GNNs to\novercome the problem of insufficient labeled molecules. However, existing GNNs\nand pre-training strategies usually treat molecules as topological graph data\nwithout fully utilizing the molecular geometry information. Whereas, the\nthree-dimensional (3D) spatial structure of a molecule, a.k.a molecular\ngeometry, is one of the most critical factors for determining molecular\nphysical, chemical, and biological properties. To this end, we propose a novel\nGeometry Enhanced Molecular representation learning method (GEM) for Chemical\nRepresentation Learning (ChemRL). At first, we design a geometry-based GNN\narchitecture that simultaneously models atoms, bonds, and bond angles in a\nmolecule. To be specific, we devised double graphs for a molecule: The first\none encodes the atom-bond relations; The second one encodes bond-angle\nrelations. Moreover, on top of the devised GNN architecture, we propose several\nnovel geometry-level self-supervised learning strategies to learn spatial\nknowledge by utilizing the local and global molecular 3D structures. We compare\nChemRL-GEM with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on different\nmolecular benchmarks and exhibit that ChemRL-GEM can significantly outperform\nall baselines in both regression and classification tasks. For example, the\nexperimental results show an overall improvement of $8.8\\%$ on average compared\nto SOTA baselines on the regression tasks, demonstrating the superiority of the\nproposed method.",

          "description": "The sequential patterns within the user interactions are pivotal for\nrepresenting the user's preference and capturing latent relationships among\nitems. The recent advancements of sequence modeling by Transformers advocate\nthe community to devise more effective encoders for the sequential\nrecommendation. Most existing sequential methods assume users are\ndeterministic. However, item-item transitions might fluctuate significantly in\nseveral item aspects and exhibit randomness of user interests. This\n\\textit{stochastic characteristics} brings up a solid demand to include\nuncertainties in representing sequences and items. Additionally, modeling\nsequences and items with uncertainties expands users' and items' interaction\nspaces, thus further alleviating cold-start problems.\n\nIn this work, we propose a Distribution-based Transformer for Sequential\nRecommendation (DT4SR), which injects uncertainties into sequential modeling.\nWe use Elliptical Gaussian distributions to describe items and sequences with\nuncertainty. We describe the uncertainty in items and sequences as Elliptical\nGaussian distribution. And we adopt Wasserstein distance to measure the\nsimilarity between distributions. We devise two novel Trans-formers for\nmodeling mean and covariance, which guarantees the positive-definite property\nof distributions. The proposed method significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The experiments on three benchmark datasets also\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in alleviating cold-start issues.

However, many researches have pointed out that the\ninsufficiency of the neural network extraction on image features may bring the\ndeteriorating of newly reconstructed image. On the other hand, the generated\npictures are sometimes too artificial because of over-smoothing. In order to\nsolve the above problems, we propose a novel self-calibrated convolutional\ngenerative adversarial networks. The generator consists of feature extraction\nand image reconstruction. Feature extraction uses self-calibrated convolutions,\nwhich contains four portions, and each portion has specific functions. It can\nnot only expand the range of receptive fields, but also obtain long-range\nspatial and inter-channel dependencies. Then image reconstruction is performed,\nand finally a super-resolution image is reconstructed.

          "description": "Thoracic disease detection from chest radiographs using deep learning methods\nhas been an active area of research in the last decade. Most previous methods\nattempt to focus on the diseased organs of the image by identifying spatial\nregions responsible for significant contributions to the model's prediction. In\ncontrast, expert radiologists first locate the prominent anatomical structures\nbefore determining if those regions are anomalous. Therefore, integrating\nanatomical knowledge within deep learning models could bring substantial\nimprovement in automatic disease classification. This work proposes an\nanatomy-aware attention-based architecture named Anatomy X-Net, that\nprioritizes the spatial features guided by the pre-identified anatomy regions.\nWe leverage a semi-supervised learning method using the JSRT dataset containing\norgan-level annotation to obtain the anatomical segmentation masks (for lungs\nand heart) for the NIH and CheXpert datasets. The proposed Anatomy X-Net uses\nthe pre-trained DenseNet-121 as the backbone network with two corresponding\nstructured modules, the Anatomy Aware Attention (AAA) and Probabilistic\nWeighted Average Pooling (PWAP), in a cohesive framework for anatomical\nattention learning. Our proposed method sets new state-of-the-art performance\non the official NIH test set with an AUC score of 0.8439, proving the efficacy\nof utilizing the anatomy segmentation knowledge to improve the thoracic disease\nclassification. Furthermore, the Anatomy X-Net yields an averaged AUC of 0.9020\non the Stanford CheXpert dataset, improving on existing methods that\ndemonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework.",

          "description": "Recent work on speech self-supervised learning (speech SSL) demonstrated the\nbenefits of scale in learning rich and transferable representations for\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with limited parallel data. It is then\nnatural to investigate the existence of sparse and transferrable subnetworks in\npre-trained speech SSL models that can achieve even better low-resource ASR\nperformance. However, directly applying widely adopted pruning methods such as\nthe Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) is suboptimal in the computational cost\nneeded. Moreover, contrary to what LTH predicts, the discovered subnetworks\nyield minimal performance gain compared to the original dense network. In this\nwork, we propose Prune-Adjust- Re-Prune (PARP), which discovers and finetunes\nsubnetworks for much better ASR performance, while only requiring a single\ndownstream finetuning run. PARP is inspired by our surprising observation that\nsubnetworks pruned for pre-training tasks only needed to be slightly adjusted\nto achieve a sizeable performance boost in downstream ASR tasks. Extensive\nexperiments on low-resource English and multi-lingual ASR show (1) sparse\nsubnetworks exist in pre-trained speech SSL, and (2) the computational\nadvantage and performance gain of PARP over baseline pruning methods. On the\n10min Librispeech split without LM decoding, PARP discovers subnetworks from\nwav2vec 2.0 with an absolute 10.9%/12.6% WER decrease compared to the full\nmodel. We demonstrate PARP mitigates performance degradation in cross-lingual\nmask transfer, and investigate the possibility of discovering a single\nsubnetwork for 10 spoken languages in one run.",

In this work, we release a 78 hour ASR\ndataset for Sanskrit, which faithfully captures several of the linguistic\ncharacteristics expressed by the language. We investigate the role of different\nacoustic model and language model units in ASR systems for Sanskrit. We also\npropose a new modelling unit, inspired by the syllable level unit selection,\nthat captures character sequences from one vowel in the word to the next vowel.\nWe also highlight the importance of choosing graphemic representations for\nSanskrit and show the impact of this choice on word error rates (WER). Finally,\nwe extend these insights from Sanskrit ASR for building ASR systems in two\nother Indic languages, Gujarati and Telugu.

          "description": "Fetoscopy laser photocoagulation is a widely used procedure for the treatment\nof Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS), that occur in mono-chorionic\nmultiple pregnancies due to placental vascular anastomoses. This procedure is\nparticularly challenging due to limited field of view, poor manoeuvrability of\nthe fetoscope, poor visibility due to fluid turbidity, variability in light\nsource, and unusual position of the placenta. This may lead to increased\nprocedural time and incomplete ablation, resulting in persistent TTTS.\nComputer-assisted intervention may help overcome these challenges by expanding\nthe fetoscopic field of view through video mosaicking and providing better\nvisualization of the vessel network. However, the research and development in\nthis domain remain limited due to unavailability of high-quality data to encode\nthe intra- and inter-procedure variability. Through the Fetoscopic Placental\nVessel Segmentation and Registration (FetReg) challenge, we present a\nlarge-scale multi-centre dataset for the development of generalized and robust\nsemantic segmentation and video mosaicking algorithms for the fetal environment\nwith a focus on creating drift-free mosaics from long duration fetoscopy\nvideos. In this paper, we provide an overview of the FetReg dataset, challenge\ntasks, evaluation metrics and baseline methods for both segmentation and\nregistration.

          "description": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular tool in training large-scale\nmachine learning models. Its performance, however, is highly variable,\ndepending crucially on the choice of the step sizes. Accordingly, a variety of\nstrategies for tuning the step sizes have been proposed, ranging from\ncoordinate-wise approaches (a.k.a. ``adaptive'' step sizes) to sophisticated\nheuristics to change the step size in each iteration. In this paper, we study\ntwo step size schedules whose power has been repeatedly confirmed in practice:\nthe exponential and the cosine step sizes. For the first time, we provide\ntheoretical support for them proving convergence rates for smooth non-convex\nfunctions, with and without the Polyak-\\L{}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. Moreover,\nwe show the surprising property that these two strategies are \\emph{adaptive}\nto the noise level in the stochastic gradients of PL functions. That is,\ncontrary to polynomial step sizes, they achieve almost optimal performance\nwithout needing to know the noise level nor tuning their hyperparameters based\non it. Finally, we conduct a fair and comprehensive empirical evaluation of\nreal-world datasets with deep learning architectures. Results show that, even\nif only requiring at most two hyperparameters to tune, these two strategies\nbest or match the performance of various finely-tuned state-of-the-art\nstrategies.",

          "description": "The advantages of event-sensing over conventional sensors (e.g., higher\ndynamic range, lower time latency, and lower power consumption) have spurred\nresearch into machine learning for event data. Unsurprisingly, deep learning\nhas emerged as a competitive methodology for learning with event sensors; in\ntypical setups, discrete and asynchronous events are first converted into\nframe-like tensors on which standard deep networks can be applied. However,\nover-fitting remains a challenge, particularly since event datasets remain\nsmall relative to conventional datasets (e.g., ImageNet). In this paper, we\nintroduce EventDrop, a new method for augmenting asynchronous event data to\nimprove the generalization of deep models. By dropping events selected with\nvarious strategies, we are able to increase the diversity of training data\n(e.g., to simulate various levels of occlusion). From a practical perspective,\nEventDrop is simple to implement and computationally low-cost.

          "description": "Meta-learning has proven to be a powerful paradigm for transferring the\nknowledge from previous tasks to facilitate the learning of a novel task.\nCurrent dominant algorithms train a well-generalized model initialization which\nis adapted to each task via the support set. The crux lies in optimizing the\ngeneralization capability of the initialization, which is measured by the\nperformance of the adapted model on the query set of each task. Unfortunately,\nthis generalization measure, evidenced by empirical results, pushes the\ninitialization to overfit the meta-training tasks, which significantly impairs\nthe generalization and adaptation to novel tasks. To address this issue, we\nactively augment a meta-training task with \"more data\" when evaluating the\ngeneralization. Concretely, we propose two task augmentation methods, including\nMetaMix and Channel Shuffle. MetaMix linearly combines features and labels of\nsamples from both the support and query sets. For each class of samples,\nChannel Shuffle randomly replaces a subset of their channels with the\ncorresponding ones from a different class. Theoretical studies show how task\naugmentation improves the generalization of meta-learning.

Current DL research has investigated how uncertainties of\npredictions can be quantified, and in this article, we evaluate the potential\nof these methods for safe, automotive radar perception. In particular we\nevaluate how uncertainty quantification can support radar perception under (1)\ndomain shift, (2) corruptions of input signals, and (3) in the presence of\nunknown objects. We find that in agreement with phenomena observed in the\nliterature,deep radar classifiers are overly confident, even in their wrong\npredictions. This raises concerns about the use of the confidence values for\ndecision making under uncertainty, as the model fails to notify when it cannot\nhandle an unknown situation. Accurate confidence values would allow optimal\nintegration of multiple information sources, e.g. via sensor fusion. We show\nthat by applying state-of-the-art post-hoc uncertainty calibration, the quality\nof confidence measures can be significantly improved,thereby partially\nresolving the over-confidence problem. Our investigation shows that further\nresearch into training and calibrating DL networks is necessary and offers\ngreat potential for safe automotive object classification with radar sensors.",

To address these challenges, several\nprivacy-preserving and verifiable inference techniques have been proposed based\non replacing the non-polynomial activation functions such as the rectified\nlinear unit (ReLU) function with polynomial activation functions. Such\ntechniques usually require polynomials with integer coefficients or polynomials\nover finite fields. Motivated by such requirements, several works proposed\nreplacing the ReLU activation function with the square activation function. In\nthis work, we empirically show that the square function is not the best\ndegree-$2$ polynomial that can replace the ReLU function even when restricting\nthe polynomials to have integer coefficients.

We show that our proposed\nestimators achieve an improved sample complexity, both (a) theoretically, by\nreaching new state-of-the-art upper bounds for recovery guarantees, and (b)\nempirically, by showing sharper phase transitions between poor and full\nrecovery for graph topologies studied in the literature, when compared to their\nL1-based state-of-the-art methods.",

Such complex tasks can be decomposed\ninto sub-tasks that are accomplishable by different robots concurrently or\nsequentially for better efficiency. While previous reinforcement learning\napproaches primarily focus on modeling the compositionality of sub-tasks, two\nfundamental issues are largely ignored particularly when learning cooperative\nstrategies for two robots: (i) domination, i.e., one robot may try to solve a\ntask by itself and leaves the other idle; (ii) conflict, i.e., one robot can\neasily interrupt another's workspace when executing different sub-tasks\nsimultaneously. To tackle these two issues, we propose a novel technique called\ndisentangled attention, which provides an intrinsic regularization for two\nrobots to focus on separate sub-tasks and objects.

          "description": "Backdoor attacks aim to mislead machine-learning models to output an\nattacker-specified class when presented a specific trigger at test time. These\nattacks require poisoning the training data or compromising the learning\nalgorithm, e.g., by injecting poisoning samples containing the trigger into the\ntraining set, along with the desired class label. Despite the increasing number\nof studies on backdoor attacks and defenses, the underlying factors affecting\nthe success of backdoor attacks, along with their impact on the learning\nalgorithm, are not yet well understood. In this work, we aim to shed light on\nthis issue. In particular, we unveil that backdoor attacks work by inducing a\nsmoother decision function around the triggered samples -- a phenomenon which\nwe refer to as \\textit{backdoor smoothing}. We quantify backdoor smoothing by\ndefining a measure that evaluates the uncertainty associated to the predictions\nof a classifier around the input samples.\n\nOur experiments show that smoothness increases when the trigger is added to\nthe input samples, and that the phenomenon is more pronounced for more\nsuccessful attacks.\n\nHowever, our experiments also show that patterns fulfilling backdoor\nsmoothing can be crafted\n\neven without poisoning the training data.\n\nAlthough our measure may not be directly exploited as a defense mechanism, it\nunveils an important phenomenon which may pave the way towards understanding\nthe limitations of current defenses that rely on a smooth decision output for\nbackdoors.",

          "description": "Estimating the probability of rare failure events is an essential step in the\nreliability assessment of engineering systems. Computing this failure\nprobability for complex non-linear systems is challenging, and has recently\nspurred the development of active-learning reliability methods. These methods\napproximate the limit-state function (LSF) using surrogate models trained with\na sequentially enriched set of model evaluations. A recently proposed method\ncalled stochastic spectral embedding (SSE) aims to improve the local\napproximation accuracy of global, spectral surrogate modelling techniques by\nsequentially embedding local residual expansions in subdomains of the input\nspace. In this work we apply SSE to the LSF, giving rise to a stochastic\nspectral embedding-based reliability (SSER) method. The resulting partition of\nthe input space decomposes the failure probability into a set of\neasy-to-compute domain-wise failure probabilities. We propose a set of\nmodifications that tailor the algorithm to efficiently solve rare event\nestimation problems. These modifications include specialized refinement domain\nselection, partitioning and enrichment strategies. We showcase the algorithm\nperformance on four benchmark problems of various dimensionality and complexity\nin the LSF.",

          "description": "When in a new situation or geographical location, human drivers have an\nextraordinary ability to watch others and learn maneuvers that they themselves\nmay have never performed. In contrast, existing techniques for learning to\ndrive preclude such a possibility as they assume direct access to an\ninstrumented ego-vehicle with fully known observations and expert driver\nactions. However, such measurements cannot be directly accessed for the non-ego\nvehicles when learning by watching others. Therefore, in an application where\ndata is regarded as a highly valuable asset, current approaches completely\ndiscard the vast portion of the training data that can be potentially obtained\nthrough indirect observation of surrounding vehicles. Motivated by this key\ninsight, we propose the Learning by Watching (LbW) framework which enables\nlearning a driving policy without requiring full knowledge of neither the state\nnor expert actions. To increase its data, i.e., with new perspectives and\nmaneuvers, LbW makes use of the demonstrations of other vehicles in a given\nscene by (1) transforming the ego-vehicle's observations to their points of\nview, and (2) inferring their expert actions. Our LbW agent learns more robust\ndriving policies while enabling data-efficient learning, including quick\nadaptation of the policy to rare and novel scenarios. In particular, LbW drives\nrobustly even with a fraction of available driving data required by existing\nmethods, achieving an average success rate of 92% on the original CARLA\nbenchmark with only 30 minutes of total driving data and 82% with only 10\nminutes.",

          "description": "The success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision is\nmainly driven by their strong inductive bias, which is strong enough to allow\nCNNs to solve vision-related tasks with random weights, meaning without\nlearning. Similarly, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has a strong inductive bias\ntowards storing information over time. However, many real-world systems are\ngoverned by conservation laws, which lead to the redistribution of particular\nquantities -- e.g. in physical and economical systems. Our novel\nMass-Conserving LSTM (MC-LSTM) adheres to these conservation laws by extending\nthe inductive bias of LSTM to model the redistribution of those stored\nquantities. MC-LSTMs set a new state-of-the-art for neural arithmetic units at\nlearning arithmetic operations, such as addition tasks, which have a strong\nconservation law, as the sum is constant over time. Further, MC-LSTM is applied\nto traffic forecasting, modelling a pendulum, and a large benchmark dataset in\nhydrology, where it sets a new state-of-the-art for predicting peak flows. In\nthe hydrology example, we show that MC-LSTM states correlate with real-world\nprocesses and are therefore interpretable.",

          "description": "Thanks to their practical efficiency and random nature of the data,\nstochastic first-order methods are standard for training large-scale machine\nlearning models. Random behavior may cause a particular run of an algorithm to\nresult in a highly suboptimal objective value, whereas theoretical guarantees\nare usually proved for the expectation of the objective value. Thus, it is\nessential to theoretically guarantee that algorithms provide small objective\nresidual with high probability. Existing methods for non-smooth stochastic\nconvex optimization have complexity bounds with the dependence on the\nconfidence level that is either negative-power or logarithmic but under an\nadditional assumption of sub-Gaussian (light-tailed) noise distribution that\nmay not hold in practice, e.g., in several NLP tasks. In our paper, we resolve\nthis issue and derive the first high-probability convergence results with\nlogarithmic dependence on the confidence level for non-smooth convex stochastic\noptimization problems with non-sub-Gaussian (heavy-tailed) noise. To derive our\nresults, we propose novel stepsize rules for two stochastic methods with\ngradient clipping. Moreover, our analysis works for generalized smooth\nobjectives with H\\\"older-continuous gradients, and for both methods, we provide\nan extension for strongly convex problems. Finally, our results imply that the\nfirst (accelerated) method we consider also has optimal iteration and oracle\ncomplexity in all the regimes, and the second one is optimal in the non-smooth\nsetting.",

We empirically verify on images that the\nrepresentations are indeed equivariant to input translations and rotations, and\nthus generalise well to unseen positions and orientations.

          "description": "We consider counterfactual explanations for private support vector machines\n(SVM), where the privacy mechanism that publicly releases the classifier\nguarantees differential privacy. While privacy preservation is essential when\ndealing with sensitive data, there is a consequent degradation in the\nclassification accuracy due to the introduced perturbations in the classifier\nweights. For such classifiers, counterfactual explanations need to be robust\nagainst the uncertainties in the SVM weights in order to ensure, with high\nconfidence, that the classification of the data instance to be explained is\ndifferent than its explanation. We model the uncertainties in the SVM weights\nthrough a random vector, and formulate the explanation problem as an\noptimization problem with probabilistic constraint. Subsequently, we\ncharacterize the problem's deterministic equivalent and study its solution. For\nlinear SVMs, the problem is a convex second-order cone program. For non-linear\nSVMs, the problem is non-convex. Thus, we propose a sub-optimal solution that\nis based on the bisection method. The results show that, contrary to non-robust\nexplanations, the quality of explanations from the robust solution degrades\nwith increasing privacy in order to guarantee a prespecified confidence level\nfor correct classifications.",

          "description": "Accurate detection and classification of online hate is a difficult task.\nImplicit hate is particularly challenging as such content tends to have unusual\nsyntax, polysemic words, and fewer markers of prejudice (e.g., slurs). This\nproblem is heightened with multimodal content, such as memes (combinations of\ntext and images), as they are often harder to decipher than unimodal content\n(e.g., text alone). This paper evaluates the role of semantic and multimodal\ncontext for detecting implicit and explicit hate. We show that both text- and\nvisual- enrichment improves model performance, with the multimodal model\n(0.771) outperforming other models' F1 scores (0.544, 0.737, and 0.754). While\nthe unimodal-text context-aware (transformer) model was the most accurate on\nthe subtask of implicit hate detection, the multimodal model outperformed it\noverall because of a lower propensity towards false positives. We find that all\nmodels perform better on content with full annotator agreement and that\nmultimodal models are best at classifying the content where annotators\ndisagree. To conduct these investigations, we undertook high-quality annotation\nof a sample of 5,000 multimodal entries. Tweets were annotated for primary\ncategory, modality, and strategy.

In this work, we\npresent Fair Normalizing Flows (FNF), a new approach offering more rigorous\nfairness guarantees for learned representations.

The key idea is to model the encoder as a normalizing flow trained to\nminimize the statistical distance between the latent representations of\ndifferent groups. The main advantage of FNF is that its exact likelihood\ncomputation allows us to obtain guarantees on the maximum unfairness of any\npotentially adversarial downstream predictor.

          "description": "When learning tasks over time, artificial neural networks suffer from a\nproblem known as Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). This happens when the weights of\na network are overwritten during the training of a new task causing forgetting\nof old information. To address this issue, we propose MetA Reusable Knowledge\nor MARK, a new method that fosters weight reusability instead of overwriting\nwhen learning a new task. Specifically, MARK keeps a set of shared weights\namong tasks. We envision these shared weights as a common Knowledge Base (KB)\nthat is not only used to learn new tasks, but also enriched with new knowledge\nas the model learns new tasks. Key components behind MARK are two-fold. On the\none hand, a metalearning approach provides the key mechanism to incrementally\nenrich the KB with new knowledge and to foster weight reusability among tasks.\nOn the other hand, a set of trainable masks provides the key mechanism to\nselectively choose from the KB relevant weights to solve each task. By using\nMARK, we achieve state of the art results in several popular benchmarks,\nsurpassing the best performing methods in terms of average accuracy by over 10%\non the 20-Split-MiniImageNet dataset, while achieving almost zero forgetfulness\nusing 55% of the number of parameters.

          "description": "Local surrogate approaches for explaining machine learning model predictions\nhave appealing properties, such as being model-agnostic and flexible in their\nmodelling. Several methods exist that fit this description and share this goal.\nHowever, despite their shared overall procedure, they set out different\nobjectives, extract different information from the black-box, and consequently\nproduce diverse explanations, that are -- in general -- incomparable. In this\nwork we review the similarities and differences amongst multiple methods, with\na particular focus on what information they extract from the model, as this has\nlarge impact on the output: the explanation.

          "description": "Most edge AI focuses on prediction tasks on resource-limited edge devices\nwhile the training is done at server machines. However, retraining or\ncustomizing a model is required at edge devices as the model is becoming\noutdated due to environmental changes over time. To follow such a concept\ndrift, a neural-network based on-device learning approach is recently proposed,\nso that edge devices train incoming data at runtime to update their model. In\nthis case, since a training is done at distributed edge devices, the issue is\nthat only a limited amount of training data can be used for each edge device.\nTo address this issue, one approach is a cooperative learning or federated\nlearning, where edge devices exchange their trained results and update their\nmodel by using those collected from the other devices. In this paper, as an\non-device learning algorithm, we focus on OS-ELM (Online Sequential Extreme\nLearning Machine) to sequentially train a model based on recent samples and\ncombine it with autoencoder for anomaly detection. We extend it for an\non-device federated learning so that edge devices can exchange their trained\nresults and update their model by using those collected from the other edge\ndevices. This cooperative model update is one-shot while it can be repeatedly\napplied to synchronize their model. Our approach is evaluated with anomaly\ndetection tasks generated from a driving dataset of cars, a human activity\ndataset, and MNIST dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed on-device\nfederated learning can produce a merged model by integrating trained results\nfrom multiple edge devices as accurately as traditional backpropagation based\nneural networks and a traditional federated learning approach with lower\ncomputation or communication cost.",

These\nresults raise the question of whether neural networks only learn successfully\nif kernels also learn successfully, despite neural networks being more\nexpressive. Here, we show theoretically that two-layer neural networks (2LNN)\nwith only a few hidden neurons can beat the performance of kernel learning on a\nsimple Gaussian mixture classification task.

Our analysis is based on the derivation of a closed set of equations\nthat track the learning dynamics of the 2LNN and thus allow to extract the\nasymptotic performance of the network as a function of signal-to-noise ratio\nand other hyperparameters.

          "description": "Convolutional architectures have proven extremely successful for vision\ntasks. Their hard inductive biases enable sample-efficient learning, but come\nat the cost of a potentially lower performance ceiling. Vision Transformers\n(ViTs) rely on more flexible self-attention layers, and have recently\noutperformed CNNs for image classification. However, they require costly\npre-training on large external datasets or distillation from pre-trained\nconvolutional networks. In this paper, we ask the following question: is it\npossible to combine the strengths of these two architectures while avoiding\ntheir respective limitations? To this end, we introduce gated positional\nself-attention (GPSA), a form of positional self-attention which can be\nequipped with a ``soft\" convolutional inductive bias. We initialise the GPSA\nlayers to mimic the locality of convolutional layers, then give each attention\nhead the freedom to escape locality by adjusting a gating parameter regulating\nthe attention paid to position versus content information. The resulting\nconvolutional-like ViT architecture, ConViT, outperforms the DeiT on ImageNet,\nwhile offering a much improved sample efficiency. We further investigate the\nrole of locality in learning by first quantifying how it is encouraged in\nvanilla self-attention layers, then analysing how it is escaped in GPSA layers.\nWe conclude by presenting various ablations to better understand the success of\nthe ConViT.

In\nparticular, deep neural networks have gained significant attention, but their\nwidespread adoption in the biomolecular domain has been limited by a lack of\neither systematic performance benchmarks or a unified toolkit for interacting\nwith molecular data. To address this, we present ATOM3D, a collection of both\nnovel and existing benchmark datasets spanning several key classes of\nbiomolecules. We implement several classes of three-dimensional molecular\nlearning methods for each of these tasks and show that they consistently\nimprove performance relative to methods based on one- and two-dimensional\nrepresentations. The specific choice of architecture proves to be critical for\nperformance, with three-dimensional convolutional networks excelling at tasks\ninvolving complex geometries, graph networks performing well on systems\nrequiring detailed positional information, and the more recently developed\nequivariant networks showing significant promise. Our results indicate that\nmany molecular problems stand to gain from three-dimensional molecular\nlearning, and that there is potential for improvement on many tasks which\nremain underexplored.

          "description": "Traumatic brain injury can be caused by head impacts, but many brain injury\nrisk estimation models are less accurate across the variety of impacts that\npatients may undergo. We investigated the spectral characteristics of different\nhead impact types with kinematics classification. Data was analyzed from 3,262\nhead impacts from lab reconstruction, American football, mixed martial arts,\nand publicly available car crash data. A random forest classifier with spectral\ndensities of linear acceleration and angular velocity was built to classify\nhead impact types (e.g., football), reaching a median accuracy of 96% over\n1,000 random partitions of training and test sets. To test the classifier on\ndata from different measurement devices, another 271 lab-reconstructed impacts\nwere obtained from 5 other instrumented mouthguards with the classifier\nreaching over 96% accuracy. The most important features in the classification\nincluded both low-frequency and high-frequency features, both linear\nacceleration features and angular velocity features. Different head impact\ntypes had different distributions of spectral densities in low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency ranges (e.g., the spectral densities of MMA impacts were higher\nin high-frequency range than in the low-frequency range). Finally, with the\nclassifier, type-specific, nearest-neighbor regression models were built for\n95th percentile maximum principal strain, 95th percentile maximum principal\nstrain in corpus callosum, and cumulative strain damage (15th percentile). This\nshowed a generally higher R2-value than baseline models. The classifier enables\na better understanding of the impact kinematics in different sports, and it can\nbe applied to evaluate the quality of impact-simulation systems and on-field\ndata augmentation.

          "description": "Vision transformer has demonstrated promising performance on challenging\ncomputer vision tasks. However, directly training the vision transformers may\nyield unstable and sub-optimal results. Recent works propose to improve the\nperformance of the vision transformers by modifying the transformer structures,\ne.g., incorporating convolution layers. In contrast, we investigate an\northogonal approach to stabilize the vision transformer training without\nmodifying the networks. We observe the instability of the training can be\nattributed to the significant similarity across the extracted patch\nrepresentations. More specifically, for deep vision transformers, the\nself-attention blocks tend to map different patches into similar latent\nrepresentations, yielding information loss and performance degradation. To\nalleviate this problem, in this work, we introduce novel loss functions in\nvision transformer training to explicitly encourage diversity across patch\nrepresentations for more discriminative feature extraction. We empirically show\nthat our proposed techniques stabilize the training and allow us to train wider\nand deeper vision transformers. We further show the diversified features\nsignificantly benefit the downstream tasks in transfer learning. For semantic\nsegmentation, we enhance the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on Cityscapes and\nADE20k. Our code will be made publicly available soon.",

          "description": "Self-supervised learning of graph neural networks (GNN) is in great need\nbecause of the widespread label scarcity issue in real-world graph/network\ndata.

However, GNNs trained by traditional GCL often risk capturing redundant\ngraph features and thus may be brittle and provide sub-par performance in\ndownstream tasks.

We pair AD-GCL with theoretical explanations and design a practical\ninstantiation based on trainable edge-dropping graph augmentation.

          "description": "We investigate finite stochastic partial monitoring, which is a general model\nfor sequential learning with limited feedback. While Thompson sampling is one\nof the most promising algorithms on a variety of online decision-making\nproblems, its properties for stochastic partial monitoring have not been\ntheoretically investigated, and the existing algorithm relies on a heuristic\napproximation of the posterior distribution. To mitigate these problems, we\npresent a novel Thompson-sampling-based algorithm, which enables us to exactly\nsample the target parameter from the posterior distribution. Besides, we prove\nthat the new algorithm achieves the logarithmic problem-dependent expected\npseudo-regret $\\mathrm{O}(\\log T)$ for a linearized variant of the problem with\nlocal observability. This result is the first regret bound of Thompson sampling\nfor partial monitoring, which also becomes the first logarithmic regret bound\nof Thompson sampling for linear bandits.",

          "description": "Recent publications on automatic-speech-recognition (ASR) have a strong focus\non attention encoder-decoder (AED) architectures which work well for large\ndatasets, but tend to overfit when applied in low resource scenarios. One\nsolution to tackle this issue is to generate synthetic data with a trained\ntext-to-speech system (TTS) if additional text is available. This was\nsuccessfully applied in many publications with AED systems. We present a novel\napproach of silence correction in the data pre-processing for TTS systems which\nincreases the robustness when training on corpora targeted for ASR\napplications. In this work we do not only show the successful application of\nsynthetic data for AED systems, but also test the same method on a highly\noptimized state-of-the-art Hybrid ASR system and a competitive monophone based\nsystem using connectionist-temporal-classification (CTC). We show that for the\nlater systems the addition of synthetic data only has a minor effect, but they\nstill outperform the AED systems by a large margin on LibriSpeech-100h. We\nachieve a final word-error-rate of 3.3%/10.0% with a Hybrid system on the\nclean/noisy test-sets, surpassing any previous state-of-the-art systems that do\nnot include unlabeled audio data.",

MAML is simple and versatile but requires\ncostly learning rate tuning and careful design of the task distribution which\naffects its scalability and generalization. This paper proposes a more robust\nMAML based on an adaptive learning scheme and a prioritization task buffer(PTB)\nreferred to as Robust MAML (RMAML) for improving scalability of training\nprocess and alleviating the problem of distribution mismatch. RMAML uses\ngradient-based hyper-parameter optimization to automatically find the optimal\nlearning rate and uses the PTB to gradually adjust train-ing task distribution\ntoward testing task distribution over the course of training.

In this work, we investigate\nthe usefulness of one of these front-end frameworks, namely wav2vec, for hybrid\nASR systems. In addition to deploying a pre-trained feature extractor, we\nexplore how to make use of an existing acoustic model (AM) trained on the same\ntask with different features as well.

We propose here instead a deep reinforcement learning-based\napproach that enables an end-to-end optimization of the detection of both\nlabeled and unlabeled anomalies. This approach learns the known abnormality by\nautomatically interacting with an anomaly-biased simulation environment, while\ncontinuously extending the learned abnormality to novel classes of anomaly\n(i.e., unknown anomalies) by actively exploring possible anomalies in the\nunlabeled data. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the exploitation of the\nsmall labeled anomaly data and the exploration of the rare unlabeled anomalies.\nExtensive experiments on 48 real-world datasets show that our model\nsignificantly outperforms five state-of-the-art competing methods.",

          "description": "Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) is emerging as an efficient and biologically\nplausible alternative to the ubiquitous backpropagation algorithm for training\ndeep neural networks. Despite relying on random feedback weights for the\nbackward pass, DFA successfully trains state-of-the-art models such as\nTransformers. On the other hand, it notoriously fails to train convolutional\nnetworks. An understanding of the inner workings of DFA to explain these\ndiverging results remains elusive. Here, we propose a theory for the success of\nDFA. We first show that learning in shallow networks proceeds in two steps: an\nalignment phase, where the model adapts its weights to align the approximate\ngradient with the true gradient of the loss function, is followed by a\nmemorisation phase, where the model focuses on fitting the data. This two-step\nprocess has a degeneracy breaking effect: out of all the low-loss solutions in\nthe landscape, a network trained with DFA naturally converges to the solution\nwhich maximises gradient alignment. We also identify a key quantity underlying\nalignment in deep linear networks: the conditioning of the alignment matrices.\nThe latter enables a detailed understanding of the impact of data structure on\nalignment, and suggests a simple explanation for the well-known failure of DFA\nto train convolutional neural networks. Numerical experiments on MNIST and\nCIFAR10 clearly demonstrate degeneracy breaking in deep non-linear networks and\nshow that the align-then-memorise process occurs sequentially from the bottom\nlayers of the network to the top.",

          "description": "International challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative\nassessment of image analysis algorithms given a specific task. Segmentation is\nso far the most widely investigated medical image processing task, but the\nvarious segmentation challenges have typically been organized in isolation,\nsuch that algorithm development was driven by the need to tackle a single\nspecific clinical problem. We hypothesized that a method capable of performing\nwell on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and\npotentially outperform a custom-designed solution. To investigate the\nhypothesis, we organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) - a\nbiomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude\nof both tasks and modalities. The underlying data set was designed to explore\nthe axis of difficulties typically encountered when dealing with medical\nimages, such as small data sets, unbalanced labels, multi-site data and small\nobjects. The MSD challenge confirmed that algorithms with a consistent good\nperformance on a set of tasks preserved their good average performance on a\ndifferent set of previously unseen tasks. Moreover, by monitoring the MSD\nwinner for two years, we found that this algorithm continued generalizing well\nto a wide range of other clinical problems, further confirming our hypothesis.\nThree main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image\nsegmentation algorithms are mature, accurate, and generalize well when\nretrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across\nmultiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the\ntraining of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to non AI\nexperts.",

          "description": "Supervised regression to demonstrations has been demonstrated to be a stable\nway to train deep policy networks. We are motivated to study how we can take\nfull advantage of supervised loss functions for stably training deep\nreinforcement learning agents. This is a challenging task because it is unclear\nhow the training data could be collected to enable policy improvement. In this\nwork, we propose Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SSRL), a simple\nalgorithm that optimizes policies with purely supervised losses. We demonstrate\nthat, without policy gradient or value estimation, an iterative procedure of\n``labeling\" data and supervised regression is sufficient to drive stable policy\nimprovement. By selecting and imitating trajectories with high episodic\nrewards, SSRL is surprisingly competitive to contemporary algorithms with more\nstable performance and less running time, showing the potential of solving\nreinforcement learning with supervised learning techniques.

          "description": "Despite its wide use, recent studies have revealed unexpected and undesirable\nproperties of neural autoregressive sequence models trained with maximum\nlikelihood, such as an unreasonably high affinity to short sequences after\ntraining and to infinitely long sequences at decoding time. We propose to study\nthese phenomena by investigating how the modes, or local maxima, of a\ndistribution are maintained throughout the full learning chain of the\nground-truth, empirical, learned and decoding-induced distributions, via the\nnewly proposed mode recovery cost. We design a tractable testbed where we build\nthree types of ground-truth distributions: (1) an LSTM based structured\ndistribution, (2) an unstructured distribution where probability of a sequence\ndoes not depend on its content, and (3) a product of these two which we call a\nsemi-structured distribution. Our study reveals both expected and unexpected\nfindings. First, starting with data collection, mode recovery cost strongly\nrelies on the ground-truth distribution and is most costly with the\nsemi-structured distribution. Second, after learning, mode recovery cost from\nthe ground-truth distribution may increase or decrease compared to data\ncollection, with the largest cost degradation occurring with the\nsemi-structured ground-truth distribution. Finally, the ability of the\ndecoding-induced distribution to recover modes from the learned distribution is\nhighly impacted by the choices made earlier in the learning chain. We conclude\nthat future research must consider the entire learning chain in order to fully\nunderstand the potentials and perils and to further improve neural\nautoregressive sequence models.",

          "description": "The ultrasound (US) screening of the infant hip is vital for the early\ndiagnosis of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The US diagnosis of DDH\nrefers to measuring alpha and beta angles that quantify hip joint development.\nThese two angles are calculated from key anatomical landmarks and structures of\nthe hip. However, this measurement process is not trivial for sonographers and\nusually requires a thorough understanding of complex anatomical structures. In\nthis study, we propose a multi-task framework to learn the relationships among\nlandmarks and structures jointly and automatically evaluate DDH. Our multi-task\nnetworks are equipped with three novel modules. Firstly, we adopt Mask R-CNN as\nthe basic framework to detect and segment key anatomical structures and add one\nlandmark detection branch to form a new multi-task framework. Secondly, we\npropose a novel shape similarity loss to refine the incomplete anatomical\nstructure prediction robustly and accurately. Thirdly, we further incorporate\nthe landmark-structure consistent prior to ensure the consistency of the bony\nrim estimated from the segmented structure and the detected landmark. In our\nexperiments, 1,231 US images of the infant hip from 632 patients are collected,\nof which 247 images from 126 patients are tested. The average errors in alpha\nand beta angles are 2.221 degrees and 2.899 degrees. About 93% and 85%\nestimates of alpha and beta angles have errors less than 5 degrees,\nrespectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can\naccurately and robustly realize the automatic evaluation of DDH, showing great\npotential for clinical application.",

Moreover, we enrich the\ntraining data for the model with synthesized document images that are fully\nlabeled for text detection and enhancement, thus overcome the insufficiency of\nlabeled document image data. For the effective exploitation of the synthetic\nand real data, the training process is separated in two phases. The first phase\nis training only synthetic data in a fully-supervised manner. Then real data\nwith only detection labels are added in the second phase. The enhancement task\nfor the real data is weakly-supervised with information from their detection\nlabels. Our methods are demonstrated in a real document dataset with\nperformances exceeding those of other text detection methods. Moreover,\nablations are conducted and the results confirm the effectiveness of the\nsynthetic data, auxiliary task, and weak-supervision.

Very recent attempts\nin this area have demonstrated promising results in terms of recognition\naccuracy, yet they have been also shown to induce, in many cases, significant\ncomputational overheads due to the additional modelling of the temporal\ninformation. In this work, we propose a Video Transformer model the complexity\nof which scales linearly with the number of frames in the video sequence and\nhence induces \\textit{no overhead} compared to an image-based Transformer\nmodel. To achieve this, our model makes two approximations to the full\nspace-time attention used in Video Transformers: (a) It restricts time\nattention to a local temporal window and capitalizes on the Transformer's depth\nto obtain full temporal coverage of the video sequence. (b) It uses efficient\nspace-time mixing to attend \\textit{jointly} spatial and temporal locations\nwithout inducing any additional cost on top of a spatial-only attention model.\nWe also show how to integrate 2 very lightweight mechanisms for global\ntemporal-only attention which provide additional accuracy improvements at\nminimal computational cost. We demonstrate that our model produces very high\nrecognition accuracy on the most popular video recognition datasets while at\nthe same time being significantly more efficient than other Video Transformer\nmodels.

          "description": "Data representation plays a critical role in the performance of novelty\ndetection (or ``anomaly detection'') methods in machine learning. The data\nrepresentation of network traffic often determines the effectiveness of these\nmodels as much as the model itself. The wide range of novel events that network\noperators need to detect (e.g., attacks, malware, new applications, changes in\ntraffic demands) introduces the possibility for a broad range of possible\nmodels and data representations. In each scenario, practitioners must spend\nsignificant effort extracting and engineering features that are most predictive\nfor that situation or application. While anomaly detection is well-studied in\ncomputer networking, much existing work develops specific models that presume a\nparticular representation -- often IPFIX/NetFlow. Yet, other representations\nmay result in higher model accuracy, and the rise of programmable networks now\nmakes it more practical to explore a broader range of representations. To\nfacilitate such exploration, we develop a systematic framework, open-source\ntoolkit, and public Python library that makes it both possible and easy to\nextract and generate features from network traffic and perform and end-to-end\nevaluation of these representations across most prevalent modern novelty\ndetection models. We first develop and publicly release an open-source tool, an\naccompanying Python library (NetML), and end-to-end pipeline for novelty\ndetection in network traffic. Second, we apply this tool to five different\nnovelty detection problems in networking, across a range of scenarios from\nattack detection to novel device detection.

          "description": "High-quality data is critical to train performant Machine Learning (ML)\nmodels, highlighting the importance of Data Quality Management (DQM). Existing\nDQM schemes often cannot satisfactorily improve ML performance because, by\ndesign, they are oblivious to downstream ML tasks. Besides, they cannot handle\nvarious data quality issues (especially those caused by adversarial attacks)\nand have limited applications to only certain types of ML models. Recently,\ndata valuation approaches (e.g., based on the Shapley value) have been\nleveraged to perform DQM; yet, empirical studies have observed that their\nperformance varies considerably based on the underlying data and training\nprocess. In this paper, we propose a task-driven, multi-purpose, model-agnostic\nDQM framework, DataSifter, which is optimized towards a given downstream ML\ntask, capable of effectively removing data points with various defects, and\napplicable to diverse models. Specifically, we formulate DQM as an optimization\nproblem and devise a scalable algorithm to solve it. Furthermore, we propose a\ntheoretical framework for comparing the worst-case performance of different DQM\nstrategies. Remarkably, our results show that the popular strategy based on the\nShapley value may end up choosing the worst data subset in certain practical\nscenarios. Our evaluation shows that DataSifter achieves and most often\nsignificantly improves the state-of-the-art performance over a wide range of\nDQM tasks, including backdoor, poison, noisy/mislabel data detection, data\nsummarization, and data debiasing.",

          "description": "Graph self-supervised learning has gained increasing attention due to its\ncapacity to learn expressive node representations. Many pretext tasks, or loss\nfunctions have been designed from distinct perspectives. However, we observe\nthat different pretext tasks affect downstream tasks differently cross\ndatasets, which suggests that searching pretext tasks is crucial for graph\nself-supervised learning. Different from existing works focusing on designing\nsingle pretext tasks, this work aims to investigate how to automatically\nleverage multiple pretext tasks effectively. Nevertheless, evaluating\nrepresentations derived from multiple pretext tasks without direct access to\nground truth labels makes this problem challenging. To address this obstacle,\nwe make use of a key principle of many real-world graphs, i.e., homophily, or\nthe principle that ``like attracts like,'' as the guidance to effectively\nsearch various self-supervised pretext tasks. We provide theoretical\nunderstanding and empirical evidence to justify the flexibility of homophily in\nthis search task.

However, this subject is less addressed in recent\nstudies. Classical methods with certain variants, such as Dynamic Programming\nwith Tile Coding which discretizes the state space, fail to handle slowly\nchanging variables because those methods cannot capture the tiny changes in\neach transition step, as it is computationally expensive or impossible to\nestablish an extremely granular grid system. In this paper, we introduce a\nHyperspace Neighbor Penetration (HNP) approach that solves the problem. HNP\ncaptures in each transition step the state's partial \"penetration\" into its\nneighboring hyper-tiles in the gridded hyperspace, thus does not require the\ntransition to be inter-tile in order for the change to be captured. Therefore,\nHNP allows for a very coarse grid system, which makes the computation feasible.\nHNP assumes near linearity of the transition function in a local space, which\nis commonly satisfied. In summary, HNP can be orders of magnitude more\nefficient than classical method in handling slowly changing variables in\nreinforcement learning.

We also conduct a\nseries of experiments on 15 public benchmarks, 8 popular GNN models, and 3\ngraph tasks -- node classification, graph classification, and edge prediction\n-- and show that GraphSym consistently achieves better performance than\nexisting popular GNNs by 1.9\\%$\\sim$3.9\\% on average and their ensembles.\nExtensive ablation studies and experiments on the few-shot setting also\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of GraphSym.",

          "description": "Riemannian manifolds provide a principled way to model nonlinear geometric\nstructure inherent in data. A Riemannian metric on said manifolds determines\ngeometry-aware shortest paths and provides the means to define statistical\nmodels accordingly. However, these operations are typically computationally\ndemanding. To ease this computational burden, we advocate probabilistic\nnumerical methods for Riemannian statistics. In particular, we focus on\nBayesian quadrature (BQ) to numerically compute integrals over normal laws on\nRiemannian manifolds learned from data. In this task, each function evaluation\nrelies on the solution of an expensive initial value problem. We show that by\nleveraging both prior knowledge and an active exploration scheme, BQ\nsignificantly reduces the number of required evaluations and thus outperforms\nMonte Carlo methods on a wide range of integration problems. As a concrete\napplication, we highlight the merits of adopting Riemannian geometry with our\nproposed framework on a nonlinear dataset from molecular dynamics.",

Several studies, however, have\nshown that it is impossible to execute BP in a real brain. Also, BP still\nserves as an important and unsolved bottleneck for memory usage and speed. We\npropose a simple, novel algorithm, the Front-Contribution algorithm, as a\ncompact alternative to BP. The contributions of all weights with respect to the\nfinal layer weights are calculated before training commences and all the\ncontributions are appended to weights of the final layer, i.e., the effective\nfinal layer weights are a non-linear function of themselves. Our algorithm then\nessentially collapses the network, precluding the necessity for weight updation\nof all weights not in the final layer. This reduction in parameters results in\nlower memory usage and higher training speed. We show that our algorithm\nproduces the exact same output as BP, in contrast to several recently proposed\nalgorithms approximating BP. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate the\nefficacy of the proposed algorithm.

          "description": "Vertical Federated Learning (vFL) allows multiple parties that own different\nattributes (e.g. features and labels) of the same data entity (e.g. a person)\nto jointly train a model. To prepare the training data, vFL needs to identify\nthe common data entities shared by all parties. It is usually achieved by\nPrivate Set Intersection (PSI) which identifies the intersection of training\nsamples from all parties by using personal identifiable information (e.g.\nemail) as sample IDs to align data instances. As a result, PSI would make\nsample IDs of the intersection visible to all parties, and therefore each party\ncan know that the data entities shown in the intersection also appear in the\nother parties, i.e. intersection membership. However, in many real-world\nprivacy-sensitive organizations, e.g. banks and hospitals, revealing membership\nof their data entities is prohibited. In this paper, we propose a vFL framework\nbased on Private Set Union (PSU) that allows each party to keep sensitive\nmembership information to itself. Instead of identifying the intersection of\nall training samples, our PSU protocol generates the union of samples as\ntraining instances. In addition, we propose strategies to generate synthetic\nfeatures and labels to handle samples that belong to the union but not the\nintersection. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, we show\nour framework can protect the privacy of the intersection membership while\nmaintaining the model utility.",

While existing notions of multi-agent robustness\nconcern perturbations in the actions of agents, we address a novel robustness\nobjective concerning perturbations in the reward functions of agents.

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from\na fully-labeled source domain to a different unlabeled target domain. Most\nexisting UDA methods learn domain-invariant feature representations by\nminimizing feature distances across domains. In this work, we build upon\ncontrastive self-supervised learning to align features so as to reduce the\ndomain discrepancy between training and testing sets. Exploring the same set of\ncategories shared by both domains, we introduce a simple yet effective\nframework CDCL, for domain alignment. In particular, given an anchor image from\none domain, we minimize its distances to cross-domain samples from the same\nclass relative to those from different categories. Since target labels are\nunavailable, we use a clustering-based approach with carefully initialized\ncenters to produce pseudo labels. In addition, we demonstrate that CDCL is a\ngeneral framework and can be adapted to the data-free setting, where the source\ndata are unavailable during training, with minimal modification. We conduct\nexperiments on two widely used domain adaptation benchmarks, i.e., Office-31\nand VisDA-2017, and demonstrate that CDCL achieves state-of-the-art performance\non both datasets.",

Indeed, at large scale, I/O takes as\nmuch as 85% of training time. Addressing this I/O bottleneck necessitates\ncareful optimization, as optimal data ingestion pipelines differ between\nsystems, and require a delicate balance between access to local storage,\nexternal filesystems, and remote nodes. We introduce NoPFS, a machine learning\nI/O middleware, which provides a scalable, flexible, and easy-to-use solution\nto the I/O bottleneck. NoPFS uses clairvoyance: Given the seed generating the\nrandom access pattern for training with SGD, it can exactly predict when and\nwhere a sample will be accessed. We combine this with an analysis of access\npatterns and a performance model to provide distributed caching policies that\nadapt to different datasets and storage hierarchies. NoPFS reduces I/O times\nand improves end-to-end training by up to 5.4x on the ImageNet-1k,\nImageNet-22k, and CosmoFlow datasets.",

We consider\ngeneralizations of this problem: mixtures of linear regressions, and mixtures\nof linear classifiers, where the goal is to recover supports of multiple sparse\nvectors using only a small number of possibly noisy linear, and 1-bit\nmeasurements respectively. The key challenge is that the measurements from\ndifferent vectors are randomly mixed. Both of these problems were also\nextensively studied recently. In mixtures of linear classifiers, the\nobservations correspond to the side of queried hyperplane a random unknown\nvector lies in, whereas in mixtures of linear regressions we observe the\nprojection of a random unknown vector on the queried hyperplane. The primary\nstep in recovering the unknown vectors from the mixture is to first identify\nthe support of all the individual component vectors. In this work, we study the\nnumber of measurements sufficient for recovering the supports of all the\ncomponent vectors in a mixture in both these models. We provide algorithms that\nuse a number of measurements polynomial in $k, \\log n$ and quasi-polynomial in\n$\\ell$, to recover the support of all the $\\ell$ unknown vectors in the mixture\nwith high probability when each individual component is a $k$-sparse\n$n$-dimensional vector.",

Recently, binary analysis techniques based on machine learning\nhave been proposed to automatically reconstruct the code representation of a\nbinary instead of manually crafting specifics of the analysis algorithm.\nHowever, the existing approaches utilizing machine learning are still\nspecialized to solve one domain of problems, rendering recreation of models for\ndifferent types of binary analysis. In this paper, we propose DeepSemantic\nutilizing BERT in producing the semantic-aware code representation of a binary\ncode.\n\nTo this end, we introduce well-balanced instruction normalization that holds\nrich information for each of instructions yet minimizing an out-of-vocabulary\n(OOV) problem. DeepSemantic has been carefully designed based on our study with\nlarge swaths of binaries. Besides, DeepSemantic leverages the essence of the\nBERT architecture into re-purposing a pre-trained generic model that is readily\navailable as a one-time processing, followed by quickly applying specific\ndownstream tasks with a fine-tuning process. We demonstrate DeepSemantic with\ntwo downstream tasks, namely, binary similarity comparison and compiler\nprovenance (i.e., compiler and optimization level) prediction. Our experimental\nresults show that the binary similarity model outperforms two state-of-the-art\nbinary similarity tools, DeepBinDiff and SAFE, 49.84% and 15.83% on average,\nrespectively.",

In robotics, such algorithms can be used for generating a\ncollection of controllers covering most of the possible behaviours of a robot.\nTo do so, these algorithms associate a behavioural descriptor to each of these\nbehaviours. Each behavioural descriptor is used for estimating the novelty of\none behaviour compared to the others. In most existing algorithms, the\nbehavioural descriptor needs to be hand-coded, thus requiring prior knowledge\nabout the task to solve. In this paper, we introduce: Autonomous Robots\nRealising their Abilities, an algorithm that uses a dimensionality reduction\ntechnique to automatically learn behavioural descriptors based on raw sensory\ndata. The performance of this algorithm is assessed on three robotic tasks in\nsimulation. The experimental results show that it performs similarly to\ntraditional hand-coded approaches without the requirement to provide any\nhand-coded behavioural descriptor. In the collection of diverse and\nhigh-performing solutions, it also manages to find behaviours that are novel\nwith respect to more features than its hand-coded baselines.

          "description": "Estimating the data uncertainty in regression tasks is often done by learning\na quantile function or a prediction interval of the true label conditioned on\nthe input. It is frequently observed that quantile regression -- a vanilla\nalgorithm for learning quantiles with asymptotic guarantees -- tends to\n\\emph{under-cover} than the desired coverage level in reality. While various\nfixes have been proposed, a more fundamental understanding of why this\nunder-coverage bias happens in the first place remains elusive.\n\nIn this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical study on the coverage of\nuncertainty estimation algorithms in learning quantiles. We prove that quantile\nregression suffers from an inherent under-coverage bias, in a vanilla setting\nwhere we learn a realizable linear quantile function and there is more data\nthan parameters. More quantitatively, for $\\alpha>0.5$ and small $d/n$, the\n$\\alpha$-quantile learned by quantile regression roughly achieves coverage\n$\\alpha - (\\alpha-1/2)\\cdot d/n$ regardless of the noise distribution, where\n$d$ is the input dimension and $n$ is the number of training data. Our theory\nreveals that this under-coverage bias stems from a certain high-dimensional\nparameter estimation error that is not implied by existing theories on quantile\nregression. Experiments on simulated and real data verify our theory and\nfurther illustrate the effect of various factors such as sample size and model\ncapacity on the under-coverage bias in more practical setups.",

          "description": "In this paper, a new Discontinuity Capturing Shallow Neural Network (DCSNN)\nfor approximating $d$-dimensional piecewise continuous functions and for\nsolving elliptic interface problems is developed. There are three novel\nfeatures in the present network; namely, (i) jump discontinuity is captured\nsharply, (ii) it is completely shallow consisting of only one hidden layer,\n(iii) it is completely mesh-free for solving partial differential equations\n(PDEs). We first continuously extend the $d$-dimensional piecewise continuous\nfunction in $(d+1)$-dimensional space by augmenting one coordinate variable to\nlabel the pieces of discontinuous function, and then construct a shallow neural\nnetwork to express this new augmented function. Since only one hidden layer is\nemployed, the number of training parameters (weights and biases) scales\nlinearly with the dimension and the neurons used in the hidden layer. For\nsolving elliptic interface equations, the network is trained by minimizing the\nmean squared error loss that consists of the residual of governing equation,\nboundary condition, and the interface jump conditions. We perform a series of\nnumerical tests to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the present network.\nOur DCSNN model is comparably efficient due to only moderate number of\nparameters needed to be trained (a few hundreds of parameters used throughout\nall numerical examples here), and the result shows better accuracy (and less\nparameters) than other method using piecewise deep neural network in\nliterature. We also compare the results obtained by the traditional grid-based\nimmersed interface method (IIM) which is designed particularly for elliptic\ninterface problems. Again, the present results show better accuracy than the\nones obtained by IIM.

          "description": "Executing computer vision models on streaming visual data, or streaming\nperception is an emerging problem, with applications in self-driving, embodied\nagents, and augmented/virtual reality. The development of such systems is\nlargely governed by the accuracy and latency of the processing pipeline. While\npast work has proposed numerous approximate execution frameworks, their\ndecision functions solely focus on optimizing latency, accuracy, or energy,\netc. This results in sub-optimum decisions, affecting the overall system\nperformance. We argue that the streaming perception systems should holistically\nmaximize the overall system performance (i.e., considering both accuracy and\nlatency simultaneously). To this end, we describe a new approach based on deep\nreinforcement learning to learn these tradeoffs at runtime for streaming\nperception. This tradeoff optimization is formulated as a novel deep contextual\nbandit problem and we design a new reward function that holistically integrates\nlatency and accuracy into a single metric. We show that our agent can learn a\ncompetitive policy across multiple decision dimensions, which outperforms\nstate-of-the-art policies on public datasets.",

          "description": "Semi-supervised anomaly detection, which aims to detect anomalies from normal\nsamples using a model that is solely trained on normal data, has been an active\nfield of research in the past decade. With recent advancements in deep\nlearning, particularly generative adversarial networks and autoencoders,\nresearchers have designed efficient deep anomaly detection methods. Existing\nworks commonly use neural networks such as an autoencoder to map the data into\na new representation that is easier to work with and then apply an anomaly\ndetection algorithm. In this paper, we propose a method, DASVDD, that jointly\nlearns the parameters of an autoencoder while minimizing the volume of an\nenclosing hyper-sphere on its latent representation. We propose a customized\nanomaly score which is a combination of autoencoder's reconstruction error and\ndistance of the lower-dimensional representation of a sample from the center of\nthe enclosing hyper-sphere. Minimizing this anomaly score on the normal data\nduring training aids us in learning the underlying distribution of normal data.\nIncluding the reconstruction error in the anomaly score ensures that DASVDD\ndoes not suffer from the common hyper-sphere collapse issue since the proposed\nDASVDD model does not converge to the trivial solution of mapping all inputs to\na constant point in the latent representation. Experimental evaluations on\nseveral benchmark datasets from different domains show that the proposed method\noutperforms most of the commonly used state-of-the-art anomaly detection\nalgorithms while maintaining robust and accurate performance across different\nanomaly classes.",

          "description": "We study two model selection settings in stochastic linear bandits (LB). In\nthe first setting, the reward parameter of the LB problem is arbitrarily\nselected from $M$ models represented as (possibly) overlapping balls in\n$\\mathbb R^d$. However, the agent only has access to misspecified models, i.e.,\nestimates of the centers and radii of the balls. We refer to this setting as\nparameter selection. In the second setting, which we refer to as feature\nselection, the expected reward of the LB problem is in the linear span of at\nleast one of $M$ feature maps (models). For each setting, we develop and\nanalyze an algorithm that is based on a reduction from bandits to\nfull-information problems. This allows us to obtain regret bounds that are not\nworse (up to a $\\sqrt{\\log M}$ factor) than the case where the true model is\nknown. Our parameter selection algorithm is OFUL-style and the one for feature\nselection is based on the SquareCB algorithm. We also show that the regret of\nour parameter selection algorithm scales logarithmically with model\nmisspecification.",

          "description": "Certified defenses based on convex relaxations are an established technique\nfor training provably robust models. The key component is the choice of\nrelaxation, varying from simple intervals to tight polyhedra. Paradoxically,\nhowever, training with tighter relaxations can often lead to worse certified\nrobustness. The poor understanding of this paradox has forced recent\nstate-of-the-art certified defenses to focus on designing various heuristics in\norder to mitigate its effects. In contrast, in this paper we study the\nunderlying causes and show that tightness alone may not be the determining\nfactor. Concretely, we identify two key properties of relaxations that impact\ntraining dynamics: continuity and sensitivity. Our extensive experimental\nevaluation demonstrates that these two factors, observed alongside tightness,\nexplain the drop in certified robustness for popular relaxations. Further, we\ninvestigate the possibility of designing and training with relaxations that are\ntight, continuous and not sensitive. We believe the insights of this work can\nhelp drive the principled discovery of new and effective certified defense\nmechanisms.",

Despite years of successful applications, transfer\nlearning practice often relies on ad-hoc solutions, while theoretical\nunderstanding of these procedures is still limited. In the present work, we\nre-think a solvable model of synthetic data as a framework for modeling\ncorrelation between data-sets. This setup allows for an analytic\ncharacterization of the generalization performance obtained when transferring\nthe learned feature map from the source to the target task. Focusing on the\nproblem of training two-layer networks in a binary classification setting, we\nshow that our model can capture a range of salient features of transfer\nlearning with real data. Moreover, by exploiting parametric control over the\ncorrelation between the two data-sets, we systematically investigate under\nwhich conditions the transfer of features is beneficial for generalization.",

          "description": "Distance metric learning has attracted a lot of interest for solving machine\nlearning and pattern recognition problems over the last decades. In this work\nwe present a simple approach based on concepts from statistical physics to\nlearn optimal distance metric for a given problem. We formulate the task as a\ntypical statistical physics problem: distances between patterns represent\nconstituents of a physical system and the objective function corresponds to\nenergy. Then we express the problem as a minimization of the free energy of a\ncomplex system, which is equivalent to distance metric learning. Much like for\nmany problems in physics, we propose an approach based on Metropolis Monte\nCarlo to find the best distance metric. This provides a natural way to learn\nthe distance metric, where the learning process can be intuitively seen as\nstretching and rotating the metric space until some heuristic is satisfied. Our\nproposed method can handle a wide variety of constraints including those with\nspurious local minima. The approach works surprisingly well with stochastic\nnearest neighbors from neighborhood component analysis (NCA). Experimental\nresults on artificial and real-world data sets reveal a clear superiority over\na number of state-of-the-art distance metric learning methods for nearest\nneighbors classification.",

In this work, we present the first quantitative evaluation of the\nprivacy gain of synthetic data publishing and compare it to that of previous\nanonymisation techniques.\n\nOur evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art generative models\ndemonstrates that synthetic data either does not prevent inference attacks or\ndoes not retain data utility.

          "description": "Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently demonstrated impressive\nresults in terms of both sample quality and distribution coverage. However,\nthey are usually applied directly in data space and often require thousands of\nnetwork evaluations for sampling. Here, we propose the Latent Score-based\nGenerative Model (LSGM), a novel approach that trains SGMs in a latent space,\nrelying on the variational autoencoder framework. Moving from data to latent\nspace allows us to train more expressive generative models, apply SGMs to\nnon-continuous data, and learn smoother SGMs in a smaller space, resulting in\nfewer network evaluations and faster sampling. To enable training LSGMs\nend-to-end in a scalable and stable manner, we (i) introduce a new\nscore-matching objective suitable to the LSGM setting, (ii) propose a novel\nparameterization of the score function that allows SGM to focus on the mismatch\nof the target distribution with respect to a simple Normal one, and (iii)\nanalytically derive multiple techniques for variance reduction of the training\nobjective.

At the first stage, we employ the physics-informed\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (PI-GAN) to learn a functional prior either\nfrom a prescribed function distribution, e.g., Gaussian process, or from\nhistorical data and physics. At the second stage, we employ the Hamiltonian\nMonte Carlo (HMC) method to estimate the posterior in the latent space of\nPI-GANs. In addition, we use two different approaches to encode the physics:\n(1) automatic differentiation, used in the physics-informed neural networks\n(PINNs) for scenarios with explicitly known partial differential equations\n(PDEs), and (2) operator regression using the deep operator network (DeepONet)\nfor PDE-agnostic scenarios. We then test the proposed method for (1)\nmeta-learning for one-dimensional regression, and forward/inverse PDE problems\n(combined with PINNs); (2) PDE-agnostic physical problems (combined with\nDeepONet), e.g., fractional diffusion as well as saturated stochastic\n(100-dimensional) flows in heterogeneous porous media; and (3) spatial-temporal\nregression problems, i.e., inference of a marine riser displacement field. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide accurate predictions\nas well as uncertainty quantification given very limited scattered and noisy\ndata, since historical data could be available to provide informative priors.\nIn summary, the proposed method is capable of learning flexible functional\npriors, and can be extended to big data problems using stochastic HMC or\nnormalizing flows since the latent space is generally characterized as low\ndimensional.",

Existing literature approximates the large-scale OTM by a\nseries of one-dimensional OTM problems through iterative random projection.\nSuch methods, however, suffer from slow or none convergence in practice due to\nthe nature of randomly selected projection directions. Instead, we propose an\nestimation method of large-scale OTM by combining the idea of projection\npursuit regression and sufficient dimension reduction. The proposed method,\nnamed projection pursuit Monge map (PPMM), adaptively selects the most\n``informative'' projection direction in each iteration. We theoretically show\nthe proposed dimension reduction method can consistently estimate the most\n``informative'' projection direction in each iteration. Furthermore, the PPMM\nalgorithm weakly convergences to the target large-scale OTM in a reasonable\nnumber of steps. Empirically, PPMM is computationally easy and converges fast.\nWe assess its finite sample performance through the applications of Wasserstein\ndistance estimation and generative models.",

          "description": "We use a meta-learning neural-network approach to analyse data from a\nmeasured quantum state. Once our neural network has been trained it can be used\nto efficiently sample measurements of the state in measurement bases not\ncontained in the training data. These samples can be used calculate expectation\nvalues and other useful quantities. We refer to this process as \"state sample\ntomography\". We encode the state's measurement outcome distributions using an\nefficiently parameterized generative neural network. This allows each stage in\nthe tomography process to be performed efficiently even for large systems. Our\nscheme is demonstrated on recent IBM Quantum devices, producing a model for a\n6-qubit state's measurement outcomes with a predictive accuracy (classical\nfidelity) > 95% for all test cases using only 100 random measurement settings\nas opposed to the 729 settings required for standard full tomography using\nlocal measurements. This reduction in the required number of measurements\nscales favourably, with training data in 200 measurement settings yielding a\npredictive accuracy > 92% for a 10 qubit state where 59,049 settings are\ntypically required for full local measurement-based quantum state tomography. A\nreduction in number of measurements by a factor, in this case, of almost 600\ncould allow for estimations of expectation values and state fidelities in\npracticable times on current quantum devices.",

Bayesian Filtering algorithms address\nthis state estimation problem, but they require models of process dynamics and\nsensory observations and the respective noise characteristics of these models.\nRecently, multiple works have demonstrated that these models can be learned by\nend-to-end training through differentiable versions of recursive filtering\nalgorithms. In this work, we investigate the advantages of differentiable\nfilters (DFs) over both unstructured learning approaches and manually-tuned\nfiltering algorithms, and provide practical guidance to researchers interested\nin applying such differentiable filters. For this, we implement DFs with four\ndifferent underlying filtering algorithms and compare them in extensive\nexperiments. Specifically, we (i) evaluate different implementation choices and\ntraining approaches, (ii) investigate how well complex models of uncertainty\ncan be learned in DFs, (iii) evaluate the effect of end-to-end training through\nDFs and (iv) compare the DFs among each other and to unstructured LSTM models.",

          "description": "Many robotics domains use some form of nonconvex model predictive control\n(MPC) for planning, which sets a reduced time horizon, performs trajectory\noptimization, and replans at every step. The actual task typically requires a\nmuch longer horizon than is computationally tractable, and is specified via a\ncost function that cumulates over that full horizon. For instance, an\nautonomous car may have a cost function that makes a desired trade-off between\nefficiency, safety, and obeying traffic laws. In this work, we challenge the\ncommon assumption that the cost we optimize using MPC should be the same as the\nground truth cost for the task (plus a terminal cost). MPC solvers can suffer\nfrom short planning horizons, local optima, incorrect dynamics models, and,\nimportantly, fail to account for future replanning ability. Thus, we propose\nthat in many tasks it could be beneficial to purposefully choose a different\ncost function for MPC to optimize: one that results in the MPC rollout having\nlow ground truth cost, rather than the MPC planned trajectory. We formalize\nthis as an optimal cost design problem, and propose a zeroth-order\noptimization-based approach that enables us to design optimal costs for an MPC\nplanning robot in continuous MDPs. We test our approach in an autonomous\ndriving domain where we find costs different from the ground truth that\nimplicitly compensate for replanning, short horizon, incorrect dynamics models,\nand local minima issues. As an example, the learned cost incentivizes MPC to\ndelay its decision until later, implicitly accounting for the fact that it will\nget more information in the future and be able to make a better decision.

          "description": "In multi-agent reinforcement learning, the inherent non-stationarity of the\nenvironment caused by other agents' actions posed significant difficulties for\nan agent to learn a good policy independently. One way to deal with\nnon-stationarity is agent modeling, by which the agent takes into consideration\nthe influence of other agents' policies. Most existing work relies on\npredicting other agents' actions or goals, or discriminating between their\npolicies. However, such modeling fails to capture the similarities and\ndifferences between policies simultaneously and thus cannot provide useful\ninformation when generalizing to unseen policies. To address this, we propose a\ngeneral method to learn representations of other agents' policies via the\njoint-action distributions sampled in interactions. The similarities and\ndifferences between policies are naturally captured by the policy distance\ninferred from the joint-action distributions and deliberately reflected in the\nlearned representations. Agents conditioned on the policy representations can\nwell generalize to unseen agents. We empirically demonstrate that our method\noutperforms existing work in multi-agent tasks when facing unseen agents.",

Where it is possible to train a Latent ODE on the\nsmooth dynamical flows between discontinuities, we apply the pruned exact\nlinear time (PELT) algorithm to detect changepoints where latent dynamics\nrestart, thereby maximizing the joint probability of a piece-wise continuous\nlatent dynamical representation. We propose usage of the marginal likelihood as\na score function for PELT, circumventing the need for model complexity-based\npenalization.

          "description": "We present a new approach ARLPCG: Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for\nProcedural Content Generation, which procedurally generates and tests\npreviously unseen environments with an auxiliary input as a control variable.\nTraining RL agents over novel environments is a notoriously difficult task. One\npopular approach is to procedurally generate different environments to increase\nthe generalizability of the trained agents. ARLPCG instead deploys an\nadversarial model with one PCG RL agent (called Generator) and one solving RL\nagent (called Solver). The Generator receives a reward signal based on the\nSolver's performance, which encourages the environment design to be challenging\nbut not impossible. To further drive diversity and control of the environment\ngeneration, we propose using auxiliary inputs for the Generator. The benefit is\ntwo-fold: Firstly, the Solver achieves better generalization through the\nGenerator's generated challenges. Secondly, the trained Generator can be used\nas a creator of novel environments that, together with the Solver, can be shown\nto be solvable. We create two types of 3D environments to validate our model,\nrepresenting two popular game genres: a third-person platformer and a racing\ngame. In these cases, we shows that ARLPCG has a significantly better solve\nratio, and that the auxiliary inputs renders the levels creation controllable\nto a certain degree.

          "description": "With the rising demand of smart mobility, ride-hailing service is getting\npopular in the urban regions. These services maintain a system for serving the\nincoming trip requests by dispatching available vehicles to the pickup points.\nAs the process should be socially and economically profitable, the task of\nvehicle dispatching is highly challenging, specially due to the time-varying\ntravel demands and traffic conditions. Due to the uneven distribution of travel\ndemands, many idle vehicles could be generated during the operation in\ndifferent subareas. Most of the existing works on vehicle dispatching system,\ndesigned static relocation centers to relocate idle vehicles. However, as\ntraffic conditions and demand distribution dynamically change over time, the\nstatic solution can not fit the evolving situations. In this paper, we propose\na dynamic future demand aware vehicle dispatching system. It can dynamically\nsearch the relocation centers considering both travel demand and traffic\nconditions. We evaluate the system on real-world dataset, and compare with the\nexisting state-of-the-art methods in our experiments in terms of several\nstandard evaluation metrics and operation time. Through our experiments, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves the serving ratio\nand with a very small increase in operation cost.",

To better design brain injury criteria, the predictive\npower of rotational kinematics factors, which are different in 1) the\nderivative order (angular velocity, angular acceleration, angular jerk), 2) the\ndirection and 3) the power (e.g., square-rooted, squared, cubic) of the angular\nvelocity, were analyzed based on different datasets including laboratory\nimpacts, American football, mixed martial arts (MMA), NHTSA automobile\ncrashworthiness tests and NASCAR crash events.

          "description": "Node embedding learns a low-dimensional representation for each node in the\ngraph. Recent progress on node embedding shows that proximity matrix\nfactorization methods gain superb performance and scale to large graphs with\nmillions of nodes. Existing approaches first define a proximity matrix and then\nlearn the embeddings that fit the proximity by matrix factorization. Most\nexisting matrix factorization methods adopt the same proximity for different\ntasks, while it is observed that different tasks and datasets may require\ndifferent proximity, limiting their representation power.\n\nMotivated by this, we propose {\\em Lemane}, a framework with trainable\nproximity measures, which can be learned to best suit the datasets and tasks at\nhand automatically. Our method is end-to-end, which incorporates differentiable\nSVD in the pipeline so that the parameters can be trained via backpropagation.\nHowever, this learning process is still expensive on large graphs. To improve\nthe scalability, we train proximity measures only on carefully subsampled\ngraphs, and then apply standard proximity matrix factorization on the original\ngraph using the learned proximity. Note that, computing the learned proximities\nfor each pair is still expensive for large graphs, and existing techniques for\ncomputing proximities are not applicable to the learned proximities. Thus, we\npresent generalized push techniques to make our solution scalable to large\ngraphs with millions of nodes.

This filter is however not invariant under translation, leading\nto visual artifacts and non-optimal shapes. We propose two embeddings of the\ninput coordinates, which lead to (approximate) spatial invariance of the NTK\nand of the filter.

Some adversarial algorithms perturb all the pixels in the\nimage minimally for the image classification task in image classification. In\ncontrast, some algorithms perturb few pixels strongly. However, very little\ninformation is available regarding why these adversarial samples so diverse\nfrom each other exist. Recently, Vargas et al. showed that the existence of\nthese adversarial samples might be due to conflicting saliency within the\nneural network. We test this hypothesis of conflicting saliency by analysing\nthe Saliency Maps (SM) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAM)\nof original and few different types of adversarial samples. We also analyse how\ndifferent adversarial samples distort the attention of the neural network\ncompared to original samples. We show that in the case of Pixel Attack,\nperturbed pixels either calls the network attention to themselves or divert the\nattention from them. Simultaneously, the Projected Gradient Descent Attack\nperturbs pixels so that intermediate layers inside the neural network lose\nattention for the correct class. We also show that both attacks affect the\nsaliency map and activation maps differently. Thus, shedding light on why some\ndefences successful against some attacks remain vulnerable against other\nattacks. We hope that this analysis will improve understanding of the existence\nand the effect of adversarial samples and enable the community to develop more\nrobust neural networks.",

In practice, some choices may be overly costly or\ntake days to train. To lift this burden, we adopt a multi-objective approach\nthat selects and adapts the hardware configuration automatically alongside\nneural architectures and their hyperparameters.

Second, we leverage hyperparameter evaluations from related\ntasks via transfer learning by building a probabilistic estimate of the Pareto\nfront that finds promising configurations more efficiently than random search.\nWe show in extensive NAS and HPO experiments that both ingredients bring\nsignificant speed-ups and cost savings, with little to no impact on accuracy.\nIn three benchmarks where hardware is selected in addition to hyperparameters,\nwe obtain runtime and cost reductions of at least 5.8x and 8.8x, respectively.\nFurthermore, when applying our multi-objective method to the tuning of\nhyperparameters only, we obtain a 10\\% improvement in runtime while maintaining\nthe same accuracy on two popular NAS benchmarks.",

          "description": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) with clustered latent spaces can\nperform conditional generation in a completely unsupervised manner. However,\nthe salient attributes of unlabeled data in the real-world are mostly\nimbalanced. Existing unsupervised conditional GANs cannot properly cluster the\nattributes in their latent spaces because they assume uniform distributions of\nthe attributes. To address this problem, we theoretically derive Stein latent\noptimization that provides reparameterizable gradient estimations of the latent\ndistribution parameters assuming a Gaussian mixture prior in a continuous\nlatent space. Structurally, we introduce an encoder network and a novel\ncontrastive loss to help generated data from a single mixture component to\nrepresent a single attribute. We confirm that the proposed method, named Stein\nLatent Optimization for GANs (SLOGAN), successfully learns the balanced or\nimbalanced attributes and performs unsupervised tasks such as unsupervised\nconditional generation, unconditional generation, and cluster assignment even\nin the absence of information of the attributes (e.g. the imbalance ratio).\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the attributes to be learned can be manipulated\nusing a small amount of probe data.",

          "description": "Normalizing flows are generative models that provide tractable density\nestimation by transforming a simple base distribution into a complex target\ndistribution. However, this technique cannot directly model data supported on\nan unknown low-dimensional manifold, a common occurrence in real-world domains\nsuch as image data. Recent attempts to remedy this limitation have introduced\ngeometric complications that defeat a central benefit of normalizing flows:\nexact density estimation.

We argue that composing a standard flow with a trainable conformal\nembedding is the most natural way to model manifold-supported data. To this\nend, we present a series of conformal building blocks and apply them in\nexperiments with real-world and synthetic data to demonstrate that flows can\nmodel manifold-supported distributions without sacrificing tractable\nlikelihoods.",

          "description": "Traffic state estimation (TSE) bifurcates into two main categories,\nmodel-driven and data-driven (e.g., machine learning, ML) approaches, while\neach suffers from either deficient physics or small data. To mitigate these\nlimitations, recent studies introduced hybrid methods, such as physics-informed\ndeep learning (PIDL), which contains both model-driven and data-driven\ncomponents. This paper contributes an improved paradigm, called\nphysics-informed deep learning with a fundamental diagram learner (PIDL+FDL),\nwhich integrates ML terms into the model-driven component to learn a functional\nform of a fundamental diagram (FD), i.e., a mapping from traffic density to\nflow or velocity. The proposed PIDL+FDL has the advantages of performing the\nTSE learning, model parameter discovery, and FD discovery simultaneously. This\npaper focuses on highway TSE with observed data from loop detectors, using\ntraffic density or velocity as traffic variables. We demonstrate the use of\nPIDL+FDL to solve popular first-order and second-order traffic flow models and\nreconstruct the FD relation as well as model parameters that are outside the FD\nterm. We then evaluate the PIDL+FDL-based TSE using the Next Generation\nSIMulation (NGSIM) dataset. The experimental results show the superiority of\nthe PIDL+FDL in terms of improved estimation accuracy and data efficiency over\nadvanced baseline TSE methods, and additionally, the capacity to properly learn\nthe unknown underlying FD relation.",

          "description": "We propose a novel framework for verifiable and compositional reinforcement\nlearning (RL) in which a collection of RL sub-systems, each of which learns to\naccomplish a separate sub-task, are composed to achieve an overall task. The\nframework consists of a high-level model, represented as a parametric Markov\ndecision process (pMDP) which is used to plan and to analyze compositions of\nsub-systems, and of the collection of low-level sub-systems themselves. By\ndefining interfaces between the sub-systems, the framework enables automatic\ndecompositons of task specifications, e.g., reach a target set of states with a\nprobability of at least 0.95, into individual sub-task specifications, i.e.\nachieve the sub-system's exit conditions with at least some minimum\nprobability, given that its entry conditions are met. This in turn allows for\nthe independent training and testing of the sub-systems; if they each learn a\npolicy satisfying the appropriate sub-task specification, then their\ncomposition is guaranteed to satisfy the overall task specification.\nConversely, if the sub-task specifications cannot all be satisfied by the\nlearned policies, we present a method, formulated as the problem of finding an\noptimal set of parameters in the pMDP, to automatically update the sub-task\nspecifications to account for the observed shortcomings. The result is an\niterative procedure for defining sub-task specifications, and for training the\nsub-systems to meet them. As an additional benefit, this procedure allows for\nparticularly challenging or important components of an overall task to be\ndetermined automatically, and focused on, during training. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the presented framework's novel capabilities.",

          "description": "We introduce a new type of programming challenge called programming puzzles,\nas an objective and comprehensive evaluation of program synthesis, and release\nan open-source dataset of Python Programming Puzzles (P3). Each puzzle is\ndefined by a short Python program $f$, and the goal is to find an input $x$\nwhich makes $f$ output \"True\". The puzzles are objective in that each one is\nspecified entirely by the source code of its verifier $f$, so evaluating $f(x)$\nis all that is needed to test a candidate solution $x$. They do not require an\nanswer key or input/output examples, nor do they depend on natural language\nunderstanding. The dataset is comprehensive in that it spans problems of a\nrange of difficulties and domains, ranging from trivial string manipulation\nproblems that are immediately obvious to human programmers (but not necessarily\nto AI), to classic programming puzzles (e.g., Towers of Hanoi), to\ninterview/competitive-programming problems (e.g., dynamic programming), to\nlongstanding open problems in algorithms and mathematics (e.g., factoring). The\nobjective nature of P3 readily supports self-supervised bootstrapping. We\ndevelop baseline enumerative program synthesis and GPT-3 solvers that are\ncapable of solving easy puzzles -- even without access to any reference\nsolutions -- by learning from their own past solutions.

          "description": "The problem of reducing processing time of large deep learning models is a\nfundamental challenge in many real-world applications. Early exit methods\nstrive towards this goal by attaching additional Internal Classifiers (ICs) to\nintermediate layers of a neural network. ICs can quickly return predictions for\neasy examples and, as a result, reduce the average inference time of the whole\nmodel. However, if a particular IC does not decide to return an answer early,\nits predictions are discarded, with its computations effectively being wasted.\nTo solve this issue, we introduce Zero Time Waste (ZTW), a novel approach in\nwhich each IC reuses predictions returned by its predecessors by (1) adding\ndirect connections between ICs and (2) combining previous outputs in an\nensemble-like manner. We conduct extensive experiments across various datasets\nand architectures to demonstrate that ZTW achieves a significantly better\naccuracy vs. inference time trade-off than other recently proposed early exit\nmethods.",

We validate our\napproach empirically on a semantic segmentation task on driving scenes.\nTransferability is tested using correlation analysis of IoU and a learned\ndiscriminator.

          "description": "Graph neural networks have been widely used on modeling graph data, achieving\nimpressive results on node classification and link prediction tasks. Yet,\nobtaining an accurate representation for a graph further requires a pooling\nfunction that maps a set of node representations into a compact form. A simple\nsum or average over all node representations considers all node features\nequally without consideration of their task relevance, and any structural\ndependencies among them. Recently proposed hierarchical graph pooling methods,\non the other hand, may yield the same representation for two different graphs\nthat are distinguished by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, as they suboptimally\npreserve information from the node features. To tackle these limitations of\nexisting graph pooling methods, we first formulate the graph pooling problem as\na multiset encoding problem with auxiliary information about the graph\nstructure, and propose a Graph Multiset Transformer (GMT) which is a multi-head\nattention based global pooling layer that captures the interaction between\nnodes according to their structural dependencies. We show that GMT satisfies\nboth injectiveness and permutation invariance, such that it is at most as\npowerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. Moreover, our methods\ncan be easily extended to the previous node clustering approaches for\nhierarchical graph pooling. Our experimental results show that GMT\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph\nclassification benchmarks with high memory and time efficiency, and obtains\neven larger performance gain on graph reconstruction and generation tasks.",

          "description": "The capability of the traditional semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods is\nfar from real-world application since they do not consider (1) class imbalance\nand (2) class distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data. This\npaper addresses such a relatively under-explored problem, imbalanced\nsemi-supervised learning, where heavily biased pseudo-labels can harm the model\nperformance. Interestingly, we find that the semantic pseudo-labels from a\nsimilarity-based classifier in feature space and the traditional pseudo-labels\nfrom the linear classifier show the complementary property. To this end, we\npropose a general pseudo-labeling framework to address the bias motivated by\nthis observation. The key idea is to class-adaptively blend the semantic\npseudo-label to the linear one, depending on the current pseudo-label\ndistribution. Thereby, the increased semantic pseudo-label component suppresses\nthe false positives in the majority classes and vice versa. We term the novel\npseudo-labeling framework for imbalanced SSL as Distribution-Aware\nSemantics-Oriented (DASO) Pseudo-label. Extensive evaluation on CIFAR10/100-LT\nand STL10-LT shows that DASO consistently outperforms both recently proposed\nre-balancing methods for label and pseudo-label.

We derive gradients with contact in this forward\nsimulation framework and speed up the computation with Jacobi iteration\ninspired by previous differentiable simulation work. To our best knowledge, we\npresent the first differentiable cloth simulator with the Coulomb law of\nfriction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our simulator in various applications,\nincluding system identification, manipulation, inverse design, and a\nreal-to-sim task. Many of our applications have not been demonstrated in\nprevious differentiable cloth simulators.

          "description": "Neuromorphic neural network processors, in the form of compute-in-memory\ncrossbar arrays of memristors, or in the form of subthreshold analog and\nmixed-signal ASICs, promise enormous advantages in compute density and energy\nefficiency for NN-based ML tasks. However, these technologies are prone to\ncomputational non-idealities, due to process variation and intrinsic device\nphysics. This degrades the task performance of networks deployed to the\nprocessor, by introducing parameter noise into the deployed model. While it is\npossible to calibrate each device, or train networks individually for each\nprocessor, these approaches are expensive and impractical for commercial\ndeployment. Alternative methods are therefore needed to train networks that are\ninherently robust against parameter variation, as a consequence of network\narchitecture and parameters. We present a new adversarial network optimisation\nalgorithm that attacks network parameters during training, and promotes robust\nperformance during inference in the face of parameter variation. Our approach\nintroduces a regularization term penalising the susceptibility of a network to\nweight perturbation. We compare against previous approaches for producing\nparameter insensitivity such as dropout, weight smoothing and introducing\nparameter noise during training. We show that our approach produces models that\nare more robust to targeted parameter variation, and equally robust to random\nparameter variation. Our approach finds minima in flatter locations in the\nweight-loss landscape compared with other approaches, highlighting that the\nnetworks found by our technique are less sensitive to parameter perturbation.\nOur work provides an approach to deploy neural network architectures to\ninference devices that suffer from computational non-idealities, with minimal\nloss of performance. ...",

          "description": "Kernel mean embedding is a useful tool to compare probability measures.\nDespite its usefulness, kernel mean embedding considers infinite-dimensional\nfeatures, which are challenging to handle in the context of differentially\nprivate data generation. A recent work proposes to approximate the kernel mean\nembedding of data distribution using finite-dimensional random features, where\nthe sensitivity of the features becomes analytically tractable. More\nimportantly, this approach significantly reduces the privacy cost, compared to\nother known privatization methods (e.g., DP-SGD), as the approximate kernel\nmean embedding of the data distribution is privatized only once and can then be\nrepeatedly used during training of a generator without incurring any further\nprivacy cost. However, the required number of random features is excessively\nhigh, often ten thousand to a hundred thousand, which worsens the sensitivity\nof the approximate kernel mean embedding. To improve the sensitivity, we\npropose to replace random features with Hermite polynomial features. Unlike the\nrandom features, the Hermite polynomial features are ordered, where the\nfeatures at the low orders contain more information on the distribution than\nthose at the high orders. Hence, a relatively low order of Hermite polynomial\nfeatures can more accurately approximate the mean embedding of the data\ndistribution compared to a significantly higher number of random features. As a\nresult, using the Hermite polynomial features, we significantly improve the\nprivacy-accuracy trade-off, reflected in the high quality and diversity of the\ngenerated data, when tested on several heterogeneous tabular datasets, as well\nas several image benchmark datasets.",

Experiments in both English and\nChinese GEC benchmarks show that aggressive decoding could yield the same\npredictions as greedy decoding but with a significant speedup for online\ninference. Its combination with the shallow decoder could offer an even higher\nonline inference speedup over the powerful Transformer baseline without quality\nloss.

          "description": "We address the problem of federated learning (FL) where users are distributed\nand partitioned into clusters. This setup captures settings where different\ngroups of users have their own objectives (learning tasks) but by aggregating\ntheir data with others in the same cluster (same learning task), they can\nleverage the strength in numbers in order to perform more efficient federated\nlearning. For this new framework of clustered federated learning, we propose\nthe Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), which alternately\nestimates the cluster identities of the users and optimizes model parameters\nfor the user clusters via gradient descent. We analyze the convergence rate of\nthis algorithm first in a linear model with squared loss and then for generic\nstrongly convex and smooth loss functions. We show that in both settings, with\ngood initialization, IFCA is guaranteed to converge, and discuss the optimality\nof the statistical error rate. In particular, for the linear model with two\nclusters, we can guarantee that our algorithm converges as long as the\ninitialization is slightly better than random. When the clustering structure is\nambiguous, we propose to train the models by combining IFCA with the weight\nsharing technique in multi-task learning. In the experiments, we show that our\nalgorithm can succeed even if we relax the requirements on initialization with\nrandom initialization and multiple restarts. We also present experimental\nresults showing that our algorithm is efficient in non-convex problems such as\nneural networks. We demonstrate the benefits of IFCA over the baselines on\nseveral clustered FL benchmarks.",

          "description": "Understanding generalization in deep learning has been one of the major\nchallenges in statistical learning theory over the last decade. While recent\nwork has illustrated that the dataset and the training algorithm must be taken\ninto account in order to obtain meaningful generalization bounds, it is still\ntheoretically not clear which properties of the data and the algorithm\ndetermine the generalization performance. In this study, we approach this\nproblem from a dynamical systems theory perspective and represent stochastic\noptimization algorithms as random iterated function systems (IFS). Well studied\nin the dynamical systems literature, under mild assumptions, such IFSs can be\nshown to be ergodic with an invariant measure that is often supported on sets\nwith a fractal structure. As our main contribution, we prove that the\ngeneralization error of a stochastic optimization algorithm can be bounded\nbased on the `complexity' of the fractal structure that underlies its invariant\nmeasure. Leveraging results from dynamical systems theory, we show that the\ngeneralization error can be explicitly linked to the choice of the algorithm\n(e.g., stochastic gradient descent -- SGD), algorithm hyperparameters (e.g.,\nstep-size, batch-size), and the geometry of the problem (e.g., Hessian of the\nloss). We further specialize our results to specific problems (e.g.,\nlinear/logistic regression, one hidden-layered neural networks) and algorithms\n(e.g., SGD and preconditioned variants), and obtain analytical estimates for\nour bound.For modern neural networks, we develop an efficient algorithm to\ncompute the developed bound and support our theory with various experiments on\nneural networks.",

          "description": "Neural Transfer Learning (TL) is becoming ubiquitous in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), thanks to its high performance on many tasks, especially in\nlow-resourced scenarios. Notably, TL is widely used for neural domain\nadaptation to transfer valuable knowledge from high-resource to low-resource\ndomains. In the standard fine-tuning scheme of TL, a model is initially\npre-trained on a source domain and subsequently fine-tuned on a target domain\nand, therefore, source and target domains are trained using the same\narchitecture. In this paper, we show through interpretation methods that such\nscheme, despite its efficiency, is suffering from a main limitation. Indeed,\nalthough capable of adapting to new domains, pre-trained neurons struggle with\nlearning certain patterns that are specific to the target domain. Moreover, we\nshed light on the hidden negative transfer occurring despite the high\nrelatedness between source and target domains, which may mitigate the final\ngain brought by transfer learning. To address these problems, we propose to\naugment the pre-trained model with normalised, weighted and randomly\ninitialised units that foster a better adaptation while maintaining the\nvaluable source knowledge. We show that our approach exhibits significant\nimprovements to the standard fine-tuning scheme for neural domain adaptation\nfrom the news domain to the social media domain on four NLP tasks:\npart-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition and morphosyntactic\ntagging.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs), while accurate, are expensive to train. Many\npractitioners, therefore, outsource the training process to third parties or\nuse pre-trained DNNs. This practice makes DNNs vulnerable to $backdoor$\n$attacks$: the third party who trains the model may act maliciously to inject\nhidden behaviors into the otherwise accurate model. Until now, the mechanism to\ninject backdoors has been limited to $poisoning$.\n\nWe argue that such a supply-chain attacker has more attack techniques\navailable. To study this hypothesis, we introduce a handcrafted attack that\ndirectly manipulates the parameters of a pre-trained model to inject backdoors.\nOur handcrafted attacker has more degrees of freedom in manipulating model\nparameters than poisoning. This makes it difficult for a defender to identify\nor remove the manipulations with straightforward methods, such as statistical\nanalysis, adding random noises to model parameters, or clipping their values\nwithin a certain range. Further, our attacker can combine the handcrafting\nprocess with additional techniques, $e.g.$, jointly optimizing a trigger\npattern, to inject backdoors into complex networks effectively$-$the\nmeet-in-the-middle attack.\n\nIn evaluations, our handcrafted backdoors remain effective across four\ndatasets and four network architectures with a success rate above 96%. Our\nbackdoored models are resilient to both parameter-level backdoor removal\ntechniques and can evade existing defenses by slightly changing the backdoor\nattack configurations. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of suppressing\nunwanted behaviors otherwise caused by poisoning. Our results suggest that\nfurther research is needed for understanding the complete space of supply-chain\nbackdoor attacks.",

          "description": "Bayesian model averaging, obtained as the expectation of a likelihood\nfunction by a posterior distribution, has been widely used for prediction,\nevaluation of uncertainty, and model selection. Various approaches have been\ndeveloped to efficiently capture the information in the posterior distribution;\none such approach is the optimization of a set of models simultaneously with\ninteraction to ensure the diversity of the individual models in the same way as\nensemble learning. A representative approach is particle variational inference\n(PVI), which uses an ensemble of models as an empirical approximation for the\nposterior distribution. PVI iteratively updates each model with a repulsion\nforce to ensure the diversity of the optimized models. However, despite its\npromising performance, a theoretical understanding of this repulsion and its\nassociation with the generalization ability remains unclear. In this paper, we\ntackle this problem in light of PAC-Bayesian analysis. First, we provide a new\nsecond-order Jensen inequality, which has the repulsion term based on the loss\nfunction. Thanks to the repulsion term, it is tighter than the standard Jensen\ninequality.

          "description": "It is often remarked that neural networks fail to increase their uncertainty\nwhen predicting on data far from the training distribution. Yet naively using\nsoftmax confidence as a proxy for uncertainty achieves modest success in tasks\nexclusively testing for this, e.g., out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. This\npaper investigates this contradiction, identifying two implicit biases that do\nencourage softmax confidence to correlate with epistemic uncertainty: 1)\nApproximately optimal decision boundary structure, and 2) Filtering effects of\ndeep networks. It describes why low-dimensional intuitions about softmax\nconfidence are misleading.

          "description": "A central challenge in training classification models in the real-world\nfederated system is learning with non-IID data. To cope with this, most of the\nexisting works involve enforcing regularization in local optimization or\nimproving the model aggregation scheme at the server. Other works also share\npublic datasets or synthesized samples to supplement the training of\nunder-represented classes or introduce a certain level of personalization.\nThough effective, they lack a deep understanding of how the data heterogeneity\naffects each layer of a deep classification model. In this paper, we bridge\nthis gap by performing an experimental analysis of the representations learned\nby different layers. Our observations are surprising: (1) there exists a\ngreater bias in the classifier than other layers, and (2) the classification\nperformance can be significantly improved by post-calibrating the classifier\nafter federated training. Motivated by the above findings, we propose a novel\nand simple algorithm called Classifier Calibration with Virtual Representations\n(CCVR), which adjusts the classifier using virtual representations sampled from\nan approximated gaussian mixture model. Experimental results demonstrate that\nCCVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular federated learning\nbenchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10. We hope that our simple\nyet effective method can shed some light on the future research of federated\nlearning with non-IID data.",

On the other hand,\nmodern data augmentation methods for classification consider two or more\nexamples at a time.

          "description": "As a generic modeling tool, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been\nwidely employed in image generation and translation tasks. However, when fed\nwith a flat input, current CNN models may fail to generate vivid results due to\nthe spatially shared convolution kernels. We call it the flatness degradation\nof CNNs. Unfortunately, such degradation is the greatest obstacles to generate\na spatially-variant output from a flat input, which has been barely discussed\nin the previous literature. To tackle this problem, we propose a model agnostic\nsolution, i.e. Noise Incentive Block (NIB), which serves as a generic plug-in\nfor any CNN generation model. The key idea is to break the flat input condition\nwhile keeping the intactness of the original information. Specifically, the NIB\nperturbs the input data symmetrically with a noise map and reassembles them in\nthe feature domain as driven by the objective function. Extensive experiments\nshow that existing CNN models equipped with NIB survive from the flatness\ndegradation and are able to generate visually better results with richer\ndetails in some specific image generation tasks given flat inputs, e.g.\nsemantic image synthesis, data-hidden image generation, and deep neural\ndithering.",

The core approach is to render individual rays by\nquerying a neural network at points sampled along the ray to obtain the density\nand colour of the sampled points, and integrating this information using the\nrendering equation. Since dense sampling is computationally prohibitive, a\ncommon solution is to perform coarse-to-fine sampling.\n\nIn this work we address a clear limitation of the vanilla coarse-to-fine\napproach -- that it is based on a heuristic and not trained end-to-end for the\ntask at hand.

From the classical perspective, however, much fewer parameters are\nsufficient for optimal estimation and prediction, whereas overparametrization\ncan be harmful even in the presence of explicit regularization. To reconcile\nthis conflict, we present a generalization theory for overparametrized ReLU\nnetworks by incorporating an explicit regularizer based on the scaled variation\nnorm. Interestingly, this regularizer is equivalent to the ridge from the angle\nof gradient-based optimization, but is similar to the group lasso in terms of\ncontrolling model complexity. By exploiting this ridge-lasso duality, we show\nthat overparametrization is generally harmless to two-layer ReLU networks. In\nparticular, the overparametrized estimators are minimax optimal up to a\nlogarithmic factor.

The Local SGD method, proposed and analyzed in the earlier\nliterature, suggests machines should make many local steps between such\ncommunications. While the initial analysis of Local SGD showed it needs $\\Omega\n( \\sqrt{T} )$ communications for $T$ local gradient steps in order for the\nerror to scale proportionately to $1/(NT)$, this has been successively improved\nin a string of papers, with the state-of-the-art requiring $\\Omega \\left( N\n\\left( \\mbox{ polynomial in log } (T) \\right) \\right)$ communications. In this\npaper, we suggest a Local SGD scheme that communicates less overall by\ncommunicating less frequently as the number of iterations grows. Our analysis\nshows that this can achieve an error that scales as $1/(NT)$ with a number of\ncommunications that is completely independent of $T$. In particular, we show\nthat $\\Omega(N)$ communications are sufficient. Empirical evidence suggests\nthis bound is close to tight as we further show that $\\sqrt{N}$ or $N^{3/4}$\ncommunications fail to achieve linear speed-up in simulations. Moreover, we\nshow that under mild assumptions, the main of which is twice differentiability\non any neighborhood of the optimal solution, one-shot averaging which only uses\na single round of communication can also achieve the optimal convergence rate\nasymptotically.",

          "description": "Scalability of graph neural networks remains one of the major challenges in\ngraph machine learning. Since the representation of a node is computed by\nrecursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its\nneighboring nodes from previous layers, the receptive fields grow\nexponentially, which makes standard stochastic optimization techniques\nineffective. Various approaches have been proposed to alleviate this issue,\ne.g., sampling-based methods and techniques based on pre-computation of graph\nfilters.\n\nIn this paper, we take a different approach and propose to use graph\ncoarsening for scalable training of GNNs, which is generic, extremely simple\nand has sublinear memory and time costs during training. We present extensive\ntheoretical analysis on the effect of using coarsening operations and provides\nuseful guidance on the choice of coarsening methods. Interestingly, our\ntheoretical analysis shows that coarsening can also be considered as a type of\nregularization and may improve the generalization. Finally, empirical results\non real world datasets show that, simply applying off-the-shelf coarsening\nmethods, we can reduce the number of nodes by up to a factor of ten without\ncausing a noticeable downgrade in classification accuracy.",

By performing experiments in their environment, they are able to\ndiscern the causal factors of variation and infer how they affect the world's\ndynamics. Inspired by this, we attempt to equip reinforcement learning agents\nwith the ability to perform experiments that facilitate a categorization of the\nrolled-out trajectories, and to subsequently infer the causal factors of the\nenvironment in a hierarchical manner. We introduce {\\em causal curiosity}, a\nnovel intrinsic reward, and show that it allows our agents to learn optimal\nsequences of actions and discover causal factors in the dynamics of the\nenvironment. The learned behavior allows the agents to infer a binary quantized\nrepresentation for the ground-truth causal factors in every environment.\nAdditionally, we find that these experimental behaviors are semantically\nmeaningful (e.g., our agents learn to lift blocks to categorize them by\nweight), and are learnt in a self-supervised manner with approximately 2.5\ntimes less data than conventional supervised planners. We show that these\nbehaviors can be re-purposed and fine-tuned (e.g., from lifting to pushing or\nother downstream tasks).

          "description": "Hierarchy and compositionality are common latent properties in many natural\nand scientific datasets. Determining when a deep network's hidden activations\nrepresent hierarchy and compositionality is important both for understanding\ndeep representation learning and for applying deep networks in domains where\ninterpretability is crucial. However, current benchmark machine learning\ndatasets either have little hierarchical or compositional structure, or the\nstructure is not known. This gap impedes precise analysis of a network's\nrepresentations and thus hinders development of new methods that can learn such\nproperties. To address this gap, we developed a new benchmark dataset with\nknown hierarchical and compositional structure. The Hangul Fonts Dataset (HFD)\nis comprised of 35 fonts from the Korean writing system (Hangul), each with\n11,172 blocks (syllables) composed from the product of initial consonant,\nmedial vowel, and final consonant glyphs. All blocks can be grouped into a few\ngeometric types which induces a hierarchy across blocks. In addition, each\nblock is composed of individual glyphs with rotations, translations, scalings,\nand naturalistic style variation across fonts. We find that both shallow and\ndeep unsupervised methods only show modest evidence of hierarchy and\ncompositionality in their representations of the HFD compared to supervised\ndeep networks. Supervised deep network representations contain structure\nrelated to the geometrical hierarchy of the characters, but the compositional\nstructure of the data is not evident. Thus, HFD enables the identification of\nshortcomings in existing methods, a critical first step toward developing new\nmachine learning algorithms to extract hierarchical and compositional structure\nin the context of naturalistic variability.",

          "description": "Evaluating the worst-case performance of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent\nunder the strongest/optimal adversarial perturbations on state observations\n(within some constraints) is crucial for understanding the robustness of RL\nagents. However, finding the optimal adversary is challenging, in terms of both\nwhether we can find the optimal attack and how efficiently we can find it.\nExisting works on adversarial RL either use heuristics-based methods that may\nnot find the strongest adversary, or directly train an RL-based adversary by\ntreating the agent as a part of the environment, which can find the optimal\nadversary but may become intractable in a large state space. In this paper, we\npropose a novel attacking algorithm which has an RL-based \"director\" searching\nfor the optimal policy perturbation, and an \"actor\" crafting state\nperturbations following the directions from the director (i.e. the actor\nexecutes targeted attacks). Our proposed algorithm, PA-AD, is theoretically\noptimal against an RL agent and significantly improves the efficiency compared\nwith prior RL-based works in environments with large or pixel state spaces.\nEmpirical results show that our proposed PA-AD universally outperforms\nstate-of-the-art attacking methods in a wide range of environments.

We identify two\nconditions on the transformation. One is a group representation condition that\nis necessary for path integration. The other is an isotropic scaling condition\nthat ensures locally conformal embedding, so that the error in the vector\nrepresentation translates proportionally to the error in the 2D self-position.\nThen we investigate the simplest transformation, i.e., the linear\ntransformation, uncover its explicit algebraic and geometric structure as\nmatrix Lie group of rotation, and establish the connection between the\nisotropic scaling condition and hexagon grid patterns of grid cells under the\nlinear transformation.

          "description": "Background: Keyword extraction is a popular research topic in the field of\nnatural language processing. Keywords are terms that describe the most relevant\ninformation in a document. The main problem that researchers are facing is how\nto efficiently and accurately extract the core keywords from a document.\nHowever, previous keyword extraction approaches have utilized the text and\ngraph features, there is the lack of models that can properly learn and combine\nthese features in a best way.\n\nMethods: In this paper, we develop a multimodal Key-phrase extraction\napproach, namely Phraseformer, using transformer and graph embedding\ntechniques. In Phraseformer, each keyword candidate is presented by a vector\nwhich is the concatenation of the text and structure learning representations.\nPhraseformer takes the advantages of recent researches such as BERT and ExEm to\npreserve both representations. Also, the Phraseformer treats the key-phrase\nextraction task as a sequence labeling problem solved using classification\ntask.\n\nResults: We analyze the performance of Phraseformer on three datasets\nincluding Inspec, SemEval2010 and SemEval 2017 by F1-score. Also, we\ninvestigate the performance of different classifiers on Phraseformer method\nover Inspec dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nPhraseformer method over the three datasets used. Additionally, the Random\nForest classifier gain the highest F1-score among all classifiers.\n\nConclusions: Due to the fact that the combination of BERT and ExEm is more\nmeaningful and can better represent the semantic of words. Hence, Phraseformer\nsignificantly outperforms single-modality methods.",

          "description": "We present a novel, fast differentiable simulator for soft-body learning and\ncontrol applications. Existing differentiable soft-body simulators can be\nclassified into two categories based on their time integration methods:\nSimulators using explicit time-stepping scheme require tiny time steps to avoid\nnumerical instabilities in gradient computation, and simulators using implicit\ntime integration typically compute gradients by employing the adjoint method\nand solving the expensive linearized dynamics. Inspired by Projective Dynamics\n(PD), we present Differentiable Projective Dynamics (DiffPD), an efficient\ndifferentiable soft-body simulator based on PD with implicit time integration.\nThe key idea in DiffPD is to speed up backpropagation by exploiting the\nprefactorized Cholesky decomposition in forward PD simulation. In terms of\ncontact handling, DiffPD supports two types of contacts: a penalty-based model\ndescribing contact and friction forces and a complementarity-based model\nenforcing non-penetration conditions and static friction. We evaluate the\nperformance of DiffPD and observe it is 4-19 times faster compared to the\nstandard Newton's method in various applications including system\nidentification, inverse design problems, trajectory optimization, and\nclosed-loop control. We also apply DiffPD in a real-to-sim example with contact\nand collisions and show its capability of reconstructing a digital twin of\nreal-world scenes.",

However, the situation is very\ndifferent for distant language pairs. Lack of lexical overlap and low syntactic\nsimilarities such as between English and Indo-Aryan languages leads to poor\ntranslation quality in existing UNMT systems. In this paper, we show that\ninitializing the embedding layer of UNMT models with cross-lingual embeddings\nshows significant improvements in BLEU score over existing approaches with\nembeddings randomly initialized. Further, static embeddings (freezing the\nembedding layer weights) lead to better gains compared to updating the\nembedding layer weights during training (non-static). We experimented using\nMasked Sequence to Sequence (MASS) and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) UNMT\napproaches for three distant language pairs. The proposed cross-lingual\nembedding initialization yields BLEU score improvement of as much as ten times\nover the baseline for English-Hindi, English-Bengali, and English-Gujarati.

          "description": "Measuring and promoting policy diversity is critical for solving games with\nstrong non-transitive dynamics where strategic cycles exist, and there is no\nconsistent winner (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors). With that in mind, maintaining a\npool of diverse policies via open-ended learning is an attractive solution,\nwhich can generate auto-curricula to avoid being exploited. However, in\nconventional open-ended learning algorithms, there are no widely accepted\ndefinitions for diversity, making it hard to construct and evaluate the diverse\npolicies. In this work, we summarize previous concepts of diversity and work\ntowards offering a unified measure of diversity in multi-agent open-ended\nlearning to include all elements in Markov games, based on both Behavioral\nDiversity (BD) and Response Diversity (RD). At the trajectory distribution\nlevel, we re-define BD in the state-action space as the discrepancies of\noccupancy measures. For the reward dynamics, we propose RD to characterize\ndiversity through the responses of policies when encountering different\nopponents. We also show that many current diversity measures fall in one of the\ncategories of BD or RD but not both. With this unified diversity measure, we\ndesign the corresponding diversity-promoting objective and population\neffectivity when seeking the best responses in open-ended learning. We validate\nour methods in both relatively simple games like matrix game, non-transitive\nmixture model, and the complex \\textit{Google Research Football} environment.\nThe population found by our methods reveals the lowest exploitability, highest\npopulation effectivity in matrix game and non-transitive mixture model, as well\nas the largest goal difference when interacting with opponents of various\nlevels in \\textit{Google Research Football}.",

This paper extends the setting to a multivariate Gaussian\nprocess where the basis functions are weighted with Gaussian graphical vectors.\nWe motivate a model where the basis functions represent different levels of\nresolution and the graphical vectors for each level are assumed to be\nindependent. Using an orthogonal basis grants linear complexity and memory\nusage in the number of spatial locations, the number of basis functions, and\nthe number of realizations. An additional fusion penalty encourages a\nparsimonious conditional independence structure in the multilevel graphical\nmodel.

In this problem, there is a user\nthat wishes to obtain $L$ independent linear combinations of a $D$-subset of\nmessages belonging to a dataset of $K$ messages stored on a single server. The\ngoal is to minimize the download cost while keeping the identity of each\nmessage required for the computation individually private. The individual\nprivacy requirement ensures that the identity of each individual message\nrequired for the computation is kept private. This is in contrast to the\nstricter notion of joint privacy that protects the entire set of identities of\nall messages used for the computation, including the correlations between these\nidentities. The notion of individual privacy captures a broad set of practical\napplications. For example, such notion is relevant when the dataset contains\ninformation about individuals, each of them requires privacy guarantees for\ntheir data access patterns. We focus on the setting in which the required\nlinear transformation is associated with a maximum distance separable (MDS)\nmatrix. In particular, we require that the matrix of coefficients pertaining to\nthe required linear combinations is the generator matrix of an MDS code. We\nestablish lower and upper bounds on the capacity of PLT with individual\nprivacy, where the capacity is defined as the supremum of all achievable\ndownload rates.

Unfortunately, this means that the model's\napproximation quality can rapidly degenerate outside some compact subset of\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$, as any such measure is largely concentrated on some bounded\nsubset of $\\mathbb{R}^d$. This paper proposes a generic solution to this\napproximation theoretic problem by introducing a canonical transformation which\n\"upgrades $\\mathscr{F}$'s approximation property\" in the following sense. The\ntransformed model class, denoted by $\\mathscr{F}\\text{-tope}$, is shown to be\ndense in $L^p_{\\mu,\\text{strict}}(\\mathbb{R}^d,\\mathbb{R}^D)$ which is a\ntopological space whose elements are locally $p$-integrable functions and whose\ntopology is much finer than usual norm topology on\n$L^p_{\\mu}(\\mathbb{R}^d,\\mathbb{R}^D)$; here $\\mu$ is any suitable\n$\\sigma$-finite Borel measure $\\mu$ on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Next, we show that if\n$\\mathscr{F}$ is any family of analytic functions then there is always a strict\n\"gap\" between $\\mathscr{F}\\text{-tope}$'s expressibility and that of\n$\\mathscr{F}$, since we find that $\\mathscr{F}$ can never dense in\n$L^p_{\\mu,\\text{strict}}(\\mathbb{R}^d,\\mathbb{R}^D)$. In the general case,\nwhere $\\mathscr{F}$ may contain non-analytic functions, we provide an abstract\nform of these results guaranteeing that there always exists some function space\nin which $\\mathscr{F}\\text{-tope}$ is dense but $\\mathscr{F}$ is not, while,\nthe converse is never possible.

          "description": "Current machine learning algorithms are designed to work with huge volumes of\nhigh dimensional data such as images. However, these algorithms are being\nincreasingly deployed to resource constrained systems such as mobile devices\nand embedded systems. Even in cases where large computing infrastructure is\navailable, the size of each data instance, as well as datasets, can be a\nbottleneck in data transfer across communication channels. Also, there is a\nhuge incentive both in energy and monetary terms in reducing both the\ncomputational and memory requirements of these algorithms. For nonparametric\nmodels that require to leverage the stored training data at inference time, the\nincreased cost in memory and computation could be even more problematic. In\nthis work, we aim to reduce the volume of data these algorithms must process\nthrough an end-to-end two-stage neural subset selection model. We first\nefficiently obtain a subset of candidate elements by sampling a mask from a\nconditionally independent Bernoulli distribution, and then autoregressivley\nconstruct a subset consisting of the most task relevant elements via sampling\nthe elements from a conditional Categorical distribution. We validate our\nmethod on set reconstruction and classification tasks with feature selection as\nwell as the selection of representative samples from a given dataset, on which\nour method outperforms relevant baselines. We also show in our experiments that\nour method enhances scalability of nonparametric models such as Neural\nProcesses.",

          "description": "Zero-shot intent detection (ZSID) aims to deal with the continuously emerging\nintents without annotated training data. However, existing ZSID systems suffer\nfrom two limitations: 1) They are not good at modeling the relationship between\nseen and unseen intents. 2) They cannot effectively recognize unseen intents\nunder the generalized intent detection (GZSID) setting. A critical problem\nbehind these limitations is that the representations of unseen intents cannot\nbe learned in the training stage. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nframework that utilizes unseen class labels to learn Class-Transductive Intent\nRepresentations (CTIR). Specifically, we allow the model to predict unseen\nintents during training, with the corresponding label names serving as input\nutterances. On this basis, we introduce a multi-task learning objective, which\nencourages the model to learn the distinctions among intents, and a similarity\nscorer, which estimates the connections among intents more accurately. CTIR is\neasy to implement and can be integrated with existing methods. Experiments on\ntwo real-world datasets show that CTIR brings considerable improvement to the\nbaseline systems.",

In this paper, we introduce\nMulti-Facet Clustering Variational Autoencoders (MFCVAE), a novel class of\nvariational autoencoders with a hierarchy of latent variables, each with a\nMixture-of-Gaussians prior, that learns multiple clusterings simultaneously,\nand is trained fully unsupervised and end-to-end.

This paper proposes a 3D CNN ordinal model for assessing the\nlevel or neurological damage in PD patients.

We consider the Ordinal Graph-based\nOversampling via Shortest Paths (OGO-SP) method, which applies a gamma\nprobability distribution for inter-class data generation. A modification of\nOGO-SP is proposed, the OGO-SP-$\\beta$ algorithm, which applies the beta\ndistribution for generating synthetic samples in the inter-class region, a\nbetter suited distribution when compared to gamma. The evaluation of the\ndifferent methods is based on a novel 3D image dataset provided by the Hospital\nUniversitario 'Reina Sof\\'ia' (C\\'ordoba, Spain).

Although center manifold theory guarantees the existence of such\nlow-dimensional normal forms, finding them has remained a long standing\nchallenge. In this work, we introduce deep learning autoencoders to discover\ncoordinate transformations that capture the underlying parametric dependence of\na dynamical system in terms of its canonical normal form, allowing for a simple\nrepresentation of the parametric dependence and bifurcation structure. The\nautoencoder constrains the latent variable to adhere to a given normal form,\nthus allowing it to learn the appropriate coordinate transformation. We\ndemonstrate the method on a number of example problems, showing that it can\ncapture a diverse set of normal forms associated with Hopf, pitchfork,\ntranscritical and/or saddle node bifurcations. This method shows how normal\nforms can be leveraged as canonical and universal building blocks in deep\nlearning approaches for model discovery and reduced-order modeling.",

To this end, we study the case of object\ndetection and, instead of following the standard detector-to-detector\ndistillation approach, introduce a classifier-to-detector knowledge transfer\nframework. In particular, we propose strategies to exploit the classification\nteacher to improve both the detector's recognition accuracy and localization\nperformance. Our experiments on several detectors with different backbones\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, allowing us to outperform the\nstate-of-the-art detector-to-detector distillation methods.",

          "description": "Using logical clauses to represent patterns, Tsetlin Machines (TMs) have\nrecently obtained competitive performance in terms of accuracy, memory\nfootprint, energy, and learning speed on several benchmarks. Each TM clause\nvotes for or against a particular class, with classification resolved using a\nmajority vote. While the evaluation of clauses is fast, being based on binary\noperators, the voting makes it necessary to synchronize the clause evaluation,\nimpeding parallelization. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for\ndesynchronizing the evaluation of clauses, eliminating the voting bottleneck.\nIn brief, every clause runs in its own thread for massive native parallelism.\nFor each training example, we keep track of the class votes obtained from the\nclauses in local voting tallies. The local voting tallies allow us to detach\nthe processing of each clause from the rest of the clauses, supporting\ndecentralized learning. This means that the TM most of the time will operate on\noutdated voting tallies. We evaluated the proposed parallelization across\ndiverse learning tasks and it turns out that our decentralized TM learning\nalgorithm copes well with working on outdated data, resulting in no significant\nloss in learning accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach\nprovides up to 50 times faster learning. Finally, learning time is almost\nconstant for reasonable clause amounts (employing from 20 to 7,000 clauses on a\nTesla V100 GPU). For sufficiently large clause numbers, computation time\nincreases approximately proportionally. Our parallel and asynchronous\narchitecture thus allows processing of massive datasets and operating with more\nclauses for higher accuracy.",

          "description": "Error feedback (EF), also known as error compensation, is an immensely\npopular convergence stabilization mechanism in the context of distributed\ntraining of supervised machine learning models enhanced by the use of\ncontractive communication compression mechanisms, such as Top-$k$. First\nproposed by Seide et al (2014) as a heuristic, EF resisted any theoretical\nunderstanding until recently [Stich et al., 2018, Alistarh et al., 2018].\nHowever, all existing analyses either i) apply to the single node setting only,\nii) rely on very strong and often unreasonable assumptions, such global\nboundedness of the gradients, or iterate-dependent assumptions that cannot be\nchecked a-priori and may not hold in practice, or iii) circumvent these issues\nvia the introduction of additional unbiased compressors, which increase the\ncommunication cost. In this work we fix all these deficiencies by proposing and\nanalyzing a new EF mechanism, which we call EF21, which consistently and\nsubstantially outperforms EF in practice. Our theoretical analysis relies on\nstandard assumptions only, works in the distributed heterogeneous data setting,\nand leads to better and more meaningful rates. In particular, we prove that\nEF21 enjoys a fast $O(1/T)$ convergence rate for smooth nonconvex problems,\nbeating the previous bound of $O(1/T^{2/3})$, which was shown a bounded\ngradients assumption. We further improve this to a fast linear rate for PL\nfunctions, which is the first linear convergence result for an EF-type method\nnot relying on unbiased compressors. Since EF has a large number of\napplications where it reigns supreme, we believe that our 2021 variant, EF21,\ncan a large impact on the practice of communication efficient distributed\nlearning.",

          "description": "We combine two advanced ideas widely used in optimization for machine\nlearning: shuffling strategy and momentum technique to develop a novel\nshuffling gradient-based method with momentum, coined Shuffling Momentum\nGradient (SMG), for non-convex finite-sum optimization problems. While our\nmethod is inspired by momentum techniques, its update is fundamentally\ndifferent from existing momentum-based methods. We establish state-of-the-art\nconvergence rates of SMG for any shuffling strategy using either constant or\ndiminishing learning rate under standard assumptions (i.e.$L$-smoothness and\nbounded variance). When the shuffling strategy is fixed, we develop another new\nalgorithm that is similar to existing momentum methods, and prove the same\nconvergence rates for this algorithm under the $L$-smoothness and bounded\ngradient assumptions. We demonstrate our algorithms via numerical simulations\non standard datasets and compare them with existing shuffling methods. Our\ntests have shown encouraging performance of the new algorithms.",

While the objective of most (local) graph clustering algorithms is to\nfind a vertex set of low conductance, there has been a sequence of recent\nstudies that highlight the importance of the inter-connection between clusters\nwhen analysing real-world datasets. Following this line of research, in this\nwork we study local algorithms for finding a pair of vertex sets defined with\nrespect to their inter-connection and their relationship with the rest of the\ngraph.

          "description": "This paper presents a new approach for assembling graph neural networks based\non framelet transforms. The latter provides a multi-scale representation for\ngraph-structured data. We decompose an input graph into low-pass and high-pass\nfrequencies coefficients for network training, which then defines a\nframelet-based graph convolution. The framelet decomposition naturally induces\na graph pooling strategy by aggregating the graph feature into low-pass and\nhigh-pass spectra, which considers both the feature values and geometry of the\ngraph data and conserves the total information. The graph neural networks with\nthe proposed framelet convolution and pooling achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance in many node and graph prediction tasks. Moreover, we propose\nshrinkage as a new activation for the framelet convolution, which thresholds\nhigh-frequency information at different scales. Compared to ReLU, shrinkage\nactivation improves model performance on denoising and signal compression:\nnoises in both node and structure can be significantly reduced by accurately\ncutting off the high-pass coefficients from framelet decomposition, and the\nsignal can be compressed to less than half its original size with\nwell-preserved prediction performance.",

We formulate the\nmembership privacy risk as a statistical divergence between training samples\nand hold-out samples, and propose sample-based methods to estimate this\ndivergence. Unlike previous works, our proposed metric and estimators make\nrealistic and flexible assumptions. First, we offer a generalizable metric as\nan alternative to accuracy for imbalanced datasets. Second, our estimators are\ncapable of estimating the membership privacy risk given any scalar or vector\nvalued attributes from the learned model, while prior work require access to\nspecific attributes. This allows our framework to provide data-driven\ncertificates for trained generative models in terms of membership privacy risk.\nFinally, we show a connection to differential privacy, which allows our\nproposed estimators to be used to understand the privacy budget 'epsilon'\nneeded for differentially private generative models. We demonstrate the utility\nof our framework through experimental demonstrations on different generative\nmodels using various model attributes yielding some new insights about\nmembership leakage and vulnerabilities of models.",

To derive a robust optimization model, a\ncentral ingredient is to identify a suitable model for uncertainty, which is\ncalled the uncertainty set, containing all scenarios against which we wish to\nprotect. An ongoing challenge in the recent literature is to derive uncertainty\nsets from given historical data.\n\nIn this paper we use an unsupervised deep learning method to construct\nnon-convex uncertainty sets from data, which have a more complex structure than\nthe typically considered sets. We prove that most of the classical uncertainty\nclasses are special cases of our derived sets and that optimizing over it is\nstrongly NP-hard. Nevertheless we show that the trained neural networks can be\nintegrated into a robust optimization model by formulating the adversarial\nproblem as a convex quadratic mixed-integer program. This allows us to derive\nrobust solutions through an iterative scenario generation process. We prove\nthat our class of uncertainty sets contains In extensive computational\nexperiments, we compare this approach to a similar approach, which derives\nuncertainty sets by kernel-based support vector clustering.

We propose diff\npruning as a simple approach to enable parameter-efficient transfer learning\nwithin the pretrain-finetune framework. This approach views finetuning as\nlearning a task-specific diff vector that is applied on top of the pretrained\nparameter vector, which remains fixed and is shared across different tasks. The\ndiff vector is adaptively pruned during training with a differentiable\napproximation to the L0-norm penalty to encourage sparsity. Diff pruning\nbecomes parameter-efficient as the number of tasks increases, as it requires\nstoring only the nonzero positions and weights of the diff vector for each\ntask, while the cost of storing the shared pretrained model remains constant.\nIt further does not require access to all tasks during training, which makes it\nattractive in settings where tasks arrive in stream or the set of tasks is\nunknown. We find that models finetuned with diff pruning can match the\nperformance of fully finetuned baselines on the GLUE benchmark while only\nmodifying 0.5% of the pretrained model's parameters per task.",

          "description": "Language is an outcome of our complex and dynamic human-interactions and the\ntechnique of natural language processing (NLP) is hence built on human\nlinguistic activities. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n(BERT) has recently gained its popularity by establishing the state-of-the-art\nscores in several NLP benchmarks. A Lite BERT (ALBERT) is literally\ncharacterized as a lightweight version of BERT, in which the number of BERT\nparameters is reduced by repeatedly applying the same neural network called\nTransformer's encoder layer. By pre-training the parameters with a massive\namount of natural language data, ALBERT can convert input sentences into\nversatile high-dimensional vectors potentially capable of solving multiple NLP\ntasks. In that sense, ALBERT can be regarded as a well-designed\nhigh-dimensional dynamical system whose operator is the Transformer's encoder,\nand essential structures of human language are thus expected to be encapsulated\nin its dynamics. In this study, we investigated the embedded properties of\nALBERT to reveal how NLP tasks are effectively solved by exploiting its\ndynamics. We thereby aimed to explore the nature of human language from the\ndynamical expressions of the NLP model. Our short-term analysis clarified that\nthe pre-trained model stably yields trajectories with higher dimensionality,\nwhich would enhance the expressive capacity required for NLP tasks. Also, our\nlong-term analysis revealed that ALBERT intrinsically shows transient chaos, a\ntypical nonlinear phenomenon showing chaotic dynamics only in its transient,\nand the pre-trained ALBERT model tends to produce the chaotic trajectory for a\nsignificantly longer time period compared to a randomly-initialized one. Our\nresults imply that local chaoticity would contribute to improving NLP\nperformance, uncovering a novel aspect in the role of chaotic dynamics in human\nlanguage behaviors.",

This paper\nsuggests taking advantage of developing an XAI general approach that allows\nproducing explanations for an ML system behaviour in terms of different and\nuser-selected input features, i.e., explanations composed of input properties\nthat the human user can select according to his background knowledge and goals.\nTo this end, we propose an XAI general approach which is able: 1) to construct\nexplanations in terms of input features that represent more salient and\nunderstandable input properties for a user, which we call here Middle-Level\ninput Features (MLFs), 2) to be applied to different types of MLFs. We\nexperimentally tested our approach on two different datasets and using three\ndifferent types of MLFs. The results seem encouraging.",

          "description": "Efficient gradient computation of the Jacobian determinant term is a core\nproblem in many machine learning settings, and especially so in the normalizing\nflow framework. Most proposed flow models therefore either restrict to a\nfunction class with easy evaluation of the Jacobian determinant, or an\nefficient estimator thereof. However, these restrictions limit the performance\nof such density models, frequently requiring significant depth to reach desired\nperformance levels. In this work, we propose Self Normalizing Flows, a flexible\nframework for training normalizing flows by replacing expensive terms in the\ngradient by learned approximate inverses at each layer. This reduces the\ncomputational complexity of each layer's exact update from $\\mathcal{O}(D^3)$\nto $\\mathcal{O}(D^2)$, allowing for the training of flow architectures which\nwere otherwise computationally infeasible, while also providing efficient\nsampling. We show experimentally that such models are remarkably stable and\noptimize to similar data likelihood values as their exact gradient\ncounterparts, while training more quickly and surpassing the performance of\nfunctionally constrained counterparts.",

          "description": "In the past few years, significant advancements were made in reconstruction\nof observed natural images from fMRI brain recordings using deep-learning\ntools. Here, for the first time, we show that dense 3D depth maps of observed\n2D natural images can also be recovered directly from fMRI brain recordings. We\nuse an off-the-shelf method to estimate the unknown depth maps of natural\nimages. This is applied to both: (i) the small number of images presented to\nsubjects in an fMRI scanner (images for which we have fMRI recordings -\nreferred to as \"paired\" data), and (ii) a very large number of natural images\nwith no fMRI recordings (\"unpaired data\"). The estimated depth maps are then\nused as an auxiliary reconstruction criterion to train for depth reconstruction\ndirectly from fMRI. We propose two main approaches: Depth-only recovery and\njoint image-depth RGBD recovery. Because the number of available \"paired\"\ntraining data (images with fMRI) is small, we enrich the training data via\nself-supervised cycle-consistent training on many \"unpaired\" data (natural\nimages & depth maps without fMRI). This is achieved using our newly defined and\ntrained Depth-based Perceptual Similarity metric as a reconstruction criterion.\nWe show that predicting the depth map directly from fMRI outperforms its\nindirect sequential recovery from the reconstructed images. We further show\nthat activations from early cortical visual areas dominate our depth\nreconstruction results, and propose means to characterize fMRI voxels by their\ndegree of depth-information tuning. This work adds an important layer of\ndecoded information, extending the current envelope of visual brain decoding\ncapabilities.",

          "description": "An exciting recent development is the uptake of deep learning in many\nscientific fields, where the objective is seeking novel scientific insights and\ndiscoveries. To interpret a learning outcome, researchers perform hypothesis\ntesting for explainable features to advance scientific domain knowledge. In\nsuch a situation, testing for a blackbox learner poses a severe challenge\nbecause of intractable models, unknown limiting distributions of parameter\nestimates, and high computational constraints. In this article, we derive two\nconsistent tests for the feature relevance of a blackbox learner. The first one\nevaluates a loss difference with perturbation on an inference sample, which is\nindependent of an estimation sample used for parameter estimation in model\nfitting. The second further splits the inference sample into two but does not\nrequire data perturbation. Also, we develop their combined versions by\naggregating the order statistics of the $p$-values based on repeated sample\nsplitting. To estimate the splitting ratio and the perturbation size, we\ndevelop adaptive splitting schemes for suitably controlling the Type \\rom{1}\nerror subject to computational constraints. By deflating the\n\\textit{bias-sd-ratio}, we establish asymptotic null distributions of the test\nstatistics and their consistency in terms of statistical power. Our theoretical\npower analysis and simulations indicate that the one-split test is more\npowerful than the two-split test, though the latter is easier to apply for\nlarge datasets. Moreover, the combined tests are more stable while compensating\nfor a power loss by repeated sample splitting. Numerically, we demonstrate the\nutility of the proposed tests on two benchmark examples. Accompanying this\npaper is our Python library {\\tt dnn-inference}\nhttps://dnn-inference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ that implements the proposed\ntests.",

An\nobstacle for their deployment over new modalities is the architectural\nconfiguration: the optimal depth-to-width ratio has been shown to dramatically\nvary across data types (e.g., $10$x larger over images than over language). We\ntheoretically predict the existence of an embedding rank bottleneck that limits\nthe contribution of self-attention width to the Transformer expressivity. We\nthus directly tie the input vocabulary size and rank to the optimal\ndepth-to-width ratio, since a small vocabulary size or rank dictates an added\nadvantage of depth over width. We empirically demonstrate the existence of this\nbottleneck and its implications on the depth-to-width interplay of Transformer\narchitectures, linking the architecture variability across domains to the often\nglossed-over usage of different vocabulary sizes or embedding ranks in\ndifferent domains.

          "description": "Due to spurious correlations, machine learning systems often fail to\ngeneralize to environments whose distributions differ from the ones used at\ntraining time. Prior work addressing this, either explicitly or implicitly,\nattempted to find a data representation that has an invariant relationship with\nthe target. This is done by leveraging a diverse set of training environments\nto reduce the effect of spurious features and build an invariant predictor.\nHowever, these methods have generalization guarantees only when both data\nrepresentation and classifiers come from a linear model class. We propose\ninvariant Causal Representation Learning (iCaRL), an approach that enables\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in the nonlinear setting (i.e.,\nnonlinear representations and nonlinear classifiers). It builds upon a\npractical and general assumption: the prior over the data representation (i.e.,\na set of latent variables encoding the data) given the target and the\nenvironment belongs to general exponential family distributions. Based on this,\nwe show that it is possible to identify the data representation up to simple\ntransformations. We also prove that all direct causes of the target can be\nfully discovered, which further enables us to obtain generalization guarantees\nin the nonlinear setting. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets show that our approach outperforms a variety of baseline\nmethods. Finally, in the discussion, we further explore the aforementioned\nassumption and propose a more general hypothesis, called the Agnostic\nHypothesis: there exist a set of hidden causal factors affecting both inputs\nand outcomes. The Agnostic Hypothesis can provide a unifying view of machine\nlearning. More importantly, it can inspire a new direction to explore a general\ntheory for identifying hidden causal factors, which is key to enabling the OOD\ngeneralization guarantees.",

To deal with the\ngeneral action space, we use the bandit based on Gaussian process (GP) as the\nbase model due to its flexibility and generality, and propose the Periodic-GP\nmethod with a temporal periodic kernel based on the upper confidence bound.\nTheoretically, we provide a new regret bound of the proposed method, by\nexplicitly characterizing the periodic kernel in the periodic stationary model.\nEmpirically, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing\nmethods in both synthetic data experiments and a real data application on\nMadrid traffic pollution.",

          "description": "Recently, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has garnered tremendous\nattention. However, stochastic optimization of MAML is still immature. Existing\nalgorithms for MAML are based on the ``episode\" idea by sampling a number of\ntasks and a number of data points for each sampled task at each iteration for\nupdating the meta-model. However, they either do not necessarily guarantee\nconvergence with a constant mini-batch size or require processing a larger\nnumber of tasks at every iteration, which is not viable for continual learning\nor cross-device federated learning where only a small number of tasks are\navailable per-iteration or per-round. This paper addresses these issues by (i)\nproposing efficient memory-based stochastic algorithms for MAML with a\ndiminishing convergence error, which only requires sampling a constant number\nof tasks and a constant number of examples per-task per-iteration; (ii)\nproposing communication-efficient distributed memory-based MAML algorithms for\npersonalized federated learning in both the cross-device (w/ client sampling)\nand the cross-silo (w/o client sampling) settings. The key novelty of the\nproposed algorithms is to maintain an individual personalized model (aka\nmemory) for each task besides the meta-model and only update them for the\nsampled tasks by a momentum method that incorporates historical updates at each\niteration. The theoretical results significantly improve the optimization\ntheory for MAML and the empirical results also corroborate the theory.",

          "description": "Transfer learning aims to exploit pre-trained models for more efficient\nfollow-up training on wide range of downstream tasks and datasets, enabling\nsuccessful training also on small data. Recent line of work posits strong\nbenefits for model generalization and transfer when model size, data size, and\ncompute budget are increased for the pre-training. It remains however still\nlargely unclear whether the observed transfer improvement due to increase in\nscale also holds when source and target data distributions are far apart from\neach other. In this work we conduct large-scale pre-training on large source\ndatasets of either natural (ImageNet-21k/1k) or medical chest X-Ray images and\ncompare full and few-shot transfer using different target datasets from both\nnatural and medical imaging domains. Our observations provide evidence that\nwhile pre-training and transfer on closely related datasets do show clear\nbenefit of increasing model and data size during pre-training, such benefits\nare not clearly visible when source and target datasets are further apart.\nThese observations hold across both full and few-shot transfer and indicate\nthat scaling laws pointing to improvement of generalization and transfer with\nincreasing model and data size are incomplete and should be revised by taking\ninto account the type and proximity of the source and target data, to correctly\npredict the effect of model and data scale during pre-training on transfer.\nRemarkably, in full shot transfer to a large X-Ray chest imaging target\n(PadChest), the largest model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k slightly outperforms\nbest models pre-trained on large X-Ray chest imaging data.

          "description": "Reinforcement learning is a powerful approach to learn behaviour through\ninteractions with an environment. However, behaviours are usually learned in a\npurely reactive fashion, where an appropriate action is selected based on an\nobservation. In this form, it is challenging to learn when it is necessary to\nexecute new decisions. This makes learning inefficient, especially in\nenvironments that need various degrees of fine and coarse control. To address\nthis, we propose a proactive setting in which the agent not only selects an\naction in a state but also for how long to commit to that action. Our TempoRL\napproach introduces skip connections between states and learns a skip-policy\nfor repeating the same action along these skips. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of TempoRL on a variety of traditional and deep RL environments,\nshowing that our approach is capable of learning successful policies up to an\norder of magnitude faster than vanilla Q-learning.",

          "description": "We present a novel methodology for automated feature subset selection from a\npool of physiological signals using Quantum Annealing (QA). As a case study, we\nwill investigate the effectiveness of QA-based feature selection techniques in\nselecting the optimal feature subset for stress detection. Features are\nextracted from four signal sources: foot EDA, hand EDA, ECG, and respiration.\nThe proposed method embeds the feature variables extracted from the\nphysiological signals in a binary quadratic model. The bias of the feature\nvariable is calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient between the\nfeature variable and the target variable. The weight of the edge connecting the\ntwo feature variables is calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient\nbetween two feature variables in the binary quadratic model. Subsequently,\nD-Wave's clique sampler is used to sample cliques from the binary quadratic\nmodel. The underlying solution is then re-sampled to obtain multiple good\nsolutions and the clique with the lowest energy is returned as the optimal\nsolution. The proposed method is compared with commonly used feature selection\ntechniques for stress detection. Results indicate that QA-based feature subset\nselection performed equally as that of classical techniques. However, under\ndata uncertainty conditions such as limited training data, the performance of\nquantum annealing for selecting optimum features remained unaffected, whereas a\nsignificant decrease in performance is observed with classical feature\nselection techniques. Preliminary results show the promise of quantum annealing\nin optimizing the training phase of a machine learning classifier, especially\nunder data uncertainty conditions.",

          "description": "We develop two new algorithms, called, FedDR and asyncFedDR, for solving a\nfundamental nonconvex composite optimization problem in federated learning. Our\nalgorithms rely on a novel combination between a nonconvex Douglas-Rachford\nsplitting method, randomized block-coordinate strategies, and asynchronous\nimplementation. They can also handle convex regularizers. Unlike recent methods\nin the literature, e.g., FedSplit and FedPD, our algorithms update only a\nsubset of users at each communication round, and possibly in an asynchronous\nmanner, making them more practical. These new algorithms also achieve\ncommunication efficiency and more importantly can handle statistical and system\nheterogeneity, which are the two main challenges in federated learning. Our\nconvergence analysis shows that the new algorithms match the communication\ncomplexity lower bound up to a constant factor under standard assumptions. Our\nnumerical experiments illustrate the advantages of our methods compared to\nexisting ones on several datasets.",

          "description": "Domains such as manufacturing and medicine crave for continuous monitoring\nand analysis of their processes, especially in combination with time series as\nproduced by sensors. Time series data can be exploited to, for example, explain\nand predict concept drifts during runtime. Generally, a certain data volume is\nrequired in order to produce meaningful analysis results. However, reliable\ndata sets are often missing, for example, if event streams and times series\ndata are collected separately, in case of a new process, or if it is too\nexpensive to obtain a sufficient data volume. Additional challenges arise with\npreparing time series data from multiple event sources, variations in data\ncollection frequency, and concept drift. This paper proposes the GENLOG\napproach to generate reliable event and time series data that follows the\ndistribution of the underlying input data set. GENLOG employs data resampling\nand enables the user to select different parts of the log data to orchestrate\nthe training of a recurrent neural network for stream generation. The generated\ndata is sampled back to its original sample rate and is embedded into the\noriginating log data file. Overall, GENLOG can boost small data sets and\nconsequently the application of online process mining.",

The SPINN model we propose here serves as a seamless bridge\nbetween two extreme modeling tools for PDEs, namely dense neural network based\nmethods like Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and traditional mesh-free\nnumerical methods, thereby providing a novel means to develop a new class of\nhybrid algorithms that build on the best of both these viewpoints. A unique\nfeature of the SPINN model that distinguishes it from other neural network\nbased approximations proposed earlier is that it is (i) interpretable, and (ii)\nsparse in the sense that it has much fewer connections than typical dense\nneural networks used for PDEs. Further, the SPINN algorithm implicitly encodes\nmesh adaptivity and is able to handle discontinuities in the solutions. In\naddition, we demonstrate that Fourier series representations can also be\nexpressed as a special class of SPINN and propose generalized neural network\nanalogues of Fourier representations. We illustrate the utility of the proposed\nmethod with a variety of examples involving ordinary differential equations,\nelliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic and nonlinear partial differential equations,\nand an example in fluid dynamics.",

          "description": "Catastrophic forgetting remains a severe hindrance to the broad application\nof artificial neural networks (ANNs), however, it continues to be a poorly\nunderstood phenomenon. Despite the extensive amount of work on catastrophic\nforgetting, we argue that it is still unclear how exactly the phenomenon should\nbe quantified, and, moreover, to what degree all of the choices we make when\ndesigning learning systems affect the amount of catastrophic forgetting. We use\nvarious testbeds from the reinforcement learning and supervised learning\nliterature to (1) provide evidence that the choice of which modern\ngradient-based optimization algorithm is used to train an ANN has a significant\nimpact on the amount of catastrophic forgetting and show that-surprisingly-in\nmany instances classical algorithms such as vanilla SGD experience less\ncatastrophic forgetting than the more modern algorithms such as Adam. We\nempirically compare four different existing metrics for quantifying\ncatastrophic forgetting and (2) show that the degree to which the learning\nsystems experience catastrophic forgetting is sufficiently sensitive to the\nmetric used that a change from one principled metric to another is enough to\nchange the conclusions of a study dramatically. Our results suggest that a much\nmore rigorous experimental methodology is required when looking at catastrophic\nforgetting. Based on our results, we recommend inter-task forgetting in\nsupervised learning must be measured with both retention and relearning metrics\nconcurrently, and intra-task forgetting in reinforcement learning must-at the\nvery least-be measured with pairwise interference.",

They are very attractive\ndue to exact likelihood evaluation and efficient sampling. However, their\neffective capacity is often insufficient since the bijectivity constraint\nlimits the model width. We address this issue by incrementally padding\nintermediate representations with noise. We precondition the noise in\naccordance with previous invertible units, which we describe as cross-unit\ncoupling. Our invertible glow-like modules express intra-unit affine coupling\nas a fusion of a densely connected block and Nystr\\\"om self-attention. We refer\nto our architecture as DenseFlow since both cross-unit and intra-unit couplings\nrely on dense connectivity. Experiments show significant improvements due to\nthe proposed contributions, and reveal state-of-the-art density estimation\namong all generative models under moderate computing budgets.",

To this end, we develop three techniques that each\ncould be of independent interest. First, we propose a black-box reduction from\nadversarial tracking control to strongly adaptive online learning with memory.\nAny solution to the latter translates to a tracking controller that pursues the\nbest action on any time interval. Second, for the resulting online learning\nproblem we develop a novel approach that further adapts to the observed\ngradients.

To this end, we utilize\nBernstein-type polynomials inspired by the optimal stability of the Bernstein\nbasis. Further, compared to the existing NF frameworks, our method provides\ncompelling advantages like theoretical upper bounds for the approximation\nerror, higher interpretability, suitability for compactly supported densities,\nand the ability to employ higher degree polynomials without training\ninstability.

          "description": "Recent theoretical work studies sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL)\nextensively in two settings: learning interactively in the environment (online\nRL), or learning from an offline dataset (offline RL). However, existing\nalgorithms and theories for learning near-optimal policies in these two\nsettings are rather different and disconnected. Towards bridging this gap, this\npaper initiates the theoretical study of policy finetuning, that is, online RL\nwhere the learner has additional access to a \"reference policy\" $\\mu$ close to\nthe optimal policy $\\pi_\\star$ in a certain sense. We consider the policy\nfinetuning problem in episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$\nstates, $A$ actions, and horizon length $H$. We first design a sharp offline\nreduction algorithm -- which simply executes $\\mu$ and runs offline policy\noptimization on the collected dataset -- that finds an $\\varepsilon$\nnear-optimal policy within $\\widetilde{O}(H^3SC^\\star/\\varepsilon^2)$ episodes,\nwhere $C^\\star$ is the single-policy concentrability coefficient between $\\mu$\nand $\\pi_\\star$. This offline result is the first that matches the sample\ncomplexity lower bound in this setting, and resolves a recent open question in\noffline RL. We then establish an $\\Omega(H^3S\\min\\{C^\\star, A\\}/\\varepsilon^2)$\nsample complexity lower bound for any policy finetuning algorithm, including\nthose that can adaptively explore the environment. This implies that -- perhaps\nsurprisingly -- the optimal policy finetuning algorithm is either offline\nreduction or a purely online RL algorithm that does not use $\\mu$. Finally, we\ndesign a new hybrid offline/online algorithm for policy finetuning that\nachieves better sample complexity than both vanilla offline reduction and\npurely online RL algorithms, in a relaxed setting where $\\mu$ only satisfies\nconcentrability partially up to a certain time step.",

One\nof the most well-adopted approaches for model interpretability is feature-based\ninterpretability, i.e., ranking the features in terms of their impact on model\npredictions. Several prior studies have focused on assessing the fidelity of\nfeature-based interpretability methods, i.e., measuring the impact of dropping\nthe top-ranked features on the model output. However, relatively little work\nhas been conducted on quantifying the robustness of interpretations. In this\nwork, we assess the robustness of interpretations of neural text classifiers,\nspecifically, those based on pretrained Transformer encoders, using two\nrandomization tests. The first compares the interpretations of two models that\nare identical except for their initializations. The second measures whether the\ninterpretations differ between a model with trained parameters and a model with\nrandom parameters. Both tests show surprising deviations from expected\nbehavior, raising questions about the extent of insights that practitioners may\ndraw from interpretations.",

          "description": "In ordinary distillation, student networks are trained with soft labels (SLs)\ngiven by pretrained teacher networks, and students are expected to improve upon\nteachers since SLs are stronger supervision than the original hard labels.\nHowever, when considering adversarial robustness, teachers may become\nunreliable and adversarial distillation may not work: teachers are pretrained\non their own adversarial data, and it is too demanding to require that teachers\nare also good at every adversarial data queried by students. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose reliable introspective adversarial distillation (IAD) where\nstudents partially instead of fully trust their teachers. Specifically, IAD\ndistinguishes between three cases given a query of a natural data (ND) and the\ncorresponding adversarial data (AD): (a) if a teacher is good at AD, its SL is\nfully trusted; (b) if a teacher is good at ND but not AD, its SL is partially\ntrusted and the student also takes its own SL into account; (c) otherwise, the\nstudent only relies on its own SL.

Successive learnt message passing between these graphs\nimproves the ability of GNNs to capture and forecast the system state in\nproblems encompassing a range of length scales. Using graph representations,\nMultiScaleGNN can impose periodic boundary conditions as an inductive bias on\nthe edges in the graphs, and achieve independence to the nodes' positions. We\ndemonstrate this method on advection problems and incompressible fluid\ndynamics. Our results show that the proposed model can generalise from uniform\nadvection fields to high-gradient fields on complex domains at test time and\ninfer long-term Navier-Stokes solutions within a range of Reynolds numbers.\nSimulations obtained with MultiScaleGNN are between two and four orders of\nmagnitude faster than the ones on which it was trained.",

          "description": "We extend semi-supervised learning to the problem of domain adaptation to\nlearn significantly higher-accuracy models that train on one data distribution\nand test on a different one. With the goal of generality, we introduce\nAdaMatch, a method that unifies the tasks of unsupervised domain adaptation\n(UDA), semi-supervised learning (SSL), and semi-supervised domain adaptation\n(SSDA). In an extensive experimental study, we compare its behavior with\nrespective state-of-the-art techniques from SSL, SSDA, and UDA on vision\nclassification tasks. We find AdaMatch either matches or significantly exceeds\nthe state-of-the-art in each case using the same hyper-parameters regardless of\nthe dataset or task. For example, AdaMatch nearly doubles the accuracy compared\nto that of the prior state-of-the-art on the UDA task for DomainNet and even\nexceeds the accuracy of the prior state-of-the-art obtained with pre-training\nby 6.4% when AdaMatch is trained completely from scratch. Furthermore, by\nproviding AdaMatch with just one labeled example per class from the target\ndomain (i.e., the SSDA setting), we increase the target accuracy by an\nadditional 6.1%, and with 5 labeled examples, by 13.6%.",

          "description": "We study an active cluster recovery problem where, given a set of $n$ points\nand an oracle answering queries like \"are these two points in the same\ncluster?\", the task is to recover exactly all clusters using as few queries as\npossible. We begin by introducing a simple but general notion of margin between\nclusters that captures, as special cases, the margins used in previous work,\nthe classic SVM margin, and standard notions of stability for center-based\nclusterings. Then, under our margin assumptions we design algorithms that, in a\nvariety of settings, recover all clusters exactly using only $O(\\log n)$\nqueries. For the Euclidean case, $\\mathbb{R}^m$, we give an algorithm that\nrecovers arbitrary convex clusters, in polynomial time, and with a number of\nqueries that is lower than the best existing algorithm by $\\Theta(m^m)$\nfactors. For general pseudometric spaces, where clusters might not be convex or\nmight not have any notion of shape, we give an algorithm that achieves the\n$O(\\log n)$ query bound, and is provably near-optimal as a function of the\npacking number of the space. Finally, for clusterings realized by binary\nconcept classes, we give a combinatorial characterization of recoverability\nwith $O(\\log n)$ queries, and we show that, for many concept classes in\nEuclidean spaces, this characterization is equivalent to our margin condition.\nOur results show a deep connection between cluster margins and active cluster\nrecoverability.",

A novel algorithm is first proposed and it achieves an\n$\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\max\\{c,1-c\\}})$ bound for static regret and an\n$\\mathcal{O}(T^{(1-c)/2})$ bound for cumulative constraint violation, where\n$c\\in(0,1)$ is a user-defined trade-off parameter, and thus has improved\nperformance compared with existing results. Both static regret and cumulative\nconstraint violation bounds are reduced to $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(T))$ when the loss\nfunctions are strongly convex, which also improves existing results. %In order\nto bound the regret with respect to any comparator sequence, In order to\nachieve the optimal regret with respect to any comparator sequence, another\nalgorithm is then proposed and it achieves the optimal\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T(1+P_T)})$ regret and an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ cumulative\nconstraint violation, where $P_T$ is the path-length of the comparator\nsequence.

          "description": "We propose a machine learning approach for quickly solving Mixed Integer\nPrograms (MIP) by learning to prioritize a set of decision variables, which we\ncall pseudo-backdoors, for branching that results in faster solution times.\nLearning-based approaches have seen success in the area of solving\ncombinatorial optimization problems by being able to flexibly leverage common\nstructures in a given distribution of problems. Our approach takes inspiration\nfrom the concept of strong backdoors, which corresponds to a small set of\nvariables such that only branching on these variables yields an optimal\nintegral solution and a proof of optimality. Our notion of pseudo-backdoors\ncorresponds to a small set of variables such that only branching on them leads\nto faster solve time (which can be solver dependent). A key advantage of\npseudo-backdoors over strong backdoors is that they are much amenable to\ndata-driven identification or prediction. Our proposed method learns to\nestimate the solver performance of a proposed pseudo-backdoor, using a labeled\ndataset collected on a set of training MIP instances. This model can then be\nused to identify high-quality pseudo-backdoors on new MIP instances from the\nsame distribution. We evaluate our method on the generalized independent set\nproblems and find that our approach can efficiently identify high-quality\npseudo-backdoors.

The\nsuccess of deep neural networks in supervised learning heavily relies on a\nlarge amount of labeled data. However, obtaining labeled data with target\nlabels is often challenging due to various reasons such as cost of labeling and\nprivacy issues, which challenges existing deep models. In spite of that, it is\nrelatively easy to obtain data with \\textit{inexact supervision}, i.e., having\nlabels/tags related to the target task. For example, social media platforms are\noverwhelmed with billions of posts and images with self-customized tags, which\nare not the exact labels for target classification tasks but are usually\nrelated to the target labels. It is promising to leverage these tags (inexact\nsupervision) and their relations with target classes to generate labeled data\nto facilitate the downstream classification tasks. However, the work on this is\nrather limited. Therefore, we study a novel problem of labeled data generation\nwith inexact supervision. We propose a novel generative framework named as\nADDES which can synthesize high-quality labeled data for target classification\ntasks by learning from data with inexact supervision and the relations between\ninexact supervision and target classes.

A common way to improve the robustness of\nmodels is to use data augmentation, which was confirmed to positively affect\nmodels' robustness, also for highly compressed models. It was further shown\nthat while data imbalance methods brought only a slight increase in accuracy\nfor the baseline model (without compression), the impact was more striking at\nhigher compression rates for the structured pruning.

In this paper, we propose a novel and\ngeneral target-aware attention mechanism (termed TANet) and integrate it with\ntracking-by-detection framework to conduct joint local and global search for\nrobust tracking. Specifically, we extract the features of target object patch\nand continuous video frames, then we concatenate and feed them into a decoder\nnetwork to generate target-aware global attention maps. More importantly, we\nresort to adversarial training for better attention prediction. The appearance\nand motion discriminator networks are designed to ensure its consistency in\nspatial and temporal views. In the tracking procedure, we integrate the\ntarget-aware attention with multiple trackers by exploring candidate search\nregions for robust tracking.

To avoid these problems, researchers have begun to\nconsider the use of energy systems based on energy-harvesting units for such\ndevices. However, the power harvested from an ambient source is fundamentally\nsmall and unstable, resulting in frequent power failures during the operation\nof IoT applications involving, for example, intermittent speech signals and the\nstreaming of videos. This paper presents a deep-learning-based speech recovery\nsystem that reconstructs intermittent speech signals from self-powered IoT\ndevices. Our intermittent speech recovery system (ISR) consists of three\nstages: interpolation, recovery, and combination. The experimental results show\nthat our recovery system increases speech quality by up to 707.1%, while\nincreasing speech intelligibility by up to 92.1%. Most importantly, our ISR\nsystem also enhances the WER scores by up to 65.6%. To the best of our\nknowledge, this study is one of the first to reconstruct intermittent speech\nsignals from self-powered-sensing IoT devices. These promising results suggest\nthat even though self powered microphone devices function with weak energy\nsources, our ISR system can still maintain the performance of most\nspeech-signal-based applications.",

          "description": "Node clustering is a powerful tool in the analysis of networks. Here, we\nintroduce a graph neural network framework with a novel scalable Directed Mixed\nPath Aggregation(DIMPA) scheme to obtain node embeddings for directed networks\nin a self-supervised manner, including a novel probabilistic imbalance loss.\nThe method is end-to-end in combining embedding generation and clustering\nwithout an intermediate step. In contrast to standard approaches in the\nliterature, in this paper, directionality is not treated as a nuisance, but\nrather contains the main signal. In particular, we leverage the recently\nintroduced cut flow imbalance measure, which is tightly related to\ndirectionality; cut flow imbalance is optimized without resorting to spectral\nmethods or cluster labels. Experimental results on synthetic data, in the form\nof directed stochastic block models and real-world data at different scales,\ndemonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art results on directed\nclustering, for a wide range of noise and sparsity levels, as well as graph\nstructures.",

Even though many methods have been developed to tackle this\nchallenge, most of those are imputation techniques that require multiple\niterations through the data before yielding convergence. In addition, such\napproaches may introduce extra biases and noises to the estimated parameters.\nIn this work, we propose novel algorithms to find the maximum likelihood\nestimates (MLEs) for a one-class/multiple-class randomly missing data set under\nsome mild assumptions. As the computation is direct without any imputation, our\nalgorithms do not require multiple iterations through the data, thus promising\nto be less time-consuming than other methods while maintaining superior\nestimation performance. We validate these claims by empirical results on\nvarious data sets of different sizes and release all codes in a GitHub\nrepository to contribute to the research community related to this problem.",

Recently there has been a renaissance in identifiability results in\ndeep generative models, not least for non-linear ICA. These prior works,\nhowever, have assumed access to a sufficiently-informative auxiliary set of\nobservations, denoted $\\mathbf{u}$. We show here how identifiability can be\nobtained in the absence of this side-information, rendering possible\nfully-unsupervised identifiable non-linear ICA. While previous theoretical\nresults have established the impossibility of identifiable non-linear ICA in\nthe presence of infinitely-flexible universal function approximators, here we\nrely on the intrinsically-finite modelling capacity of any particular chosen\nparameterisation of a deep generative model. In particular, we focus on\ngenerative models which perform clustering in their latent space -- a model\nstructure which matches previous identifiable models, but with the learnt\nclustering providing a synthetic form of auxiliary information. We evaluate our\nproposals using VAEs, on synthetic and image datasets, and find that the\nlearned clusterings function effectively: deep generative models with latent\nclusterings are empirically identifiable, to the same degree as models which\nrely on side information.",

          "description": "Recent efforts to unravel the mystery of implicit regularization in deep\nlearning have led to a theoretical focus on matrix factorization -- matrix\ncompletion via linear neural network. As a step further towards practical deep\nlearning, we provide the first theoretical analysis of implicit regularization\nin tensor factorization -- tensor completion via certain type of non-linear\nneural network. We circumvent the notorious difficulty of tensor problems by\nadopting a dynamical systems perspective, and characterizing the evolution\ninduced by gradient descent. The characterization suggests a form of greedy low\ntensor rank search, which we rigorously prove under certain conditions, and\nempirically demonstrate under others. Motivated by tensor rank capturing the\nimplicit regularization of a non-linear neural network, we empirically explore\nit as a measure of complexity, and find that it captures the essence of\ndatasets on which neural networks generalize. This leads us to believe that\ntensor rank may pave way to explaining both implicit regularization in deep\nlearning, and the properties of real-world data translating this implicit\nregularization to generalization.",

          "description": "Modern machine learning methods are often overparametrized, allowing\nadaptation to the data at a fine level. This can seem puzzling; in the worst\ncase, such models do not need to generalize. This puzzle inspired a great\namount of work, arguing when overparametrization reduces test error, in a\nphenomenon called \"double descent\". Recent work aimed to understand in greater\ndepth why overparametrization is helpful for generalization. This leads to\ndiscovering the unimodality of variance as a function of the level of\nparametrization, and to decomposing the variance into that arising from label\nnoise, initialization, and randomness in the training data to understand the\nsources of the error.\n\nIn this work we develop a deeper understanding of this area. Specifically, we\npropose using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to decompose the variance in the\ntest error in a symmetric way, for studying the generalization performance of\ncertain two-layer linear and non-linear networks. The advantage of the analysis\nof variance is that it reveals the effects of initialization, label noise, and\ntraining data more clearly than prior approaches. Moreover, we also study the\nmonotonicity and unimodality of the variance components. While prior work\nstudied the unimodality of the overall variance, we study the properties of\neach term in variance decomposition.\n\nOne key insight is that in typical settings, the interaction between training\nsamples and initialization can dominate the variance; surprisingly being larger\nthan their marginal effect. Also, we characterize \"phase transitions\" where the\nvariance changes from unimodal to monotone. On a technical level, we leverage\nadvanced deterministic equivalent techniques for Haar random matrices, that --\nto our knowledge -- have not yet been used in the area. We also verify our\nresults in numerical simulations and on empirical data examples.",

In MuLaNE, there are multiple network layers\nwhere each node has an importance weight and each layer is explored by a random\nwalk. The MuLaNE task is to allocate total random walk budget $B$ into each\nnetwork layer so that the total weights of the unique nodes visited by random\nwalks are maximized. We systematically study this problem from offline\noptimization to online learning. For the offline optimization setting where the\nnetwork structure and node weights are known, we provide greedy based\nconstant-ratio approximation algorithms for overlapping networks, and greedy or\ndynamic-programming based optimal solutions for non-overlapping networks. For\nthe online learning setting, neither the network structure nor the node weights\nare known initially. We adapt the combinatorial multi-armed bandit framework\nand design algorithms to learn random walk related parameters and node weights\nwhile optimizing the budget allocation in multiple rounds, and prove that they\nachieve logarithmic regret bounds.

          "description": "We present a theoretical framework of probabilistic learning derived by\nMaximum Probability (MP) Theorem shown in the current paper. In this\nprobabilistic framework, a model is defined as an event in the probability\nspace, and a model or the associated event - either the true underlying model\nor the parameterized model - have a quantified probability measure. This\nquantification of a model's probability measure is derived by the MP Theorem,\nin which we have shown that an event's probability measure has an upper-bound\ngiven its conditional distribution on an arbitrary random variable. Through\nthis alternative framework, the notion of model parameters is encompassed in\nthe definition of the model or the associated event. Therefore, this framework\ndeviates from the conventional approach of assuming a prior on the model\nparameters. Instead, the regularizing effects of assuming prior over parameters\nis seen through maximizing probabilities of models or according to information\ntheory, minimizing the information content of a model. The probability of a\nmodel in our framework is invariant to reparameterization and is solely\ndependent on the model's likelihood function. Also, rather than maximizing the\nposterior in a conventional Bayesian setting, the objective function in our\nalternative framework is defined as the probability of set operations (e.g.\nintersection) on the event of the true underlying model and the event of the\nmodel at hand. Our theoretical framework, as a derivation of MP theorem, adds\nclarity to probabilistic learning through solidifying the definition of\nprobabilistic models, quantifying their probabilities, and providing a visual\nunderstanding of objective functions.",

However, MC dropout is not as effective as more\ncompute-intensive methods such as deep ensembles. This performance gap can be\nattributed to the relatively poor quality of individual models in the MC\ndropout ensemble and their lack of diversity. These issues can in turn be\ntraced back to the coupled training and substantial parameter sharing of the\ndropout models. Motivated by this perspective, we propose a strategy to compute\nan ensemble of subnetworks, each corresponding to a non-overlapping dropout\nmask computed via a pruning strategy and trained independently. We show that\nthe proposed subnetwork ensembling method can perform as well as standard deep\nensembles in both accuracy and uncertainty estimates, yet with a computational\nefficiency similar to MC dropout.

We illustrate the advantage of exact\nmarginalizability in several tasks that are out of reach of previous deep\nnetwork-based density estimation models, such as estimating mutual information\nbetween arbitrary subsets of variables, inferring causality by testing for\nconditional independence, and inference with missing data without the need for\ndata imputation, outperforming state-of-the-art models on these tasks.

Interestingly, we prove that passivity implies\nbounded regret, connecting two fundamental primitives of control theory and\nonline optimization.\n\nThe observation of energy conservation in FTRL inspires us to present a\nfamily of lossless learning dynamics, each of which has an underlying energy\nfunction with a simple gradient structure. This family is closed under convex\ncombination; as an immediate corollary, any convex combination of FTRL dynamics\nis lossless and thus has bounded regret. This allows us to extend the framework\nof Fox and Shamma (Games, 2013) to prove not just global asymptotic stability\nresults for game dynamics, but Poincar\\'e recurrence results as well.\nIntuitively, when a lossless game (e.g. graphical constant-sum game) is coupled\nwith lossless learning dynamic, their interconnection is also lossless, which\nresults in a pendulum-like energy-preserving recurrent behavior, generalizing\nthe results of Piliouras and Shamma (SODA, 2014) and Mertikopoulos,\nPapadimitriou and Piliouras (SODA, 2018).",

          "description": "Sentence embeddings encode sentences in fixed dense vectors and have played\nan important role in various NLP tasks and systems. Methods for building\nsentence embeddings include unsupervised learning such as Quick-Thoughts and\nsupervised learning such as InferSent. With the success of pretrained NLP\nmodels, recent research shows that fine-tuning pretrained BERT on SNLI and\nMulti-NLI data creates state-of-the-art sentence embeddings, outperforming\nprevious sentence embeddings methods on various evaluation benchmarks. In this\npaper, we propose a new method to build sentence embeddings by doing supervised\ncontrastive learning. Specifically our method fine-tunes pretrained BERT on\nSNLI data, incorporating both supervised crossentropy loss and supervised\ncontrastive loss. Compared with baseline where fine-tuning is only done with\nsupervised cross-entropy loss similar to current state-of-the-art method SBERT,\nour supervised contrastive method improves 2.8% in average on Semantic Textual\nSimilarity (STS) benchmarks and 1.05% in average on various sentence transfer\ntasks.",

While multiple standard benchmarks exist\nto compare DRL agents, there is currently no such thing for ACL algorithms.\nThus, comparing existing approaches is difficult, as too many experimental\nparameters differ from paper to paper. In this work, we identify several key\nchallenges faced by ACL algorithms. Based on these, we present TeachMyAgent\n(TA), a benchmark of current ACL algorithms leveraging procedural task\ngeneration. It includes 1) challenge-specific unit-tests using variants of a\nprocedural Box2D bipedal walker environment, and 2) a new procedural Parkour\nenvironment combining most ACL challenges, making it ideal for global\nperformance assessment. We then use TeachMyAgent to conduct a comparative study\nof representative existing approaches, showcasing the competitiveness of some\nACL algorithms that do not use expert knowledge. We also show that the Parkour\nenvironment remains an open problem.

          "description": "Recent studies suggest that ``memorization'' is one important factor for\noverparameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) to achieve optimal performance.\nSpecifically, the perfectly fitted DNNs can memorize the labels of many\natypical samples, generalize their memorization to correctly classify test\natypical samples and enjoy better test performance. While, DNNs which are\noptimized via adversarial training algorithms can also achieve perfect training\nperformance by memorizing the labels of atypical samples, as well as the\nadversarially perturbed atypical samples. However, adversarially trained models\nalways suffer from poor generalization, with both relatively low clean accuracy\nand robustness on the test set. In this work, we study the effect of\nmemorization in adversarial trained DNNs and disclose two important findings:\n(a) Memorizing atypical samples is only effective to improve DNN's accuracy on\nclean atypical samples, but hardly improve their adversarial robustness and (b)\nMemorizing certain atypical samples will even hurt the DNN's performance on\ntypical samples. Based on these two findings, we propose Benign Adversarial\nTraining (BAT) which can facilitate adversarial training to avoid fitting\n``harmful'' atypical samples and fit as more ``benign'' atypical samples as\npossible. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of BAT, and show it\ncan achieve better clean accuracy vs. robustness trade-off than baseline\nmethods, in benchmark datasets such as CIFAR100 and Tiny~ImageNet.",

This paper\nexamines the neuron activation patterns of deep learning-based classification\nmodels and explores whether the models' performances can be explained through\nneurons' activation behavior. We propose two approaches: one that models\nneurons' activation behavior as a graph and examines whether the neurons form\nmeaningful communities, and the other examines the predictability of neurons'\nbehavior using entropy. Our comprehensive experimental study reveals that both\nthe community quality (modularity) and entropy are closely related to the deep\nlearning models' performances, thus paves a novel way of explaining deep\nlearning models directly from the neurons' activation pattern.",

In this\nwork, we tackle the problem of job dispatching without the knowledge of service\nrates and queue lengths, where the dispatcher can only obtain noisy estimates\nof the service rates by observing job departures. This problem presents a novel\nexploration-exploitation trade-off between sending jobs to all the servers to\nestimate their service rates, and exploiting the currently known fastest\nservers to minimize the expected queueing delay. We propose a bandit-based\nexploration policy that learns the service rates from observed job departures.\nUnlike the standard multi-armed bandit problem where only one out of a finite\nset of actions is optimal, here the optimal policy requires identifying the\noptimal fraction of incoming jobs to be sent to each server.

We provide a suite of Frank-Wolfe style algorithms, which,\ndepending on the nature of the objective function (i.e., if $G$ and $C$ are\nmonotone or not, and non-negative or not) and on the nature of the set $P$\n(i.e., whether it is downward closed or not), provide $1-1/e$, $1/e$, or $1/2$\napproximation guarantees. We then use our algorithms to get a framework to\nsmoothly interpolate between choosing a diverse set of elements from a given\nground set (corresponding to the mode of a determinantal point process) and\nchoosing a clustered set of elements (corresponding to the maxima of a suitable\nconcave function). Additionally, we apply our algorithms to various functions\nin the above class (DR-submodular + concave) in both constrained and\nunconstrained settings, and show that our algorithms consistently outperform\nnatural baselines.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of optimizing the distribution operations of a hub\nusing drones to deliver medical supplies to different geographic regions.\nDrones are an innovative method with many benefits including low-contact\ndelivery thereby reducing the spread of pandemic and vaccine-preventable\ndiseases. While we focus on medical supply delivery for this work, it is\napplicable to drone delivery for many other applications, including food,\npostal items, and e-commerce delivery. In this paper, our goal is to address\ndrone delivery challenges by optimizing the distribution operations at a drone\nhub that dispatch drones to different geographic locations generating\nstochastic demands for medical supplies. By considering different geographic\nlocations, we consider different classes of demand that require different\nflight ranges, which is directly related to the amount of charge held in a\ndrone battery. We classify the stochastic demands based on their distance from\nthe drone hub, use a Markov decision process to model the problem, and perform\ncomputational tests using realistic data representing a prominent drone\ndelivery company. We solve the problem using a reinforcement learning method\nand show its high performance compared with the exact solution found using\ndynamic programming. Finally, we analyze the results and provide insights for\nmanaging the drone hub operations.",

          "description": "In a typical supervised machine learning setting, the predictions on all test\ninstances are based on a common subset of features discovered during model\ntraining. However, using a different subset of features that is most\ninformative for each test instance individually may not only improve prediction\naccuracy, but also the overall interpretability of the model. At the same time,\nfeature selection methods for classification have been known to be the most\neffective when many features are irrelevant and/or uncorrelated. In fact,\nfeature selection ignoring correlations between features can lead to poor\nclassification performance. In this work, a Bayesian network is utilized to\nmodel feature dependencies. Using the dependency network, a new method is\nproposed that sequentially selects the best feature to evaluate for each test\ninstance individually, and stops the selection process to make a prediction\nonce it determines that no further improvement can be achieved with respect to\nclassification accuracy. The optimum number of features to acquire and the\noptimum classification strategy are derived for each test instance. The\ntheoretical properties of the optimum solution are analyzed, and a new\nalgorithm is proposed that takes advantage of these properties to implement a\nrobust and scalable solution for high dimensional settings. The effectiveness,\ngeneralizability, and scalability of the proposed method is illustrated on a\nvariety of real-world datasets from diverse application domains.",

The power curve of a wind turbine, which exhibits the\nrelationship between generated power and wind speed, plays a major role in\nassessing the performance of a wind farm. Neural networks have been used for\npower curve estimation. However, they do not produce a confidence measure for\ntheir output, unless computationally prohibitive Bayesian methods are used. In\nthis paper, a probabilistic neural network with Monte Carlo dropout is\nconsidered to quantify the model (epistemic) uncertainty of the power curve\nestimation. This approach offers a minimal increase in computational complexity\nover deterministic approaches. Furthermore, by incorporating a probabilistic\nloss function, the noise or aleatoric uncertainty in the data is estimated. The\ndeveloped network captures both model and noise uncertainty which is found to\nbe useful tools in assessing performance. Also, the developed network is\ncompared with existing ones across a public domain dataset showing superior\nperformance in terms of prediction accuracy.",

          "description": "Graph is an usual representation of relational data, which are ubiquitous in\nmanydomains such as molecules, biological and social networks. A popular\napproach to learningwith graph structured data is to make use of graph kernels,\nwhich measure the similaritybetween graphs and are plugged into a kernel\nmachine such as a support vector machine.Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) based graph\nkernels, which employ WL labeling scheme to extract subtree patterns and\nperform node embedding, are demonstrated to achieve great performance while\nbeing efficiently computable. However, one of the main drawbacks of ageneral\nkernel is the decoupling of kernel construction and learning process. For\nmoleculargraphs, usual kernels such as WL subtree, based on substructures of\nthe molecules, consider all available substructures having the same importance,\nwhich might not be suitable inpractice. In this paper, we propose a method to\nlearn the weights of subtree patterns in the framework of WWL kernels, the\nstate of the art method for graph classification task [14]. To overcome the\ncomputational issue on large scale data sets, we present an efficient learning\nalgorithm and also derive a generalization gap bound to show its convergence.\nFinally, through experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for learning the weights\nof subtree patterns.",

However, despite these successes,\nthe recent Predicting Generalization in Deep Learning (PGDL) NeurIPS 2020\ncompetition suggests that there is a need for more robust and efficient\nmeasures of network generalization. In this work, we propose a new framework\nfor evaluating the generalization capabilities of trained networks. We use\nperturbation response (PR) curves that capture the accuracy change of a given\nnetwork as a function of varying levels of training sample perturbation. From\nthese PR curves, we derive novel statistics that capture generalization\ncapability. Specifically, we introduce two new measures for accurately\npredicting generalization gaps: the Gi-score and Pal-score, that are inspired\nby the Gini coefficient and Palma ratio (measures of income inequality), that\naccurately predict generalization gaps. Using our framework applied to intra\nand inter class sample mixup, we attain better predictive scores than the\ncurrent state-of-the-art measures on a majority of tasks in the PGDL\ncompetition. In addition, we show that our framework and the proposed\nstatistics can be used to capture to what extent a trained network is invariant\nto a given parametric input transformation, such as rotation or translation.\nTherefore, these generalization gap prediction statistics also provide a useful\nmeans for selecting the optimal network architectures and hyperparameters that\nare invariant to a certain perturbation.",

To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness, we conduct thorough\nexperiments across diverse datasets, search spaces, and NAS algorithms.\nConsequently, NAS algorithms with the proposed selection discover architectures\nthat are competitive with those obtained using the entire dataset. It\nsignificantly reduces the search cost: executing DARTS with the proposed\nselection requires only 40 minutes on CIFAR-10 and 7.5 hours on ImageNet with a\nsingle GPU. Additionally, when the architecture searched on ImageNet using the\nproposed selection is inversely transferred to CIFAR-10, a state-of-the-art\ntest error of 2.4\\% is yielded.

Instead\nof solving the BMF problem directly, this approach solves a nonnegative\noptimization problem with the constraint over an auxiliary matrix whose Boolean\nstructure is identical to the initial Boolean data. Then the solution of the\nnonnegative auxiliary optimization problem is thresholded to provide a solution\nfor the BMF problem. We provide the proofs for the equivalencies of the two\nsolution spaces under the existence of an exact solution. Moreover, the\nnonincreasing property of the algorithm is also proven.

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising results for\nsemi-supervised learning tasks on graphs such as node classification. Despite\nthe great success of GNNs, many real-world graphs are often sparsely and\nnoisily labeled, which could significantly degrade the performance of GNNs, as\nthe noisy information could propagate to unlabeled nodes via graph structure.\nThus, it is important to develop a label noise-resistant GNN for\nsemi-supervised node classification. Though extensive studies have been\nconducted to learn neural networks with noisy labels, they mostly focus on\nindependent and identically distributed data and assume a large number of noisy\nlabels are available, which are not directly applicable for GNNs. Thus, we\ninvestigate a novel problem of learning a robust GNN with noisy and limited\nlabels. To alleviate the negative effects of label noise, we propose to link\nthe unlabeled nodes with labeled nodes of high feature similarity to bring more\nclean label information. Furthermore, accurate pseudo labels could be obtained\nby this strategy to provide more supervision and further reduce the effects of\nlabel noise. Our theoretical and empirical analysis verify the effectiveness of\nthese two strategies under mild conditions. Extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning a\nrobust GNN with noisy and limited labels.",

A common practice is to perform data augmentation via\nhand-crafted transformations intended to leave the semantics of the data\ninvariant. We seek to understand the empirical success of this approach from a\ntheoretical perspective. We formulate the augmentation process as a latent\nvariable model by postulating a partition of the latent representation into a\ncontent component, which is assumed invariant to augmentation, and a style\ncomponent, which is allowed to change. Unlike prior work on disentanglement and\nindependent component analysis, we allow for both nontrivial statistical and\ncausal dependencies in the latent space. We study the identifiability of the\nlatent representation based on pairs of views of the observations and prove\nsufficient conditions that allow us to identify the invariant content partition\nup to an invertible mapping in both generative and discriminative settings. We\nfind numerical simulations with dependent latent variables are consistent with\nour theory.

As such, deploying DL models across mobile\nplatforms is vital to enable the development and broad availability of the\nnext-generation intelligent apps. Nevertheless, the wide and optimised\ndeployment of DL models is currently hindered by the vast system heterogeneity\nof mobile devices, the varying computational cost of different DL models and\nthe variability of performance needs across DL applications. This paper\nproposes OODIn, a framework for the optimised deployment of DL apps across\nheterogeneous mobile devices. OODIn comprises a novel DL-specific software\narchitecture together with an analytical framework for modelling DL\napplications that: (1) counteract the variability in device resources and DL\nmodels by means of a highly parametrised multi-layer design; and (2) perform a\nprincipled optimisation of both model- and system-level parameters through a\nmulti-objective formulation, designed for DL inference apps, in order to adapt\nthe deployment to the user-specified performance requirements and device\ncapabilities. Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed framework\nconsistently outperforms status-quo designs across heterogeneous devices and\ndelivers up to 4.3x and 3.5x performance gain over highly optimised platform-\nand model-aware designs respectively, while effectively adapting execution to\ndynamic changes in resource availability.",

          "description": "Surrogate algorithms such as Bayesian optimisation are especially designed\nfor black-box optimisation problems with expensive objectives, such as\nhyperparameter tuning or simulation-based optimisation. In the literature,\nthese algorithms are usually evaluated with synthetic benchmarks which are well\nestablished but have no expensive objective, and only on one or two real-life\napplications which vary wildly between papers. There is a clear lack of\nstandardisation when it comes to benchmarking surrogate algorithms on\nreal-life, expensive, black-box objective functions. This makes it very\ndifficult to draw conclusions on the effect of algorithmic contributions. A new\nbenchmark library, EXPObench, provides first steps towards such a\nstandardisation. The library is used to provide an extensive comparison of six\ndifferent surrogate algorithms on four expensive optimisation problems from\ndifferent real-life applications. This has led to new insights regarding the\nrelative importance of exploration, the evaluation time of the objective, and\nthe used model. A further contribution is that we make the algorithms and\nbenchmark problem instances publicly available, contributing to more uniform\nanalysis of surrogate algorithms. Most importantly, we include the performance\nof the six algorithms on all evaluated problem instances.

          "description": "Machine learning algorithms are increasingly used for consequential decision\nmaking regarding individuals based on their relevant features. Features that\nare relevant for accurate decisions may however lead to either explicit or\nimplicit forms of discrimination against unprivileged groups, such as those of\ncertain race or gender. This happens due to existing biases in the training\ndata, which are often replicated or even exacerbated by the learning algorithm.\nIdentifying and measuring these biases at the data level is a challenging\nproblem due to the interdependence among the features, and the decision\noutcome. In this work, we develop a framework for fairness-aware feature\nselection which takes into account the correlation among the features and the\ndecision outcome, and is based on information theoretic measures for the\naccuracy and discriminatory impacts of features. In particular, we first\npropose information theoretic measures which quantify the impact of different\nsubsets of features on the accuracy and discrimination of the decision\noutcomes. We then deduce the marginal impact of each feature using Shapley\nvalue function; a solution concept in cooperative game theory used to estimate\nmarginal contributions of players in a coalitional game. Finally, we design a\nfairness utility score for each feature (for feature selection) which\nquantifies how this feature influences accurate as well as nondiscriminatory\ndecisions. Our framework depends on the joint statistics of the data rather\nthan a particular classifier design. We examine our proposed framework on real\nand synthetic data to evaluate its performance.",

Most of\nthe work on this topic is in the sequential setting, where there is no\nconstraint on the time taken to identify such an arm; this allows the\ndecision-maker to pull one arm at a time. In this work, the decision-maker is\ngiven a deadline of $T$ rounds, where, on each round, it can adaptively choose\nwhich arms to pull and how many times to pull them; this distinguishes the\nnumber of decisions made (i.e., time or number of rounds) from the number of\nsamples acquired (cost). Such situations occur in clinical trials, where one\nmay need to identify a promising treatment under a deadline while minimizing\nthe number of test subjects, or in simulation-based studies run on the cloud,\nwhere we can elastically scale up or down the number of virtual machines to\nconduct as many experiments as we wish, but need to pay for the resource-time\nused. As the decision-maker can only make $T$ decisions, she may need to pull\nsome arms excessively relative to a sequential algorithm in order to perform\nwell on all possible problems. We formalize this added difficulty with two\nhardness results that indicate that unlike sequential settings, the ability to\nadapt to the problem difficulty is constrained by the finite deadline. We\npropose Elastic Batch Racing (EBR), a novel algorithm for this setting and\nbound its sample complexity, showing that EBR is optimal with respect to both\nhardness results.

          "description": "Batch Normalization (BN) is a popular technique for training Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs). BN uses scaling and shifting to normalize activations of\nmini-batches to accelerate convergence and improve generalization. The recently\nproposed Iterative Normalization (IterNorm) method improves these properties by\nwhitening the activations iteratively using Newton's method. However, since\nNewton's method initializes the whitening matrix independently at each training\nstep, no information is shared between consecutive steps. In this work, instead\nof exact computation of whitening matrix at each time step, we estimate it\ngradually during training in an online fashion, using our proposed Stochastic\nWhitening Batch Normalization (SWBN) algorithm. We show that while SWBN\nimproves the convergence rate and generalization of DNNs, its computational\noverhead is less than that of IterNorm. Due to the high efficiency of the\nproposed method, it can be easily employed in most DNN architectures with a\nlarge number of layers.

          "description": "With the popularity of Machine Learning (ML) solutions, algorithms and data\nhave been released faster than the capacity of processing them. In this\ncontext, the problem of Algorithm Recommendation (AR) is receiving a\nsignificant deal of attention recently. This problem has been addressed in the\nliterature as a learning task, often as a Meta-Learning problem where the aim\nis to recommend the best alternative for a specific dataset. For such, datasets\nencoded by meta-features are explored by ML algorithms that try to learn the\nmapping between meta-representations and the best technique to be used. One of\nthe challenges for the successful use of ML is to define which features are the\nmost valuable for a specific dataset since several meta-features can be used,\nwhich increases the meta-feature dimension. This paper presents an empirical\nanalysis of Feature Selection and Feature Extraction in the meta-level for the\nAR problem. The present study was focused on three criteria: predictive\nperformance, dimensionality reduction, and pipeline runtime. As we verified,\napplying Dimensionality Reduction (DR) methods did not improve predictive\nperformances in general. However, DR solutions reduced about 80% of the\nmeta-features, obtaining pretty much the same performance as the original setup\nbut with lower runtimes. The only exception was PCA, which presented about the\nsame runtime as the original meta-features. Experimental results also showed\nthat various datasets have many non-informative meta-features and that it is\npossible to obtain high predictive performance using around 20% of the original\nmeta-features. Therefore, due to their natural trend for high dimensionality,\nDR methods should be used for Meta-Feature Selection and Meta-Feature\nExtraction.",

DisTop progressively\nbuilds a discrete topology of the environment using an unsupervised contrastive\nloss, a growing network and a goal-conditioned policy. Using this topology, a\nstate-independent hierarchical policy can select where the agent has to keep\ndiscovering skills in the state space. In turn, the newly visited states allows\nan improved learnt representation and the learning loop continues. Our\nexperiments emphasize that DisTop is agnostic to the ground state\nrepresentation and that the agent can discover the topology of its environment\nwhether the states are high-dimensional binary data, images, or proprioceptive\ninputs. We demonstrate that this paradigm is competitiveon MuJoCo benchmarks\nwith state-of-the-art algorithms on both single-task dense rewards and diverse\nskill discovery.

          "description": "Credit assignment is a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning, the\nproblem of measuring an action's influence on future rewards. Improvements in\ncredit assignment methods have the potential to boost the performance of RL\nalgorithms on many tasks, but thus far have not seen widespread adoption.\nRecently, a family of methods called Hindsight Credit Assignment (HCA) was\nproposed, which explicitly assign credit to actions in hindsight based on the\nprobability of the action having led to an observed outcome. This approach is\nappealing as a means to more efficient data usage, but remains a largely\ntheoretical idea applicable to a limited set of tabular RL tasks, and it is\nunclear how to extend HCA to Deep RL environments. In this work, we explore the\nuse of HCA-style credit in a deep RL context. We first describe the limitations\nof existing HCA algorithms in deep RL, then propose several\ntheoretically-justified modifications to overcome them. Based on this\nexploration, we present a new algorithm, Credit-Constrained Advantage\nActor-Critic (C2A2C), which ignores policy updates for actions which don't\naffect future outcomes based on credit in hindsight, while updating the policy\nas normal for those that do. We find that C2A2C outperforms Advantage\nActor-Critic (A2C) on the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) benchmark, showing\nbroad improvements over A2C and motivating further work on credit-constrained\nupdate rules for deep RL methods.",

          "description": "A novel model called error loss network (ELN) is proposed to build an error\nloss function for supervised learning. The ELN is in structure similar to a\nradial basis function (RBF) neural network, but its input is an error sample\nand output is a loss corresponding to that error sample. That means the\nnonlinear input-output mapper of ELN creates an error loss function. The\nproposed ELN provides a unified model for a large class of error loss\nfunctions, which includes some information theoretic learning (ITL) loss\nfunctions as special cases. The activation function, weight parameters and\nnetwork size of the ELN can be predetermined or learned from the error samples.\nOn this basis, we propose a new machine learning paradigm where the learning\nprocess is divided into two stages: first, learning a loss function using an\nELN; second, using the learned loss function to continue to perform the\nlearning. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the desirable\nperformance of the new method.",

Using these augmentations, we propose a new\nrobustness measure, Robustness to Augmented Data (RAD), which measures the\nconsistency of model predictions between original and augmented examples.\nThrough extensive experimentation, we show that RAD, unlike classical accuracy\nmeasures, can quantify when state-of-the-art systems are not robust to\ncounterfactuals.

          "description": "Transformer networks are able to capture patterns in data coming from many\ndomains (text, images, videos, proteins, etc.) with little or no change to\narchitecture components. We perform a theoretical analysis of the core\ncomponent responsible for signal propagation between elements, i.e. the\nself-attention matrix. In practice, this matrix typically exhibits two\nproperties: (1) it is sparse, meaning that each token only attends to a small\nsubset of other tokens; and (2) it changes dynamically depending on the input\nto the module. With these considerations in mind, we ask the following\nquestion: Can a fixed self-attention module approximate arbitrary sparse\npatterns depending on the input? How small is the hidden size $d$ required for\nsuch approximation? We make progress in answering this question and show that\nthe self-attention matrix can provably approximate sparse matrices, where\nsparsity is in terms of a bounded number of nonzero elements in each row and\ncolumn. While the parameters of self-attention are fixed, various sparse\nmatrices can be approximated by only modifying the inputs. Our proof is based\non the random projection technique and uses the seminal Johnson-Lindenstrauss\nlemma. Our proof is constructive, enabling us to propose an algorithm for\nfinding adaptive inputs and fixed self-attention parameters in order to\napproximate a given matrix. In particular, we show that, in order to\napproximate any sparse matrix up to a given precision defined in terms of\npreserving matrix element ratios, $d$ grows only logarithmically with the\nsequence length $L$ (i.e. $d = O(\\log L)$).",

Therefore, we\ndescribe a sufficient and necessary accuracy condition which determines whether\na PSR is able to accurately model POMDP rewards, we show that rewards can be\napproximated even when the accuracy condition is not satisfied, and we find\nthat a non-trivial number of POMDPs taken from a well-known third-party\nrepository do not satisfy the accuracy condition.

Some\nsurprising results obtained on styled test problems suggest that, under certain\nconditions, HanNets exhibit an unusual ability to produce nearly perfect\nsolutions unattainable by fully connected networks. Experiments on regression\ndatasets show that HanNets can significantly reduce the number of model\nparameters while maintaining or improving the level of generalization accuracy.\nIn addition, by adding a few Han-layers into the pre-classification FC-layer of\na convolutional neural network, we are able to quickly improve a\nstate-of-the-art result on CIFAR10 dataset. These proof-of-concept results are\nsufficient to necessitate further studies on HanNets to understand their\ncapacities and limits, and to exploit their potentials in real-world\napplications.",

However, English is the predominant\nlanguage for online resources and technical knowledge, journals, and\ndocumentation. Consequently, many Bangla-speaking people, who have limited\ncommand of English, face hurdles to utilize English resources. To bridge the\ngap between limited support and increasing demand, researchers conducted many\nexperiments and developed valuable tools and techniques to create and process\nBangla language materials. Many efforts are also ongoing to make it easy to use\nthe Bangla language in the online and technical domains. There are some review\npapers to understand the past, previous, and future Bangla Natural Language\nProcessing (BNLP) trends. The studies are mainly concentrated on the specific\ndomains of BNLP, such as sentiment analysis, speech recognition, optical\ncharacter recognition, and text summarization. There is an apparent scarcity of\nresources that contain a comprehensive study of the recent BNLP tools and\nmethods. Therefore, in this paper, we present a thorough review of 71 BNLP\nresearch papers and categorize them into 11 categories, namely Information\nExtraction, Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition, Parsing, Parts of\nSpeech Tagging, Question Answering System, Sentiment Analysis, Spam and Fake\nDetection, Text Summarization, Word Sense Disambiguation, and Speech Processing\nand Recognition. We study articles published between 1999 to 2021, and 50% of\nthe papers were published after 2015. We discuss Classical, Machine Learning\nand Deep Learning approaches with different datasets while addressing the\nlimitations and current and future trends of the BNLP.",

Since its introduction more than 50 years\nago, the Chow-Liu algorithm, which efficiently computes the maximum likelihood\ntree, has been the benchmark algorithm for learning tree-structured graphical\nmodels. A bound on the sample complexity of the Chow-Liu algorithm with respect\nto the prediction-centric local total variation loss was shown in [BK19]. While\nthose results demonstrated that it is possible to learn a useful model even\nwhen recovering the true underlying graph is impossible, their bound depends on\nthe maximum strength of interactions and thus does not achieve the\ninformation-theoretic optimum. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm that\ncarefully combines elements of the Chow-Liu algorithm with tree metric\nreconstruction methods to efficiently and optimally learn tree Ising models\nunder a prediction-centric loss.

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm for machine learning, in\nwhich data owners can collaboratively train a model by sharing gradients\ninstead of their raw data. Two fundamental research problems in FL are\nincentive mechanism and privacy protection. The former focuses on how to\nincentivize data owners to participate in FL. The latter studies how to protect\ndata owners' privacy while maintaining high utility of trained models. However,\nincentive mechanism and privacy protection in FL have been studied separately\nand no work solves both problems at the same time. In this work, we address the\ntwo problems simultaneously by an FL-Market that incentivizes data owners'\nparticipation by providing appropriate payments and privacy protection.\nFL-Market enables data owners to obtain compensation according to their privacy\nloss quantified by local differential privacy (LDP). Our insight is that, by\nmeeting data owners' personalized privacy preferences and providing appropriate\npayments, we can (1) incentivize privacy risk-tolerant data owners to set\nlarger privacy parameters (i.e., gradients with less noise) and (2) provide\npreferred privacy protection for privacy risk-averse data owners. To achieve\nthis, we design a personalized LDP-based FL framework with a deep\nlearning-empowered auction mechanism for incentivizing trading gradients with\nless noise and optimal aggregation mechanisms for model updates. Our\nexperiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework and mechanisms.",

Based on the Cross-Barcode, we\nintroduce the Manifold Topology Divergence score (MTop-Divergence) and apply it\nto assess the performance of deep generative models in various domains: images,\n3D-shapes, time-series, and on different datasets: MNIST, Fashion MNIST, SVHN,\nCIFAR10, FFHQ, chest X-ray images, market stock data, ShapeNet. We demonstrate\nthat the MTop-Divergence accurately detects various degrees of mode-dropping,\nintra-mode collapse, mode invention, and image disturbance. Our algorithm\nscales well (essentially linearly) with the increase of the dimension of the\nambient high-dimensional space. It is one of the first TDA-based practical\nmethodologies that can be applied universally to datasets of different sizes\nand dimensions, including the ones on which the most recent GANs in the visual\ndomain are trained.

One common\nrecipe for conserving computation arising from feature extraction is to\npropagate features of few selected keyframes.

To leverage fast image\nsegmentation for furthering video segmentation, we propose a simple yet\nefficient propagation framework. Specifically, we perform lightweight flow\nestimation in 1/8-downscaled image space for temporal warping in segmentation\noutpace space. Moreover, we introduce a guided spatially-varying convolution\nfor fusing segmentations derived from the previous and current frames, to\nmitigate propagation error and enable lightweight feature extraction on\nnon-keyframes.

Intuitively, pairs of events that are always\nobserved in the same order are likely to be separated by an irreversible\nsequence of actions. Conveniently, learning the temporal order of events can be\ndone in a fully self-supervised way, which we use to estimate the reversibility\nof actions from experience, without any priors. We propose two different\nstrategies that incorporate reversibility in RL agents, one strategy for\nexploration (RAE) and one strategy for control (RAC). We demonstrate the\npotential of reversibility-aware agents in several environments, including the\nchallenging Sokoban game.

          "description": "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) raises keen attention to identifying sparse\ntrainable subnetworks, or winning tickets, of training, which can be trained in\nisolation to achieve similar or even better performance compared to the full\nmodels. Despite many efforts being made, the most effective method to identify\nsuch winning tickets is still Iterative Magnitude-based Pruning (IMP), which is\ncomputationally expensive and has to be run thoroughly for every different\nnetwork. A natural question that comes in is: can we \"transform\" the winning\nticket found in one network to another with a different architecture, yielding\na winning ticket for the latter at the beginning, without re-doing the\nexpensive IMP? Answering this question is not only practically relevant for\nefficient \"once-for-all\" winning ticket finding, but also theoretically\nappealing for uncovering inherently scalable sparse patterns in networks. We\nconduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and propose a variety\nof strategies to tweak the winning tickets found from different networks of the\nsame model family (e.g., ResNets). Based on these results, we articulate the\nElastic Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (E-LTH): by mindfully replicating (or\ndropping) and re-ordering layers for one network, its corresponding winning\nticket could be stretched (or squeezed) into a subnetwork for another deeper\n(or shallower) network from the same family, whose performance is nearly the\nsame competitive as the latter's winning ticket directly found by IMP.

          "description": "Robotic tasks such as manipulation with visual inputs require image features\nthat capture the physical properties of the scene, e.g., the position and\nconfiguration of objects. Recently, it has been suggested to learn such\nfeatures in an unsupervised manner from simulated, self-supervised, robot\ninteraction; the idea being that high-level physical properties are well\ncaptured by modern physical simulators, and their representation from visual\ninputs may transfer well to the real world. In particular, learning methods\nbased on noise contrastive estimation have shown promising results. To\nrobustify the simulation-to-real transfer, domain randomization (DR) was\nsuggested for learning features that are invariant to irrelevant visual\nproperties such as textures or lighting. In this work, however, we show that a\nnaive application of DR to unsupervised learning based on contrastive\nestimation does not promote invariance, as the loss function maximizes mutual\ninformation between the features and both the relevant and irrelevant visual\nproperties. We propose a simple modification of the contrastive loss to fix\nthis, exploiting the fact that we can control the simulated randomization of\nvisual properties. Our approach learns physical features that are significantly\nmore robust to visual domain variation, as we demonstrate using both rigid and\nnon-rigid objects.",

          "description": "Motivated by packet routing in computer networks, online queuing systems are\ncomposed of queues receiving packets at different rates. Repeatedly, they send\npackets to servers, each of them treating only at most one packet at a time. In\nthe centralized case, the number of accumulated packets remains bounded (i.e.,\nthe system is \\textit{stable}) as long as the ratio between service rates and\narrival rates is larger than $1$. In the decentralized case, individual\nno-regret strategies ensures stability when this ratio is larger than $2$. Yet,\nmyopically minimizing regret disregards the long term effects due to the\ncarryover of packets to further rounds. On the other hand, minimizing long term\ncosts leads to stable Nash equilibria as soon as the ratio exceeds\n$\\frac{e}{e-1}$. Stability with decentralized learning strategies with a ratio\nbelow $2$ was a major remaining question. We first argue that for ratios up to\n$2$, cooperation is required for stability of learning strategies, as selfish\nminimization of policy regret, a \\textit{patient} notion of regret, might\nindeed still be unstable in this case. We therefore consider cooperative queues\nand propose the first learning decentralized algorithm guaranteeing stability\nof the system as long as the ratio of rates is larger than $1$, thus reaching\nperformances comparable to centralized strategies.",

In the online phase, it utilizes the resulting order-preserving\nconditional transport map to issue real-time characterization of the\nconditional beliefs given new observed information.

          "description": "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis suggests that an over-parametrized network\nconsists of ``lottery tickets'', and training a certain collection of them\n(i.e., a subnetwork) can match the performance of the full model. In this\npaper, we study such a collection of tickets, which is referred to as ``winning\ntickets'', in extremely over-parametrized models, e.g., pre-trained language\nmodels. We observe that at certain compression ratios, the generalization\nperformance of the winning tickets can not only match but also exceed that of\nthe full model. In particular, we observe a phase transition phenomenon: As the\ncompression ratio increases, generalization performance of the winning tickets\nfirst improves then deteriorates after a certain threshold. We refer to the\ntickets on the threshold as ``super tickets''. We further show that the phase\ntransition is task and model dependent -- as the model size becomes larger and\nthe training data set becomes smaller, the transition becomes more pronounced.\nOur experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that the super tickets improve\nsingle task fine-tuning by $0.9$ points on BERT-base and $1.0$ points on\nBERT-large, in terms of task-average score. We also demonstrate that adaptively\nsharing the super tickets across tasks benefits multi-task learning.",

          "description": "There has been a growing interest in model-agnostic methods that can make\ndeep learning models more transparent and explainable to a user. Some\nresearchers recently argued that for a machine to achieve a certain degree of\nhuman-level explainability, this machine needs to provide human causally\nunderstandable explanations, also known as causability. A specific class of\nalgorithms that have the potential to provide causability are counterfactuals.\nThis paper presents an in-depth systematic review of the diverse existing body\nof literature on counterfactuals and causability for explainable artificial\nintelligence. We performed an LDA topic modelling analysis under a PRISMA\nframework to find the most relevant literature articles. This analysis resulted\nin a novel taxonomy that considers the grounding theories of the surveyed\nalgorithms, together with their underlying properties and applications in\nreal-world data. This research suggests that current model-agnostic\ncounterfactual algorithms for explainable AI are not grounded on a causal\ntheoretical formalism and, consequently, cannot promote causability to a human\ndecision-maker. Our findings suggest that the explanations derived from major\nalgorithms in the literature provide spurious correlations rather than\ncause/effects relationships, leading to sub-optimal, erroneous or even biased\nexplanations. This paper also advances the literature with new directions and\nchallenges on promoting causability in model-agnostic approaches for\nexplainable artificial intelligence.",

A puzzling phenomenon in deep learning is that models are trained\nwith many more parameters than what this classical theory would suggest. We\npropose a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. We prove that for a\nbroad class of data distributions and model classes, overparametrization is\nnecessary if one wants to interpolate the data smoothly. Namely we show that\nsmooth interpolation requires $d$ times more parameters than mere\ninterpolation, where $d$ is the ambient data dimension. We prove this universal\nlaw of robustness for any smoothly parametrized function class with polynomial\nsize weights, and any covariate distribution verifying isoperimetry. In the\ncase of two-layers neural networks and Gaussian covariates, this law was\nconjectured in prior work by Bubeck, Li and Nagaraj.

We theoretically show that the solution of the\nnew equation is exactly the optimal value function and the corresponding\noperator converges faster than the classical operator. Besides, it leads to a\nnew multi-step off-policy algorithm, which is capable of safely utilizing any\noff-policy data collected by the arbitrary policy.

Our attack model is strictly stronger than those\nconsidered in prior works. Our first result shows that no algorithm can find a\nbetter than $O(\\epsilon)$-optimal policy under our attack model. Next, we show\nthat surprisingly the natural policy gradient (NPG) method retains a natural\nrobustness property if the reward corruption is bounded, and can find an\n$O(\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$-optimal policy. Consequently, we develop a Filtered Policy\nGradient (FPG) algorithm that can tolerate even unbounded reward corruption and\ncan find an $O(\\epsilon^{1/4})$-optimal policy. We emphasize that FPG is the\nfirst that can achieve a meaningful learning guarantee when a constant fraction\nof episodes are corrupted.

          "description": "Noise and low quality of ECG signals acquired from Holter or wearable devices\ndeteriorate the accuracy and robustness of R-peak detection algorithms. This\npaper presents a generic and robust system for R-peak detection in Holter ECG\nsignals. While many proposed algorithms have successfully addressed the problem\nof ECG R-peak detection, there is still a notable gap in the performance of\nthese detectors on such low-quality ECG records. Therefore, in this study, a\nnovel implementation of the 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used\nintegrated with a verification model to reduce the number of false alarms. This\nCNN architecture consists of an encoder block and a corresponding decoder block\nfollowed by a sample-wise classification layer to construct the 1D segmentation\nmap of R- peaks from the input ECG signal. Once the proposed model has been\ntrained, it can solely be used to detect R-peaks possibly in a single channel\nECG data stream quickly and accurately, or alternatively, such a solution can\nbe conveniently employed for real-time monitoring on a lightweight portable\ndevice. The model is tested on two open-access ECG databases: The China\nPhysiological Signal Challenge (2020) database (CPSC-DB) with more than one\nmillion beats, and the commonly used MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MIT-DB).\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed systematic approach achieves\n99.30% F1-score, 99.69% recall, and 98.91% precision in CPSC-DB, which is the\nbest R-peak detection performance ever achieved. Compared to all competing\nmethods, the proposed approach can reduce the false-positives and\nfalse-negatives in Holter ECG signals by more than 54% and 82%, respectively.\nResults also demonstrate similar or better performance than most competing\nalgorithms on MIT-DB with 99.83% F1-score, 99.85% recall, and 99.82% precision.",

          "description": "AdaBelief, one of the current best optimizers, demonstrates superior\ngeneralization ability compared to the popular Adam algorithm by viewing the\nexponential moving average of observed gradients. AdaBelief is theoretically\nappealing in that it has a data-dependent $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when\nobjective functions are convex, where $T$ is a time horizon. It remains however\nan open problem whether the convergence rate can be further improved without\nsacrificing its generalization ability. %on how to exploit strong convexity to\nfurther improve the convergence rate of AdaBelief. To this end, we make a first\nattempt in this work and design a novel optimization algorithm called\nFastAdaBelief that aims to exploit its strong convexity in order to achieve an\neven faster convergence rate. In particular, by adjusting the step size that\nbetter considers strong convexity and prevents fluctuation, our proposed\nFastAdaBelief demonstrates excellent generalization ability as well as superior\nconvergence. As an important theoretical contribution, we prove that\nFastAdaBelief attains a data-dependant $O(\\log T)$ regret bound, which is\nsubstantially lower than AdaBelief. On the empirical side, we validate our\ntheoretical analysis with extensive experiments in both scenarios of strong and\nnon-strong convexity on three popular baseline models. Experimental results are\nvery encouraging: FastAdaBelief converges the quickest in comparison to all\nmainstream algorithms while maintaining an excellent generalization ability, in\ncases of both strong or non-strong convexity. FastAdaBelief is thus posited as\na new benchmark model for the research community.",

Yet, recent work has found that they often assign a higher\nlikelihood to data from outside the training distribution. This seemingly\nparadoxical behavior has caused concerns over the quality of the attained\ndensity estimates. In the context of hierarchical variational autoencoders, we\nprovide evidence to explain this behavior by out-of-distribution data having\nin-distribution low-level features. We argue that this is both expected and\ndesirable behavior. With this insight in hand, we develop a fast, scalable and\nfully unsupervised likelihood-ratio score for OOD detection that requires data\nto be in-distribution across all feature-levels.

While the laws for scaling Transformer language models\nhave been studied, it is unknown how Vision Transformers scale. To address\nthis, we scale ViT models and data, both up and down, and characterize the\nrelationships between error rate, data, and compute. Along the way, we refine\nthe architecture and training of ViT, reducing memory consumption and\nincreasing accuracy the resulting models. As a result, we successfully train a\nViT model with two billion parameters, which attains a new state-of-the-art on\nImageNet of 90.45% top-1 accuracy.

          "description": "Recent works show that group equivariance as an inductive bias improves\nneural network performance for both classification and generation. However,\ndesigning group-equivariant neural networks is challenging when the group of\ninterest is large and is unknown. Moreover, inducing equivariance can\nsignificantly reduce the number of independent parameters in a network with\nfixed feature size, affecting its overall performance. We address these\nproblems by proving a new group-theoretic result in the context of equivariant\nneural networks that shows that a network is equivariant to a large group if\nand only if it is equivariant to smaller groups from which it is constructed.\nUsing this result, we design a novel fast group equivariant construction\nalgorithm, and a deep Q-learning-based search algorithm in a reduced search\nspace, yielding what we call autoequivariant networks (AENs). AENs find the\nright balance between equivariance and network size when tested on new\nbenchmark datasets, G-MNIST and G-Fashion-MNIST, obtained via group\ntransformations on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST respectively that we release.\nExtending these results to group convolutional neural networks, where we\noptimize between equivariances, augmentations, and network sizes, we find group\nequivariance to be the most dominating factor in all high-performing GCNNs on\nseveral datasets like CIFAR10, SVHN, RotMNIST, ASL, EMNIST, and KMNIST.",

          "description": "Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across\nvarious machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head\nself-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image\npatches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such\nflexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can\nfacilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain\nshifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We\nsystematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments\nencompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following\nintriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe\nocclusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.\n(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local\ntextures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to\nCNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate\nshape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,\npreviously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape\nrepresentation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic\nsegmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a\nsingle ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high\naccuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional\nand few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to\nflexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention\nmechanism.",

          "description": "Despite their impressive performance in object recognition and other tasks\nunder standard testing conditions, deep networks often fail to generalize to\nout-of-distribution (o.o.d.) samples. One cause for this shortcoming is that\nmodern architectures tend to rely on \"shortcuts\" - superficial features that\ncorrelate with categories without capturing deeper invariants that hold across\ncontexts. Real-world concepts often possess a complex structure that can vary\nsuperficially across contexts, which can make the most intuitive and promising\nsolutions in one context not generalize to others. One potential way to improve\no.o.d. generalization is to assume simple solutions are unlikely to be valid\nacross contexts and avoid them, which we refer to as the too-good-to-be-true\nprior. A low-capacity network (LCN) with a shallow architecture should only be\nable to learn surface relationships, including shortcuts. We find that LCNs can\nserve as shortcut detectors. Furthermore, an LCN's predictions can be used in a\ntwo-stage approach to encourage a high-capacity network (HCN) to rely on deeper\ninvariant features that should generalize broadly. In particular, items that\nthe LCN can master are downweighted when training the HCN. Using a modified\nversion of the CIFAR-10 dataset in which we introduced shortcuts, we found that\nthe two-stage LCN-HCN approach reduced reliance on shortcuts and facilitated\no.o.d. generalization.",

          "description": "Sound event localization aims at estimating the positions of sound sources in\nthe environment with respect to an acoustic receiver (e.g. a microphone array).\nRecent advances in this domain most prominently focused on utilizing deep\nrecurrent neural networks. Inspired by the success of transformer architectures\nas a suitable alternative to classical recurrent neural networks, this paper\nintroduces a novel transformer-based sound event localization framework, where\ntemporal dependencies in the received multi-channel audio signals are captured\nvia self-attention mechanisms. Additionally, the estimated sound event\npositions are represented as multivariate Gaussian variables, yielding an\nadditional notion of uncertainty, which many previously proposed deep\nlearning-based systems designed for this application do not provide. The\nframework is evaluated on three publicly available multi-source sound event\nlocalization datasets and compared against state-of-the-art methods in terms of\nlocalization error and event detection accuracy. It outperforms all competing\nsystems on all datasets with statistical significant differences in\nperformance.",

          "description": "Off-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) holds the promise of better data\nefficiency as it allows sample reuse and potentially enables safe interaction\nwith the environment. Current off-policy policy gradient methods either suffer\nfrom high bias or high variance, delivering often unreliable estimates. The\nprice of inefficiency becomes evident in real-world scenarios such as\ninteraction-driven robot learning, where the success of RL has been rather\nlimited, and a very high sample cost hinders straightforward application. In\nthis paper, we propose a nonparametric Bellman equation, which can be solved in\nclosed form. The solution is differentiable w.r.t the policy parameters and\ngives access to an estimation of the policy gradient. In this way, we avoid the\nhigh variance of importance sampling approaches, and the high bias of\nsemi-gradient methods. We empirically analyze the quality of our gradient\nestimate against state-of-the-art methods, and show that it outperforms the\nbaselines in terms of sample efficiency on classical control tasks.",

          "description": "The increasing level of marine plastic pollution poses severe threats to the\nmarine ecosystem and biodiversity. The present study attempted to explore the\nfull functionality of open Sentinel satellite data and ML models for detecting\nand classifying floating plastic debris in Mytilene (Greece), Limassol\n(Cyprus), Calabria (Italy), and Beirut (Lebanon). Two ML models, i.e. Support\nVector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) were utilized to carry out the\nclassification analysis. In-situ plastic location data was collected from the\ncontrol experiment conducted in Mytilene, Greece and Limassol, Cyprus, and the\nsame was considered for training the models. Both remote sensing bands and\nspectral indices were used for developing the ML models. A spectral signature\nprofile for plastic was created for discriminating the floating plastic from\nother marine debris. A newly developed index, kernel Normalized Difference\nVegetation Index (kNDVI), was incorporated into the modelling to examine its\ncontribution to model performances. Both SVM and RF were performed well in five\nmodels and test case combinations. Among the two ML models, the highest\nperformance was measured for the RF. The inclusion of kNDVI was found effective\nand increased the model performances, reflected by high balanced accuracy\nmeasured for model 2 (~80% to ~98 % for SVM and ~87% to ~97 % for RF). Using\nthe best-performed model, an automated floating plastic detection system was\ndeveloped and tested in Calabria and Beirut. For both sites, the trained model\nhad detected the floating plastic with ~99% accuracy. Among the six predictors,\nthe FDI was found the most important variable for detecting marine floating\nplastic. These findings collectively suggest that high-resolution remote\nsensing imagery and the automated ML models can be an effective alternative for\nthe cost-effective detection of marine floating plastic.",

          "description": "Real world applications such as economics and policy making often involve\nsolving multi-agent games with two unique features: (1) The agents are\ninherently asymmetric and partitioned into leaders and followers; (2) The\nagents have different reward functions, thus the game is general-sum. The\nmajority of existing results in this field focuses on either symmetric solution\nconcepts (e.g. Nash equilibrium) or zero-sum games. It remains vastly open how\nto learn the Stackelberg equilibrium -- an asymmetric analog of the Nash\nequilibrium -- in general-sum games efficiently from samples.\n\nThis paper initiates the theoretical study of sample-efficient learning of\nthe Stackelberg equilibrium, in the bandit feedback setting where we only\nobserve noisy samples of the reward. We consider three representative\ntwo-player general-sum games: bandit games, bandit-reinforcement learning\n(bandit-RL) games, and linear bandit games. In all these games, we identify a\nfundamental gap between the exact value of the Stackelberg equilibrium and its\nestimated version using finitely many noisy samples, which can not be closed\ninformation-theoretically regardless of the algorithm. We then establish sharp\npositive results on sample-efficient learning of Stackelberg equilibrium with\nvalue optimal up to the gap identified above, with matching lower bounds in the\ndependency on the gap, error tolerance, and the size of the action spaces.\nOverall, our results unveil unique challenges in learning Stackelberg\nequilibria under noisy bandit feedback, which we hope could shed light on\nfuture research on this topic.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are notorious for making more mistakes for the\nclasses that have substantially fewer samples than the others during training.\nSuch class imbalance is ubiquitous in clinical applications and very crucial to\nhandle because the classes with fewer samples most often correspond to critical\ncases (e.g., cancer) where misclassifications can have severe consequences. Not\nto miss such cases, binary classifiers need to be operated at high True\nPositive Rates (TPR) by setting a higher threshold but this comes at the cost\nof very high False Positive Rates (FPR) for problems with class imbalance.\nExisting methods for learning under class imbalance most often do not take this\ninto account. We argue that prediction accuracy should be improved by\nemphasizing reducing FPRs at high TPRs for problems where misclassification of\nthe positive, i.e., critical, class samples are associated with higher cost. To\nthis end, we pose the training of a DNN for binary classification as a\nconstrained optimization problem and introduce a novel constraint that can be\nused with existing loss functions to enforce maximal area under the ROC curve\n(AUC) through prioritizing FPR reduction at high TPR. We solve the resulting\nconstrained optimization problem using an Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM).\nGoing beyond binary, we also propose two possible extensions of the proposed\nconstraint for multi-class classification problems. We present experimental\nresults for image-based binary and multi-class classification applications\nusing an in-house medical imaging dataset, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Our results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method improves the baselines in majority of the\ncases by attaining higher accuracy on critical classes while reducing the\nmisclassification rate for the non-critical class samples.",

Very effective representations are obtained when\npowerful externally trained feature extractors (e.g. ResNets pre-trained on\nImageNet) are fine-tuned on the training data which consists of normal samples\nand no anomalies. However, this is a difficult task that can suffer from\ncatastrophic collapse, i.e. it is prone to learning trivial and non-specific\nfeatures.

          "description": "The ever-growing computational demands of increasingly complex machine\nlearning models frequently necessitate the use of powerful cloud-based\ninfrastructure for their training. Binary neural networks are known to be\npromising candidates for on-device inference due to their extreme compute and\nmemory savings over higher-precision alternatives. However, their existing\ntraining methods require the concurrent storage of high-precision activations\nfor all layers, generally making learning on memory-constrained devices\ninfeasible. In this paper, we demonstrate that the backward propagation\noperations needed for binary neural network training are strongly robust to\nquantization, thereby making on-the-edge learning with modern models a\npractical proposition. We introduce a low-cost binary neural network training\nstrategy exhibiting sizable memory footprint and energy reductions while\ninducing little to no accuracy loss vs Courbariaux & Bengio's standard\napproach. These resource decreases are primarily enabled through the retention\nof activations exclusively in binary format. Against the latter algorithm, our\ndrop-in replacement sees coincident memory requirement and energy consumption\ndrops of 2--6$\\times$, while reaching similar test accuracy in comparable time,\nacross a range of small-scale models trained to classify popular datasets. We\nalso demonstrate from-scratch ImageNet training of binarized ResNet-18,\nachieving a 3.12$\\times$ memory reduction.

          "description": "Recent years have seen a rapid growth of utilizing graph neural networks\n(GNNs) in the biomedical domain for tackling drug-related problems. However,\nlike any other deep architectures, GNNs are data hungry. While requiring labels\nin real world is often expensive, pretraining GNNs in an unsupervised manner\nhas been actively explored. Among them, graph contrastive learning, by\nmaximizing the mutual information between paired graph augmentations, has been\nshown to be effective on various downstream tasks. However, the current graph\ncontrastive learning framework has two limitations. First, the augmentations\nare designed for general graphs and thus may not be suitable or powerful enough\nfor certain domains. Second, the contrastive scheme only learns representations\nthat are invariant to local perturbations and thus does not consider the global\nstructure of the dataset, which may also be useful for downstream tasks.\nTherefore, in this paper, we study graph contrastive learning in the context of\nbiomedical domain, where molecular graphs are present. We propose a novel\nframework called MoCL, which utilizes domain knowledge at both local- and\nglobal-level to assist representation learning. The local-level domain\nknowledge guides the augmentation process such that variation is introduced\nwithout changing graph semantics. The global-level knowledge encodes the\nsimilarity information between graphs in the entire dataset and helps to learn\nrepresentations with richer semantics. The entire model is learned through a\ndouble contrast objective. We evaluate MoCL on various molecular datasets under\nboth linear and semi-supervised settings and results show that MoCL achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

          "description": "The softmax policy gradient (PG) method, which performs gradient ascent under\nsoftmax policy parameterization, is arguably one of the de facto\nimplementations of policy optimization in modern reinforcement learning. For\n$\\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs),\nremarkable progress has recently been achieved towards establishing global\nconvergence of softmax PG methods in finding a near-optimal policy. However,\nprior results fall short of delineating clear dependencies of convergence rates\non salient parameters such as the cardinality of the state space $\\mathcal{S}$\nand the effective horizon $\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$, both of which could be\nexcessively large. In this paper, we deliver a pessimistic message regarding\nthe iteration complexity of softmax PG methods, despite assuming access to\nexact gradient computation. Specifically, we demonstrate that the softmax PG\nmethod with stepsize $\\eta$ can take \\[\n\n\\frac{1}{\\eta} |\\mathcal{S}|^{2^{\\Omega\\big(\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}\\big)}}\n~\\text{iterations} \\] to converge, even in the presence of a benign policy\ninitialization and an initial state distribution amenable to exploration (so\nthat the distribution mismatch coefficient is not exceedingly large). This is\naccomplished by characterizing the algorithmic dynamics over a\ncarefully-constructed MDP containing only three actions. Our exponential lower\nbound hints at the necessity of carefully adjusting update rules or enforcing\nproper regularization in accelerating PG methods.",

          "description": "Machine learning models are commonly trained end-to-end and in a supervised\nsetting, using paired (input, output) data. Examples include recent\nsuper-resolution methods that train on pairs of (low-resolution,\nhigh-resolution) images. However, these end-to-end approaches require\nre-training every time there is a distribution shift in the inputs (e.g., night\nimages vs daylight) or relevant latent variables (e.g., camera blur or hand\nmotion). In this work, we leverage state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models\n(here StyleGAN2) for building powerful image priors, which enable application\nof Bayes' theorem for many downstream reconstruction tasks. Our method,\nBayesian Reconstruction through Generative Models (BRGM), uses a single\npre-trained generator model to solve different image restoration tasks, i.e.,\nsuper-resolution and in-painting, by combining it with different forward\ncorruption models. We keep the weights of the generator model fixed, and\nreconstruct the image by estimating the Bayesian maximum a-posteriori (MAP)\nestimate over the input latent vector that generated the reconstructed image.\nWe further use variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution\nover the latent vectors, from which we sample multiple solutions. We\ndemonstrate BRGM on three large and diverse datasets: (i) 60,000 images from\nthe Flick Faces High Quality dataset (ii) 240,000 chest X-rays from MIMIC III\nand (iii) a combined collection of 5 brain MRI datasets with 7,329 scans.\nAcross all three datasets and without any dataset-specific hyperparameter\ntuning, our simple approach yields performance competitive with current\ntask-specific state-of-the-art methods on super-resolution and in-painting,\nwhile being more generalisable and without requiring any training.

Moreover, we introduce a pilot update\nmechanism to improve the alignment between the inner-learner and meta-learner\nin meta learning algorithms that focus on an improved inner-learner.\nExperiments on various benchmarks show that MetaDistil can yield significant\nimprovements compared with traditional KD algorithms and is less sensitive to\nthe choice of different student capacity and hyperparameters, facilitating the\nuse of KD on different tasks and models.

          "description": "Modeling the dynamics of real-world physical systems is critical for\nspatiotemporal prediction tasks, but challenging when data is limited. The\nscarcity of real-world data and the difficulty in reproducing the data\ndistribution hinder directly applying meta-learning techniques. Although the\nknowledge of governing partial differential equations (PDE) of data can be\nhelpful for the fast adaptation to few observations, it is mostly infeasible to\nexactly find the equation for observations in real-world physical systems. In\nthis work, we propose a framework, physics-aware meta-learning with auxiliary\ntasks, whose spatial modules incorporate PDE-independent knowledge and temporal\nmodules utilize the generalized features from the spatial modules to be adapted\nto the limited data, respectively. The framework is inspired by a local\nconservation law expressed mathematically as a continuity equation and does not\nrequire the exact form of governing equation to model the spatiotemporal\nobservations. The proposed method mitigates the need for a large number of\nreal-world tasks for meta-learning by leveraging spatial information in\nsimulated data to meta-initialize the spatial modules. We apply the proposed\nframework to both synthetic and real-world spatiotemporal prediction tasks and\ndemonstrate its superior performance with limited observations.",

          "description": "Medical image analysis typically includes several tasks such as enhancement,\nsegmentation, and classification. Traditionally, these tasks are implemented\nusing separate deep learning models for separate tasks, which is not efficient\nbecause it involves unnecessary training repetitions, demands greater\ncomputational resources, and requires a relatively large amount of labeled\ndata. In this paper, we propose a multi-task training approach for medical\nimage analysis, where individual tasks are fine-tuned simultaneously through\nrelevant knowledge transfer using a unified modality-specific feature\nrepresentation (UMS-Rep). We explore different fine-tuning strategies to\ndemonstrate the impact of the strategy on the performance of target medical\nimage tasks. We experiment with different visual tasks (e.g., image denoising,\nsegmentation, and classification) to highlight the advantages offered with our\napproach for two imaging modalities, chest X-ray and Doppler echocardiography.\nOur results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the overall demand\nfor computational resources and improves target task generalization and\nperformance. Further, our results prove that the performance of target tasks in\nmedical images is highly influenced by the utilized fine-tuning strategy.",

Often after initially released, it undergoes several\nrevisions later (maybe due to human or technical constraints) - as a result, it\nmay take weeks until the data reaches to a stable value. This so-called\n'backfill' phenomenon and its effect on model performance has been barely\nstudied in the prior literature. In this paper, we introduce the multi-variate\nbackfill problem using COVID-19 as the motivating example. We construct a\ndetailed dataset composed of relevant signals over the past year of the\npandemic. We then systematically characterize several patterns in backfill\ndynamics and leverage our observations for formulating a novel problem and\nneural framework Back2Future that aims to refines a given model's predictions\nin real-time. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method refines the\nperformance of top models for COVID-19 forecasting, in contrast to non-trivial\nbaselines, yielding 18% improvement over baselines, enabling us obtain a new\nSOTA performance. In addition, we show that our model improves model evaluation\ntoo; hence policy-makers can better understand the true accuracy of forecasting\nmodels in real-time.",

          "description": "In this paper we consider multi-objective reinforcement learning where the\nobjectives are balanced using preferences. In practice, the preferences are\noften given in an adversarial manner, e.g., customers can be picky in many\napplications. We formalize this problem as an episodic learning problem on a\nMarkov decision process, where transitions are unknown and a reward function is\nthe inner product of a preference vector with pre-specified multi-objective\nreward functions. We consider two settings. In the online setting, the agent\nreceives a (adversarial) preference every episode and proposes policies to\ninteract with the environment. We provide a model-based algorithm that achieves\na nearly minimax optimal regret bound\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\bigl(\\sqrt{\\min\\{d,S\\}\\cdot H^2 SAK}\\bigr)$, where $d$\nis the number of objectives, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of\nactions, $H$ is the length of the horizon, and $K$ is the number of episodes.\nFurthermore, we consider preference-free exploration, i.e., the agent first\ninteracts with the environment without specifying any preference and then is\nable to accommodate arbitrary preference vector up to $\\epsilon$ error. Our\nproposed algorithm is provably efficient with a nearly optimal trajectory\ncomplexity $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\bigl({\\min\\{d,S\\}\\cdot H^3\nSA}/{\\epsilon^2}\\bigr)$.

          "description": "This paper investigates the motion planning of autonomous dynamical systems\nmodeled by Markov decision processes (MDP) with unknown transition\nprobabilities over continuous state and action spaces. Linear temporal logic\n(LTL) is used to specify high-level tasks over infinite horizon, which can be\nconverted into a limit deterministic generalized B\\\"uchi automaton (LDGBA) with\nseveral accepting sets. The novelty is to design an embedded product MDP\n(EP-MDP) between the LDGBA and the MDP by incorporating a synchronous\ntracking-frontier function to record unvisited accepting sets of the automaton,\nand to facilitate the satisfaction of the accepting conditions. The proposed\nLDGBA-based reward shaping and discounting schemes for the model-free\nreinforcement learning (RL) only depend on the EP-MDP states and can overcome\nthe issues of sparse rewards. Rigorous analysis shows that any RL method that\noptimizes the expected discounted return is guaranteed to find an optimal\npolicy whose traces maximize the satisfaction probability. A modular deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is then developed to generate such\npolicies over continuous state and action spaces.

More\nroughly, they will fail in handling the third challenge, let alone addressing\nthe three jointly. In this paper, we aim at meeting these under the least\nassumption by building a concise yet effective model with just one\nhyper-parameter. To ease insufficiency of available labels, we exploit not only\nthe consensus of multiple views but also the global and local structures hidden\namong multiple labels. Specifically, we introduce an indicator matrix to tackle\nthe first two challenges in a regression form while aligning the same\nindividual labels and all labels of different views in a common label space to\nbattle the third challenge. In aligning, we characterize the global and local\nstructures of multiple labels to be high-rank and low-rank, respectively.\nSubsequently, an efficient algorithm with linear time complexity in the number\nof samples is established.

          "description": "Accurate and trustworthy epidemic forecasting is an important problem that\nhas impact on public health planning and disease mitigation. Most existing\nepidemic forecasting models disregard uncertainty quantification, resulting in\nmis-calibrated predictions. Recent works in deep neural models for\nuncertainty-aware time-series forecasting also have several limitations; e.g.\nit is difficult to specify meaningful priors in Bayesian NNs, while methods\nlike deep ensembling are computationally expensive in practice. In this paper,\nwe fill this important gap. We model the forecasting task as a probabilistic\ngenerative process and propose a functional neural process model called EPIFNP,\nwhich directly models the probability density of the forecast value. EPIFNP\nleverages a dynamic stochastic correlation graph to model the correlations\nbetween sequences in a non-parametric way, and designs different stochastic\nlatent variables to capture functional uncertainty from different perspectives.\nOur extensive experiments in a real-time flu forecasting setting show that\nEPIFNP significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in both\naccuracy and calibration metrics, up to 2.5x in accuracy and 2.4x in\ncalibration. Additionally, due to properties of its generative process,EPIFNP\nlearns the relations between the current season and similar patterns of\nhistorical seasons,enabling interpretable forecasts. Beyond epidemic\nforecasting, the EPIFNP can be of independent interest for advancing principled\nuncertainty quantification in deep sequential models for predictive analytics",

Since biotherapeutics are\nmanufactured in living cells whose biological mechanisms are complex and have\nhighly variable outputs, in this paper, we introduce a model-based\nreinforcement learning framework accounting for model risk to support\nbioprocess online learning and guide the optimal reliable customized stopping\npolicy for fermentation process. Specifically, built on the dynamic mechanisms\nof protein and impurity generation, we first construct a probabilistic model\ncharacterizing the impact of underlying bioprocess stochastic uncertainty on\nimpurity and protein growth rates. Since biopharmaceutical manufacturing often\nhas very limited batch data during the development and early stage of\nproduction, we derive the posterior distribution quantifying the process model\nrisk, and further develop the Bayesian rule based knowledge update to support\nbioprocess online learning. With the prediction risk accounting for both\nbioprocess stochastic uncertainty and model risk, the proposed reinforcement\nlearning framework can provide the optimal and reliable decision making. We\nconduct the structural analysis of optimal policy and study the impact of model\nrisk on the policy selection. We can show that it asymptotically converges to\nthe optimal policy obtained under perfect information of underlying stochastic\nprocess. Our case studies demonstrate that the proposed framework can greatly\nimprove the biomanufacturing industrial practice.",

Predicting higher-order relationships, i.e hyperedge,\nbecomes a fundamental problem for the full understanding of complicated\ninteractions. The development of graph neural network (GNN) has greatly\nadvanced the analysis of ordinary graphs with pair-wise relations. However,\nthese methods could not be easily extended to the case of hypergraph. In this\npaper, we generalize the challenges of GNN in representing higher-order data in\nprinciple, which are edge- and node-level ambiguities. To overcome the\nchallenges, we present \\textbf{SNALS} that utilizes bipartite graph neural\nnetwork with structural features to collectively tackle the two ambiguity\nissues. SNALS captures the joint interactions of a hyperedge by its local\nenvironment, which is retrieved by collecting the spectrum information of their\nconnections. As a result, SNALS achieves nearly 30% performance increase\ncompared with most recent GNN-based models. In addition, we applied SNALS to\npredict genetic higher-order interactions on 3D genome organization data.

In the problem, the rewards are\nindependently sampled from distributions across all agents and rounds, but they\nmay be corrupted by an adversary. Our goal is to minimize both the overall\nregret and communication cost across all agents. We first show that an additive\nterm of corruption is unavoidable for any algorithm in this problem. Then, we\npropose a new algorithm that is agnostic to the level of corruption. Our\nalgorithm not only achieves near-optimal regret in the stochastic setting, but\nalso obtains a regret with an additive term of corruption in the corrupted\nsetting, while maintaining efficient communication. The algorithm is also\napplicable for the single-agent corruption problem, and achieves a high\nprobability regret that removes the multiplicative dependence of $K$ on\ncorruption level.

Previous queries in the user session can provide useful context for the\nuser's intent and can be leveraged to suggest auto-completions that are more\nrelevant while adhering to the user's prefix. Such session-aware QACs can be\ngenerated by recent sequence-to-sequence deep learning models; however, these\ngenerative approaches often do not meet the stringent latency requirements of\nresponding to each user keystroke. Moreover, these generative approaches pose\nthe risk of showing nonsensical queries.\n\nIn this paper, we provide a solution to this problem: we take the novel\napproach of modeling session-aware QAC as an eXtreme Multi-Label Ranking (XMR)\nproblem where the input is the previous query in the session and the user's\ncurrent prefix, while the output space is the set of tens of millions of\nqueries entered by users in the recent past.

In the face of a complex environment\nor constraints on time and resources, however, aiming to synthesize such an\noptimal policy can become infeasible. These scenarios give rise to an important\ntrade-off between the information an agent must acquire to learn and the\nsub-optimality of the resulting policy. While an agent designer has a\npreference for how this trade-off is resolved, existing approaches further\nrequire that the designer translate these preferences into a fixed learning\ntarget for the agent.

          "description": "The goal of fairness in classification is to learn a classifier that does not\ndiscriminate against groups of individuals based on sensitive attributes, such\nas race and gender. One approach to designing fair algorithms is to use\nrelaxations of fairness notions as regularization terms or in a constrained\noptimization problem. We observe that the hyperbolic tangent function can\napproximate the indicator function. We leverage this property to define a\ndifferentiable relaxation that approximates fairness notions provably better\nthan existing relaxations. In addition, we propose a model-agnostic\nmulti-objective architecture that can simultaneously optimize for multiple\nfairness notions and multiple sensitive attributes and supports all statistical\nparity-based notions of fairness. We use our relaxation with the\nmulti-objective architecture to learn fair classifiers. Experiments on public\ndatasets show that our method suffers a significantly lower loss of accuracy\nthan current debiasing algorithms relative to the unconstrained model.",

          "description": "In recent years, the Transformer architecture has proven to be very\nsuccessful in sequence processing, but its application to other data\nstructures, such as graphs, has remained limited due to the difficulty of\nproperly defining positions. Here, we present the $\\textit{Spectral Attention\nNetwork}$ (SAN), which uses a learned positional encoding (LPE) that can take\nadvantage of the full Laplacian spectrum to learn the position of each node in\na given graph. This LPE is then added to the node features of the graph and\npassed to a fully-connected Transformer. By leveraging the full spectrum of the\nLaplacian, our model is theoretically powerful in distinguishing graphs, and\ncan better detect similar sub-structures from their resonance. Further, by\nfully connecting the graph, the Transformer does not suffer from\nover-squashing, an information bottleneck of most GNNs, and enables better\nmodeling of physical phenomenons such as heat transfer and electric\ninteraction. When tested empirically on a set of 4 standard datasets, our model\nperforms on par or better than state-of-the-art GNNs, and outperforms any\nattention-based model by a wide margin, becoming the first fully-connected\narchitecture to perform well on graph benchmarks.",

More precisely, under a\nmild assumption, we prove that the deviation of the representations from\northogonality rapidly decays with depth up to a term inversely proportional to\nthe network width. This result has two main implications: 1) Theoretically, as\nthe depth grows, the distribution of the representation -- after the linear\nlayers -- contracts to a Wasserstein-2 ball around an isotropic Gaussian\ndistribution. Furthermore, the radius of this Wasserstein ball shrinks with the\nwidth of the network. 2) In practice, the orthogonality of the representations\ndirectly influences the performance of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). When\nrepresentations are initially aligned, we observe SGD wastes many iterations to\northogonalize representations before the classification.

Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)\nalgorithms aim to make an efficient use of the current generation of quantum\nhardware. However, optimizing variational quantum algorithms is a challenge as\nit is an NP-hard problem that in general requires an exponential time to solve\nand can contain many far from optimal local minima. Here, we present a current\nterm NISQ algorithm for SDP. The classical optimization program of our NISQ\nsolver is another SDP over a smaller dimensional ansatz space. We harness the\nSDP based formulation of the Hamiltonian ground state problem to design a NISQ\neigensolver. Unlike variational quantum eigensolvers, the classical\noptimization program of our eigensolver is convex, can be solved in polynomial\ntime with the number of ansatz parameters and every local minimum is a global\nminimum. Further, we demonstrate the potential of our NISQ SDP solver by\nfinding the largest eigenvalue of up to $2^{1000}$ dimensional matrices and\nsolving graph problems related to quantum contextuality.

          "description": "Discrete supervised learning problems such as classification are often\ntackled by introducing a continuous surrogate problem akin to regression.\nBounding the original error, between estimate and solution, by the surrogate\nerror endows discrete problems with convergence rates already shown for\ncontinuous instances. Yet, current approaches do not leverage the fact that\ndiscrete problems are essentially predicting a discrete output when continuous\nproblems are predicting a continuous value. In this paper, we tackle this issue\nfor general structured prediction problems, opening the way to \"super fast\"\nrates, that is, convergence rates for the excess risk faster than $n^{-1}$,\nwhere $n$ is the number of observations, with even exponential rates with the\nstrongest assumptions. We first illustrate it for predictors based on nearest\nneighbors, generalizing rates known for binary classification to any discrete\nproblem within the framework of structured prediction. We then consider kernel\nridge regression where we improve known rates in $n^{-1/4}$ to arbitrarily fast\nrates, depending on a parameter characterizing the hardness of the problem,\nthus allowing, under smoothness assumptions, to bypass the curse of\ndimensionality.",

This is the first\ntheoretical study of online bin packing in the realistic setting of erroneous\npredictions, as well as the first experimental study in the setting in which\nthe input is generated according to both static and evolving distributions.\nPrevious work on this problem has only addressed the extreme cases with respect\nto the prediction error, has relied on overly powerful and error-free\nprediction oracles, and has focused on experimental evaluation based on static\ninput distributions.",

          "description": "Recently, there has been considerable research interest in graph clustering\naimed at data partition using the graph information. However, one limitation of\nthe most of graph-based methods is that they assume the graph structure to\noperate is fixed and reliable. And there are inevitably some edges in the graph\nthat are not conducive to graph clustering, which we call spurious edges. This\npaper is the first attempt to employ graph pooling technique for node\nclustering and we propose a novel dual graph embedding network (DGEN), which is\ndesigned as a two-step graph encoder connected by a graph pooling layer to\nlearn the graph embedding. In our model, it is assumed that if a node and its\nnearest neighboring node are close to the same clustering center, this node is\nan informative node and this edge can be considered as a cluster-friendly edge.\nBased on this assumption, the neighbor cluster pooling (NCPool) is devised to\nselect the most informative subset of nodes and the corresponding edges based\non the distance of nodes and their nearest neighbors to the cluster centers.\nThis can effectively alleviate the impact of the spurious edges on the\nclustering. Finally, to obtain the clustering assignment of all nodes, a\nclassifier is trained using the clustering results of the selected nodes.\nExperiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed method over state-of-the-art algorithms.",

          "description": "Building invariance to non-meaningful transformations is essential to\nbuilding efficient and generalizable machine learning models. In practice, the\nmost common way to learn invariance is through data augmentation. There has\nbeen recent interest in the development of methods that learn distributions on\naugmentation transformations from the training data itself. While such\napproaches are beneficial since they are responsive to the data, they ignore\nthe fact that in many situations the range of transformations to which a model\nneeds to be invariant changes depending on the particular class input belongs\nto. For example, if a model needs to be able to predict whether an image\ncontains a starfish or a dog, we may want to apply random rotations to starfish\nimages during training (since these do not have a preferred orientation), but\nwe would not want to do this to images of dogs. In this work we introduce a\nmethod by which we can learn class conditional distributions on augmentation\ntransformations. We give a number of examples where our methods learn different\nnon-meaningful transformations depending on class and further show how our\nmethod can be used as a tool to probe the symmetries intrinsic to a potentially\ncomplex dataset.",

          "description": "When modeling dynamical systems from real-world data samples, the\ndistribution of data often changes according to the environment in which they\nare captured, and the dynamics of the system itself vary from one environment\nto another. Generalizing across environments thus challenges the conventional\nframeworks. The classical settings suggest either considering data as i.i.d.\nand learning a single model to cover all situations or learning\nenvironment-specific models. Both are sub-optimal: the former disregards the\ndiscrepancies between environments leading to biased solutions, while the\nlatter does not exploit their potential commonalities and is prone to scarcity\nproblems. We propose LEADS, a novel framework that leverages the commonalities\nand discrepancies among known environments to improve model generalization.\nThis is achieved with a tailored training formulation aiming at capturing\ncommon dynamics within a shared model while additional terms capture\nenvironment-specific dynamics. We ground our approach in theory, exhibiting a\ndecrease in sample complexity with our approach and corroborate these results\nempirically, instantiating it for linear dynamics. Moreover, we concretize this\nframework for neural networks and evaluate it experimentally on representative\nfamilies of nonlinear dynamics. We show that this new setting can exploit\nknowledge extracted from environment-dependent data and improves generalization\nfor both known and novel environments.",

In this work, we focus\non one aspect of the problem, namely bias amplification: the tendency of models\nto amplify the biases present in the data they are trained on. A metric for\nmeasuring bias amplification was introduced in the seminal work by Zhao et al.\n(2017); however, as we demonstrate, this metric suffers from a number of\nshortcomings including conflating different types of bias amplification and\nfailing to account for varying base rates of protected attributes. We introduce\nand analyze a new, decoupled metric for measuring bias amplification,\n$\\text{BiasAmp}_{\\rightarrow}$ (Directional Bias Amplification). We thoroughly\nanalyze and discuss both the technical assumptions and normative implications\nof this metric. We provide suggestions about its measurement by cautioning\nagainst predicting sensitive attributes, encouraging the use of confidence\nintervals due to fluctuations in the fairness of models across runs, and\ndiscussing the limitations of what this metric captures.

          "description": "Deep reinforcement learning has achieved significant success in many\ndecision-making tasks in various fields. However, it requires a large training\ntime of dense neural networks to obtain a good performance. This hinders its\napplicability on low-resource devices where memory and computation are strictly\nconstrained. In a step towards enabling deep reinforcement learning agents to\nbe applied to low-resource devices, in this work, we propose for the first time\nto dynamically train deep reinforcement learning agents with sparse neural\nnetworks from scratch. We adopt the evolution principles of dynamic sparse\ntraining in the reinforcement learning paradigm and introduce a training\nalgorithm that optimizes the sparse topology and the weight values jointly to\ndynamically fit the incoming data. Our approach is easy to be integrated into\nexisting deep reinforcement learning algorithms and has many favorable\nadvantages. First, it allows for significant compression of the network size\nwhich reduces the memory and computation costs substantially. This would\naccelerate not only the agent inference but also its training process. Second,\nit speeds up the agent learning process and allows for reducing the number of\nrequired training steps. Third, it can achieve higher performance than training\nthe dense counterpart network. We evaluate our approach on OpenAI gym\ncontinuous control tasks. The experimental results show the effectiveness of\nour approach in achieving higher performance than one of the state-of-art\nbaselines with a 50\\% reduction in the network size and floating-point\noperations (FLOPs). Moreover, our proposed approach can reach the same\nperformance achieved by the dense network with a 40-50\\% reduction in the\nnumber of training steps.",

          "description": "In multiagent environments, several decision-making individuals interact\nwhile adhering to the dynamics constraints imposed by the environment. These\ninteractions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents'\ndecision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to study\nfrom a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted on\nlearning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, for\nexample, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-driving\ncars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may be\navailable in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets of\nplayers may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, while\nunobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study the\nproblem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and future\nobservations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations for\nother agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- and\nbackward-information in combination with graph networks and variational\nautoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. We\nevaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projective\ncamera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player state\nestimation setting. We illustrate that our method outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art approaches, including those hand-crafted for football.",

          "description": "We investigate the visual cross-embodiment imitation setting, in which agents\nlearn policies from videos of other agents (such as humans) demonstrating the\nsame task, but with stark differences in their embodiments -- shape, actions,\nend-effector dynamics, etc. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to\nautomatically discover and learn vision-based reward functions from\ncross-embodiment demonstration videos that are robust to these differences.\nSpecifically, we present a self-supervised method for Cross-embodiment Inverse\nReinforcement Learning (XIRL) that leverages temporal cycle-consistency\nconstraints to learn deep visual embeddings that capture task progression from\noffline videos of demonstrations across multiple expert agents, each performing\nthe same task differently due to embodiment differences. Prior to our work,\nproducing rewards from self-supervised embeddings has typically required\nalignment with a reference trajectory, which may be difficult to acquire. We\nshow empirically that if the embeddings are aware of task-progress, simply\ntaking the negative distance between the current state and goal state in the\nlearned embedding space is useful as a reward for training policies with\nreinforcement learning. We find our learned reward function not only works for\nembodiments seen during training, but also generalizes to entirely new\nembodiments. We also find that XIRL policies are more sample efficient than\nbaselines, and in some cases exceed the sample efficiency of the same agent\ntrained with ground truth sparse rewards.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have been shown as a class of useful tools for\naddressing signal recognition issues in recent years, especially for\nidentifying the nonlinear feature structures of signals. However, this power of\nmost deep learning techniques heavily relies on an abundant amount of training\ndata, so the performance of classic neural nets decreases sharply when the\nnumber of training data samples is small or unseen data are presented in the\ntesting phase.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new\ndataset, called the MindReader, providing explicit user ratings both for items\nand for KG entities.

In this work, we propose a general algorithmic framework, Mime, which\ni) mitigates client drift and ii) adapts arbitrary centralized optimization\nalgorithms such as momentum and Adam to the cross-device federated learning\nsetting. Mime uses a combination of control-variates and server-level\nstatistics (e.g. momentum) at every client-update step to ensure that each\nlocal update mimics that of the centralized method run on iid data. We prove a\nreduction result showing that Mime can translate the convergence of a generic\nalgorithm in the centralized setting into convergence in the federated setting.\nFurther, we show that when combined with momentum based variance reduction,\nMime is provably faster than any centralized method--the first such result. We\nalso perform a thorough experimental exploration of Mime's performance on real\nworld datasets.",

Approximate NGD methods such as KFAC attempt to improve\nNGD's running time and practical application by reducing the Fisher matrix\ninversion cost with approximation. However, the approximations do not reduce\nthe overall time significantly and lead to less accurate parameter updates and\nloss of curvature information.

Recently, there is a\nsurge of attempts to propose algorithms for OOD that mainly build upon the idea\nof extracting invariant features. Although intuitively reasonable, theoretical\nunderstanding of what kind of invariance can guarantee OOD generalization is\nstill limited, and generalization to arbitrary out-of-distribution is clearly\nimpossible. In this work, we take the first step towards rigorous and\nquantitative definitions of 1) what is OOD; and 2) what does it mean by saying\nan OOD problem is learnable. We also introduce a new concept of expansion\nfunction, which characterizes to what extent the variance is amplified in the\ntest domains over the training domains, and therefore give a quantitative\nmeaning of invariant features. Based on these, we prove OOD generalization\nerror bounds. It turns out that OOD generalization largely depends on the\nexpansion function. As recently pointed out by Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz (2020),\nany OOD learning algorithm without a model selection module is incomplete. Our\ntheory naturally induces a model selection criterion. Extensive experiments on\nbenchmark OOD datasets demonstrate that our model selection criterion has a\nsignificant advantage over baselines.",

          "description": "Vision transformers (ViTs) process input images as sequences of patches via\nself-attention; a radically different architecture than convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs). This makes it interesting to study the adversarial feature\nspace of ViT models and their transferability. In particular, we observe that\nadversarial patterns found via conventional adversarial attacks show very low\nblack-box transferability even for large ViT models. However, we show that this\nphenomenon is only due to the sub-optimal attack procedures that do not\nleverage the true representation potential of ViTs. A deep ViT is composed of\nmultiple blocks, with a consistent architecture comprising of self-attention\nand feed-forward layers, where each block is capable of independently producing\na class token. Formulating an attack using only the last class token\n(conventional approach) does not directly leverage the discriminative\ninformation stored in the earlier tokens, leading to poor adversarial\ntransferability of ViTs. Using the compositional nature of ViT models, we\nenhance the transferability of existing attacks by introducing two novel\nstrategies specific to the architecture of ViT models. (i) Self-Ensemble: We\npropose a method to find multiple discriminative pathways by dissecting a\nsingle ViT model into an ensemble of networks. This allows explicitly utilizing\nclass-specific information at each ViT block. (ii) Token Refinement: We then\npropose to refine the tokens to further enhance the discriminative capacity at\neach block of ViT. Our token refinement systematically combines the class\ntokens with structural information preserved within the patch tokens. An\nadversarial attack, when applied to such refined tokens within the ensemble of\nclassifiers found in a single vision transformer, has significantly higher\ntransferability.",

          "description": "Collecting annotated data for semantic segmentation is time-consuming and\nhard to scale up. In this paper, we for the first time propose a unified\nframework, termed as Multi-Dataset Pretraining, to take full advantage of the\nfragmented annotations of different datasets. The highlight is that the\nannotations from different domains can be efficiently reused and consistently\nboost performance for each specific domain. This is achieved by first\npretraining the network via the proposed pixel-to-prototype contrastive loss\nover multiple datasets regardless of their taxonomy labels, and followed by\nfine-tuning the pretrained model over specific dataset as usual. In order to\nbetter model the relationship among images and classes from different datasets,\nwe extend the pixel level embeddings via cross dataset mixing and propose a\npixel-to-class sparse coding strategy that explicitly models the pixel-class\nsimilarity over the manifold embedding space. In this way, we are able to\nincrease intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, as well as\nconsidering inter-class similarity across different datasets for better\ntransferability. Experiments conducted on several benchmarks demonstrate its\nsuperior performance. Notably, MDP consistently outperforms the pretrained\nmodels over ImageNet by a considerable margin, while only using less than 10%\nsamples for pretraining.",

          "description": "Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) models are powerful for studying the\nassociations between two sets of variables. The canonically correlated\nrepresentations, termed \\textit{canonical variates} are widely used in\nunsupervised learning to analyze unlabeled multi-modal registered datasets.\nDespite their success, CCA models may break (or overfit) if the number of\nvariables in either of the modalities exceeds the number of samples. Moreover,\noften a significant fraction of the variables measures modality-specific\ninformation, and thus removing them is beneficial for identifying the\n\\textit{canonically correlated variates}. Here, we propose $\\ell_0$-CCA, a\nmethod for learning correlated representations based on sparse subsets of\nvariables from two observed modalities. Sparsity is obtained by multiplying the\ninput variables by stochastic gates, whose parameters are learned together with\nthe CCA weights via an $\\ell_0$-regularized correlation loss. We further\npropose $\\ell_0$-Deep CCA for solving the problem of non-linear sparse CCA by\nmodeling the correlated representations using deep nets. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of the method using several synthetic and real examples.

          "description": "Recent works in self-supervised learning have advanced the state-of-the-art\nby relying on the contrastive learning paradigm, which learns representations\nby pushing positive pairs, or similar examples from the same class, closer\ntogether while keeping negative pairs far apart. Despite the empirical\nsuccesses, theoretical foundations are limited -- prior analyses assume\nconditional independence of the positive pairs given the same class label, but\nrecent empirical applications use heavily correlated positive pairs (i.e., data\naugmentations of the same image). Our work analyzes contrastive learning\nwithout assuming conditional independence of positive pairs using a novel\nconcept of the augmentation graph on data. Edges in this graph connect\naugmentations of the same data, and ground-truth classes naturally form\nconnected sub-graphs. We propose a loss that performs spectral decomposition on\nthe population augmentation graph and can be succinctly written as a\ncontrastive learning objective on neural net representations. Minimizing this\nobjective leads to features with provable accuracy guarantees under linear\nprobe evaluation. By standard generalization bounds, these accuracy guarantees\nalso hold when minimizing the training contrastive loss. Empirically, the\nfeatures learned by our objective can match or outperform several strong\nbaselines on benchmark vision datasets. In all, this work provides the first\nprovable analysis for contrastive learning where guarantees for linear probe\nevaluation can apply to realistic empirical settings.",

          "description": "Machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL) techniques have been\nincreasingly used in anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS).\nHowever, ML/DL has shown to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks,\nespecially in such security-sensitive systems. Many adversarial attacks have\nbeen proposed to evaluate the robustness of ML-based NIDSs. Unfortunately,\nexisting attacks mostly focused on feature-space and/or white-box attacks,\nwhich make impractical assumptions in real-world scenarios, leaving the study\non practical gray/black-box attacks largely unexplored.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of the\ngray/black-box traffic-space adversarial attacks to evaluate the robustness of\nML-based NIDSs. Our work outperforms previous ones in the following aspects:\n(i) practical-the proposed attack can automatically mutate original traffic\nwith extremely limited knowledge and affordable overhead while preserving its\nfunctionality; (ii) generic-the proposed attack is effective for evaluating the\nrobustness of various NIDSs using diverse ML/DL models and non-payload-based\nfeatures; (iii) explainable-we propose an explanation method for the fragile\nrobustness of ML-based NIDSs. Based on this, we also propose a defense scheme\nagainst adversarial attacks to improve system robustness. We extensively\nevaluate the robustness of various NIDSs using diverse feature sets and ML/DL\nmodels. Experimental results show our attack is effective (e.g., >97% evasion\nrate in half cases for Kitsune, a state-of-the-art NIDS) with affordable\nexecution cost and the proposed defense method can effectively mitigate such\nattacks (evasion rate is reduced by >50% in most cases).",

          "description": "In recent years, various notions of capacity and complexity have been\nproposed for characterizing the generalization properties of stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) in deep learning. Some of the popular notions that\ncorrelate well with the performance on unseen data are (i) the `flatness' of\nthe local minimum found by SGD, which is related to the eigenvalues of the\nHessian, (ii) the ratio of the stepsize $\\eta$ to the batch-size $b$, which\nessentially controls the magnitude of the stochastic gradient noise, and (iii)\nthe `tail-index', which measures the heaviness of the tails of the network\nweights at convergence. In this paper, we argue that these three seemingly\nunrelated perspectives for generalization are deeply linked to each other. We\nclaim that depending on the structure of the Hessian of the loss at the\nminimum, and the choices of the algorithm parameters $\\eta$ and $b$, the SGD\niterates will converge to a \\emph{heavy-tailed} stationary distribution. We\nrigorously prove this claim in the setting of quadratic optimization: we show\nthat even in a simple linear regression problem with independent and\nidentically distributed data whose distribution has finite moments of all\norder, the iterates can be heavy-tailed with infinite variance. We further\ncharacterize the behavior of the tails with respect to algorithm parameters,\nthe dimension, and the curvature. We then translate our results into insights\nabout the behavior of SGD in deep learning. We support our theory with\nexperiments conducted on synthetic data, fully connected, and convolutional\nneural networks.",

          "description": "While deep and large pre-trained models are the state-of-the-art for various\nnatural language processing tasks, their huge size poses significant challenges\nfor practical uses in resource constrained settings. Recent works in knowledge\ndistillation propose task-agnostic as well as task-specific methods to compress\nthese models, with task-specific ones often yielding higher compression rate.\nIn this work, we develop a new task-agnostic distillation framework\nXtremeDistilTransformers that leverages the advantage of task-specific methods\nfor learning a small universal model that can be applied to arbitrary tasks and\nlanguages. To this end, we study the transferability of several source tasks,\naugmentation resources and model architecture for distillation. We evaluate our\nmodel performance on multiple tasks, including the General Language\nUnderstanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, SQuAD question answering dataset and\na massive multi-lingual NER dataset with 41 languages.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks are powerful machines for visual pattern recognition,\nbut reasoning tasks that are easy for humans may still be difficult for neural\nmodels. Humans possess the ability to extrapolate reasoning strategies learned\non simple problems to solve harder examples, often by thinking for longer. For\nexample, a person who has learned to solve small mazes can easily extend the\nvery same search techniques to solve much larger mazes by spending more time.\nIn computers, this behavior is often achieved through the use of algorithms,\nwhich scale to arbitrarily hard problem instances at the cost of more\ncomputation. In contrast, the sequential computing budget of feed-forward\nneural networks is limited by their depth, and networks trained on simple\nproblems have no way of extending their reasoning to accommodate harder\nproblems. In this work, we show that recurrent networks trained to solve simple\nproblems with few recurrent steps can indeed solve much more complex problems\nsimply by performing additional recurrences during inference. We demonstrate\nthis algorithmic behavior of recurrent networks on prefix sum computation,\nmazes, and chess. In all three domains, networks trained on simple problem\ninstances are able to extend their reasoning abilities at test time simply by\n\"thinking for longer.\"",

          "description": "Current technology for autonomous cars primarily focuses on getting the\npassenger from point A to B. Nevertheless, it has been shown that passengers\nare afraid of taking a ride in self-driving cars. One way to alleviate this\nproblem is by allowing the passenger to give natural language commands to the\ncar. However, the car can misunderstand the issued command or the visual\nsurroundings which could lead to uncertain situations. It is desirable that the\nself-driving car detects these situations and interacts with the passenger to\nsolve them. This paper proposes a model that detects uncertain situations when\na command is given and finds the visual objects causing it. Optionally, a\nquestion generated by the system describing the uncertain objects is included.\nWe argue that if the car could explain the objects in a human-like way,\npassengers could gain more confidence in the car's abilities. Thus, we\ninvestigate how to (1) detect uncertain situations and their underlying causes,\nand (2) how to generate clarifying questions for the passenger. When evaluating\non the Talk2Car dataset, we show that the proposed model, \\acrfull{pipeline},\nimproves \\gls{m:ambiguous-absolute-increase} in terms of $IoU_{.5}$ compared to\nnot using \\gls{pipeline}. Furthermore, we designed a referring expression\ngenerator (REG) \\acrfull{reg_model} tailored to a self-driving car setting\nwhich yields a relative improvement of \\gls{m:meteor-relative} METEOR and\n\\gls{m:rouge-relative} ROUGE-l compared with state-of-the-art REG models, and\nis three times faster.",

          "description": "This work explores the hypothesis that the complexity of the function a deep\nneural network (NN) is learning can be deduced by how fast its weights change\nduring training. Our analysis provides evidence for this supposition by\nrelating the network's distribution of Lipschitz constants (i.e., the norm of\nthe gradient at different regions of the input space) during different training\nintervals with the behavior of the stochastic training procedure. We first\nobserve that the average Lipschitz constant close to the training data affects\nvarious aspects of the parameter trajectory, with more complex networks having\na longer trajectory, bigger variance, and often veering further from their\ninitialization. We then show that NNs whose biases are trained more steadily\nhave bounded complexity even in regions of the input space that are far from\nany training point. Finally, we find that steady training with Dropout implies\na training- and data-dependent generalization bound that grows\npoly-logarithmically with the number of parameters. Overall, our results\nsupport the hypothesis that good training behavior can be a useful bias towards\ngood generalization.",

          "description": "Attention mechanisms have become a standard tool for sequence modeling tasks,\nin particular by stacking self-attention layers over the entire input sequence\nas in the Transformer architecture. In this work we introduce a novel attention\nprocedure called staircase attention that, unlike self-attention, operates\nacross the sequence (in time) recurrently processing the input by adding\nanother step of processing. A step in the staircase comprises of backward\ntokens (encoding the sequence so far seen) and forward tokens (ingesting a new\npart of the sequence), or an extreme Ladder version with a forward step of zero\nthat simply repeats the Transformer on each step of the ladder, sharing the\nweights. We thus describe a family of such models that can trade off\nperformance and compute, by either increasing the amount of recurrence through\ntime, the amount of sequential processing via recurrence in depth, or both.\nStaircase attention is shown to be able to solve tasks that involve tracking\nthat conventional Transformers cannot, due to this recurrence. Further, it is\nshown to provide improved modeling power for the same size model (number of\nparameters) compared to self-attentive Transformers on large language modeling\nand dialogue tasks, yielding significant perplexity gains.",

Given their accuracy performance, currently, Recurrent Neural Networks\n(RNNs) are the models of choice for this task. Despite their success in time\nseries forecasting, less attention has been paid to make the RNNs trustworthy.\nFor example, RNNs can not naturally provide an uncertainty measure to their\npredictions. This could be extremely useful in practice in several cases e.g.\nto detect when a prediction might be completely wrong due to an unusual pattern\nin the time series.

          "description": "Static recommendation methods like collaborative filtering suffer from the\ninherent limitation of performing real-time personalization for cold-start\nusers. Online recommendation, e.g., multi-armed bandit approach, addresses this\nlimitation by interactively exploring user preference online and pursuing the\nexploration-exploitation (EE) trade-off. However, existing bandit-based methods\nmodel recommendation actions homogeneously. Specifically, they only consider\nthe items as the arms, being incapable of handling the item attributes, which\nnaturally provide interpretable information of user's current demands and can\neffectively filter out undesired items. In this work, we consider the\nconversational recommendation for cold-start users, where a system can both ask\nthe attributes from and recommend items to a user interactively. This important\nscenario was studied in a recent work. However, it employs a hand-crafted\nfunction to decide when to ask attributes or make recommendations. Such\nseparate modeling of attributes and items makes the effectiveness of the system\nhighly rely on the choice of the hand-crafted function, thus introducing\nfragility to the system. To address this limitation, we seamlessly unify\nattributes and items in the same arm space and achieve their EE trade-offs\nautomatically using the framework of Thompson Sampling. Our Conversational\nThompson Sampling (ConTS) model holistically solves all questions in\nconversational recommendation by choosing the arm with the maximal reward to\nplay. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that ConTS\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods Conversational UCB (ConUCB) and\nEstimation-Action-Reflection model in both metrics of success rate and average\nnumber of conversation turns.",

A key challenge of this setting is that users do\nnot have access to the ground truth (i.e. they cannot correctly identify\nwhether an app is malicious). To tackle this, LiM uses a safe semi-supervised\nensemble that maximizes classification accuracy with respect to a baseline\nclassifier trained by the service provider (i.e. the cloud). We implement LiM\nand show that the cloud server has F1 score of 95%, while clients have perfect\nrecall with only 1 false positive in >100 apps, using a dataset of 25K clean\napps and 25K malicious apps, 200 users and 50 rounds of federation.\nFurthermore, we conduct a security analysis and demonstrate that LiM is robust\nagainst both poisoning attacks by adversaries who control half of the clients,\nand inference attacks performed by an honest-but-curious cloud server.

This demands learning models that capture relevant motion patterns, while\noffering enough flexibility to adapt the encoded skills to new requirements,\nsuch as dynamic obstacle avoidance. We introduce a Riemannian manifold\nperspective on this problem, and propose to learn a Riemannian manifold from\nhuman demonstrations on which geodesics are natural motion skills. We realize\nthis with a variational autoencoder (VAE) over the space of position and\norientations of the robot end-effector.

They also provide\na straightforward method to avoid obstacles by redefining the ambient metric in\nan online fashion. Moreover, geodesics naturally exploit the manifold resulting\nfrom multiple--mode tasks to design motions that were not explicitly\ndemonstrated previously. We test our learning framework using a 7-DoF robotic\nmanipulator, where the robot satisfactorily learns and reproduces realistic\nskills featuring elaborated motion patterns, avoids previously unseen\nobstacles, and generates novel movements in multiple-mode settings.",

          "description": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to generalize the knowledge learned\nfrom a well-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recently,\nadversarial domain adaptation with two distinct classifiers (bi-classifier) has\nbeen introduced into UDA which is effective to align distributions between\ndifferent domains. Previous bi-classifier adversarial learning methods only\nfocus on the similarity between the outputs of two distinct classifiers.\nHowever, the similarity of the outputs cannot guarantee the accuracy of target\nsamples, i.e., target samples may match to wrong categories even if the\ndiscrepancy between two classifiers is small. To challenge this issue, in this\npaper, we propose a cross-domain gradient discrepancy minimization (CGDM)\nmethod which explicitly minimizes the discrepancy of gradients generated by\nsource samples and target samples. Specifically, the gradient gives a cue for\nthe semantic information of target samples so it can be used as a good\nsupervision to improve the accuracy of target samples. In order to compute the\ngradient signal of target samples, we further obtain target pseudo labels\nthrough a clustering-based self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on\nthree widely used UDA datasets show that our method surpasses many previous\nstate-of-the-arts. Codes are available at https://github.com/lijin118/CGDM.",

          "description": "This paper is about the problem of learning a stochastic policy for\ngenerating an object (like a molecular graph) from a sequence of actions, such\nthat the probability of generating an object is proportional to a given\npositive reward for that object. Whereas standard return maximization tends to\nconverge to a single return-maximizing sequence, there are cases where we would\nlike to sample a diverse set of high-return solutions. These arise, for\nexample, in black-box function optimization when few rounds are possible, each\nwith large batches of queries, where the batches should be diverse, e.g., in\nthe design of new molecules. One can also see this as a problem of\napproximately converting an energy function to a generative distribution. While\nMCMC methods can achieve that, they are expensive and generally only perform\nlocal exploration. Instead, training a generative policy amortizes the cost of\nsearch during training and yields to fast generation. Using insights from\nTemporal Difference learning, we propose GFlowNet, based on a view of the\ngenerative process as a flow network, making it possible to handle the tricky\ncase where different trajectories can yield the same final state, e.g., there\nare many ways to sequentially add atoms to generate some molecular graph. We\ncast the set of trajectories as a flow and convert the flow consistency\nequations into a learning objective, akin to the casting of the Bellman\nequations into Temporal Difference methods. We prove that any global minimum of\nthe proposed objectives yields a policy which samples from the desired\ndistribution, and demonstrate the improved performance and diversity of\nGFlowNet on a simple domain where there are many modes to the reward function,\nand on a molecule synthesis task.",

          "description": "Learning dynamics governed by differential equations is crucial for\npredicting and controlling the systems in science and engineering. Neural\nOrdinary Differential Equation (NODE), a deep learning model integrated with\ndifferential equations, learns the dynamics directly from the samples on the\ntrajectory and shows great promise in the scientific field. However, the\ntraining of NODE highly depends on the numerical solver, which can amplify\nnumerical noise and be unstable, especially for ill-conditioned dynamical\nsystems. In this paper, to reduce the reliance on the numerical solver, we\npropose to enhance the supervised signal in learning dynamics. Specifically,\nbeyond learning directly from the trajectory samples, we pre-train a neural\ndifferential operator (NDO) to output an estimation of the derivatives to serve\nas an additional supervised signal. The NDO is pre-trained on a class of\nsymbolic functions, and it learns the mapping between the trajectory samples of\nthese functions to their derivatives. We provide theoretical guarantee on that\nthe output of NDO can well approximate the ground truth derivatives by proper\ntuning the complexity of the library. To leverage both the trajectory signal\nand the estimated derivatives from NDO, we propose an algorithm called\nNDO-NODE, in which the loss function contains two terms: the fitness on the\ntrue trajectory samples and the fitness on the estimated derivatives that are\noutput by the pre-trained NDO. Experiments on various of dynamics show that our\nproposed NDO-NODE can consistently improve the forecasting accuracy.",

However, capturing salient molecular\nproperties like quantum-chemical energies remains challenging and requires\nsophisticated neural net models of molecular graphs or geometry-based\ninformation. As a simpler and more efficient alternative, we present a SMILES\nVariational Auto-Encoder (VAE) augmented with topological data analysis (TDA)\nrepresentations of molecules, known as persistence images. Our experiments show\nthat this TDA augmentation enables a SMILES VAE to capture the complex relation\nbetween 3D geometry and electronic properties, and allows generation of novel,\ndiverse, and valid molecules with geometric features consistent with the\ntraining data, which exhibit a varying range of global electronic structural\nproperties, such as a small HOMO-LUMO gap - a critical property for designing\norganic solar cells. We demonstrate that our TDA augmentation yields better\nsuccess in downstream tasks compared to models trained without these\nrepresentations and can assist in targeted molecule discovery.",

          "description": "Bayesian optimization (BO) conventionally relies on handcrafted acquisition\nfunctions (AFs) to sequentially determine the sample points. However, it has\nbeen widely observed in practice that the best-performing AF in terms of regret\ncan vary significantly under different types of black-box functions. It has\nremained a challenge to design one AF that can attain the best performance over\na wide variety of black-box functions. This paper aims to attack this challenge\nthrough the perspective of reinforced few-shot AF learning (FSAF).\nSpecifically, we first connect the notion of AFs with Q-functions and view a\ndeep Q-network (DQN) as a surrogate differentiable AF. While it serves as a\nnatural idea to combine DQN and an existing few-shot learning method, we\nidentify that such a direct combination does not perform well due to severe\noverfitting, which is particularly critical in BO due to the need of a\nversatile sampling policy. To address this, we present a Bayesian variant of\nDQN with the following three features: (i) It learns a distribution of\nQ-networks as AFs based on the Kullback-Leibler regularization framework. This\ninherently provides the uncertainty required in sampling for BO and mitigates\noverfitting. (ii) For the prior of the Bayesian DQN, we propose to use a demo\npolicy induced by an off-the-shelf AF for better training stability. (iii) On\nthe meta-level, we leverage the meta-loss of Bayesian model-agnostic\nmeta-learning, which serves as a natural companion to the proposed FSAF.\nMoreover, with the proper design of the Q-networks, FSAF is general-purpose in\nthat it is agnostic to the dimension and the cardinality of the input domain.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the FSAF achieves comparable\nor better regrets than the state-of-the-art benchmarks on a wide variety of\nsynthetic and real-world test functions.",

          "description": "Kernel methods are a highly effective and widely used collection of modern\nmachine learning algorithms. A fundamental limitation of virtually all such\nmethods are computations involving the kernel matrix that naively scale\nquadratically (e.g., constructing the kernel matrix and matrix-vector\nmultiplication) or cubically (solving linear systems) with the size of the data\nset $N.$ We propose the Fast Kernel Transform (FKT), a general algorithm to\ncompute matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) for datasets in moderate\ndimensions with quasilinear complexity. Typically, analytically grounded fast\nmultiplication methods require specialized development for specific kernels. In\ncontrast, our scheme is based on auto-differentiation and automated symbolic\ncomputations that leverage the analytical structure of the underlying kernel.\nThis allows the FKT to be easily applied to a broad class of kernels, including\nGaussian, Matern, and Rational Quadratic covariance functions and physically\nmotivated Green's functions, including those of the Laplace and Helmholtz\nequations. Furthermore, the FKT maintains a high, quantifiable, and\ncontrollable level of accuracy -- properties that many acceleration methods\nlack. We illustrate the efficacy and versatility of the FKT by providing timing\nand accuracy benchmarks and by applying it to scale the stochastic neighborhood\nembedding (t-SNE) and Gaussian processes to large real-world data sets.",

This\nreformulation allows us to propose novel algorithms inspired from inverse\nproblems and nonnegative matrix factorization. In particular, we consider\nmajorization-minimization which leads in our setting to efficient\nmultiplicative updates for a variety of penalties. Furthermore, we derive for\nthe first time an efficient algorithm to compute the regularization path of UOT\nwith quadratic penalties. The proposed algorithm provides a continuity of\npiece-wise linear OT plans converging to the solution of balanced OT\n(corresponding to infinite penalty weights).

However, with limited experience, RL often suffers from data\ninefficiency for training. For un-experienced or less-experienced trajectories\n(i.e., state-action sequences), the lack of data limits the use of them for\nbetter feature learning. In this work, we propose a novel method, dubbed\nPlayVirtual, which augments cycle-consistent virtual trajectories to enhance\nthe data efficiency for RL feature representation learning. Specifically,\nPlayVirtual predicts future states based on the current state and action by a\ndynamics model and then predicts the previous states by a backward dynamics\nmodel, which forms a trajectory cycle. Based on this, we augment the actions to\ngenerate a large amount of virtual state-action trajectories. Being free of\ngroudtruth state supervision, we enforce a trajectory to meet the cycle\nconsistency constraint, which can significantly enhance the data efficiency. We\nvalidate the effectiveness of our designs on the Atari and DeepMind Control\nSuite benchmarks. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods\nby a large margin on both benchmarks.",

          "description": "Machine learning approaches achieve high accuracy for text recognition and\nare therefore increasingly used for the transcription of handwritten historical\nsources. However, using machine learning in production requires a streamlined\nend-to-end machine learning pipeline that scales to the dataset size, and a\nmodel that achieves high accuracy with few manual transcriptions. In addition,\nthe correctness of the model results must be verified. This paper describes our\nlessons learned developing, tuning, and using the Occode end-to-end machine\nlearning pipeline for transcribing 7,3 million rows with handwritten occupation\ncodes in the Norwegian 1950 population census. We achieve an accuracy of 97%\nfor the automatically transcribed codes, and we send 3% of the codes for manual\nverification. We verify that the occupation code distribution found in our\nresult matches the distribution found in our training data which should be\nrepresentative for the census as a whole. We believe our approach and lessons\nlearned are useful for other transcription projects that plan to use machine\nlearning in production.

          "description": "Reliable yet efficient evaluation of generalisation performance of a proposed\narchitecture is crucial to the success of neural architecture search (NAS).\nTraditional approaches face a variety of limitations: training each\narchitecture to completion is prohibitively expensive, early stopped validation\naccuracy may correlate poorly with fully trained performance, and model-based\nestimators require large training sets. We instead propose to estimate the\nfinal test performance based on a simple measure of training speed. Our\nestimator is theoretically motivated by the connection between generalisation\nand training speed, and is also inspired by the reformulation of a PAC-Bayes\nbound under the Bayesian setting. Our model-free estimator is simple,\nefficient, and cheap to implement, and does not require hyperparameter-tuning\nor surrogate training before deployment. We demonstrate on various NAS search\nspaces that our estimator consistently outperforms other alternatives in\nachieving better correlation with the true test performance rankings. We\nfurther show that our estimator can be easily incorporated into both\nquery-based and one-shot NAS methods to improve the speed or quality of the\nsearch.",

          "description": "Recommender systems are often designed based on a collaborative filtering\napproach, where user preferences are predicted by modelling interactions\nbetween users and items. Many common approaches to solve the collaborative\nfiltering task are based on learning representations of users and items,\nincluding simple matrix factorization, Gaussian process latent variable models,\nand neural-network based embeddings. While matrix factorization approaches fail\nto model nonlinear relations, neural networks can potentially capture such\ncomplex relations with unprecedented predictive power and are highly scalable.\nHowever, neither of them is able to model predictive uncertainties. In\ncontrast, Gaussian Process based models can generate a predictive distribution,\nbut cannot scale to large amounts of data. In this manuscript, we propose a\nnovel approach combining the representation learning paradigm of collaborative\nfiltering with multi-output Gaussian processes in a joint framework to generate\nuncertainty-aware recommendations. We introduce an efficient strategy for model\ntraining and inference, resulting in a model that scales to very large and\nsparse datasets and achieves competitive performance in terms of classical\nmetrics quantifying the reconstruction error. In addition to accurately\npredicting user preferences, our model also provides meaningful uncertainty\nestimates about that prediction.",

We propose a unifying conceptual framework for\nstatistical arbitrage and develop a novel deep learning solution, which finds\ncommonality and time-series patterns from large panels in a data-driven and\nflexible way. First, we construct arbitrage portfolios of similar assets as\nresidual portfolios from conditional latent asset pricing factors. Second, we\nextract the time series signals of these residual portfolios with one of the\nmost powerful machine learning time-series solutions, a convolutional\ntransformer. Last, we use these signals to form an optimal trading policy, that\nmaximizes risk-adjusted returns under constraints. We conduct a comprehensive\nempirical comparison study with daily large cap U.S. stocks. Our optimal\ntrading strategy obtains a consistently high out-of-sample Sharpe ratio and\nsubstantially outperforms all benchmark approaches. It is orthogonal to common\nrisk factors, and exploits asymmetric local trend and reversion patterns. Our\nstrategies remain profitable after taking into account trading frictions and\ncosts.

          "description": "Broadening access to both computational and educational resources is critical\nto diffusing machine-learning (ML) innovation. However, today, most ML\nresources and experts are siloed in a few countries and organizations. In this\npaper, we describe our pedagogical approach to increasing access to applied ML\nthrough a massive open online course (MOOC) on Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML).\nWe suggest that TinyML, ML on resource-constrained embedded devices, is an\nattractive means to widen access because TinyML both leverages low-cost and\nglobally accessible hardware, and encourages the development of complete,\nself-contained applications, from data collection to deployment. To this end, a\ncollaboration between academia (Harvard University) and industry (Google)\nproduced a four-part MOOC that provides application-oriented instruction on how\nto develop solutions using TinyML. The series is openly available on the edX\nMOOC platform, has no prerequisites beyond basic programming, and is designed\nfor learners from a global variety of backgrounds. It introduces pupils to\nreal-world applications, ML algorithms, data-set engineering, and the ethical\nconsiderations of these technologies via hands-on programming and deployment of\nTinyML applications in both the cloud and their own microcontrollers. To\nfacilitate continued learning, community building, and collaboration beyond the\ncourses, we launched a standalone website, a forum, a chat, and an optional\ncourse-project competition. We also released the course materials publicly,\nhoping they will inspire the next generation of ML practitioners and educators\nand further broaden access to cutting-edge ML technologies.",

Despite its theoretical\nappeal, this viewpoint lacks a crucial ingredient of deep learning in finite\nDNNs, laying at the heart of their success -- feature learning. Here we\nconsider DNNs trained with noisy gradient descent on a large training set and\nderive a self consistent Gaussian Process theory accounting for strong\nfinite-DNN and feature learning effects. Applying this to a toy model of a\ntwo-layer linear convolutional neural network (CNN) shows good agreement with\nexperiments. We further identify, both analytical and numerically, a sharp\ntransition between a feature learning regime and a lazy learning regime in this\nmodel. Strong finite-DNN effects are also derived for a non-linear two-layer\nfully connected network. Our self consistent theory provides a rich and\nversatile analytical framework for studying feature learning and other non-lazy\neffects in finite DNNs.",

          "description": "We tackle sequential learning under label noise in applications where a human\nsupervisor can be queried to relabel suspicious examples. Existing approaches\nare flawed, in that they only relabel incoming examples that look\n``suspicious'' to the model. As a consequence, those mislabeled examples that\nelude (or don't undergo) this cleaning step end up tainting the training data\nand the model with no further chance of being cleaned. We propose Cincer, a\nnovel approach that cleans both new and past data by identifying pairs of\nmutually incompatible examples. Whenever it detects a suspicious example,\nCincer identifies a counter-example in the training set that -- according to\nthe model -- is maximally incompatible with the suspicious example, and asks\nthe annotator to relabel either or both examples, resolving this possible\ninconsistency. The counter-examples are chosen to be maximally incompatible, so\nto serve as explanations of the model' suspicion, and highly influential, so to\nconvey as much information as possible if relabeled. Cincer achieves this by\nleveraging an efficient and robust approximation of influence functions based\non the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Our extensive empirical evaluation\nshows that clarifying the reasons behind the model's suspicions by cleaning the\ncounter-examples helps acquiring substantially better data and models,\nespecially when paired with our FIM approximation.",

We focus on classification tasks, and design\nthe intermediate tasks using an automatically constructed label hierarchy. We\ntrain the model at each level of the hierarchy, from coarse labels to fine\nlabels, transferring acquired knowledge across these levels. For instance, the\nmodel will first learn to distinguish animals from objects, and then use this\nacquired knowledge when learning to classify among more fine-grained classes\nsuch as cat, dog, car, and truck. Most existing curriculum learning algorithms\nfor supervised learning consist of scheduling the order in which the training\nexamples are presented to the model. In contrast, our approach focuses on the\noutput space of the model.

          "description": "Emotion recognition from speech is a challenging task. Re-cent advances in\ndeep learning have led bi-directional recur-rent neural network (Bi-RNN) and\nattention mechanism as astandard method for speech emotion recognition,\nextractingand attending multi-modal features - audio and text, and thenfusing\nthem for downstream emotion classification tasks. Inthis paper, we propose a\nsimple yet efficient neural networkarchitecture to exploit both acoustic and\nlexical informationfrom speech. The proposed framework using multi-scale\ncon-volutional layers (MSCNN) to obtain both audio and text hid-den\nrepresentations. Then, a statistical pooling unit (SPU)is used to further\nextract the features in each modality. Be-sides, an attention module can be\nbuilt on top of the MSCNN-SPU (audio) and MSCNN (text) to further improve the\nperfor-mance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed modeloutperforms\nprevious state-of-the-art methods on IEMOCAPdataset with four emotion\ncategories (i.e., angry, happy, sadand neutral) in both weighted accuracy (WA)\nand unweightedaccuracy (UA), with an improvement of 5.0% and 5.2% respectively\nunder the ASR setting.",

          "description": "Flow-based generative models have shown excellent ability to explicitly learn\nthe probability density function of data via a sequence of invertible\ntransformations. Yet, modeling long-range dependencies over normalizing flows\nremains understudied. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce two types of\ninvertible attention mechanisms for generative flow models. To be precise, we\npropose map-based and scaled dot-product attention for unconditional and\nconditional generative flow models. The key idea is to exploit split-based\nattention mechanisms to learn the attention weights and input representations\non every two splits of flow feature maps. Our method provides invertible\nattention modules with tractable Jacobian determinants, enabling seamless\nintegration of it at any positions of the flow-based models. The proposed\nattention mechanism can model the global data dependencies, leading to more\ncomprehensive flow models. Evaluation on multiple generation tasks demonstrates\nthat the introduced attention flow idea results in efficient flow models and\ncompares favorably against the state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional\ngenerative flow methods.",

          "description": "Theoretical results show that neural networks can be approximated by Gaussian\nprocesses in the infinite-width limit. However, for fully connected networks,\nit has been previously shown that for any fixed network width, $n$, the\nGaussian approximation gets worse as the network depth, $d$, increases. Given\nthat modern networks are deep, this raises the question of how well modern\narchitectures, like ResNets, are captured by the infinite-width limit. To\nprovide a better approximation, we study ReLU ResNets in the\ninfinite-depth-and-width limit, where both depth and width tend to infinity as\ntheir ratio, $d/n$, remains constant. In contrast to the Gaussian\ninfinite-width limit, we show theoretically that the network exhibits\nlog-Gaussian behaviour at initialization in the infinite-depth-and-width limit,\nwith parameters depending on the ratio $d/n$. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we\ndemonstrate that even basic properties of standard ResNet architectures are\npoorly captured by the Gaussian limit, but remarkably well captured by our\nlog-Gaussian limit. Moreover, our analysis reveals that ReLU ResNets at\ninitialization are hypoactivated: fewer than half of the ReLUs are activated.\nAdditionally, we calculate the interlayer correlations, which have the effect\nof exponentially increasing the variance of the network output. Based on our\nanalysis, we introduce Balanced ResNets, a simple architecture modification,\nwhich eliminates hypoactivation and interlayer correlations and is more\namenable to theoretical analysis.",

We propose a\nsimple but powerful method which we call FEAR, for ranking architectures in any\nsearch space. FEAR leverages the viewpoint that neural networks are powerful\nnon-linear feature extractors. First, we train different architectures in the\nsearch space to the same training or validation error. Then, we compare the\nusefulness of the features extracted by each architecture. We do so with a\nquick training keeping most of the architecture frozen. This gives fast\nestimates of the relative performance. We validate FEAR on Natsbench topology\nsearch space on three different datasets against competing baselines and show\nstrong ranking correlation especially compared to recently proposed zero-cost\nmethods. FEAR particularly excels at ranking high-performance architectures in\nthe search space. When used in the inner loop of discrete search algorithms\nlike random search, FEAR can cut down the search time by approximately 2.4X\nwithout losing accuracy. We additionally empirically study very recently\nproposed zero-cost measures for ranking and find that they breakdown in ranking\nperformance as training proceeds and also that data-agnostic ranking scores\nwhich ignore the dataset do not generalize across dissimilar datasets.",

          "description": "Black-box optimization (BBO) has a broad range of applications, including\nautomatic machine learning, engineering, physics, and experimental design.\nHowever, it remains a challenge for users to apply BBO methods to their\nproblems at hand with existing software packages, in terms of applicability,\nperformance, and efficiency. In this paper, we build OpenBox, an open-source\nand general-purpose BBO service with improved usability. The modular design\nbehind OpenBox also facilitates flexible abstraction and optimization of basic\nBBO components that are common in other existing systems. OpenBox is\ndistributed, fault-tolerant, and scalable. To improve efficiency, OpenBox\nfurther utilizes \"algorithm agnostic\" parallelization and transfer learning.\nOur experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of\nOpenBox compared to existing systems.",

          "description": "This article addresses several longstanding misconceptions concerning Koopman\noperators, including the existence of lattices of eigenfunctions, common\neigenfunctions between Koopman operators, and boundedness and compactness of\nKoopman operators, among others. Counterexamples are provided for each\nmisconception. This manuscript also proves that the Gaussian RBF's native space\nonly supports bounded Koopman operator corresponding to affine dynamics, which\nshows that the assumption of boundedness is very limiting. A framework for DMD\nis presented that requires only densely defined Koopman operators over\nreproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and the effectiveness of this approach is\ndemonstrated through reconstruction examples.",
