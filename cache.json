          "description": "Recent pretraining models in Chinese neglect two important aspects specific\nto the Chinese language: glyph and pinyin, which carry significant syntax and\nsemantic information for language understanding. In this work, we propose\nChineseBERT, which incorporates both the {\\it glyph} and {\\it pinyin}\ninformation of Chinese characters into language model pretraining. The glyph\nembedding is obtained based on different fonts of a Chinese character, being\nable to capture character semantics from the visual features, and the pinyin\nembedding characterizes the pronunciation of Chinese characters, which handles\nthe highly prevalent heteronym phenomenon in Chinese (the same character has\ndifferent pronunciations with different meanings). Pretrained on large-scale\nunlabeled Chinese corpus, the proposed ChineseBERT model yields significant\nperformance boost over baseline models with fewer training steps. The porpsoed\nmodel achieves new SOTA performances on a wide range of Chinese NLP tasks,\nincluding machine reading comprehension, natural language inference, text\nclassification, sentence pair matching, and competitive performances in named\nentity recognition. Code and pretrained models are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/ShannonAI/ChineseBert.",

          "description": "This paper demonstrate how NLP can be used to address an unmet need of the\nlegal community and increase access to justice. The paper introduces Legal\nPrecedent Prediction (LPP), the task of predicting relevant passages from\nprecedential court decisions given the context of a legal argument. To this\nend, the paper showcases a BERT model, trained on 530,000 examples of legal\narguments made by U.S. federal judges, to predict relevant passages from\nprecedential court decisions given the context of a legal argument. In 96% of\nunseen test examples the correct target passage is among the top-10 predicted\npassages. The same model is able to predict relevant precedent given a short\nsummary of a complex and unseen legal brief, predicting the precedent that was\nactually cited by the brief's co-author, former U.S. Solicitor General and\ncurrent U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan.",

          "description": "Commonsense inference to understand and explain human language is a\nfundamental research problem in natural language processing. Explaining human\nconversations poses a great challenge as it requires contextual understanding,\nplanning, inference, and several aspects of reasoning including causal,\ntemporal, and commonsense reasoning. In this work, we introduce CIDER -- a\nmanually curated dataset that contains dyadic dialogue explanations in the form\nof implicit and explicit knowledge triplets inferred using contextual\ncommonsense inference. Extracting such rich explanations from conversations can\nbe conducive to improving several downstream applications. The annotated\ntriplets are categorized by the type of commonsense knowledge present (e.g.,\ncausal, conditional, temporal). We set up three different tasks conditioned on\nthe annotated dataset: Dialogue-level Natural Language Inference, Span\nExtraction, and Multi-choice Span Selection. Baseline results obtained with\ntransformer-based models reveal that the tasks are difficult, paving the way\nfor promising future research. The dataset and the baseline implementations are\npublicly available at https://cider-task.github.io/cider/.",

          "description": "German and French football language display tense-aspect-mood (TAM) forms\nwhich differ from the TAM use in other genres. In German football talk, the\npresent indicative may replace the pluperfect subjunctive. In French reports of\nfootball matches, the imperfective past may occur instead of a perfective past\ntense-aspect form. We argue that the two phenomena share a functional core and\nare licensed in the same way, which is a direct result of the genre they occur\nin. More precisely, football match reports adhere to a precise script and\nspecific events are temporally determined in terms of objective time. This\nallows speakers to exploit a secondary function of TAM forms, namely, they\nshift the temporal perspective. We argue that it is on the grounds of the genre\nthat comprehenders predict the deviating forms and are also able to decode\nthem. We present various corpus studies where we explore the functioning of\nthese phenomena in order to gain insights into their distribution,\ngrammaticalization and their functioning in discourse. Relevant factors are\nAktionsart properties, rhetorical relations and their interaction with other\nTAM forms. This allows us to discuss coping mechanisms on the part of the\ncomprehender. We broaden our understanding of the phenomena, which have only\nbeen partly covered for French and up to now seem to have been ignored in\nGerman.",

          "description": "Social media platforms provide users the freedom of expression and a medium\nto exchange information and express diverse opinions. Unfortunately, this has\nalso resulted in the growth of abusive content with the purpose of\ndiscriminating people and targeting the most vulnerable communities such as\nimmigrants, LGBT, Muslims, Jews and women. Because abusive language is\nsubjective in nature, there might be highly polarizing topics or events\ninvolved in the annotation of abusive contents such as hate speech (HS).\nTherefore, we need novel approaches to model conflicting perspectives and\nopinions coming from people with different personal and demographic\nbackgrounds. In this paper, we present an in-depth study to model polarized\nopinions coming from different communities under the hypothesis that similar\ncharacteristics (ethnicity, social background, culture etc.) can influence the\nperspectives of annotators on a certain phenomenon. We believe that by relying\non this information, we can divide the annotators into groups sharing similar\nperspectives. We can create separate gold standards, one for each group, to\ntrain state-of-the-art deep learning models. We can employ an ensemble approach\nto combine the perspective-aware classifiers from different groups to an\ninclusive model. We also propose a novel resource, a multi-perspective English\nlanguage dataset annotated according to different sub-categories relevant for\ncharacterising online abuse: hate speech, aggressiveness, offensiveness and\nstereotype. By training state-of-the-art deep learning models on this novel\nresource, we show how our approach improves the prediction performance of a\nstate-of-the-art supervised classifier.",

          "description": "This work originates from the observation that today's state of the art\nstatistical language models are impressive not only for their performance, but\nalso - and quite crucially - because they are built entirely from correlations\nin unstructured text data. The latter observation prompts a fundamental\nquestion that lies at the heart of this paper: What mathematical structure\nexists in unstructured text data? We put forth enriched category theory as a\nnatural answer. We show that sequences of symbols from a finite alphabet, such\nas those found in a corpus of text, form a category enriched over\nprobabilities. We then address a second fundamental question: How can this\ninformation be stored and modeled in a way that preserves the categorical\nstructure? We answer this by constructing a functor from our enriched category\nof text to a particular enriched category of reduced density operators. The\nlatter leverages the Loewner order on positive semidefinite operators, which\ncan further be interpreted as a toy example of entailment.",

          "description": "Automatic evaluation metrics are a crucial component of dialog systems\nresearch. Standard language evaluation metrics are known to be ineffective for\nevaluating dialog.

To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of recently\nproposed dialog evaluation metrics on a number of datasets. In this paper, 17\ndifferent automatic evaluation metrics are evaluated on 10 different datasets.\nFurthermore, the metrics are assessed in different settings, to better qualify\ntheir respective strengths and weaknesses. Metrics are assessed (1) on both the\nturn level and the dialog level, (2) for different dialog lengths, (3) for\ndifferent dialog qualities (e.g., coherence, engaging), (4) for different types\nof response generation models (i.e., generative, retrieval, simple models and\nstate-of-the-art models), (5) taking into account the similarity of different\nmetrics and (6) exploring combinations of different metrics.

          "description": "We introduce a generic seq2seq parsing framework that casts constituency\nparsing problems (syntactic and discourse parsing) into a series of conditional\nsplitting decisions. Our parsing model estimates the conditional probability\ndistribution of possible splitting points in a given text span and supports\nefficient top-down decoding, which is linear in number of nodes. The\nconditional splitting formulation together with efficient beam search inference\nfacilitate structural consistency without relying on expensive structured\ninference. Crucially, for discourse analysis we show that in our formulation,\ndiscourse segmentation can be framed as a special case of parsing which allows\nus to perform discourse parsing without requiring segmentation as a\npre-requisite. Experiments show that our model achieves good results on the\nstandard syntactic parsing tasks under settings with/without pre-trained\nrepresentations and rivals state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods that are more\ncomputationally expensive than ours.

          "description": "Current methods for learning visually grounded language from videos often\nrely on text annotation, such as human generated captions or machine generated\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. In this work, we introduce the\nAudio-Video Language Network (AVLnet), a self-supervised network that learns a\nshared audio-visual embedding space directly from raw video inputs. To\ncircumvent the need for text annotation, we learn audio-visual representations\nfrom randomly segmented video clips and their raw audio waveforms. We train\nAVLnet on HowTo100M, a large corpus of publicly available instructional videos,\nand evaluate on image retrieval and video retrieval tasks, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance. We perform analysis of AVLnet's learned\nrepresentations, showing our model utilizes speech and natural sounds to learn\naudio-visual concepts. Further, we propose a tri-modal model that jointly\nprocesses raw audio, video, and text captions from videos to learn a\nmulti-modal semantic embedding space useful for text-video retrieval.

It has been a focal point to understand\nhow much of the semantics of the the words has been transferred into embedding\nvectors. This is important as the embedding is going to be used as the basis\nfor downstream NLP applications and it will be costly to evaluate the\napplication end-to-end in order to identify quality of the used embedding\nmodel. Generally the word embeddings are evaluated through a number of tests,\nincluding analogy test. In this paper we propose a test framework for Persian\nembedding models. Persian is a low resource language and there is no rich\nsemantic benchmark to evaluate word embedding models for this language. In this\npaper we introduce an evaluation framework including a hand crafted Persian SAT\nbased analogy dataset, a colliquial test set (specific to Persian) and a\nbenchmark to study the impact of various parameters on the semantic evaluation\ntask.",

          "description": "In neural machine translation, cross entropy (CE) is the standard loss\nfunction in two training methods of auto-regressive models, i.e., teacher\nforcing and scheduled sampling. In this paper, we propose mixed cross entropy\nloss (mixed CE) as a substitute for CE in both training approaches. In teacher\nforcing, the model trained with CE regards the translation problem as a\none-to-one mapping process, while in mixed CE this process can be relaxed to\none-to-many. In scheduled sampling, we show that mixed CE has the potential to\nencourage the training and testing behaviours to be similar to each other, more\neffectively mitigating the exposure bias problem. We demonstrate the\nsuperiority of mixed CE over CE on several machine translation datasets, WMT'16\nRo-En, WMT'16 Ru-En, and WMT'14 En-De in both teacher forcing and scheduled\nsampling setups. Furthermore, in WMT'14 En-De, we also find mixed CE\nconsistently outperforms CE on a multi-reference set as well as a challenging\nparaphrased reference set.

Recent work has shown that transformers with hard\nattention are quite limited in capacity, and in fact can be simulated by\nconstant-depth circuits. However, hard attention is a restrictive assumption,\nwhich may complicate the relevance of these results for practical transformers.\nIn this work, we analyze the circuit complexity of transformers with saturated\nattention: a generalization of hard attention that more closely captures the\nattention patterns learnable in practical transformers. We show that saturated\ntransformers transcend the limitations of hard-attention transformers. With\nsome minor assumptions, we prove that the number of bits needed to represent a\nsaturated transformer memory vector is $O(\\log n)$, which implies saturated\ntransformers can be simulated by log-depth circuits. Thus, the jump from hard\nto saturated attention can be understood as increasing the transformer's\neffective circuit depth by a factor of $O(\\log n)$.",

          "description": "To provide consistent emotional interaction with users, dialog systems should\nbe capable to automatically select appropriate emotions for responses like\nhumans. However, most existing works focus on rendering specified emotions in\nresponses or empathetically respond to the emotion of users, yet the individual\ndifference in emotion expression is overlooked. This may lead to inconsistent\nemotional expressions and disinterest users. To tackle this issue, we propose\nto equip the dialog system with personality and enable it to automatically\nselect emotions in responses by simulating the emotion transition of humans in\nconversation. In detail, the emotion of the dialog system is transitioned from\nits preceding emotion in context. The transition is triggered by the preceding\ndialog context and affected by the specified personality trait. To achieve\nthis, we first model the emotion transition in the dialog system as the\nvariation between the preceding emotion and the response emotion in the\nValence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion space. Then, we design neural networks\nto encode the preceding dialog context and the specified personality traits to\ncompose the variation. Finally, the emotion for response is selected from the\nsum of the preceding emotion and the variation. We construct a dialog dataset\nwith emotion and personality labels and conduct emotion prediction tasks for\nevaluation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the\npersonality-affected emotion transition.",

We evaluate the proposed mapping methods on nine languages, using two\ndownstream tasks, NER and dependency parsing.

Our model outperforms prior work by up\nto 2.6% F1 score on several datasets for joint entity and relation extraction.",

          "description": "Natural language is compositional; the meaning of a sentence is a function of\nthe meaning of its parts. This property allows humans to create and interpret\nnovel sentences, generalizing robustly outside their prior experience. Neural\nnetworks have been shown to struggle with this kind of generalization, in\nparticular performing poorly on tasks designed to assess compositional\ngeneralization (i.e. where training and testing distributions differ in ways\nthat would be trivial for a compositional strategy to resolve). Their poor\nperformance on these tasks may in part be due to the nature of supervised\nlearning which assumes training and testing data to be drawn from the same\ndistribution. We implement a meta-learning augmented version of supervised\nlearning whose objective directly optimizes for out-of-distribution\ngeneralization. We construct pairs of tasks for meta-learning by sub-sampling\nexisting training data. Each pair of tasks is constructed to contain relevant\nexamples, as determined by a similarity metric, in an effort to inhibit models\nfrom memorizing their input. Experimental results on the COGS and SCAN datasets\nshow that our similarity-driven meta-learning can improve generalization\nperformance.",

          "description": "Recently generating natural language explanations has shown very promising\nresults in not only offering interpretable explanations but also providing\nadditional information and supervision for prediction. However, existing\napproaches usually require a large set of human annotated explanations for\ntraining while collecting a large set of explanations is not only time\nconsuming but also expensive. In this paper, we develop a general framework for\ninterpretable natural language understanding that requires only a small set of\nhuman annotated explanations for training. Our framework treats natural\nlanguage explanations as latent variables that model the underlying reasoning\nprocess of a neural model. We develop a variational EM framework for\noptimization where an explanation generation module and an\nexplanation-augmented prediction module are alternatively optimized and\nmutually enhance each other. Moreover, we further propose an explanation-based\nself-training method under this framework for semi-supervised learning. It\nalternates between assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data and generating new\nexplanations to iteratively improve each other. Experiments on two natural\nlanguage understanding tasks demonstrate that our framework can not only make\neffective predictions in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, but also\ngenerate good natural language explanation.",

          "description": "Electronic health record (EHR) coding is the task of assigning ICD codes to\neach EHR. Most previous studies either only focus on the frequent ICD codes or\ntreat rare and frequent ICD codes in the same way. These methods perform well\non frequent ICD codes but due to the extremely unbalanced distribution of ICD\ncodes, the performance on rare ones is far from satisfactory. We seek to\nimprove the performance for both frequent and rare ICD codes by using a\ncontrastive graph-based EHR coding framework, CoGraph, which re-casts EHR\ncoding as a few-shot learning task. First, we construct a heterogeneous EHR\nword-entity (HEWE) graph for each EHR, where the words and entities extracted\nfrom an EHR serve as nodes and the relations between them serve as edges. Then,\nCoGraph learns similarities and dissimilarities between HEWE graphs from\ndifferent ICD codes so that information can be transferred among them. In a\nfew-shot learning scenario, the model only has access to frequent ICD codes\nduring training, which might force it to encode features that are useful for\nfrequent ICD codes only. To mitigate this risk, CoGraph devises two graph\ncontrastive learning schemes, GSCL and GECL, that exploit the HEWE graph\nstructures so as to encode transferable features. GSCL utilizes the\nintra-correlation of different sub-graphs sampled from HEWE graphs while GECL\nexploits the inter-correlation among HEWE graphs at different clinical stages.\nExperiments on the MIMIC-III benchmark dataset show that CoGraph significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on EHR coding, not only on frequent ICD\ncodes, but also on rare codes, in terms of several evaluation indicators. On\nfrequent ICD codes, GSCL and GECL improve the classification accuracy and F1 by\n1.31% and 0.61%, respectively, and on rare ICD codes CoGraph has more obvious\nimprovements by 2.12% and 2.95%.",

All extractive\nsub-summaries are later combined to generate a summary for any given source\ndocument. We utilize the lesser used and challenging WikiHow dataset in our\napproach to text summarization. This dataset is unlike the commonly used news\ndatasets which are available for text summarization. The well-known news\ndatasets present their most important information in the first few lines of\ntheir source texts, which make their summarization a lesser challenging task\nwhen compared to summarizing the WikiHow dataset. Contrary to these news\ndatasets, the documents in the WikiHow dataset are written using a generalized\napproach and have lesser abstractedness and higher compression ratio, thus\nproposing a greater challenge to generate summaries. A lot of the current\nstate-of-the-art text summarization techniques tend to eliminate important\ninformation present in source documents in the favor of brevity.

          "description": "While state-of-the-art NLP models have been achieving the excellent\nperformance of a wide range of tasks in recent years, important questions are\nbeing raised about their robustness and their underlying sensitivity to\nsystematic biases that may exist in their training and test data. Such issues\ncome to be manifest in performance problems when faced with out-of-distribution\ndata in the field. One recent solution has been to use counterfactually\naugmented datasets in order to reduce any reliance on spurious patterns that\nmay exist in the original data. Producing high-quality augmented data can be\ncostly and time-consuming as it usually needs to involve human feedback and\ncrowdsourcing efforts. In this work, we propose an alternative by describing\nand evaluating an approach to automatically generating counterfactual data for\ndata augmentation and explanation. A comprehensive evaluation on several\ndifferent datasets and using a variety of state-of-the-art benchmarks\ndemonstrate how our approach can achieve significant improvements in model\nperformance when compared to models training on the original data and even when\ncompared to models trained with the benefit of human-generated augmented data.",

          "description": "The evaluation of neural machine translation systems is usually built upon\ngenerated translation of a certain decoding method (e.g., beam search) with\nevaluation metrics over the generated translation (e.g., BLEU). However, this\nevaluation framework suffers from high search errors brought by heuristic\nsearch algorithms and is limited by its nature of evaluation over one best\ncandidate. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation protocol, which not\nonly avoids the effect of search errors but provides a system-level evaluation\nin the perspective of model ranking. In particular, our method is based on our\nnewly proposed exact top-$k$ decoding instead of beam search. Our approach\nevaluates model errors by the distance between the candidate spaces scored by\nthe references and the model respectively. Extensive experiments on WMT'14\nEnglish-German demonstrate that bad ranking ability is connected to the\nwell-known beam search curse, and state-of-the-art Transformer models are\nfacing serious ranking errors. By evaluating various model architectures and\ntechniques, we provide several interesting findings. Finally, to effectively\napproximate the exact search algorithm with same time cost as original beam\nsearch, we present a minimum heap augmented beam search algorithm.",

          "description": "Neural text generation models are typically trained by maximizing\nlog-likelihood with the sequence cross entropy loss, which encourages an exact\ntoken-by-token match between a target sequence with a generated sequence. Such\ntraining objective is sub-optimal when the target sequence not perfect, e.g.,\nwhen the target sequence is corrupted with noises, or when only weak sequence\nsupervision is available. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nEdit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL), which computes the matching loss of a\ntarget n-gram with all n-grams in the generated sequence. EISL draws\ninspirations from convolutional networks (ConvNets) which are shift-invariant\nto images, hence is robust to the shift of n-grams to tolerate edits in the\ntarget sequences. Moreover, the computation of EISL is essentially a\nconvolution operation with target n-grams as kernels, which is easy to\nimplement with existing libraries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EISL, we\nconduct experiments on three tasks: machine translation with noisy target\nsequences, unsupervised text style transfer, and non-autoregressive machine\ntranslation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms\ncross entropy loss on these three tasks.",

However, previous works generally view the abstract\nas plain text, ignoring the fact that it is a description of a certain entity\nand can be decomposed into different topics. In this paper, we propose a\ntwo-stage model TWAG that guides the abstract generation with topical\ninformation. First, we detect the topic of each input paragraph with a\nclassifier trained on existing Wikipedia articles to divide input documents\ninto different topics. Then, we predict the topic distribution of each abstract\nsentence, and decode the sentence from topic-aware representations with a\nPointer-Generator network. We evaluate our model on the WikiCatSum dataset, and\nthe results show that \\modelnames outperforms various existing baselines and is\ncapable of generating comprehensive abstracts.

          "description": "Generating high-quality and diverse essays with a set of topics is a\nchallenging task in natural language generation. Since several given topics\nonly provide limited source information, utilizing various topic-related\nknowledge is essential for improving essay generation performance. However,\nprevious works cannot sufficiently use that knowledge to facilitate the\ngeneration procedure. This paper aims to improve essay generation by extracting\ninformation from both internal and external knowledge. Thus, a topic-to-essay\ngeneration model with comprehensive knowledge enhancement, named TEGKE, is\nproposed. For internal knowledge enhancement, both topics and related essays\nare fed to a teacher network as source information. Then, informative features\nwould be obtained from the teacher network and transferred to a student network\nwhich only takes topics as input but provides comparable information compared\nwith the teacher network. For external knowledge enhancement, a topic knowledge\ngraph encoder is proposed. Unlike the previous works only using the nearest\nneighbors of topics in the commonsense base, our topic knowledge graph encoder\ncould exploit more structural and semantic information of the commonsense\nknowledge graph to facilitate essay generation. Moreover, the adversarial\ntraining based on the Wasserstein distance is proposed to improve generation\nquality. Experimental results demonstrate that TEGKE could achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on both automatic and human evaluation.",

On one hand, it can relieve radiologists from\nthe heavy burden of report writing; On the other hand, it can remind\nradiologists of abnormalities and avoid the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.\nYet, this task remains a challenging job for data-driven neural networks, due\nto the serious visual and textual data biases. To this end, we propose a\nPosterior-and-Prior Knowledge Exploring-and-Distilling approach (PPKED) to\nimitate the working patterns of radiologists, who will first examine the\nabnormal regions and assign the disease topic tags to the abnormal regions, and\nthen rely on the years of prior medical knowledge and prior working experience\naccumulations to write reports. Thus, the PPKED includes three modules:\nPosterior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE), Prior Knowledge Explorer (PrKE) and\nMulti-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD). In detail, PoKE explores the posterior\nknowledge, which provides explicit abnormal visual regions to alleviate visual\ndata bias; PrKE explores the prior knowledge from the prior medical knowledge\ngraph (medical knowledge) and prior radiology reports (working experience) to\nalleviate textual data bias. The explored knowledge is distilled by the MKD to\ngenerate the final reports. Evaluated on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets, our\nmethod is able to outperform previous state-of-the-art models on these two\ndatasets.",

          "description": "Given the prevalence of pre-trained contextualized representations in today's\nNLP, there have been several efforts to understand what information such\nrepresentations contain. A common strategy to use such representations is to\nfine-tune them for an end task. However, how fine-tuning for a task changes the\nunderlying space is less studied. In this work, we study the English BERT\nfamily and use two probing techniques to analyze how fine-tuning changes the\nspace. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning improves performance because it\npushes points associated with a label away from other labels. By comparing the\nrepresentations before and after fine-tuning, we also discover that fine-tuning\ndoes not change the representations arbitrarily; instead, it adjusts the\nrepresentations to downstream tasks while preserving the original structure.\nFinally, using carefully constructed experiments, we show that fine-tuning can\nencode training sets in a representation, suggesting an overfitting problem of\na new kind.",

          "description": "There is an escalating need for methods to identify latent patterns in text\ndata from many domains. We introduce a new method to identify topics in a\ncorpus and represent documents as topic sequences. Discourse Atom Topic\nModeling draws on advances in theoretical machine learning to integrate topic\nmodeling and word embedding, capitalizing on the distinct capabilities of each.\nWe first identify a set of vectors (\"discourse atoms\") that provide a sparse\nrepresentation of an embedding space. Atom vectors can be interpreted as latent\ntopics: Through a generative model, atoms map onto distributions over words;\none can also infer the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate\nour method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the U.S. National\nViolent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS summarizes violent death\nincidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify\n225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical\naggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured\nvariables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender, and\nrecent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias\nof our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then\ncompare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female\nversus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of\nreporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a\nflexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data.",

In spatial referring\nexpression generation, the ambiguity is unavoidable due to the diversity of\nreference frames, which will lead to an understanding gap between humans and\nrobots. To narrow this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel\nperspective-corrected spatial referring expression generation (PcSREG) approach\nfor human-robot interaction by considering the selection of reference frames.\nThe task of referring expression generation is simplified into the process of\ngenerating diverse spatial relation units. First, we pick out all landmarks in\nthese spatial relation units according to the entropy of preference and allow\nits updating through a stack model. Then all possible referring expressions are\ngenerated according to different reference frame strategies. Finally, we\nevaluate every expression using a probabilistic referring expression resolution\nmodel and find the best expression that satisfies both of the appropriateness\nand effectiveness. We implement the proposed approach on a robot system and\nempirical experiments show that our approach can generate more effective\nspatial referring expressions for practical applications.",

          "description": "Target speech separation is the process of filtering a certain speaker's\nvoice out of speech mixtures according to the additional speaker identity\ninformation provided. Recent works have made considerable improvement by\nprocessing signals in the time domain directly. The majority of them take fully\noverlapped speech mixtures for training. However, since most real-life\nconversations occur randomly and are sparsely overlapped, we argue that\ntraining with different overlap ratio data benefits. To do so, an unavoidable\nproblem is that the popularly used SI-SNR loss has no definition for silent\nsources. This paper proposes the weighted SI-SNR loss, together with the joint\nlearning of target speech separation and personal VAD. The weighted SI-SNR loss\nimposes a weight factor that is proportional to the target speaker's duration\nand returns zero when the target speaker is absent. Meanwhile, the personal VAD\ngenerates masks and sets non-target speech to silence. Experiments show that\nour proposed method outperforms the baseline by 1.73 dB in terms of SDR on\nfully overlapped speech, as well as by 4.17 dB and 0.9 dB on sparsely\noverlapped speech of clean and noisy conditions. Besides, with slight\ndegradation in performance, our model could reduce the time costs in inference.",

In our work, we present RadGraph, a dataset of\nentities and relations in full-text chest X-ray radiology reports based on a\nnovel information extraction schema we designed to structure radiology reports.\nWe release a development dataset, which contains board-certified radiologist\nannotations for 500 radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR dataset (14,579\nentities and 10,889 relations), and a test dataset, which contains two\nindependent sets of board-certified radiologist annotations for 100 radiology\nreports split equally across the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert datasets. Using these\ndatasets, we train and test a deep learning model, RadGraph Benchmark, that\nachieves a micro F1 of 0.82 and 0.73 on relation extraction on the MIMIC-CXR\nand CheXpert test sets respectively. Additionally, we release an inference\ndataset, which contains annotations automatically generated by RadGraph\nBenchmark across 220,763 MIMIC-CXR reports (around 6 million entities and 4\nmillion relations) and 500 CheXpert reports (13,783 entities and 9,908\nrelations) with mappings to associated chest radiographs.

          "description": "We generalize deep self-attention distillation in MiniLM (Wang et al., 2020)\nby only using self-attention relation distillation for task-agnostic\ncompression of pretrained Transformers. In particular, we define multi-head\nself-attention relations as scaled dot-product between the pairs of query, key,\nand value vectors within each self-attention module. Then we employ the above\nrelational knowledge to train the student model. Besides its simplicity and\nunified principle, more favorably, there is no restriction in terms of the\nnumber of student's attention heads, while most previous work has to guarantee\nthe same head number between teacher and student. Moreover, the fine-grained\nself-attention relations tend to fully exploit the interaction knowledge\nlearned by Transformer. In addition, we thoroughly examine the layer selection\nstrategy for teacher models, rather than just relying on the last layer as in\nMiniLM. We conduct extensive experiments on compressing both monolingual and\nmultilingual pretrained models. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmodels distilled from base-size and large-size teachers (BERT, RoBERTa and\nXLM-R) outperform the state-of-the-art.",

Vector representations can be limiting,\nhowever, in that typical scoring such as dot product similarity intertwines\nposition and magnitude of the vector in space. Exciting innovations in the\nspace of representation learning have proposed alternative fundamental\nrepresentations, such as distributions, hyperbolic vectors, or regions. Our\nmodel, Word2Box, takes a region-based approach to the problem of word\nrepresentation, representing words as $n$-dimensional rectangles. These\nrepresentations encode position and breadth independently and provide\nadditional geometric operations such as intersection and containment which\nallow them to model co-occurrence patterns vectors struggle with.

The resulting system is a multimodal few-shot learner,\nwith the surprising ability to learn a variety of new tasks when conditioned on\nexamples, represented as a sequence of multiple interleaved image and text\nembeddings. We demonstrate that it can rapidly learn words for new objects and\nnovel visual categories, do visual question-answering with only a handful of\nexamples, and make use of outside knowledge, by measuring a single model on a\nvariety of established and new benchmarks.",

Besides an $F_1$-based relevance score, we also\ndesign an $F_\\beta$-based variant that pays more attention to the recall score.\nAs for the redundancy score of the summary, we compute a self-masked similarity\nscore with the summary itself to evaluate the redundant information in the\nsummary. Finally, we combine the relevance and redundancy scores to produce the\nfinal evaluation score of the given summary.

          "description": "Link prediction is the task of predicting missing relations between entities\nof the knowledge graph by inferring from the facts contained in it. Recent work\nin link prediction has attempted to provide a model for increasing link\nprediction accuracy by using more layers in neural network architecture or\nmethods that add to the computational complexity of models. This paper we\nproposed a method for refining the knowledge graph, which makes the knowledge\ngraph more informative, and link prediction operations can be performed more\naccurately using relatively fast translational models. Translational link\nprediction models, such as TransE, TransH, TransD, etc., have much less\ncomplexity than deep learning approaches. This method uses the hierarchy of\nrelationships and also the hierarchy of entities in the knowledge graph to add\nthe entity information as a new entity to the graph and connect it to the nodes\nwhich contain this information in their hierarchy. Our experiments show that\nour method can significantly increase the performance of translational link\nprediction methods in H@10, MR, MRR.",

          "description": "In the field of inorganic materials science, there is a growing demand to\nextract knowledge such as physical properties and synthesis processes of\nmaterials by machine-reading a large number of papers. This is because\nmaterials researchers refer to many papers in order to come up with promising\nterms of experiments for material synthesis. However, there are only a few\nsystems that can extract material names and their properties. This study\nproposes a large-scale natural language processing (NLP) pipeline for\nextracting material names and properties from materials science literature to\nenable the search and retrieval of results in materials science. Therefore, we\npropose a label definition for extracting material names and properties and\naccordingly build a corpus containing 836 annotated paragraphs extracted from\n301 papers for training a named entity recognition (NER) model. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the utility of this NER model; it achieves successful\nextraction with a micro-F1 score of 78.1%. To demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach, we present a thorough evaluation on a real-world automatically\nannotated corpus by applying our trained NER model to 12,895 materials science\npapers. We analyze the trend in materials science by visualizing the outputs of\nthe NLP pipeline. For example, the country-by-year analysis indicates that in\nrecent years, the number of papers on \"MoS2,\" a material used in perovskite\nsolar cells, has been increasing rapidly in China but decreasing in the United\nStates. Further, according to the conditions-by-year analysis, the processing\ntemperature of the catalyst material \"PEDOT:PSS\" is shifting below 200 degree,\nand the number of reports with a processing time exceeding 5 h is increasing\nslightly.",

          "description": "Extracting relational triples from texts is a fundamental task in knowledge\ngraph construction. The popular way of existing methods is to jointly extract\nentities and relations using a single model, which often suffers from the\noverlapping triple problem. That is, there are multiple relational triples that\nshare the same entities within one sentence. In this work, we propose an\neffective cascade dual-decoder approach to extract overlapping relational\ntriples, which includes a text-specific relation decoder and a\nrelation-corresponded entity decoder. Our approach is straightforward: the\ntext-specific relation decoder detects relations from a sentence according to\nits text semantics and treats them as extra features to guide the entity\nextraction; for each extracted relation, which is with trainable embedding, the\nrelation-corresponded entity decoder detects the corresponding head and tail\nentities using a span-based tagging scheme. In this way, the overlapping triple\nproblem is tackled naturally. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate\nthat our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves\nbetter F1 scores under the strict evaluation metric.

          "description": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a fundamental role in modeling and\nsimulating problems across a wide range of disciplines. Recent advances in deep\nlearning have shown the great potential of physics-informed neural networks\n(PINNs) to solve PDEs as a basis for data-driven modeling and inverse analysis.\nHowever, the majority of existing PINN methods, based on fully-connected NNs,\npose intrinsic limitations to low-dimensional spatiotemporal parameterizations.\nMoreover, since the initial/boundary conditions (I/BCs) are softly imposed via\npenalty, the solution quality heavily relies on hyperparameter tuning. To this\nend, we propose the novel physics-informed convolutional-recurrent learning\narchitectures (PhyCRNet and PhyCRNet-s) for solving PDEs without any labeled\ndata. Specifically, an encoder-decoder convolutional long short-term memory\nnetwork is proposed for low-dimensional spatial feature extraction and temporal\nevolution learning. The loss function is defined as the aggregated discretized\nPDE residuals, while the I/BCs are hard-encoded in the network to ensure\nforcible satisfaction (e.g., periodic boundary padding). The networks are\nfurther enhanced by autoregressive and residual connections that explicitly\nsimulate time marching. The performance of our proposed methods has been\nassessed by solving three nonlinear PDEs (e.g., 2D Burgers' equations, the\n$\\lambda$-$\\omega$ and FitzHugh Nagumo reaction-diffusion equations), and\ncompared against the start-of-the-art baseline algorithms.

          "description": "Forming and interpreting abstraction is a core process in human\ncommunication. In particular, when giving and performing complex instructions\nstated in natural language (NL), people may naturally evoke abstract constructs\nsuch as objects, loops, conditions and functions to convey their intentions in\nan efficient and precise way. Yet, interpreting and grounding abstraction\nstated in NL has not been systematically studied in NLP/AI. To elicit\nnaturally-occurring abstractions in NL we develop the Hexagons referential\ngame, where players describe increasingly complex images on a two-dimensional\nHexagons board, and other players need to follow these instructions to recreate\nthe images. Using this game we collected the Hexagons dataset, which consists\nof 164 images and over 3000 naturally-occurring instructions, rich with diverse\nabstractions. Results of our baseline models on an instruction-to-execution\ntask derived from the Hexagons dataset confirm that higher-level abstractions\nin NL are indeed more challenging for current systems to process. Thus, this\ndataset exposes a new and challenging dimension for grounded semantic parsing,\nand we propose it for the community as a future benchmark to explore more\nsophisticated and high-level communication within NLP applications.",

          "description": "Fake news travels at unprecedented speeds, reaches global audiences and puts\nusers and communities at great risk via social media platforms. Deep learning\nbased models show good performance when trained on large amounts of labeled\ndata on events of interest, whereas the performance of models tends to degrade\non other events due to domain shift. Therefore, significant challenges are\nposed for existing detection approaches to detect fake news on emergent events,\nwhere large-scale labeled datasets are difficult to obtain. Moreover, adding\nthe knowledge from newly emergent events requires to build a new model from\nscratch or continue to fine-tune the model, which can be challenging,\nexpensive, and unrealistic for real-world settings. In order to address those\nchallenges, we propose an end-to-end fake news detection framework named\nMetaFEND, which is able to learn quickly to detect fake news on emergent events\nwith a few verified posts. Specifically, the proposed model integrates\nmeta-learning and neural process methods together to enjoy the benefits of\nthese approaches. In particular, a label embedding module and a hard attention\nmechanism are proposed to enhance the effectiveness by handling categorical\ninformation and trimming irrelevant posts. Extensive experiments are conducted\non multimedia datasets collected from Twitter and Weibo. The experimental\nresults show our proposed MetaFEND model can detect fake news on never-seen\nevents effectively and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.",

This work is the first to use these textual descriptions, which we call\nprivileged information, for AutoML. We use a pre-trained Transformer model to\nprocess the privileged text and demonstrate that using this information\nimproves AutoML performance. Thus, our approach leverages the progress of\nunsupervised representation learning in natural language processing to provide\na significant boost to AutoML. We demonstrate that using only textual\ndescriptions of the data and functions achieves reasonable classification\nperformance, and adding textual descriptions to data meta-features improves\nclassification across tabular datasets. To achieve zero-shot AutoML we train a\ngraph neural network with these description embeddings and the data\nmeta-features. Each node represents a training dataset, which we use to predict\nthe best machine learning pipeline for a new test dataset in a zero-shot\nfashion. Our zero-shot approach rapidly predicts a high-quality pipeline for a\nsupervised learning task and dataset. In contrast, most AutoML systems require\ntens or hundreds of pipeline evaluations.

We further propose Multinomial\nMasked Proxy (MMP) loss to leverage the hardness of speaker pairs. These\nmethods have been applied to evaluate on VoxCeleb test set and reach\nstate-of-the-art Equal Error Rate(EER).",

          "description": "ELECTRA pretrains a discriminator to detect replaced tokens, where the\nreplacements are sampled from a generator trained with masked language\nmodeling. Despite the compelling performance, ELECTRA suffers from the\nfollowing two issues. First, there is no direct feedback loop from\ndiscriminator to generator, which renders replacement sampling inefficient.\nSecond, the generator's prediction tends to be over-confident along with\ntraining, making replacements biased to correct tokens. In this paper, we\npropose two methods to improve replacement sampling for ELECTRA pre-training.\nSpecifically, we augment sampling with a hardness prediction mechanism, so that\nthe generator can encourage the discriminator to learn what it has not\nacquired. We also prove that efficient sampling reduces the training variance\nof the discriminator. Moreover, we propose to use a focal loss for the\ngenerator in order to relieve oversampling of correct tokens as replacements.\nExperimental results show that our method improves ELECTRA pre-training on\nvarious downstream tasks.",

We have created a database of 1076 English\ntitles + 20 Marathi titles and also used database\nthis http URL with 16559 titles and their\nsummaries. We have proposed Sentiment Progression based Indexing for searching\nand recommending books. This can be used to create personalized clusters of\nbook titles of interest to readers.

          "description": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can achieve promising results with outrageous\nlarge amount of parameters but constant computation cost, and thus it has\nbecome a trend in model scaling. Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring\nquality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this\nwork, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe\nthat load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,\ncontrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely\nactivated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can\nsignificantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step\nforward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits\nexperts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This\nstrategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,\nand our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is\nmore effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$\ntrillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in\ncomparison with the recent SOTAs on $2048$ TPU cores.

Inspired by\nthe recent progress of large-scale pre-trained language models on machine\ntranslation in a limited scenario, we firstly demonstrate that a single\nlanguage model (LM4MT) can achieve comparable performance with strong\nencoder-decoder NMT models on standard machine translation benchmarks, using\nthe same training data and similar amount of model parameters. LM4MT can also\neasily utilize source-side texts as additional supervision.

In spoken\ndialogues, abundant dialogue noise and common semantics could obscure the\nunderlying informative content, making the general topic modeling approaches\ndifficult to apply. In addition, for customer service, role-specific\ninformation matters and is an indispensable part of a summary.

We\nanalyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of\nprefixes, when varying the training objective or the amount of training data,\nand during the training process.

          "description": "In spoken conversational question answering (SCQA), the answer to the\ncorresponding question is generated by retrieving and then analyzing a fixed\nspoken document, including multi-part conversations. Most SCQA systems have\nconsidered only retrieving information from ordered utterances. However, the\nsequential order of dialogue is important to build a robust spoken\nconversational question answering system, and the changes of utterances order\nmay severely result in low-quality and incoherent corpora. To this end, we\nintroduce a self-supervised learning approach, including incoherence\ndiscrimination, insertion detection, and question prediction, to explicitly\ncapture the coreference resolution and dialogue coherence among spoken\ndocuments. Specifically, we design a joint learning framework where the\nauxiliary self-supervised tasks can enable the pre-trained SCQA systems towards\nmore coherent and meaningful spoken dialogue learning. We also utilize the\nproposed self-supervised learning tasks to capture intra-sentence coherence.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed method provides more\ncoherent, meaningful, and appropriate responses, yielding superior performance\ngains compared to the original pre-trained language models.

We validate the\nperformance of the QA models trained with our word embedding perturbation on a\nsingle source dataset, on five different target domains.The results show that\nour method significantly outperforms the baselineDA methods. Notably, the model\ntrained with ours outperforms the model trained with more than 240K\nartificially generated QA pairs.",

One promising data source to help monitor human behavior is daily\nsmartphone usage. However, care must be taken to summarize behaviors without\nidentifying the user through personal (e.g., personally identifiable\ninformation) or protected (e.g., race, gender) attributes. In this paper, we\nstudy behavioral markers of daily mood using a recent dataset of mobile\nbehaviors from adolescent populations at high risk of suicidal behaviors. Using\ncomputational models, we find that language and multimodal representations of\nmobile typed text (spanning typed characters, words, keystroke timings, and app\nusage) are predictive of daily mood. However, we find that models trained to\npredict mood often also capture private user identities in their intermediate\nrepresentations.

          "description": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) topic has seen a lot of progress these\nlast three years, with the emergence of end-to-end neural approaches. Spoken\nlanguage understanding refers to natural language processing tasks related to\nsemantic extraction from speech signal, like named entity recognition from\nspeech or slot filling task in a context of human-machine dialogue.\nClassically, SLU tasks were processed through a cascade approach that consists\nin applying, firstly, an automatic speech recognition process, followed by a\nnatural language processing module applied to the automatic transcriptions.\nThese three last years, end-to-end neural approaches, based on deep neural\nnetworks, have been proposed in order to directly extract the semantics from\nspeech signal, by using a single neural model. More recent works on\nself-supervised training with unlabeled data open new perspectives in term of\nperformance for automatic speech recognition and natural language processing.\nIn this paper, we present a brief overview of the recent advances on the French\nMEDIA benchmark dataset for SLU, with or without the use of additional data. We\nalso present our last results that significantly outperform the current\nstate-of-the-art with a Concept Error Rate (CER) of 11.2%, instead of 13.6% for\nthe last state-of-the-art system presented this year.",

          "description": "Recent advances in transformers have enabled Table Question Answering (Table\nQA) systems to achieve high accuracy and SOTA results on open domain datasets\nlike WikiTableQuestions and WikiSQL. Such transformers are frequently\npre-trained on open-domain content such as Wikipedia, where they effectively\nencode questions and corresponding tables from Wikipedia as seen in Table QA\ndataset. However, web tables in Wikipedia are notably flat in their layout,\nwith the first row as the sole column header. The layout lends to a relational\nview of tables where each row is a tuple. Whereas, tables in domain-specific\nbusiness or scientific documents often have a much more complex layout,\nincluding hierarchical row and column headers, in addition to having\nspecialized vocabulary terms from that domain.\n\nTo address this problem, we introduce the domain-specific Table QA dataset\nAIT-QA (Airline Industry Table QA). The dataset consists of 515 questions\nauthored by human annotators on 116 tables extracted from public U.S. SEC\nfilings (publicly available at: https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml) of major\nairline companies for the fiscal years 2017-2019. We also provide annotations\npertaining to the nature of questions, marking those that require hierarchical\nheaders, domain-specific terminology, and paraphrased forms. Our zero-shot\nbaseline evaluation of three transformer-based SOTA Table QA methods - TaPAS\n(end-to-end), TaBERT (semantic parsing-based), and RCI (row-column\nencoding-based) - clearly exposes the limitation of these methods in this\npractical setting, with the best accuracy at just 51.8\\% (RCI). We also present\npragmatic table preprocessing steps used to pivot and project these complex\ntables into a layout suitable for the SOTA Table QA models.",

Previous\nwork explored how embeddings can be obtained in zero-resource settings where no\nlabelled data is available in the target language. The current best approach\nuses transfer learning: a single supervised multilingual model is trained using\nlabelled data from multiple well-resourced languages and then applied to a\ntarget zero-resource language (without fine-tuning). However, it is still\nunclear how the specific choice of training languages affect downstream\nperformance. Concretely, here we ask whether it is beneficial to use training\nlanguages related to the target. Using data from eleven languages spoken in\nSouthern Africa, we experiment with adding data from different language\nfamilies while controlling for the amount of data per language. In word\ndiscrimination and query-by-example search evaluations, we show that training\non languages from the same family gives large improvements.

          "description": "OBJECTIVE: Leverage existing biomedical NLP tools and DS domain terminology\nto produce a novel and comprehensive knowledge graph containing dietary\nsupplement (DS) information for discovering interactions between DS and drugs,\nor Drug-Supplement Interactions (DSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created\nSemRepDS (an extension of SemRep), capable of extracting semantic relations\nfrom abstracts by leveraging a DS-specific terminology (iDISK) containing\n28,884 DS terms not found in the UMLS. PubMed abstracts were processed using\nSemRepDS to generate semantic relations, which were then filtered using a\nPubMedBERT-based model to remove incorrect relations before generating our\nknowledge graph (SuppKG). Two pathways are used to identify potential DS-Drug\ninteractions which are then evaluated by medical professionals for mechanistic\nplausibility. RESULTS: Comparison analysis found that SemRepDS returned 206.9%\nmore DS relations and 158.5% more DS entities than SemRep. The fine-tuned BERT\nmodel obtained an F1 score of 0.8605 and removed 43.86% of the relations,\nimproving the precision of the relations by 26.4% compared to pre-filtering.\nSuppKG consists of 2,928 DS-specific nodes. Manual review of findings\nidentified 44 (88%) proposed DS-Gene-Drug and 32 (64%) proposed\nDS-Gene1-Function-Gene2-Drug pathways to be mechanistically plausible.\nDISCUSSION: The additional relations extracted using SemRepDS generated SuppKG\nthat was used to find plausible DSI not found in the current literature. By the\nnature of the SuppKG, these interactions are unlikely to have been found using\nSemRep without the expanded DS terminology. CONCLUSION: We successfully extend\nSemRep to include DS information and produce SuppKG which can be used to find\npotential DS-Drug interactions.",

Its main goal is to reduce\nthe performance drops occurring when a speech translation model trained on\nmanually segmented data (i.e. an ideal, sentence-like segmentation) is\nevaluated on automatically segmented audio (i.e. actual, more realistic testing\nconditions). For the same purpose, a custom hybrid segmentation procedure that\naccounts for both audio content (pauses) and for the length of the produced\nsegments is applied to the test data before passing them to the system. At\ninference time, we compared this procedure with a baseline segmentation method\nbased on Voice Activity Detection (VAD).

          "description": "Despite rapid developments in the field of machine learning research,\ncollecting high-quality labels for supervised learning remains a bottleneck for\nmany applications. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that\nstate-of-the-art models for NLP tasks are becoming deeper and more complex,\noften increasing the amount of training data required even for fine-tuning.\nWeak supervision methods, including data programming, address this problem and\nreduce the cost of label collection by using noisy label sources for\nsupervision. However, until recently, data programming was only accessible to\nusers who knew how to program. To bridge this gap, the Data Programming by\nDemonstration framework was proposed to facilitate the automatic creation of\nlabeling functions based on a few examples labeled by a domain expert. This\nframework has proven successful for generating high-accuracy labeling models\nfor document classification. In this work, we extend the DPBD framework to\nspan-level annotation tasks, arguably one of the most time-consuming NLP\nlabeling tasks. We built a novel tool, TagRuler, that makes it easy for\nannotators to build span-level labeling functions without programming and\nencourages them to explore trade-offs between different labeling models and\nactive learning strategies. We empirically demonstrated that an annotator could\nachieve a higher F1 score using the proposed tool compared to manual labeling\nfor different span-level annotation tasks.",

          "description": "Service manual documents are crucial to the engineering company as they\nprovide guidelines and knowledge to service engineers. However, it has become\ninconvenient and inefficient for service engineers to retrieve specific\nknowledge from documents due to the complexity of resources. In this research,\nwe propose an automated knowledge mining and document classification system\nwith novel multi-model transfer learning approaches. Particularly, the\nclassification performance of the system has been improved with three effective\ntechniques: fine-tuning, pruning, and multi-model method. The fine-tuning\ntechnique optimizes a pre-trained BERT model by adding a feed-forward neural\nnetwork layer and the pruning technique is used to retrain the BERT model with\nnew data. The multi-model method initializes and trains multiple BERT models to\novercome the randomness of data ordering during the fine-tuning process. In the\nfirst iteration of the training process, multiple BERT models are being trained\nsimultaneously. The best model is then selected for the next phase of the\ntraining process with another two iterations and the training processes for\nother BERT models will be terminated. The performance of the proposed system\nhas been evaluated by comparing with two robust baseline methods, BERT and\nBERT-CNN. Experimental results on a widely used Corpus of Linguistic\nAcceptability (CoLA) dataset have shown that the proposed techniques perform\nbetter than these baseline methods in terms of accuracy and MCC score.",

We start with a rich word embedding\npre-trained from a large general dataset, which is then augmented with\nembeddings learned from a much smaller and more specific domain dataset through\na simple non-linear mapping mechanism. We also experimented with several other\nmore sophisticated methods of such mapping including, several auto-encoder\nbased and custom loss-function based methods that learn embedding\nrepresentations through gradually learning to be close to the words of similar\nsemantics and distant to dissimilar semantics. Our strengthened representations\nbetter capture the semantics of the depression domain, as it combines the\nsemantics learned from the specific domain coupled with word coverage from the\ngeneral language. We also present a comparative performance analyses of our\nword embedding representations with a simple bag-of-words model, well known\nsentiment and psycholinguistic lexicons, and a general pre-trained word\nembedding. When used as feature representations for several different machine\nlearning methods, including deep learning models in a depressive Tweets\nidentification task, we show that our augmented word embedding representations\nachieve a significantly better F1 score than the others, specially when applied\nto a high quality dataset.

Leveraging\nextraneous user-item information proves essential to mitigate the sparsity\nissue, for which we exploit the natural language signals from the users' query\nand the contextual knowledge from the products.

          "description": "State-of-the-art models in natural language processing rely on separate rigid\nsubword tokenization algorithms, which limit their generalization ability and\nadaptation to new settings. In this paper, we propose a new model inductive\nbias that learns a subword tokenization end-to-end as part of the model. To\nthis end, we introduce a soft gradient-based subword tokenization module (GBST)\nthat automatically learns latent subword representations from characters in a\ndata-driven fashion. Concretely, GBST enumerates candidate subword blocks and\nlearns to score them in a position-wise fashion using a block scoring network.\nWe additionally introduce Charformer, a deep Transformer model that integrates\nGBST and operates on the byte level. Via extensive experiments on English GLUE,\nmultilingual, and noisy text datasets, we show that Charformer outperforms a\nseries of competitive byte-level baselines while generally performing on par\nand sometimes outperforming subword-based models. Additionally, Charformer is\nfast, improving the speed of both vanilla byte-level and subword-level\nTransformers by 28%-100% while maintaining competitive quality.

          "description": "The clinical named entity recognition (CNER) task seeks to locate and\nclassify clinical terminologies into predefined categories, such as diagnostic\nprocedure, disease disorder, severity, medication, medication dosage, and sign\nsymptom. CNER facilitates the study of side-effect on medications including\nidentification of novel phenomena and human-focused information extraction.\nExisting approaches in extracting the entities of interests focus on using\nstatic word embeddings to represent each word. However, one word can have\ndifferent interpretations that depend on the context of the sentences.\nEvidently, static word embeddings are insufficient to integrate the diverse\ninterpretation of a word. To overcome this challenge, the technique of\ncontextualized word embedding has been introduced to better capture the\nsemantic meaning of each word based on its context. Two of these language\nmodels, ELMo and Flair, have been widely used in the field of Natural Language\nProcessing to generate the contextualized word embeddings on domain-generic\ndocuments. However, these embeddings are usually too general to capture the\nproximity among vocabularies of specific domains. To facilitate various\ndownstream applications using clinical case reports (CCRs), we pre-train two\ndeep contextualized language models, Clinical Embeddings from Language Model\n(C-ELMo) and Clinical Contextual String Embeddings (C-Flair) using the\nclinical-related corpus from the PubMed Central.

It aims at suggesting the next\nPOI to a user in spatial and temporal context, which is a practical yet\nchallenging task in various applications. Existing approaches mainly model the\nspatial and temporal information, and memorize historical patterns through\nuser's trajectories for recommendation.

In this paper, we propose an attention-based\nsequence-to-sequence generative model, namely POI-Augmentation Seq2Seq\n(PA-Seq2Seq), to address the sparsity of training set by making check-in\nrecords to be evenly-spaced. Specifically, the encoder summarises each check-in\nsequence and the decoder predicts the possible missing check-ins based on the\nencoded information. In order to learn time-aware correlation among user\nhistory, we employ local attention mechanism to help the decoder focus on a\nspecific range of context information when predicting a certain missing\ncheck-in point.

          "description": "Robust recommendation aims at capturing true preference of users from noisy\ndata, for which there are two lines of methods have been proposed. One is based\non noise injection, and the other is to adopt the generative model Variational\nAuto-encoder (VAE). However, the existing works still face two challenges.\nFirst, the noise injection based methods often draw the noise from a fixed\nnoise distribution given in advance, while in real world, the noise\ndistributions of different users and items may differ from each other due to\npersonal behaviors and item usage patterns. Second, the VAE based models are\nnot expressive enough to capture the true preference since VAE often yields an\nembedding space of a single modal, while in real world, user-item interactions\nusually exhibit multi-modality on user preference distribution. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel model called Dual Adversarial Variational Embedding (DAVE)\nfor robust recommendation, which can provide personalized noise reduction for\ndifferent users and items, and capture the multi-modality of the embedding\nspace, by combining the advantages of VAE and adversarial training between the\nintroduced auxiliary discriminators and the variational inference networks.

However, existing work mainly models\ncheck-in data as isolated POI sequences, neglecting the crucial collaborative\nsignals from cross-sequence check-in information. Furthermore, the sparse\nPOI-POI transitions restrict the ability of a model to learn effective\nsequential patterns for recommendation. In this paper, we propose\nSequence-to-Graph (Seq2Graph) augmentation for each POI sequence, allowing\ncollaborative signals to be propagated from correlated POIs belonging to other\nsequences.

To overcome the sparsity of POI-level\ninteractions, we further infuse category-awareness into SGRec with a multi-task\nlearning scheme that captures the denser category-wise transitions. As such,\nSGRec makes full use of the collaborative signals for learning expressive POI\nrepresentations, and also comprehensively uncovers multi-level sequential\npatterns for user preference modelling.

All extractive\nsub-summaries are later combined to generate a summary for any given source\ndocument. We utilize the lesser used and challenging WikiHow dataset in our\napproach to text summarization. This dataset is unlike the commonly used news\ndatasets which are available for text summarization. The well-known news\ndatasets present their most important information in the first few lines of\ntheir source texts, which make their summarization a lesser challenging task\nwhen compared to summarizing the WikiHow dataset.

          "description": "As a new type of e-commerce platform developed in recent years, local\nconsumer service platform provides users with software to consume service to\nthe nearby store or to the home, such as Groupon and Koubei. Different from\nother common e-commerce platforms, the behavior of users on the local consumer\nservice platform is closely related to their real-time local context\ninformation. Therefore, building a context-aware user behavior prediction\nsystem is able to provide both merchants and users better service in local\nconsumer service platforms. However, most of the previous work just treats the\ncontextual information as an ordinary feature into the prediction model to\nobtain the prediction list under a specific context, which ignores the fact\nthat the interest of a user in different contexts is often significantly\ndifferent. Hence, in this paper, we propose a context-aware heterogeneous graph\nattention network (CHGAT) to dynamically generate the representation of the\nuser and to estimate the probability for future behavior. Specifically, we\nfirst construct the meta-path based heterogeneous graphs with the historical\nbehaviors from multiple sources and comprehend heterogeneous vertices in the\ngraph with a novel unified knowledge representing approach. Next, a multi-level\nattention mechanism is introduced for context-aware aggregation with graph\nvertices, which contains the vertex-level attention network and the path-level\nattention network. Both of them aim to capture the semantic correlation between\ninformation contained in the graph and the outside real-time contextual\ninformation in the search system. Then the model proposed in this paper\naggregates specific graphs with their corresponding context features and\nobtains the representation of user interest under a specific context and input\nit into the prediction network to finally obtain the predicted probability of\nuser behavior.",

          "description": "With the development of blockchain technologies, the number of smart\ncontracts deployed on blockchain platforms is growing exponentially, which\nmakes it difficult for users to find desired services by manual screening. The\nautomatic classification of smart contracts can provide blockchain users with\nkeyword-based contract searching and helps to manage smart contracts\neffectively. Current research on smart contract classification focuses on\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) solutions which are based on contract source\ncode. However, more than 94% of smart contracts are not open-source, so the\napplication scenarios of NLP methods are very limited. Meanwhile, NLP models\nare vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a classification\nmodel based on features from contract bytecode instead of source code to solve\nthese problems. We also use feature selection and ensemble learning to optimize\nthe model. Our experimental studies on over 3,300 real-world Ethereum smart\ncontracts show that our model can classify smart contracts without source code\nand has better performance than baseline models. Our model also has good\nresistance to adversarial attacks compared with NLP-based models. In addition,\nour analysis reveals that account features used in many smart contract\nclassification models have little effect on classification and can be excluded.",

          "description": "In quantum private information retrieval (QPIR), a user retrieves a classical\nfile from multiple servers by downloading quantum systems without revealing the\nidentity of the file. The QPIR capacity is the maximal achievable ratio of the\nretrieved file size to the total download size. In this paper, the capacity of\nQPIR from MDS-coded and colluding servers is studied. Two classes of QPIR,\ncalled stabilizer QPIR and dimension squared QPIR induced from classical\nstrongly linear PIR are defined, and the related QPIR capacities are derived.\nFor the non-colluding case, the general QPIR capacity is derived when the\nnumber of files goes to infinity. The capacities of symmetric and non-symmetric\nQPIR with coded and colluding servers are proved to coincide, being double to\ntheir classical counterparts. A general statement on the converse bound for\nQPIR with coded and colluding servers is derived showing that the capacities of\nstabilizer QPIR and dimension squared QPIR induced from any class of PIR are\nupper bounded by twice the classical capacity of the respective PIR class. The\nproposed capacity-achieving scheme combines the star-product scheme by\nFreij-Hollanti et al. and the stabilizer QPIR scheme by Song et al. by\nemploying (weakly) self-dual Reed--Solomon codes.",

          "description": "Thanks to their scalability, two-stage recommenders are used by many of\ntoday's largest online platforms, including YouTube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.\nThese systems produce recommendations in two steps: (i) multiple nominators --\ntuned for low prediction latency -- preselect a small subset of candidates from\nthe whole item pool; (ii)~a slower but more accurate ranker further narrows\ndown the nominated items, and serves to the user. Despite their popularity, the\nliterature on two-stage recommenders is relatively scarce, and the algorithms\nare often treated as the sum of their parts. Such treatment presupposes that\nthe two-stage performance is explained by the behavior of individual components\nif they were deployed independently. This is not the case: using synthetic and\nreal-world data, we demonstrate that interactions between the ranker and the\nnominators substantially affect the overall performance. Motivated by these\nfindings, we derive a generalization lower bound which shows that careful\nchoice of each nominator's training set is sometimes the only difference\nbetween a poor and an optimal two-stage recommender. Since searching for a good\nchoice manually is difficult, we learn one instead. In particular, using a\nMixture-of-Experts approach, we train the nominators (experts) to specialize on\ndifferent subsets of the item pool. This significantly improves performance.",

          "description": "Knowledge graph embedding research has mainly focused on the two smallest\nnormed division algebras, $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{C}$. Recent results suggest\nthat trilinear products of quaternion-valued embeddings can be a more effective\nmeans to tackle link prediction. In addition, models based on convolutions on\nreal-valued embeddings often yield state-of-the-art results for link\nprediction. In this paper, we investigate a composition of convolution\noperations with hypercomplex multiplications. We propose the four approaches\nQMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO to tackle the link prediction problem. QMult and\nOMult can be considered as quaternion and octonion extensions of previous\nstate-of-the-art approaches, including DistMult and ComplEx. ConvQ and ConvO\nbuild upon QMult and OMult by including convolution operations in a way\ninspired by the residual learning framework. We evaluated our approaches on\nseven link prediction datasets including WN18RR, FB15K-237 and YAGO3-10.\nExperimental results suggest that the benefits of learning hypercomplex-valued\nvector representations become more apparent as the size and complexity of the\nknowledge graph grows. ConvO outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on\nFB15K-237 in MRR, Hit@1 and Hit@3, while QMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO\noutperform state-of-the-approaches on YAGO3-10 in all metrics. Results also\nsuggest that link prediction performances can be further improved via\nprediction averaging. To foster reproducible research, we provide an\nopen-source implementation of approaches, including training and evaluation\nscripts as well as pretrained models.",

Previous researchers found that by using\nthe information extracted from these reviews, we can better profile the users'\nexplicit preferences as well as the item features, leading to the improvement\nof recommendation performance. However, most of the previous algorithms were\nonly utilizing the review information for explicit-feedback problem i.e. rating\nprediction, and when it comes to implicit-feedback ranking problem such as\ntop-N recommendation, the usage of review information has not been fully\nexplored.

We find that models utilizing only review\ninformation can not achieve better performances than vanilla implicit-feedback\nmatrix factorization method.

          "description": "Sequential recommendation aims to leverage users' historical behaviors to\npredict their next interaction. Existing works have not yet addressed two main\nchallenges in sequential recommendation. First, user behaviors in their rich\nhistorical sequences are often implicit and noisy preference signals, they\ncannot sufficiently reflect users' actual preferences. In addition, users'\ndynamic preferences often change rapidly over time, and hence it is difficult\nto capture user patterns in their historical sequences. In this work, we\npropose a graph neural network model called SURGE (short for SeqUential\nRecommendation with Graph neural nEtworks) to address these two issues.\nSpecifically, SURGE integrates different types of preferences in long-term user\nbehaviors into clusters in the graph by re-constructing loose item sequences\ninto tight item-item interest graphs based on metric learning. This helps\nexplicitly distinguish users' core interests, by forming dense clusters in the\ninterest graph. Then, we perform cluster-aware and query-aware graph\nconvolutional propagation and graph pooling on the constructed graph. It\ndynamically fuses and extracts users' current activated core interests from\nnoisy user behavior sequences. We conduct extensive experiments on both public\nand proprietary industrial datasets. Experimental results demonstrate\nsignificant performance gains of our proposed method compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods. Further studies on sequence length confirm that our\nmethod can model long behavioral sequences effectively and efficiently.",

In this paper, we propose a model, \\textbf{SSI}, to improve\nsequential recommendation consistency with Self-Supervised Imitation.\nPrecisely, we extract the consistency knowledge by utilizing three\nself-supervised pre-training tasks, where temporal consistency and persona\nconsistency capture user-interaction dynamics in terms of the chronological\norder and persona sensitivities, respectively. Furthermore, to provide the\nmodel with a global perspective, global session consistency is introduced by\nmaximizing the mutual information among global and local interaction sequences.\nFinally, to comprehensively take advantage of all three independent aspects of\nconsistency-enhanced knowledge, we establish an integrated imitation learning\nframework. The consistency knowledge is effectively internalized and\ntransferred to the student model by imitating the conventional prediction logit\nas well as the consistency-enhanced item representations. In addition, the\nflexible self-supervised imitation framework can also benefit other student\nrecommenders.

          "description": "Multimodal sentiment analysis benefits various applications such as\nhuman-computer interaction and recommendation systems. It aims to infer the\nusers' bipolar ideas using visual, textual, and acoustic signals. Although\nresearchers affirm the association between cognitive cues and emotional\nmanifestations, most of the current multimodal approaches in sentiment analysis\ndisregard user-specific aspects. To tackle this issue, we devise a novel method\nto perform multimodal sentiment prediction using cognitive cues, such as\npersonality. Our framework constructs an adaptive tree by hierarchically\ndividing users and trains the LSTM-based submodels, utilizing an\nattention-based fusion to transfer cognitive-oriented knowledge within the\ntree. Subsequently, the framework consumes the conclusive agglomerative\nknowledge from the adaptive tree to predict final sentiments. We also devise a\ndynamic dropout method to facilitate data sharing between neighboring nodes,\nreducing data sparsity. The empirical results on real-world datasets determine\nthat our proposed model for sentiment prediction can surpass trending rivals.\nMoreover, compared to other ensemble approaches, the proposed transfer-based\nalgorithm can better utilize the latent cognitive cues and foster the\nprediction outcomes. Based on the given extrinsic and intrinsic analysis\nresults, we note that compared to other theoretical-based techniques, the\nproposed hierarchical clustering approach can better group the users within the\nadaptive tree.",

          "description": "In large technology companies, the requirements for managing and organizing\ntechnical documents created by engineers and managers in supporting relevant\ndecision making have increased dramatically in recent years, which has led to a\nhigher demand for more scalable, accurate, and automated document\nclassification. Prior studies have primarily focused on processing text for\nclassification and small-scale databases. This paper describes a novel\nmultimodal deep learning architecture, called TechDoc, for technical document\nclassification, which utilizes both natural language and descriptive images to\ntrain hierarchical classifiers. The architecture synthesizes convolutional\nneural networks and recurrent neural networks through an integrated training\nprocess. We applied the architecture to a large multimodal technical document\ndatabase and trained the model for classifying documents based on the\nhierarchical International Patent Classification system. Our results show that\nthe trained neural network presents a greater classification accuracy than\nthose using a single modality and several earlier text classification methods.\nThe trained model can potentially be scaled to millions of real-world technical\ndocuments with both text and figures, which is useful for data and knowledge\nmanagement in large technology companies and organizations.",

          "description": "One key property in recommender systems is the long-tail distribution in\nuser-item interactions where most items only have few user feedback. Improving\nthe recommendation of tail items can promote novelty and bring positive effects\nto both users and providers, and thus is a desirable property of recommender\nsystems. Current novel recommendation studies over-emphasize the importance of\ntail items without differentiating the degree of users' intent on popularity\nand often incur a sharp decline of accuracy. Moreover, none of existing methods\nhas ever taken the extreme case of tail items, i.e., cold-start items without\nany interaction, into consideration.\n\nIn this work, we first disclose the mechanism that drives a user's\ninteraction towards popular or niche items by disentangling her intent into\nconformity influence (popularity) and personal interests (preference). We then\npresent a unified end-to-end framework to simultaneously optimize accuracy and\nnovelty targets based on the disentangled intent of popularity and that of\npreference. We further develop a new paradigm for novel recommendation of\ncold-start items which exploits the self-supervised learning technique to model\nthe correlation between collaborative features and content features. We conduct\nextensive experimental results on three real-world datasets.

          "description": "Considering the impact of recommendations on item providers is one of the\nduties of multi-sided recommender systems. Item providers are key stakeholders\nin online platforms, and their earnings and plans are influenced by the\nexposure their items receive in recommended lists. Prior work showed that\ncertain minority groups of providers, characterized by a common sensitive\nattribute (e.g., gender or race), are being disproportionately affected by\nindirect and unintentional discrimination. Our study in this paper handles a\nsituation where ($i$) the same provider is associated with multiple items of a\nlist suggested to a user, ($ii$) an item is created by more than one provider\njointly, and ($iii$) predicted user-item relevance scores are biasedly\nestimated for items of provider groups. Under this scenario, we assess\ndisparities in relevance, visibility, and exposure, by simulating diverse\nrepresentations of the minority group in the catalog and the interactions.\nBased on emerged unfair outcomes, we devise a treatment that combines\nobservation upsampling and loss regularization, while learning user-item\nrelevance scores. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our treatment\nleads to lower disparate relevance. The resulting recommended lists show fairer\nvisibility and exposure, higher minority item coverage, and negligible loss in\nrecommendation utility.",

The system\nexploits the recent state-of-the-art Chinese pretrained language model, namely\nEnhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration (ERNIE), which\nfacilitates the system with expressive semantic matching. In particular, we\ndeveloped an ERNIE-based retrieval model, which is equipped with 1) expressive\nTransformer-based semantic encoders, and 2) a comprehensive multi-stage\ntraining paradigm.

Eventually, the system is fully\ndeployed into production, where rigorous offline and online experiments were\nconducted.

          "description": "As the heart of a search engine, the ranking system plays a crucial role in\nsatisfying users' information demands. More recently, neural rankers fine-tuned\nfrom pre-trained language models (PLMs) establish state-of-the-art ranking\neffectiveness. However, it is nontrivial to directly apply these PLM-based\nrankers to the large-scale web search system due to the following challenging\nissues:(1) the prohibitively expensive computations of massive neural PLMs,\nespecially for long texts in the web-document, prohibit their deployments in an\nonline ranking system that demands extremely low latency;(2) the discrepancy\nbetween existing ranking-agnostic pre-training objectives and the ad-hoc\nretrieval scenarios that demand comprehensive relevance modeling is another\nmain barrier for improving the online ranking system;(3) a real-world search\nengine typically involves a committee of ranking components, and thus the\ncompatibility of the individually fine-tuned ranking model is critical for a\ncooperative ranking system. In this work, we contribute a series of\nsuccessfully applied techniques in tackling these exposed issues when deploying\nthe state-of-the-art Chinese pre-trained language model, i.e., ERNIE, in the\nonline search engine system. We first articulate a novel practice to\ncost-efficiently summarize the web document and contextualize the resultant\nsummary content with the query using a cheap yet powerful Pyramid-ERNIE\narchitecture. Then we endow an innovative paradigm to finely exploit the\nlarge-scale noisy and biased post-click behavioral data for relevance-oriented\npre-training. We also propose a human-anchored fine-tuning strategy tailored\nfor the online ranking system, aiming to stabilize the ranking signals across\nvarious online components. Extensive offline and online experimental results\nshow that the proposed techniques significantly boost the search engine's\nperformance.",

          "description": "Fairness in recommendation has attracted increasing attention due to bias and\ndiscrimination possibly caused by traditional recommenders.

          "description": "The abundant sequential documents such as online archival, social media and\nnews feeds are streamingly updated, where each chunk of documents is\nincorporated with smoothly evolving yet dependent topics. Such digital texts\nhave attracted extensive research on dynamic topic modeling to infer hidden\nevolving topics and their temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing\napproaches focus on single-topic-thread evolution and ignore the fact that a\ncurrent topic may be coupled with multiple relevant prior topics. In addition,\nthese approaches also incur the intractable inference problem when inferring\nlatent parameters, resulting in a high computational cost and performance\ndegradation. In this work, we assume that a current topic evolves from all\nprior topics with corresponding coupling weights, forming the\nmulti-topic-thread evolution. Our method models the dependencies between\nevolving topics and thoroughly encodes their complex multi-couplings across\ntime steps. To conquer the intractable inference challenge, a new solution with\na set of novel data augmentation techniques is proposed, which successfully\ndiscomposes the multi-couplings between evolving topics. A fully conjugate\nmodel is thus obtained to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency of the\ninference technique. A novel Gibbs sampler with a backward-forward filter\nalgorithm efficiently learns latent timeevolving parameters in a closed-form.\nIn addition, the latent Indian Buffet Process (IBP) compound distribution is\nexploited to automatically infer the overall topic number and customize the\nsparse topic proportions for each sequential document without bias. The\nproposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets against\nthe competitive baselines, demonstrating its superiority over the baselines in\nterms of the low per-word perplexity, high coherent topics, and better document\ntime prediction.",

Current\nmethods typically propose either: (i) fine-grained approaches employing\nspatio-temporal representations and similarity calculations, achieving high\nperformance at a high computational cost or (ii) coarse-grained approaches\nrepresenting/indexing videos as global vectors, where the spatio-temporal\nstructure is lost, providing low performance but also having low computational\ncost. In this work, we propose a Knowledge Distillation framework, which we\ncall Distill-and-Select (DnS), that starting from a well-performing\nfine-grained Teacher Network learns: a) Student Networks at different retrieval\nperformance and computational efficiency trade-offs and b) a Selection Network\nthat at test time rapidly directs samples to the appropriate student to\nmaintain both high retrieval performance and high computational efficiency. We\ntrain several students with different architectures and arrive at different\ntrade-offs of performance and efficiency, i.e., speed and storage requirements,\nincluding fine-grained students that store index videos using binary\nrepresentations. Importantly, the proposed scheme allows Knowledge Distillation\nin large, unlabelled datasets -- this leads to good students. We evaluate DnS\non five public datasets on three different video retrieval tasks and\ndemonstrate a) that our students achieve state-of-the-art performance in\nseveral cases and b) that our DnS framework provides an excellent trade-off\nbetween retrieval performance, computational speed, and storage space. In\nspecific configurations, our method achieves similar mAP with the teacher but\nis 20 times faster and requires 240 times less storage space.

          "description": "Service manual documents are crucial to the engineering company as they\nprovide guidelines and knowledge to service engineers. However, it has become\ninconvenient and inefficient for service engineers to retrieve specific\nknowledge from documents due to the complexity of resources. In this research,\nwe propose an automated knowledge mining and document classification system\nwith novel multi-model transfer learning approaches. Particularly, the\nclassification performance of the system has been improved with three effective\ntechniques: fine-tuning, pruning, and multi-model method. The fine-tuning\ntechnique optimizes a pre-trained BERT model by adding a feed-forward neural\nnetwork layer and the pruning technique is used to retrain the BERT model with\nnew data. The multi-model method initializes and trains multiple BERT models to\novercome the randomness of data ordering during the fine-tuning process. In the\nfirst iteration of the training process, multiple BERT models are being trained\nsimultaneously. The best model is then selected for the next phase of the\ntraining process with another two iterations and the training processes for\nother BERT models will be terminated. The performance of the proposed system\nhas been evaluated by comparing with two robust baseline methods, BERT and\nBERT-CNN. Experimental results on a widely used Corpus of Linguistic\nAcceptability (CoLA) dataset have shown that the proposed techniques perform\nbetter than these baseline methods in terms of accuracy and MCC score.",

          "description": "OBJECTIVE: Leverage existing biomedical NLP tools and DS domain terminology\nto produce a novel and comprehensive knowledge graph containing dietary\nsupplement (DS) information for discovering interactions between DS and drugs,\nor Drug-Supplement Interactions (DSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created\nSemRepDS (an extension of SemRep), capable of extracting semantic relations\nfrom abstracts by leveraging a DS-specific terminology (iDISK) containing\n28,884 DS terms not found in the UMLS. PubMed abstracts were processed using\nSemRepDS to generate semantic relations, which were then filtered using a\nPubMedBERT-based model to remove incorrect relations before generating our\nknowledge graph (SuppKG). Two pathways are used to identify potential DS-Drug\ninteractions which are then evaluated by medical professionals for mechanistic\nplausibility. RESULTS: Comparison analysis found that SemRepDS returned 206.9%\nmore DS relations and 158.5% more DS entities than SemRep. The fine-tuned BERT\nmodel obtained an F1 score of 0.8605 and removed 43.86% of the relations,\nimproving the precision of the relations by 26.4% compared to pre-filtering.\nSuppKG consists of 2,928 DS-specific nodes. Manual review of findings\nidentified 44 (88%) proposed DS-Gene-Drug and 32 (64%) proposed\nDS-Gene1-Function-Gene2-Drug pathways to be mechanistically plausible.\nDISCUSSION: The additional relations extracted using SemRepDS generated SuppKG\nthat was used to find plausible DSI not found in the current literature. By the\nnature of the SuppKG, these interactions are unlikely to have been found using\nSemRep without the expanded DS terminology. CONCLUSION: We successfully extend\nSemRep to include DS information and produce SuppKG which can be used to find\npotential DS-Drug interactions.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of semantic matching in product search: given a\ncustomer query, retrieve all semantically related products from a huge catalog\nof size 100 million, or more. Because of large catalog spaces and real-time\nlatency constraints, semantic matching algorithms not only desire high recall\nbut also need to have low latency. Conventional lexical matching approaches\n(e.g., Okapi-BM25) exploit inverted indices to achieve fast inference time, but\nfail to capture behavioral signals between queries and products. In contrast,\nembedding-based models learn semantic representations from customer behavior\ndata, but the performance is often limited by shallow neural encoders due to\nlatency constraints. Semantic product search can be viewed as an eXtreme\nMulti-label Classification (XMC) problem, where customer queries are input\ninstances and products are output labels. In this paper, we aim to improve\nsemantic product search by using tree-based XMC models where inference time\ncomplexity is logarithmic in the number of products. We consider hierarchical\nlinear models with n-gram features for fast real-time inference.\nQuantitatively, our method maintains a low latency of 1.25 milliseconds per\nquery and achieves a 65% improvement of Recall@100 (60.9% v.s. 36.8%) over a\ncompeting embedding-based DSSM model. Our model is robust to weight pruning\nwith varying thresholds, which can flexibly meet different system requirements\nfor online deployments. Qualitatively, our method can retrieve products that\nare complementary to existing product search system and add diversity to the\nmatch set.",

We show that such algorithms induce a particular\nkind of stereotyping: if preferences for a \\textit{set} of items are\nanti-correlated in the general user population, then those items may not be\nrecommended together to a user, regardless of that user's preferences and\nratings history. First, we introduce a notion of \\textit{joint accessibility},\nwhich measures the extent to which a set of items can jointly be accessed by\nusers. We then study joint accessibility under the standard factorization-based\ncollaborative filtering framework, and provide theoretical necessary and\nsufficient conditions when joint accessibility is violated. Moreover, we show\nthat these conditions can easily be violated when the users are represented by\na single feature vector. To improve joint accessibility, we further propose an\nalternative modelling fix, which is designed to capture the diverse multiple\ninterests of each user using a multi-vector representation.

          "description": "In modern ranking problems, different and disparate representations of the\nitems to be ranked are often available. It is sensible, then, to try to combine\nthese representations to improve ranking. Indeed, learning to rank via\ncombining representations is both principled and practical for learning a\nranking function for a particular query. In extremely data-scarce settings,\nhowever, the amount of labeled data available for a particular query can lead\nto a highly variable and ineffective ranking function. One way to mitigate the\neffect of the small amount of data is to leverage information from semantically\nsimilar queries. Indeed, as we demonstrate in simulation settings and real data\nexamples, when semantically similar queries are available it is possible to\ngainfully use them when ranking with respect to a particular query. We describe\nand explore this phenomenon in the context of the bias-variance trade off and\napply it to the data-scarce settings of a Bing navigational graph and the\nDrosophila larva connectome.",

          "description": "Obesity is known to lower the quality of life substantially. It is often\nassociated with increased chances of non-communicable diseases such as\ndiabetes, cardiovascular problems, different types of cancers, etc. Evidence\nsuggests that diet-related mobile applications play a vital role in assisting\nan individual in making healthier choices and keeping track of food intake.\nHowever, due to an abundance of similar applications, it becomes pertinent to\nevaluate each of them in terms of functionality, usability, and possible design\nissues to truly determine state-of-the-art solutions for the future. Since\nthese applications involve implementing multiple user requirements and\nrecommendations from different dietitians, the evaluation becomes quite\ncomplex. Therefore, this study aims to review existing dietary applications at\nlength to highlight key features and problems that enhance or undermine an\napplication's usability.

          "description": "Hashing plays an important role in information retrieval, due to its low\nstorage and high speed of processing. Among the techniques available in the\nliterature, multi-modal hashing, which can encode heterogeneous multi-modal\nfeatures into compact hash codes, has received particular attention. Most of\nthe existing multi-modal hashing methods adopt the fixed weighting factors to\nfuse multiple modalities for any query data, which cannot capture the variation\nof different queries. Besides, many methods introduce hyper-parameters to\nbalance many regularization terms that make the optimization harder. Meanwhile,\nit is time-consuming and labor-intensive to set proper parameter values. The\nlimitations may significantly hinder their promotion in real applications. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple, yet effective method that is inspired by the\nHadamard matrix. The proposed method captures the multi-modal feature\ninformation in an adaptive manner and preserves the discriminative semantic\ninformation in the hash codes. Our framework is flexible and involves a very\nfew hyper-parameters. Extensive experimental results show the method is\neffective and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.",

          "description": "This paper proposes a novel way of doing audio synthesis at the waveform\nlevel using Transformer architectures. We propose a deep neural network for\ngenerating waveforms, similar to wavenet \\cite{oord2016wavenet}. This is fully\nprobabilistic, auto-regressive, and causal, i.e. each sample generated depends\nonly on the previously observed samples. Our approach outperforms a widely used\nwavenet architecture by up to 9\\% on a similar dataset for predicting the next\nstep. Using the attention mechanism, we enable the architecture to learn which\naudio samples are important for the prediction of the future sample. We show\nhow causal transformer generative models can be used for raw waveform\nsynthesis. We also show that this performance can be improved by another 2\\% by\nconditioning samples over a wider context. The flexibility of the current model\nto synthesize audio from latent representations suggests a large number of\npotential applications. The novel approach of using generative transformer\narchitectures for raw audio synthesis is, however, still far away from\ngenerating any meaningful music, without using latent codes/meta-data to aid\nthe generation process.",

          "description": "In recent years, Word-level Sign Language Recognition (WSLR) research has\ngained popularity in the computer vision community, and thus various approaches\nhave been proposed. Among these approaches, the method using I3D network\nachieves the highest recognition accuracy on large public datasets for WSLR.\nHowever, the method with I3D only utilizes appearance information of the upper\nbody of the signers to recognize sign language words. On the other hand, in\nWSLR, the information of local regions, such as the hand shape and facial\nexpression, and the positional relationship among the body and both hands are\nimportant. Thus in this work, we utilized local region images of both hands and\nface, along with skeletal information to capture local information and the\npositions of both hands relative to the body, respectively. In other words, we\npropose a novel multi-stream WSLR framework, in which a stream with local\nregion images and a stream with skeletal information are introduced by\nextending I3D network to improve the recognition accuracy of WSLR. From the\nexperimental results on WLASL dataset, it is evident that the proposed method\nhas achieved about 15% improvement in the Top-1 accuracy than the existing\nconventional methods.",

Although\nresearchers affirm the association between cognitive cues and emotional\nmanifestations, most of the current multimodal approaches in sentiment analysis\ndisregard user-specific aspects. To tackle this issue, we devise a novel method\nto perform multimodal sentiment prediction using cognitive cues, such as\npersonality. Our framework constructs an adaptive tree by hierarchically\ndividing users and trains the LSTM-based submodels, utilizing an\nattention-based fusion to transfer cognitive-oriented knowledge within the\ntree. Subsequently, the framework consumes the conclusive agglomerative\nknowledge from the adaptive tree to predict final sentiments. We also devise a\ndynamic dropout method to facilitate data sharing between neighboring nodes,\nreducing data sparsity. The empirical results on real-world datasets determine\nthat our proposed model for sentiment prediction can surpass trending rivals.\nMoreover, compared to other ensemble approaches, the proposed transfer-based\nalgorithm can better utilize the latent cognitive cues and foster the\nprediction outcomes.

          "description": "In this paper, we address the text-to-audio grounding issue, namely,\ngrounding the segments of the sound event described by a natural language query\nin the untrimmed audio. This is a newly proposed but challenging audio-language\ntask, since it requires to not only precisely localize all the on- and off-sets\nof the desired segments in the audio, but to perform comprehensive acoustic and\nlinguistic understandings and reason the multimodal interactions between the\naudio and query. To tackle those problems, the existing method treats the query\nholistically as a single unit by a global query representation, which fails to\nhighlight the keywords that contain rich semantics. Besides, this method has\nnot fully exploited interactions between the query and audio. Moreover, since\nthe audio and queries are arbitrary and variable in length, many meaningless\nparts of them are not filtered out in this method, which hinders the grounding\nof the desired segments.\n\nTo this end, we propose a novel Query Graph with Cross-gating Attention\n(QGCA) model, which models the comprehensive relations between the words in\nquery through a novel query graph. Besides, to capture the fine-grained\ninteractions between audio and query, a cross-modal attention module that\nassigns higher weights to the keywords is introduced to generate the\nsnippet-specific query representations. Finally, we also design a cross-gating\nmodule to emphasize the crucial parts as well as weaken the irrelevant ones in\nthe audio and query. We extensively evaluate the proposed QGCA model on the\npublic Audiogrounding dataset with significant improvements over several\nstate-of-the-art methods. Moreover, further ablation study shows the consistent\neffectiveness of different modules in the proposed QGCA model.",

          "description": "Nowadays, most existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) models 1) are\ndeveloped for synthetically-distorted images and often generalize poorly to\nauthentic ones; 2) heavily rely on human ratings, which are prohibitively\nlabor-expensive to collect. Here, we propose an $opinion$-$free$ BIQA method\nthat learns from synthetically-distorted images and multiple agents to assess\nthe perceptual quality of authentically-distorted ones captured in the wild\nwithout relying on human labels. Specifically, we first assemble a large number\nof image pairs from synthetically-distorted images and use a set of\nfull-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) models to assign pseudo-binary\nlabels of each pair indicating which image has higher quality as the\nsupervisory signal. We then train a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nBIQA model to rank the perceptual quality, optimized for consistency with the\nbinary labels. Since there exists domain shift between the synthetically- and\nauthentically-distorted images, an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) module\nis introduced to alleviate this issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed $opinion$-$free$ BIQA model, yielding\nstate-of-the-art performance in terms of correlation with human opinion scores,\nas well as gMAD competition.

They have potential\nto inform public health at scale, however, immersive story design is still in\nearly stages and largely devoid of best practices. This paper presents a focus\ngroup study with 147 viewers of an immersive story about binge drinking\nexperienced through VR headsets and mobile phones. The objective of the study\nis to identify aspects of immersive story design that influence attitudes\ntowards the health issue exhibited, and to understand how health information is\nconsumed in immersive stories. Findings emphasize the need for an immersive\nstory to provide reasoning behind character engagement in the focal health\nbehavior, to show the main character clearly engaging in the behavior, and to\nenable viewers to experience escalating symptoms of the behavior before the\npenultimate health consequence. Findings also show how the design of supporting\ncharacters can inadvertently distract viewers and lead them to justify the\ndetrimental behavior being exhibited.

          "description": "Video represents the majority of internet traffic today leading to a\ncontinuous technological arms race between generating higher quality content,\ntransmitting larger file sizes and supporting network infrastructure. Adding to\nthis is the recent COVID-19 pandemic fueled surge in the use of video\nconferencing tools. Since videos take up substantial bandwidth (~100 Kbps to\nfew Mbps), improved video compression can have a substantial impact on network\nperformance for live and pre-recorded content, providing broader access to\nmultimedia content worldwide. In this work, we present a novel video\ncompression pipeline, called Txt2Vid, which substantially reduces data\ntransmission rates by compressing webcam videos (\"talking-head videos\") to a\ntext transcript. The text is transmitted and decoded into a realistic\nreconstruction of the original video using recent advances in deep learning\nbased voice cloning and lip syncing models. Our generative pipeline achieves\ntwo to three orders of magnitude reduction in the bitrate as compared to the\nstandard audio-video codecs (encoders-decoders), while maintaining equivalent\nQuality-of-Experience based on a subjective evaluation by users (n=242) in an\nonline study.

Feature extraction of multi-modal CS is a key step in CS\nrecognition. Recent supervised deep learning based methods suffer from noisy CS\ndata annotations especially for hand shape modality.

In this work, we propose a\ncross-modal knowledge distillation method with teacher-student structure, which\ntransfers audio speech information to CS to overcome the limited data problem.\nFirstly, we pretrain a teacher model for CS recognition with a large amount of\nopen source audio speech data, and simultaneously pretrain the feature\nextractors for lips and hands using CS data. Then, we distill the knowledge\nfrom teacher model to the student model with frame-level and sequence-level\ndistillation strategies. Importantly, for frame-level, we exploit multi-task\nlearning to weigh losses automatically, to obtain the balance coefficient.\nBesides, we establish a five-speaker British English CS dataset for the first\ntime.

          "description": "In this paper, we address the problem of high performance and computationally\nefficient content-based video retrieval in large-scale datasets. Current\nmethods typically propose either: (i) fine-grained approaches employing\nspatio-temporal representations and similarity calculations, achieving high\nperformance at a high computational cost or (ii) coarse-grained approaches\nrepresenting/indexing videos as global vectors, where the spatio-temporal\nstructure is lost, providing low performance but also having low computational\ncost. In this work, we propose a Knowledge Distillation framework, which we\ncall Distill-and-Select (DnS), that starting from a well-performing\nfine-grained Teacher Network learns: a) Student Networks at different retrieval\nperformance and computational efficiency trade-offs and b) a Selection Network\nthat at test time rapidly directs samples to the appropriate student to\nmaintain both high retrieval performance and high computational efficiency. We\ntrain several students with different architectures and arrive at different\ntrade-offs of performance and efficiency, i.e., speed and storage requirements,\nincluding fine-grained students that store index videos using binary\nrepresentations. Importantly, the proposed scheme allows Knowledge Distillation\nin large, unlabelled datasets -- this leads to good students. We evaluate DnS\non five public datasets on three different video retrieval tasks and\ndemonstrate a) that our students achieve state-of-the-art performance in\nseveral cases and b) that our DnS framework provides an excellent trade-off\nbetween retrieval performance, computational speed, and storage space.

          "description": "Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire has frequently been used for\nefficient depression preliminary screening. However, the uncontrollable\nself-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively\nanswering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered\nHamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically,\nfacial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered\nevaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered\nevaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to\nevidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding\nquestion-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the\nSDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical\nframework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on\nthe questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a\nhierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern\nexploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for\nquestion-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term\nFE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of\neach video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative\ninformation and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity.\nThen, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire\nscores for final depression detection. Our thorough evaluations also show the\nvalidity of fusing SDS evaluation and its video recording, and the superiority\nof our framework to the conventional state-of-the-art temporal modeling\nmethods.",

It is assumed that for a time instant the frames corresponding\nto all views are packed into a single frame, i.e. the frame-compatible approach\nto multiview coding is applied. For such coding scenario, the paper\ndemonstrates that Screen Content Coding can be efficiently used for multiview\nvideo coding. Two approaches are considered: the first using standard HEVC\nScreen Content Coding, and the second using Advanced Screen Content Coding. The\nlatter is the original proposal of the authors that exploits quarter-pel motion\nvectors and other nonstandard extensions of HEVC Screen Content Coding. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that multiview video coding even using\nstandard HEVC Screen Content Coding is much more efficient than simulcast HEVC\ncoding. The proposed Advanced Screen Content Coding provides virtually the same\ncoding efficiency as MV-HEVC, which is the state-of-the-art multiview video\ncompression technique. The authors suggest that Advanced Screen Content Coding\ncan be efficiently used within the new Versatile Video Coding (VVC) technology.\nNevertheless a reference multiview extension of VVC does not exist yet,\ntherefore, for VVC-based coding, the experimental comparisons are left for\nfuture work.",

          "description": "High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) surpasses its predecessors in encoding\nefficiency by introducing new coding tools at the cost of an increased encoding\ntime-complexity.

Each CTU is then divided recursively into a number\nof equally sized square areas, known as Coding Units (CUs). Although this\ndiversity of frame partitioning increases encoding efficiency, it also causes\nan increase in the time complexity due to the increased number of ways to find\nthe optimal partitioning. To address this complexity, numerous algorithms have\nbeen proposed to eliminate unnecessary searches during partitioning CTUs by\nexploiting the correlation in the video. In this paper, existing CTU depth\ndecision algorithms for HEVC are surveyed. These algorithms are categorized\ninto two groups, namely statistics and machine learning approaches. Statistics\napproaches are further subdivided into neighboring and inherent approaches.\nNeighboring approaches exploit the similarity between adjacent CTUs to limit\nthe depth range of the current CTU, while inherent approaches use only the\navailable information within the current CTU. Machine learning approaches try\nto extract and exploit similarities implicitly. Traditional methods like\nsupport vector machines or random forests use manually selected features, while\nrecently proposed deep learning methods extract features during training.\nFinally, this paper discusses extending these methods to more recent video\ncoding formats such as Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and AOMedia Video 1(AV1).",

          "description": "To reduce annotation labor associated with object detection, an increasing\nnumber of studies focus on transferring the learned knowledge from a labeled\nsource domain to another unlabeled target domain. However, existing methods\nassume that the labeled data are sampled from a single source domain, which\nignores a more generalized scenario, where labeled data are from multiple\nsource domains. For the more challenging task, we propose a unified Faster\nR-CNN based framework, termed Divide-and-Merge Spindle Network (DMSN), which\ncan simultaneously enhance domain invariance and preserve discriminative power.\nSpecifically, the framework contains multiple source subnets and a pseudo\ntarget subnet. First, we propose a hierarchical feature alignment strategy to\nconduct strong and weak alignments for low- and high-level features,\nrespectively, considering their different effects for object detection. Second,\nwe develop a novel pseudo subnet learning algorithm to approximate optimal\nparameters of pseudo target subset by weighted combination of parameters in\ndifferent source subnets. Finally, a consistency regularization for region\nproposal network is proposed to facilitate each subnet to learn more abstract\ninvariances. Extensive experiments on different adaptation scenarios\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

          "description": "High resolution images are widely used in our daily life, whereas high-speed\nvideo capture is challenging due to the low frame rate of cameras working at\nthe high resolution mode. Digging deeper, the main bottleneck lies in the low\nthroughput of existing imaging systems. Towards this end, snapshot compressive\nimaging (SCI) was proposed as a promising solution to improve the throughput of\nimaging systems by compressive sampling and computational reconstruction.\nDuring acquisition, multiple high-speed images are encoded and collapsed to a\nsingle measurement. After this, algorithms are employed to retrieve the video\nframes from the coded snapshot. Recently developed Plug-and-Play (PnP)\nalgorithms make it possible for SCI reconstruction in large-scale problems.\nHowever, the lack of high-resolution encoding systems still precludes SCI's\nwide application. In this paper, we build a novel hybrid coded aperture\nsnapshot compressive imaging (HCA-SCI) system by incorporating a dynamic liquid\ncrystal on silicon and a high-resolution lithography mask. We further implement\na PnP reconstruction algorithm with cascaded denoisers for high quality\nreconstruction. Based on the proposed HCA-SCI system and algorithm, we achieve\na 10-mega pixel SCI system to capture high-speed scenes, leading to a high\nthroughput of 4.6G voxels per second. Both simulation and real data experiments\nverify the feasibility and performance of our proposed HCA-SCI scheme.",

          "description": "Acquiring accurate 3D annotated data for hand pose estimation is a\nnotoriously difficult problem. This typically requires complex multi-camera\nsetups and controlled conditions, which in turn creates a domain gap that is\nhard to bridge to fully unconstrained settings. Encouraged by the success of\ncontrastive learning on image classification tasks, we propose a new\nself-supervised method for the structured regression task of 3D hand pose\nestimation. Contrastive learning makes use of unlabeled data for the purpose of\nrepresentation learning via a loss formulation that encourages the learned\nfeature representations to be invariant under any image transformation. For 3D\nhand pose estimation, it too is desirable to have invariance to appearance\ntransformation such as color jitter. However, the task requires equivariance\nunder affine transformations, such as rotation and translation. To address this\nissue, we propose an equivariant contrastive objective and demonstrate its\neffectiveness in the context of 3D hand pose estimation. We experimentally\ninvestigate the impact of invariant and equivariant contrastive objectives and\nshow that learning equivariant features leads to better representations for the\ntask of 3D hand pose estimation. Furthermore, we show that a standard\nResNet-152, trained on additional unlabeled data, attains an improvement of\n$7.6\\%$ in PA-EPE on FreiHAND and thus achieves state-of-the-art performance\nwithout any task specific, specialized architectures.",

          "description": "Self-supervised contrastive learning has demonstrated great potential in\nlearning visual representations. Despite their success on various downstream\ntasks such as image classification and object detection, self-supervised\npre-training for fine-grained scenarios is not fully explored. In this paper,\nwe first point out that current contrastive methods are prone to memorizing\nbackground/foreground texture and therefore have a limitation in localizing the\nforeground object. Analysis suggests that learning to extract discriminative\ntexture information and localization are equally crucial for self-supervised\npre-training under fine-grained scenarios. Based on our findings, we introduce\nCross-view Saliency Alignment (CVSA), a contrastive learning framework that\nfirst crops and swaps saliency regions of images as a novel view generation and\nthen guides the model to localize on the foreground object via a cross-view\nalignment loss. Extensive experiments on four popular fine-grained\nclassification benchmarks show that CVSA significantly improves the learned\nrepresentation.",

Therefore, dynamic fetal MRI, which aims at capturing fetal motion and\ndynamics of fetal function, is limited to fast imaging techniques with\ncompromises in image quality and resolution. Super-resolution for dynamic fetal\nMRI is still a challenge, especially when multi-oriented stacks of image slices\nfor oversampling are not available and high temporal resolution for recording\nthe dynamics of the fetus or placenta is desired.

          "description": "Bilevel optimization recently has attracted increased interest in machine\nlearning due to its many applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and\npolicy optimization. Although some methods recently have been proposed to solve\nthe bilevel problems, these methods do not consider using adaptive learning\nrates. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a class of fast and effective\nadaptive methods for solving bilevel optimization problems that the outer\nproblem is possibly nonconvex and the inner problem is strongly-convex.\nSpecifically, we propose a fast single-loop BiAdam algorithm based on the basic\nmomentum technique, which achieves a sample complexity of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ for finding an $\\epsilon$-stationary point. At the\nsame time, we propose an accelerated version of BiAdam algorithm (VR-BiAdam) by\nusing variance reduced technique, which reaches the best known sample\ncomplexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$. To further reduce computation in\nestimating derivatives, we propose a fast single-loop stochastic approximated\nBiAdam algorithm (saBiAdam) by avoiding the Hessian inverse, which still\nachieves a sample complexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ without large\nbatches. We further present an accelerated version of saBiAdam algorithm\n(VR-saBiAdam), which also reaches the best known sample complexity of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$. We apply the unified adaptive matrices to our\nmethods as the SUPER-ADAM \\citep{huang2021super}, which including many types of\nadaptive learning rates. Moreover, our framework can flexibly use the momentum\nand variance reduced techniques. In particular, we provide a useful convergence\nanalysis framework for both the constrained and unconstrained bilevel\noptimization.

          "description": "Home-cage social behaviour analysis of mice is an invaluable tool to assess\ntherapeutic efficacy of neurodegenerative diseases. Despite tremendous efforts\nmade within the research community, single-camera video recordings are mainly\nused for such analysis. Because of the potential to create rich descriptions of\nmouse social behaviors, the use of multi-view video recordings for rodent\nobservations is increasingly receiving much attention. However, identifying\nsocial behaviours from various views is still challenging due to the lack of\ncorrespondence across data sources. To address this problem, we here propose a\nnovel multiview latent-attention and dynamic discriminative model that jointly\nlearns view-specific and view-shared sub-structures, where the former captures\nunique dynamics of each view whilst the latter encodes the interaction between\nthe views. Furthermore, a novel multi-view latent-attention variational\nautoencoder model is introduced in learning the acquired features, enabling us\nto learn discriminative features in each view. Experimental results on the\nstandard CRMI13 and our multi-view Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB)\ndatasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the other state of the arts\ntechnologies and effectively deals with the imbalanced data problem.",

Moreover, atmospheric conditions and\nspecific geographical region characteristics constitute a relevant domain gap\nthat does not allow direct applicability of a trained model on the available\ndataset to the area of interest.

This is common due to the slight fluctuation of road smoothness and\nslope. Due to the lack of insight in industrial application, existing methods\non open datasets neglect the camera pose information, which inevitably results\nin the detector being susceptible to camera extrinsic parameters. The\nperturbation of objects is very popular in most autonomous driving cases for\nindustrial products. To this end, we propose a novel method to capture camera\npose to formulate the detector free from extrinsic perturbation. Specifically,\nthe proposed framework predicts camera extrinsic parameters by detecting\nvanishing point and horizon change. A converter is designed to rectify\nperturbative features in the latent space. By doing so, our 3D detector works\nindependent of the extrinsic parameter variations and produces accurate results\nin realistic cases, e.g., potholed and uneven roads, where almost all existing\nmonocular detectors fail to handle.

          "description": "Multi-Source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (multi-source UDA) aims to learn\na model from several labeled source domains while performing well on a\ndifferent target domain where only unlabeled data are available at training\ntime. To align source and target features distributions, several recent works\nuse source and target explicit statistics matching such as features moments or\nclass centroids. Yet, these approaches do not guarantee class conditional\ndistributions alignment across domains. In this work, we propose a new\nframework called Contrastive Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (CMSDA) for\nmulti-source UDA that addresses this limitation. Discriminative features are\nlearned from interpolated source examples via cross entropy minimization and\nfrom target examples via consistency regularization and hard pseudo-labeling.\nSimultaneously, interpolated source examples are leveraged to align source\nclass conditional distributions through an interpolated version of the\nsupervised contrastive loss. This alignment leads to more general and\ntransferable features which further improve the generalization on the target\ndomain.

          "description": "Transformer models have achieved great progress on computer vision tasks\nrecently. The rapid development of vision transformers is mainly contributed by\ntheir high representation ability for extracting informative features from\ninput images. However, the mainstream transformer models are designed with deep\narchitectures, and the feature diversity will be continuously reduced as the\ndepth increases, i.e., feature collapse. In this paper, we theoretically\nanalyze the feature collapse phenomenon and study the relationship between\nshortcuts and feature diversity in these transformer models. Then, we present\nan augmented shortcut scheme, which inserts additional paths with learnable\nparameters in parallel on the original shortcuts. To save the computational\ncosts, we further explore an efficient approach that uses the block-circulant\nprojection to implement augmented shortcuts. Extensive experiments conducted on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which\nbrings about 1% accuracy increase of the state-of-the-art visual transformers\nwithout obviously increasing their parameters and FLOPs.",

Among these approaches, the method using I3D network\nachieves the highest recognition accuracy on large public datasets for WSLR.\nHowever, the method with I3D only utilizes appearance information of the upper\nbody of the signers to recognize sign language words. On the other hand, in\nWSLR, the information of local regions, such as the hand shape and facial\nexpression, and the positional relationship among the body and both hands are\nimportant.

In other words, we\npropose a novel multi-stream WSLR framework, in which a stream with local\nregion images and a stream with skeletal information are introduced by\nextending I3D network to improve the recognition accuracy of WSLR.

          "description": "Transferability estimation is an essential problem in transfer learning to\npredict how good the performance is when transferring a source model (or source\ntask) to a target task. Recent analytical transferability metrics have been\nwidely used for source model selection and multi-task learning. A major\nchallenge is how to make transfereability estimation robust under the\ncross-domain cross-task settings. The recently proposed OTCE score solves this\nproblem by considering both domain and task differences, with the help of\ntransfer experiences on auxiliary tasks, which causes an efficiency overhead.\nIn this work, we propose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score\nthat dramatically improves the robustness of the task difference estimation in\nOTCE, thus removing the need for auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we build the\njoint correspondences between source and target data via solving an optimal\ntransport problem with a ground cost considering both the sample distance and\nlabel distance, and then compute the transferability score as the negative\nconditional entropy of the matched labels. Extensive validations under the\nintra-dataset and inter-dataset transfer settings demonstrate that our JC-NCE\nscore outperforms the auxiliary-task free version of OTCE for 7% and 12%,\nrespectively, and is also more robust than other existing transferability\nmetrics on average.",

Most SSL methods only consider\na clear distinction between classes but in many real-world datasets, this clear\ndistinction is not given due to intra- or interobserver variability. This\nvariability can lead to different annotations per image. Thus many images have\nambiguous annotations and their label needs to be considered \"fuzzy\". This\nfuzziness of labels must be addressed as it will limit the performance of\nSemi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and deep learning in general. We propose\nSemi-Supervised Classification & Clustering (S2C2) which can extend many deep\nSSL algorithms. S2C2 can estimate the fuzziness of a label and applies SSL as a\nclassification to certainly labeled data while creating distinct clusters for\nimages with similar but fuzzy labels. We show that S2C2 results in median 7.4%\nbetter F1-score for classifications and 5.4% lower inner distance of clusters\nacross multiple SSL algorithms and datasets while being more interpretable due\nto the fuzziness estimation of our method. Overall, a combination of\nSemi-Supervised Learning with our method S2C2 leads to better handling of the\nfuzziness of labels and thus real-world datasets.",

Moreover, we integrate a complementary branch into the framework,\nwhich explicitly refines the predictions with pseudo supervision from the MIL\nstage.

As opposed to previous\nworks relying on completely dense residuals, we propose to only provide sparse\nmeasurements to update the depth code and show through careful experimentation\nthat our choice of sparse measurements and FEJs can still significantly improve\nthe estimated depth maps. Our full system also exhibits state-of-the-art pose\nestimation accuracy, and we show that it can run in real-time with\nsingle-thread execution while utilizing GPU acceleration only for the network\nand code Jacobian.",

          "description": "Resolution in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is typically bounded\nby the receptive field size through filter sizes, and subsampling layers or\nstrided convolutions on feature maps. The optimal resolution may vary\nsignificantly depending on the dataset. Modern CNNs hard-code their resolution\nhyper-parameters in the network architecture which makes tuning such\nhyper-parameters cumbersome. We propose to do away with hard-coded resolution\nhyper-parameters and aim to learn the appropriate resolution from data. We use\nscale-space theory to obtain a self-similar parametrization of filters and make\nuse of the N-Jet: a truncated Taylor series to approximate a filter by a\nlearned combination of Gaussian derivative filters. The parameter sigma of the\nGaussian basis controls both the amount of detail the filter encodes and the\nspatial extent of the filter. Since sigma is a continuous parameter, we can\noptimize it with respect to the loss. The proposed N-Jet layer achieves\ncomparable performance when used in state-of-the art architectures, while\nlearning the correct resolution in each layer automatically. We evaluate our\nN-Jet layer on both classification and segmentation, and we show that learning\nsigma is especially beneficial for inputs at multiple sizes.",

          "description": "Many man-made objects are characterised by a shape that is symmetric along\none or more planar directions. Estimating the location and orientation of such\nsymmetry planes can aid many tasks such as estimating the overall orientation\nof an object of interest or performing shape completion, where a partial scan\nof an object is reflected across the estimated symmetry plane in order to\nobtain a more detailed shape. Many methods processing 3D data rely on expensive\n3D convolutions. In this paper we present an alternative novel encoding that\ninstead slices the data along the height dimension and passes it sequentially\nto a 2D convolutional recurrent regression scheme. The method also comprises a\ndifferentiable least squares step, allowing for end-to-end accurate and fast\nprocessing of both full and partial scans of symmetric objects. We use this\napproach to efficiently handle 3D inputs to design a method to estimate planar\nreflective symmetries. We show that our approach has an accuracy comparable to\nstate-of-the-art techniques on the task of planar reflective symmetry\nestimation on full synthetic objects. Additionally, we show that it can be\ndeployed on partial scans of objects in a real-world pipeline to improve the\noutputs of a 3D object detector.",

We\ndemonstrate this by showing improved performance of a simple\nk-nearest-neighbors classifier on the learned distance matrix. We also\ndemonstrate a further application of this method to biological image analysis:\nonce trained, we use our model to compute the distance between the biological\ngraphs and a set of graphs output by a cell division simulator.

Here, we report experiments with a simple such attention\nsystem that can improve the performance of standard convolutional networks,\nwith relatively few additional parameters. Each spatial position in each layer\nof the network produces a key-query vector pair; all queries are then pooled\ninto a global attention query. On the next iteration, the match between each\nkey and the global attention query modulates the network's activations --\nemphasizing or silencing the locations that agree or disagree (respectively)\nwith the global attention system. We demonstrate the usefulness of this\nbrain-inspired Global Attention Agreement network (GAttANet) for various\nconvolutional backbones (from a simple 5-layer toy model to a standard ResNet50\narchitecture) and datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Imagenet-1k). Each time, our\nglobal attention system improves accuracy over the corresponding baseline.",

          "description": "Last ten years have witnessed the growth of many computer vision applications\nfor food recognition. Dietary studies showed that dietary-related problem such\nas obesity is associated with other chronic diseases like hypertension,\nirregular blood sugar levels, and increased risk of heart attacks. The primary\ncause of these problems is poor lifestyle choices and unhealthy dietary habits,\nwhich are manageable by using interactive mHealth apps that use automatic\nvisual-based methods to assess dietary intake. This review discusses the most\nperforming methodologies that have been developed so far for automatic food\nrecognition. First, we will present the rationale of visual-based methods for\nfood recognition. The core of the paper is the presentation, discussion and\nevaluation of these methods on popular food image databases. We also discussed\nthe mobile applications that are implementing these methods.

          "description": "In applications such as object tracking, time-series data inevitably carry\nmissing observations. Following the success of deep learning-based models for\nvarious sequence learning tasks, these models increasingly replace classic\napproaches in object tracking applications for inferring the object motions\nstate. While traditional tracking approaches can deal with missing\nobservations, most of their deep counterparts are, by default, not suited for\nthis.\n\nTowards this end, this paper introduces a transformer-based approach for\nhandling missing observations in variable input length trajectory data. The\nmodel is formed indirectly by successively increasing the complexity of the\ndemanded inference tasks. Starting from reproducing noise-free trajectories,\nthe model then learns to infer trajectories from noisy inputs. By providing\nmissing tokens, binary-encoded missing events, the model learns to in-attend to\nmissing data and infers a complete trajectory conditioned on the remaining\ninputs. In the case of a sequence of successive missing events, the model then\nacts as a pure prediction model. The model's abilities are demonstrated on\nsynthetic data and real-world data reflecting prototypical object tracking\nscenarios.",

Thereby,\nlocal dependencies of image regions get lost and since a whole-slide-image\ncomprises many thousands of such patches this process is inherently slow. We\npropose to subdivide the image into coherent regions prior to classification by\ngrouping visually similar adjacent image pixels into larger segments, i.e.\nsuperpixels.

Firstly, a baseline of\napplying YOLO to 1,026 frames with pedestrian annotations in the KITTI Vision\nBenchmark Suite has been established. Next, video degradation candidates for\neach of these frames were generated using the leading video codecs libx264,\nlibx265, Nvidia HEVC, and AV1: 52 frames for the various compression presets\nfor color and gray-scale frames resulting in 104 degradation candidates per\noriginal KITTI frame and 426,816 images in total. YOLO was applied to each\nimage to compute the intersection-over-union (IoU) metric to compare the\nperformance with the original baseline. While aggressively lossy compression\nsettings result in significant performance drops as expected, it was also\nobserved that some configurations actually result in slightly better IoU\nresults compared to the baseline.

UAD has two main\nadvantages over its fully supervised counterpart. Firstly, it is able to\ndirectly leverage large datasets available from health screening programs that\ncontain mostly normal image samples, avoiding the costly manual labelling of\nabnormal samples and the subsequent issues involved in training with extremely\nclass-imbalanced data. Further, UAD approaches can potentially detect and\nlocalise any type of lesions that deviate from the normal patterns. One\nsignificant challenge faced by UAD methods is how to learn effective\nlow-dimensional image representations to detect and localise subtle\nabnormalities, generally consisting of small lesions. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel self-supervised representation learning method,\ncalled Constrained Contrastive Distribution learning for anomaly detection\n(CCD), which learns fine-grained feature representations by simultaneously\npredicting the distribution of augmented data and image contexts using\ncontrastive learning with pretext constraints. The learned representations can\nbe leveraged to train more anomaly-sensitive detection models. Extensive\nexperiment results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art\nUAD approaches on three different colonoscopy and fundus screening datasets.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/tianyu0207/CCD.",

          "description": "Self-supervised learning solves pretext prediction tasks that do not require\nannotations to learn feature representations. For vision tasks, pretext tasks\nsuch as predicting rotation, solving jigsaw are solely created from the input\ndata. Yet, predicting this known information helps in learning representations\nuseful for downstream tasks. However, recent works have shown that wider and\ndeeper models benefit more from self-supervised learning than smaller models.\nTo address the issue of self-supervised pre-training of smaller models, we\npropose Distill-on-the-Go (DoGo), a self-supervised learning paradigm using\nsingle-stage online knowledge distillation to improve the representation\nquality of the smaller models. We employ deep mutual learning strategy in which\ntwo models collaboratively learn from each other to improve one another.\nSpecifically, each model is trained using self-supervised learning along with\ndistillation that aligns each model's softmax probabilities of similarity\nscores with that of the peer model. We conduct extensive experiments on\nmultiple benchmark datasets, learning objectives, and architectures to\ndemonstrate the potential of our proposed method.

          "description": "Neural networks are susceptible to small transformations including 2D\nrotations and shifts, image crops, and even changes in object colors. This is\noften attributed to biases in the training dataset, and the lack of 2D\nshift-invariance due to not respecting the sampling theorem. In this paper, we\nchallenge this hypothesis by training and testing on unbiased datasets, and\nshowing that networks are brittle to both small 3D perspective changes and\nlighting variations which cannot be explained by dataset bias or lack of\nshift-invariance. To find these in-distribution errors, we introduce an\nevolution strategies (ES) based approach, which we call CMA-Search. Despite\ntraining with a large-scale (0.5 million images), unbiased dataset of camera\nand light variations, in over 71% cases CMA-Search can find camera parameters\nin the vicinity of a correctly classified image which lead to in-distribution\nmisclassifications with < 3.6% change in parameters. With lighting changes,\nCMA-Search finds misclassifications in 33% cases with < 11.6% change in\nparameters.

          "description": "With the rise of Transformers as the standard for language processing, and\ntheir advancements in computer vision, along with their unprecedented size and\namounts of training data, many have come to believe that they are not suitable\nfor small sets of data. This trend leads to great concerns, including but not\nlimited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the\nexclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this\npaper, we dispel the myth that transformers are \"data hungry\" and therefore can\nonly be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the\nright size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with\nstate-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets. Our model eliminates the requirement\nfor class token and positional embeddings through a novel sequence pooling\nstrategy and the use of convolutions. We show that compared to CNNs, our\ncompact transformers have fewer parameters and MACs, while obtaining similar\naccuracies. Our method is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as\nlittle as 0.28M parameters and achieve reasonable results. It can reach an\naccuracy of 95.29 % when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is comparable\nwith modern CNN based approaches, and a significant improvement over previous\nTransformer based models. Our simple and compact design democratizes\ntransformers by making them accessible to those equipped with basic computing\nresources and/or dealing with important small datasets. Our method works on\nlarger datasets, such as ImageNet (80.28% accuracy with 29% parameters of ViT),\nand NLP tasks as well.

          "description": "Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is arguably the most popular\nmeta-learning algorithm nowadays, given its flexibility to incorporate various\nmodel architectures and to be applied to different problems. Nevertheless, its\nperformance on few-shot classification is far behind many recent algorithms\ndedicated to the problem. In this paper, we point out several key facets of how\nto train MAML to excel in few-shot classification. First, we find that a large\nnumber of gradient steps are needed for the inner loop update, which\ncontradicts the common usage of MAML for few-shot classification. Second, we\nfind that MAML is sensitive to the permutation of class assignments in\nmeta-testing: for a few-shot task of $N$ classes, there are exponentially many\nways to assign the learned initialization of the $N$-way classifier to the $N$\nclasses, leading to an unavoidably huge variance. Third, we investigate several\nways for permutation invariance and find that learning a shared classifier\ninitialization for all the classes performs the best. On benchmark datasets\nsuch as MiniImageNet and TieredImageNet, our approach, which we name\nUNICORN-MAML, performs on a par with or even outperforms state-of-the-art\nalgorithms, while keeping the simplicity of MAML without adding any extra\nsub-networks.",

In this paper, we propose a new two-stream action\nrecognition network, termed as MENet, consisting of a Motion Enhancement (ME)\nmodule and a Video-level Aggregation (VLA) module to achieve long-short\ntemporal modeling. Specifically, motion representations have been proved\neffective in capturing short-term and high-frequency action. However, current\nmotion representations are calculated from adjacent frames, which may have poor\ninterpretation and bring useless information (noisy or blank). Thus, for\nshort-term motions, we design an efficient ME module to enhance the short-term\nmotions by mingling the motion saliency among neighboring segments. As for\nlong-term aggregations, VLA is adopted at the top of the appearance branch to\nintegrate the long-term dependencies across all segments. The two components of\nMENet are complementary in temporal modeling.

          "description": "Compared to many other dense prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation,\nit is the arbitrary number of instances that has made instance segmentation\nmuch more challenging. In order to predict a mask for each instance, mainstream\napproaches either follow the 'detect-then-segment' strategy (e.g., Mask R-CNN),\nor predict embedding vectors first then cluster pixels into individual\ninstances. In this paper, we view the task of instance segmentation from a\ncompletely new perspective by introducing the notion of \"instance categories\",\nwhich assigns categories to each pixel within an instance according to the\ninstance's location. With this notion, we propose segmenting objects by\nlocations (SOLO), a simple, direct, and fast framework for instance\nsegmentation with strong performance. We derive a few SOLO variants (e.g.,\nVanilla SOLO, Decoupled SOLO, Dynamic SOLO) following the basic principle. Our\nmethod directly maps a raw input image to the desired object categories and\ninstance masks, eliminating the need for the grouping post-processing or the\nbounding box detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for\ninstance segmentation in terms of both speed and accuracy, while being\nconsiderably simpler than the existing methods. Besides instance segmentation,\nour method yields state-of-the-art results in object detection (from our mask\nbyproduct) and panoptic segmentation. We further demonstrate the flexibility\nand high-quality segmentation of SOLO by extending it to perform one-stage\ninstance-level image matting. Code is available at: https://git.io/AdelaiDet",

However, due to the variety and large number of\ncells, complete annotations that include every cell of interest in the training\nimages can be challenging. Usually, incomplete annotations can be achieved,\nwhere positive labeling results are carefully examined to ensure their\nreliability but there can be other positive instances, i.e., cells of interest,\nthat are not included in the annotations. This annotation strategy leads to a\nlack of knowledge about true negative samples. Most existing methods simply\ntreat instances that are not labeled as positive as truly negative during\nnetwork training, which can adversely affect the network performance. In this\nwork, to address the problem of incomplete annotations, we formulate the\ntraining of detection networks as a positive-unlabeled learning problem.\nSpecifically, the classification loss in network training is revised to take\ninto account incomplete annotations, where the terms corresponding to negative\nsamples are approximated with the true positive samples and the other samples\nof which the labels are unknown.

          "description": "Multi-modal imaging is a key healthcare technology in the diagnosis and\nmanagement of disease, but it is often underutilized due to costs associated\nwith multiple separate scans. This limitation yields the need for synthesis of\nunacquired modalities from the subset of available modalities. In recent years,\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) models with superior depiction of\nstructural details have been established as state-of-the-art in numerous\nmedical image synthesis tasks. However, GANs are characteristically based on\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) backbones that perform local processing with\ncompact filters.

While attention maps incorporated in GANs can\nmultiplicatively modulate CNN features to emphasize critical image regions,\ntheir capture of global context is mostly implicit.

Based on an encoder-decoder architecture, ResViT employs a\ncentral bottleneck comprising novel aggregated residual transformer (ART)\nblocks that synergistically combine convolutional and transformer modules.\nComprehensive demonstrations are performed for synthesizing missing sequences\nin multi-contrast MRI and CT images from MRI. Our results indicate the\nsuperiority of ResViT against competing methods in terms of qualitative\nobservations and quantitative metrics.",

          "description": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved great success due to the\npowerful feature learning ability of convolution layers. Specifically, the\nstandard convolution traverses the input images/features using a sliding window\nscheme to extract features. However, not all the windows contribute equally to\nthe prediction results of CNNs. In practice, the convolutional operation on\nsome of the windows (e.g., smooth windows that contain very similar pixels) can\nbe very redundant and may introduce noises into the computation. Such\nredundancy may not only deteriorate the performance but also incur the\nunnecessary computational cost. Thus, it is important to reduce the\ncomputational redundancy of convolution to improve the performance. To this\nend, we propose a Content-aware Convolution (CAC) that automatically detects\nthe smooth windows and applies a 1x1 convolutional kernel to replace the\noriginal large kernel. In this sense, we are able to effectively avoid the\nredundant computation on similar pixels. By replacing the standard convolution\nin CNNs with our CAC, the resultant models yield significantly better\nperformance and lower computational cost than the baseline models with the\nstandard convolution. More critically, we are able to dynamically allocate\nsuitable computation resources according to the data smoothness of different\nimages, making it possible for content-aware computation. Extensive experiments\non various computer vision tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nexisting methods.",

          "description": "Association, aiming to link bounding boxes of the same identity in a video\nsequence, is a central component in multi-object tracking (MOT). To train\nassociation modules, e.g., parametric networks, real video data are usually\nused. However, annotating person tracks in consecutive video frames is\nexpensive, and such real data, due to its inflexibility, offer us limited\nopportunities to evaluate the system performance w.r.t changing tracking\nscenarios. In this paper, we study whether 3D synthetic data can replace\nreal-world videos for association training. Specifically, we introduce a\nlarge-scale synthetic data engine named MOTX, where the motion characteristics\nof cameras and objects are manually configured to be similar to those in\nreal-world datasets. We show that compared with real data, association\nknowledge obtained from synthetic data can achieve very similar performance on\nreal-world test sets without domain adaption techniques. Our intriguing\nobservation is credited to two factors. First and foremost, 3D engines can well\nsimulate motion factors such as camera movement, camera view and object\nmovement, so that the simulated videos can provide association modules with\neffective motion features. Second, experimental results show that the\nappearance domain gap hardly harms the learning of association knowledge. In\naddition, the strong customization ability of MOTX allows us to quantitatively\nassess the impact of motion factors on MOT, which brings new insights to the\ncommunity.",

          "description": "Even though deep neural networks succeed on many different tasks including\nsemantic segmentation, they lack on robustness against adversarial examples. To\ncounteract this exploit, often adversarial training is used. However, it is\nknown that adversarial training with weak adversarial attacks (e.g. using the\nFast Gradient Method) does not improve the robustness against stronger attacks.\nRecent research shows that it is possible to increase the robustness of such\nsingle-step methods by choosing an appropriate step size during the training.\nFinding such a step size, without increasing the computational effort of\nsingle-step adversarial training, is still an open challenge. In this work we\naddress the computationally particularly demanding task of semantic\nsegmentation and propose a new step size control algorithm that increases the\nrobustness of single-step adversarial training. The proposed algorithm does not\nincrease the computational effort of single-step adversarial training\nconsiderably and also simplifies training, because it is free of\nmeta-parameter.

In this paper, we\npropose a very fast deep learning framework called Bringing the Lightness\n(denoted as BLNet) that consists of two U-Nets with a series of well-designed\nloss functions to tackle all of the above degradations. Based on Retinex\nTheory, the decomposition net in our model can decompose low-light images into\nreflectance and illumination and remove noise in the reflectance during the\ndecomposition phase. We propose a Noise and Color Bias Control module (NCBC\nModule) that contains a convolutional neural network and two loss functions\n(noise loss and color loss). This module is only used to calculate the loss\nfunctions during the training phase, so our method is very fast during the test\nphase. This module can smooth the reflectance to achieve the purpose of noise\nremoval while preserving details and edge information and controlling color\nbias. We propose a network that can be trained to learn the mapping between\nlow-light and normal-light illumination and enhance the brightness of images\ntaken in low-light illumination. We train and evaluate the performance of our\nproposed model over the real-world Low-Light (LOL) dataset), and we also test\nour model over several other frequently used datasets (LIME, DICM and MEF\ndatasets). We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach\nachieves a promising effect with good rubustness and generalization and\noutperforms many other state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and\nquantitatively.

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in image\nrestoration tasks by directly learning a powerful non-linear mapping from\ncorrupted images to their latent clean ones. However, there still exist two\nmajor limitations for these deep learning (DL)-based methods. Firstly, the\nnoises contained in real corrupted images are very complex, usually neglected\nand largely under-estimated in most current methods. Secondly, existing DL\nmethods are mostly trained on one pre-assumed degradation process for all of\nthe training image pairs, such as the widely used bicubic downsampling\nassumption in the image super-resolution task, inevitably leading to poor\ngeneralization performance when the true degradation does not match with such\nassumed one. To address these issues, we propose a unified generative model for\nthe image restoration, which elaborately configures the degradation process\nfrom the latent clean image to the observed corrupted one. Specifically,\ndifferent from most of current methods, the pixel-wisely non-i.i.d. Gaussian\ndistribution, being with more flexibility, is adopted in our method to fit the\ncomplex real noises. Furthermore, the method is built on the general image\ndegradation process, making it capable of adapting diverse degradations under\none single model. Besides, we design a variational inference algorithm to learn\nall parameters involved in the proposed model with explicit form of objective\nloss. Specifically, beyond traditional variational methodology, two DNNs are\nemployed to parameterize the posteriori distributions, one to infer the\ndistribution of the latent clean image, and another to infer the distribution\nof the image noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed method on three classical image restoration tasks, including image\ndenoising, image super-resolution and JPEG image deblocking.",

          "description": "Compared with cheap addition operation, multiplication operation is of much\nhigher computation complexity. The widely-used convolutions in deep neural\nnetworks are exactly cross-correlation to measure the similarity between input\nfeature and convolution filters, which involves massive multiplications between\nfloat values. In this paper, we present adder networks (AdderNets) to trade\nthese massive multiplications in deep neural networks, especially convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), for much cheaper additions to reduce computation costs.\nIn AdderNets, we take the $\\ell_1$-norm distance between filters and input\nfeature as the output response. We first develop a theoretical foundation for\nAdderNets, by showing that both the single hidden layer AdderNet and the\nwidth-bounded deep AdderNet with ReLU activation functions are universal\nfunction approximators. An approximation bound for AdderNets with a single\nhidden layer is also presented. We further analyze the influence of this new\nsimilarity measure on the optimization of neural network and develop a special\ntraining scheme for AdderNets. Based on the gradient magnitude, an adaptive\nlearning rate strategy is proposed to enhance the training procedure of\nAdderNets. AdderNets can achieve a 75.7% Top-1 accuracy and a 92.3% Top-5\naccuracy using ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset without any multiplication in\nthe convolutional layer.",

This paper\ndevelops a generic computer vision system based on features extracted from\ntrained CNNs. Multiple learned features are combined into a single structure to\nwork on different image classification tasks. The proposed system was\nexperimentally derived by testing several approaches for extracting features\nfrom the inner layers of CNNs and using them as inputs to SVMs that are then\ncombined by sum rule.

The resulting vision system is shown\nto significantly boost the performance of standard CNNs across a large and\ndiverse collection of image data sets.

          "description": "Accurate segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nis clinically relevant in diagnoses, prognoses and surgery treatment, which\nrequires multiple modalities to provide complementary morphological and\nphysiopathologic information. However, missing modality commonly occurs due to\nimage corruption, artifacts, different acquisition protocols or allergies to\ncertain contrast agents in clinical practice. Though existing efforts\ndemonstrate the possibility of a unified model for all missing situations, most\nof them perform poorly when more than one modality is missing. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Adversarial Co-training Network (ACN) to solve this issue,\nin which a series of independent yet related models are trained dedicated to\neach missing situation with significantly better results. Specifically, ACN\nadopts a novel co-training network, which enables a coupled learning process\nfor both full modality and missing modality to supplement each other's domain\nand feature representations, and more importantly, to recover the `missing'\ninformation of absent modalities. Then, two unsupervised modules, i.e., entropy\nand knowledge adversarial learning modules are proposed to minimize the domain\ngap while enhancing prediction reliability and encouraging the alignment of\nlatent representations, respectively. We also adapt modality-mutual information\nknowledge transfer learning to ACN to retain the rich mutual information among\nmodalities. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018 dataset show that our proposed\nmethod significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art methods under any missing\nsituation.",

The CATS\nconsists of two modules: a novel tracing loss that performs feature unmixing by\ntracing boundaries for better side edge learning, and a context-aware fusion\nblock that tackles the side mixing by aggregating the complementary merits of\nlearned side edges. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed CATS can be\nintegrated into modern deep edge detectors to improve localization accuracy.\nWith the vanilla VGG16 backbone, in terms of BSDS500 dataset, our CATS improves\nthe F-measure (ODS) of the RCF and BDCN deep edge detectors by 12% and 6%\nrespectively when evaluating without using the morphological non-maximal\nsuppression scheme for edge detection.",

          "description": "Adversarial training is one of the most effective approaches to improve model\nrobustness against adversarial examples. However, previous works mainly focus\non the overall robustness of the model, and the in-depth analysis on the role\nof each class involved in adversarial training is still missing. In this paper,\nwe propose to analyze the class-wise robustness in adversarial training. First,\nwe provide a detailed diagnosis of adversarial training on six benchmark\ndatasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, STL-10 and ImageNet.\nSurprisingly, we find that there are remarkable robustness discrepancies among\nclasses, leading to unbalance/unfair class-wise robustness in the robust\nmodels. Furthermore, we keep investigating the relations between classes and\nfind that the unbalanced class-wise robustness is pretty consistent among\ndifferent attack and defense methods. Moreover, we observe that the stronger\nattack methods in adversarial learning achieve performance improvement mainly\nfrom a more successful attack on the vulnerable classes (i.e., classes with\nless robustness). Inspired by these interesting findings, we design a simple\nbut effective attack method based on the traditional PGD attack, named\nTemperature-PGD attack, which proposes to enlarge the robustness disparity\namong classes with a temperature factor on the confidence distribution of each\nimage. Experiments demonstrate our method can achieve a higher attack rate than\nthe PGD attack. Furthermore, from the defense perspective, we also make some\nmodifications in the training and inference phase to improve the robustness of\nthe most vulnerable class, so as to mitigate the large difference in class-wise\nrobustness. We believe our work can contribute to a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of adversarial training as well as rethinking the class-wise\nproperties in robust models.",

          "description": "We present a fully automatic system that can produce high-fidelity,\nphoto-realistic 3D digital human heads with a consumer RGB-D selfie camera. The\nsystem only needs the user to take a short selfie RGB-D video while rotating\nhis/her head, and can produce a high quality head reconstruction in less than\n30 seconds. Our main contribution is a new facial geometry modeling and\nreflectance synthesis procedure that significantly improves the\nstate-of-the-art. Specifically, given the input video a two-stage frame\nselection procedure is first employed to select a few high-quality frames for\nreconstruction. Then a differentiable renderer based 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)\nfitting algorithm is applied to recover facial geometries from multiview RGB-D\ndata, which takes advantages of a powerful 3DMM basis constructed with\nextensive data generation and perturbation. Our 3DMM has much larger expressive\ncapacities than conventional 3DMM, allowing us to recover more accurate facial\ngeometry using merely linear basis. For reflectance synthesis, we present a\nhybrid approach that combines parametric fitting and CNNs to synthesize\nhigh-resolution albedo/normal maps with realistic hair/pore/wrinkle details.\nResults show that our system can produce faithful 3D digital human faces with\nextremely realistic details. The main code and the newly constructed 3DMM basis\nis publicly available.",

          "description": "Unsupervised disentanglement has been shown to be theoretically impossible\nwithout inductive biases on the models and the data. As an alternative\napproach, recent methods rely on limited supervision to disentangle the factors\nof variation and allow their identifiability. While annotating the true\ngenerative factors is only required for a limited number of observations, we\nargue that it is infeasible to enumerate all the factors of variation that\ndescribe a real-world image distribution. To this end, we propose a method for\ndisentangling a set of factors which are only partially labeled, as well as\nseparating the complementary set of residual factors that are never explicitly\nspecified. Our success in this challenging setting, demonstrated on synthetic\nbenchmarks, gives rise to leveraging off-the-shelf image descriptors to\npartially annotate a subset of attributes in real image domains (e.g. of human\nfaces) with minimal manual effort. Specifically, we use a recent language-image\nembedding model (CLIP) to annotate a set of attributes of interest in a\nzero-shot manner and demonstrate state-of-the-art disentangled image\nmanipulation results.",

          "description": "Standardized body region labelling of individual images provides data that\ncan improve human and computer use of medical images. A CNN-based classifier\nwas developed to identify body regions in CT and MRI. 17 CT (18 MRI) body\nregions covering the entire human body were defined for the classification\ntask. Three retrospective databases were built for the AI model training,\nvalidation, and testing, with a balanced distribution of studies per body\nregion. The test databases originated from a different healthcare network.\nAccuracy, recall and precision of the classifier was evaluated for patient age,\npatient gender, institution, scanner manufacturer, contrast, slice thickness,\nMRI sequence, and CT kernel. The data included a retrospective cohort of 2,934\nanonymized CT cases (training: 1,804 studies, validation: 602 studies, test:\n528 studies) and 3,185 anonymized MRI cases (training: 1,911 studies,\nvalidation: 636 studies, test: 638 studies). 27 institutions from primary care\nhospitals, community hospitals and imaging centers contributed to the test\ndatasets. The data included cases of all genders in equal proportions and\nsubjects aged from a few months old to +90 years old. An image-level prediction\naccuracy of 91.9% (90.2 - 92.1) for CT, and 94.2% (92.0 - 95.6) for MRI was\nachieved. The classification results were robust across all body regions and\nconfounding factors. Due to limited data, performance results for subjects\nunder 10 years-old could not be reliably evaluated. We show that deep learning\nmodels can classify CT and MRI images by body region including lower and upper\nextremities with high accuracy.",

          "description": "Video frame interpolation is the task of creating an interframe between two\nadjacent frames along the time axis. So, instead of simply averaging two\nadjacent frames to create an intermediate image, this operation should maintain\nsemantic continuity with the adjacent frames. Most conventional methods use\noptical flow, and various tools such as occlusion handling and object smoothing\nare indispensable. Since the use of these various tools leads to complex\nproblems, we tried to tackle the video interframe generation problem without\nusing problematic optical flow . To enable this , we have tried to use a deep\nneural network with an invertible structure, and developed an U-Net based\nGenerative Flow which is a modified normalizing flow. In addition, we propose a\nlearning method with a new consistency loss in the latent space to maintain\nsemantic temporal consistency between frames. The resolution of the generated\nimage is guaranteed to be identical to that of the original images by using an\ninvertible network. Furthermore, as it is not a random image like the ones by\ngenerative models, our network guarantees stable outputs without flicker.\nThrough experiments, we \\sam {confirmed the feasibility of the proposed\nalgorithm and would like to suggest the U-Net based Generative Flow as a new\npossibility for baseline in video frame interpolation. This paper is meaningful\nin that it is the world's first attempt to use invertible networks instead of\noptical flows for video interpolation.",

          "description": "Most deep learning models are data-driven and the excellent performance is\nhighly dependent on the abundant and diverse datasets. However, it is very hard\nto obtain and label the datasets of some specific scenes or applications. If we\ntrain the detector using the data from one domain, it cannot perform well on\nthe data from another domain due to domain shift, which is one of the big\nchallenges of most object detection models. To address this issue, some\nimage-to-image translation techniques have been employed to generate some fake\ndata of some specific scenes to train the models. With the advent of Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs), we could realize unsupervised image-to-image\ntranslation in both directions from a source to a target domain and from the\ntarget to the source domain. In this study, we report a new approach to making\nuse of the generated images. We propose to concatenate the original 3-channel\nimages and their corresponding GAN-generated fake images to form 6-channel\nrepresentations of the dataset, hoping to address the domain shift problem\nwhile exploiting the success of available detection models.

          "description": "Low-light imaging on mobile devices is typically challenging due to\ninsufficient incident light coming through the relatively small aperture,\nresulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the previous works on\nlow-light image processing focus either only on a single task such as\nillumination adjustment, color enhancement, or noise removal; or on a joint\nillumination adjustment and denoising task that heavily relies on short-long\nexposure image pairs collected from specific camera models, and thus these\napproaches are less practical and generalizable in real-world settings where\ncamera-specific joint enhancement and restoration is required. To tackle this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a low-light image processing framework that\nperforms joint illumination adjustment, color enhancement, and denoising.\nConsidering the difficulty in model-specific data collection and the ultra-high\ndefinition of the captured images, we design two branches: a coefficient\nestimation branch as well as a joint enhancement and denoising branch. The\ncoefficient estimation branch works in a low-resolution space and predicts the\ncoefficients for enhancement via bilateral learning, whereas the joint\nenhancement and denoising branch works in a full-resolution space and performs\njoint enhancement and denoising in a progressive manner. In contrast to\nexisting methods, our framework does not need to recollect massive data when\nbeing adapted to another camera model, which significantly reduces the efforts\nrequired to fine-tune our approach for practical usage. Through extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate its great potential in real-world low-light imaging\napplications when compared with current state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Automatic surgical gesture recognition is fundamentally important to enable\nintelligent cognitive assistance in robotic surgery. With recent advancement in\nrobot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, rich information including surgical\nvideos and robotic kinematics can be recorded, which provide complementary\nknowledge for understanding surgical gestures. However, existing methods either\nsolely adopt uni-modal data or directly concatenate multi-modal\nrepresentations, which can not sufficiently exploit the informative\ncorrelations inherent in visual and kinematics data to boost gesture\nrecognition accuracies. In this regard, we propose a novel online approach of\nmulti-modal relational graph network (i.e., MRG-Net) to dynamically integrate\nvisual and kinematics information through interactive message propagation in\nthe latent feature space.

          "description": "Compared with cheap addition operation, multiplication operation is of much\nhigher computation complexity. The widely-used convolutions in deep neural\nnetworks are exactly cross-correlation to measure the similarity between input\nfeature and convolution filters, which involves massive multiplications between\nfloat values. In this paper, we present adder networks (AdderNets) to trade\nthese massive multiplications in deep neural networks, especially convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), for much cheaper additions to reduce computation costs.\nIn AdderNets, we take the $\\ell_1$-norm distance between filters and input\nfeature as the output response. The influence of this new similarity measure on\nthe optimization of neural network have been thoroughly analyzed. To achieve a\nbetter performance, we develop a special back-propagation approach for\nAdderNets by investigating the full-precision gradient. We then propose an\nadaptive learning rate strategy to enhance the training procedure of AdderNets\naccording to the magnitude of each neuron's gradient. As a result, the proposed\nAdderNets can achieve 74.9% Top-1 accuracy 91.7% Top-5 accuracy using ResNet-50\non the ImageNet dataset without any multiplication in convolution layer.

In this paper, we use ETHOS hate speech detection dataset and\nanalyze the performance of hate speech detection classifier by replacing or\nintegrating the word embeddings (fastText (FT), GloVe (GV) or FT + GV) with\nstatic BERT embeddings (BE). With the extensive experimental trails it is\nobserved that the neural network performed better with static BE compared to\nusing FT, GV or FT + GV as word embeddings.

Recently, several\nmethods have been proposed for unsupervised learning of object-centric\nrepresentations. However, since these models were evaluated on different\ndownstream tasks, it remains unclear how they compare in terms of basic\nperceptual abilities such as detection, figure-ground segmentation and tracking\nof objects. To close this gap, we design a benchmark with four data sets of\nvarying complexity and seven additional test sets featuring challenging\ntracking scenarios relevant for natural videos. Using this benchmark, we\ncompare the perceptual abilities of four object-centric approaches: ViMON, a\nvideo-extension of MONet, based on recurrent spatial attention, OP3, which\nexploits clustering via spatial mixture models, as well as TBA and SCALOR,\nwhich use explicit factorization via spatial transformers. Our results suggest\nthat the architectures with unconstrained latent representations learn more\npowerful representations in terms of object detection, segmentation and\ntracking than the spatial transformer based architectures. We also observe that\nnone of the methods are able to gracefully handle the most challenging tracking\nscenarios despite their synthetic nature, suggesting that our benchmark may\nprovide fruitful guidance towards learning more robust object-centric video\nrepresentations.",

In addition,\nthe design and testing of complex systems, e.g., robots, which often employ\ndeep learning-based perception models, may face severe difficulties as even\nstate-of-the-art methods trained on real and large-scale datasets cannot always\nperform adequately as they have not adapted to the visual differences between\nthe virtual and the real world data.

The existing logic reasoning\nmethods, quite often, need to design some reasoning patterns beforehand. This\nhas led to an interesting question: can logic reasoning patterns be directly\nlearned from given data? The problem is termed as a data concept logic. In this\nstudy, a learning logic task from images, called a LiLi task, first is\nproposed. This task is to learn and reason the logic relation from images,\nwithout presetting any reasoning patterns. As a preliminary exploration, we\ndesign six LiLi data sets (Bitwise And, Bitwise Or, Bitwise Xor, Addition,\nSubtraction and Multiplication), in which each image is embedded with a n-digit\nnumber. It is worth noting that a learning model beforehand does not know the\nmeaning of the n-digit numbers embedded in images and the relation between the\ninput images and the output image. In order to tackle the task, in this work we\nuse many typical neural network models and produce fruitful results. However,\nthese models have the poor performances on the difficult logic task. For\nfurthermore addressing this task, a novel network framework called a divide and\nconquer model by adding some label information is designed, achieving a high\ntesting accuracy.",

          "description": "Longitudinal studies are vital to understanding dynamic changes of the\nplanet, but labels (e.g., buildings, facilities, roads) are often available\nonly for a single point in time. We propose a general model, Temporal Cluster\nMatching (TCM), for detecting building changes in time series of remotely\nsensed imagery when footprint labels are observed only once. The intuition\nbehind the model is that the relationship between spectral values inside and\noutside of building's footprint will change when a building is constructed (or\ndemolished). For instance, in rural settings, the pre-construction area may\nlook similar to the surrounding environment until the building is constructed.\nSimilarly, in urban settings, the pre-construction areas will look different\nfrom the surrounding environment until construction. We further propose a\nheuristic method for selecting the parameters of our model which allows it to\nbe applied in novel settings without requiring data labeling efforts (to fit\nthe parameters). We apply our model over a dataset of poultry barns from\n2016/2017 high-resolution aerial imagery in the Delmarva Peninsula and a\ndataset of solar farms from a 2020 mosaic of Sentinel 2 imagery in India. Our\nresults show that our model performs as well when fit using the proposed\nheuristic as it does when fit with labeled data, and further, that supervised\nversions of our model perform the best among all the baselines we test against.\nFinally, we show that our proposed approach can act as an effective data\naugmentation strategy -- it enables researchers to augment existing structure\nfootprint labels along the time dimension and thus use imagery from multiple\npoints in time to train deep learning models. We show that this improves the\nspatial generalization of such models when evaluated on the same change\ndetection task.",

In this paper, we provide a\nsystematic evaluation of domain adaptation in facial expression recognition.\nUsing state-of-the-art transfer learning techniques and six commonly-used\nfacial expression datasets (three collected in the lab and three\n\"in-the-wild\"), we conduct extensive round-robin experiments to examine the\nclassification accuracies for a state-of-the-art CNN model.

However, the\nconventional padding mechanism used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can\nintroduce spatial artifacts, especially in QSM background field removal and\nsingle-step QSM which requires inference from total fields with extreme large\nvalues at the edge boundaries of volume of interest. To address this issue, we\npropose an improved padding technique which utilizes the neighboring valid\nvoxels to estimate the invalid voxels of feature maps at volume boundaries in\nthe neural networks. Studies using simulated and in-vivo data show that the\nproposed padding greatly improves estimation accuracy and reduces artifacts in\nthe results in the tasks of background field removal, field-to-source\ninversion, and single-step QSM reconstruction.",

          "description": "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all. Myocardial segmentation of\nMyocardial Contrast Echocardiography (MCE), a critical task in automatic\nmyocardial perfusion analysis, is an example. Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, our\ngrading study shows that using extended Dice as an evaluation metric can better\nidentify segmentation results that need manual correction compared with using\nDice.",

          "description": "3D semantic scene completion and 2D semantic segmentation are two tightly\ncorrelated tasks that are both essential for indoor scene understanding,\nbecause they predict the same semantic classes, using positively correlated\nhigh-level features. Current methods use 2D features extracted from early-fused\nRGB-D images for 2D segmentation to improve 3D scene completion. We argue that\nthis sequential scheme does not ensure these two tasks fully benefit each\nother, and present an Iterative Mutual Enhancement Network (IMENet) to solve\nthem jointly, which interactively refines the two tasks at the late prediction\nstage. Specifically, two refinement modules are developed under a unified\nframework for the two tasks. The first is a 2D Deformable Context Pyramid (DCP)\nmodule, which receives the projection from the current 3D predictions to refine\nthe 2D predictions. In turn, a 3D Deformable Depth Attention (DDA) module is\nproposed to leverage the reprojected results from 2D predictions to update the\ncoarse 3D predictions. This iterative fusion happens to the stable high-level\nfeatures of both tasks at a late stage. Extensive experiments on NYU and NYUCAD\ndatasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed iterative late fusion scheme,\nand our approach outperforms the state of the art on both 3D semantic scene\ncompletion and 2D semantic segmentation.",

We propose a new regularization\nmethod, which enables learning robust classifiers in presence of noisy data. To\nachieve this goal, we propose a new adversarial regularization scheme based on\nthe Wasserstein distance. Using this distance allows taking into account\nspecific relations between classes by leveraging the geometric properties of\nthe labels space. Our Wasserstein Adversarial Regularization (WAR) encodes a\nselective regularization, which promotes smoothness of the classifier between\nsome classes, while preserving sufficient complexity of the decision boundary\nbetween others. We first discuss how and why adversarial regularization can be\nused in the context of label noise and then show the effectiveness of our\nmethod on five datasets corrupted with noisy labels: in both benchmarks and\nreal datasets, WAR outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.",

          "description": "The thick-slice magnetic resonance (MR) images are often structurally blurred\nin coronal and sagittal views, which causes harm to diagnosis and image\npost-processing. Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential to re-construct\nthe high-resolution (HR) thin-slice MR images from those low-resolution (LR)\ncases, which we refer to as the slice interpolation task in this work. However,\nsince it is generally difficult to sample abundant paired LR-HR MR images, the\nclassical fully supervised DL-based models cannot be effectively trained to get\nrobust performance. To this end, we propose a novel Two-stage Self-supervised\nCycle-consistency Network (TSCNet) for MR slice interpolation, in which a\ntwo-stage self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy is developed for unsupervised\nDL network training. The paired LR-HR images are synthesized along the sagittal\nand coronal directions of input LR images for network pretraining in the\nfirst-stage SSL, and then a cyclic in-terpolation procedure based on triplet\naxial slices is designed in the second-stage SSL for further refinement. More\ntraining samples with rich contexts along all directions are exploited as\nguidance to guarantee the improved in-terpolation performance. Moreover, a new\ncycle-consistency constraint is proposed to supervise this cyclic procedure,\nwhich encourages the network to reconstruct more realistic HR images. The\nexperimental results on a real MRI dataset indicate that TSCNet achieves\nsuperior performance over the conventional and other SSL-based algorithms, and\nobtains competitive quali-tative and quantitative results compared with the\nfully supervised algorithm.",

          "description": "In the field of adversarial robustness, there is a common practice that\nadopts the single-step adversarial training for quickly developing\nadversarially robust models. However, the single-step adversarial training is\nmost likely to cause catastrophic overfitting, as after a few training epochs\nit will be hard to generate strong adversarial examples to continuously boost\nthe adversarial robustness. In this work, we aim to avoid the catastrophic\noverfitting by introducing multi-step adversarial examples during the\nsingle-step adversarial training. Then, to balance the large training overhead\nof generating multi-step adversarial examples, we propose a Multi-stage\nOptimization based Adversarial Training (MOAT) method that periodically trains\nthe model on mixed benign examples, single-step adversarial examples, and\nmulti-step adversarial examples stage by stage. In this way, the overall\ntraining overhead is reduced significantly, meanwhile, the model could avoid\ncatastrophic overfitting. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100\ndatasets demonstrate that under similar amount of training overhead, the\nproposed MOAT exhibits better robustness than either single-step or multi-step\nadversarial training methods.",

          "description": "Image inpainting is one of the important tasks in computer vision which\nfocuses on the reconstruction of missing regions in an image. The aim of this\npaper is to introduce an image inpainting model based on Wasserstein Generative\nAdversarial Imputation Network. The generator network of the model uses\nbuilding blocks of convolutional layers with different dilation rates, together\nwith skip connections that help the model reproduce fine details of the output.\nThis combination yields a universal imputation model that is able to handle\nvarious scenarios of missingness with sufficient quality. To show this\nexperimentally, the model is simultaneously trained to deal with three\nscenarios given by missing pixels at random, missing various smaller square\nregions, and one missing square placed in the center of the image. It turns out\nthat our model achieves high-quality inpainting results on all scenarios.\nPerformance is evaluated using peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural\nsimilarity index on two real-world benchmark datasets, CelebA faces and Paris\nStreetView. The results of our model are compared to biharmonic imputation and\nto some of the other state-of-the-art image inpainting methods.",

          "description": "We study a practical domain adaptation task, called source-free unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA) problem, in which we cannot access source domain data\ndue to data privacy issues but only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled\ntarget data are available. This task, however, is very difficult due to one key\nchallenge: the lack of source data and target domain labels makes model\nadaptation very challenging. To address this, we propose to mine the hidden\nknowledge in the source model and exploit it to generate source avatar\nprototypes (i.e., representative features for each source class) as well as\ntarget pseudo labels for domain alignment. To this end, we propose a\nContrastive Prototype Generation and Adaptation (CPGA) method. Specifically,\nCPGA consists of two stages: (1) prototype generation: by exploring the\nclassification boundary information of the source model, we train a prototype\ngenerator to generate avatar prototypes via contrastive learning. (2) prototype\nadaptation: based on the generated source prototypes and target pseudo labels,\nwe develop a new robust contrastive prototype adaptation strategy to align each\npseudo-labeled target data to the corresponding source prototypes. Extensive\nexperiments on three UDA benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of the proposed method.",

          "description": "With the goal of making deep learning more label-efficient, a growing number\nof papers have been studying active learning (AL) for deep models. However,\nthere are a number of issues in the prevalent experimental settings, mainly\nstemming from a lack of unified implementation and benchmarking. Issues in the\ncurrent literature include sometimes contradictory observations on the\nperformance of different AL algorithms, unintended exclusion of important\ngeneralization approaches such as data augmentation and SGD for optimization, a\nlack of study of evaluation facets like the labeling efficiency of AL, and\nlittle or no clarity on the scenarios in which AL outperforms random sampling\n(RS). In this work, we present a unified re-implementation of state-of-the-art\nAL algorithms in the context of image classification, and we carefully study\nthese issues as facets of effective evaluation. On the positive side, we show\nthat AL techniques are 2x to 4x more label-efficient compared to RS with the\nuse of data augmentation. Surprisingly, when data augmentation is included,\nthere is no longer a consistent gain in using BADGE, a state-of-the-art\napproach, over simple uncertainty sampling. We then do a careful analysis of\nhow existing approaches perform with varying amounts of redundancy and number\nof examples per class. Finally, we provide several insights for AL\npractitioners to consider in future work, such as the effect of the AL batch\nsize, the effect of initialization, the importance of retraining a new model at\nevery round, and other insights.",

While Monte Carlo techniques\nare classically used to sample from intractable posterior distributions, they\ncan suffer from scalability issues in high-dimensional inference problems such\nas image restoration. To address this issue, EP is used here to approximate the\nposterior distributions using products of multivariate Gaussian densities.\nMoreover, imposing structural constraints on the covariance matrices of these\ndensities allows for greater scalability and distributed computation. While the\nmethod is naturally suited to handle additive Gaussian observation noise, it\ncan also be extended to non-Gaussian noise.

We also assess the\nscalability of our method, looking at both the number and the size of the video\nstreams under scrutiny.

          "description": "3D model generation from single 2D RGB images is a challenging and actively\nresearched computer vision task. Various techniques using conventional network\narchitectures have been proposed for the same. However, the body of research\nwork is limited and there are various issues like using inefficient 3D\nrepresentation formats, weak 3D model generation backbones, inability to\ngenerate dense point clouds, dependence of post-processing for generation of\ndense point clouds, and dependence on silhouettes in RGB images. In this paper,\na novel 2D RGB image to point cloud conversion technique is proposed, which\nimproves the state of art in the field due to its efficient, robust and simple\nmodel by using the concept of parallelization in network architecture. It not\nonly uses the efficient and rich 3D representation of point clouds, but also\nuses a novel and robust point cloud generation backbone in order to address the\nprevalent issues. This involves using a single-encoder multiple-decoder deep\nnetwork architecture wherein each decoder generates certain fixed viewpoints.\nThis is followed by fusing all the viewpoints to generate a dense point cloud.\nVarious experiments are conducted on the technique and its performance is\ncompared with those of other state of the art techniques and impressive gains\nin performance are demonstrated.

          "description": "Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has developed into a prominent tool for\nadaptive, scale-based signal analysis in various fields like robotics, security\nand biomedical engineering. Since the dramatic increase in amount of data puts\nforward higher requirements for the capability of real-time signal analysis, it\nis difficult for existing EMD and its variants to trade off the growth of data\ndimension and the speed of signal analysis. In order to decompose\nmulti-dimensional signals at a faster speed, we present a novel\nsignal-serialization method (serial-EMD), which concatenates multi-variate or\nmulti-dimensional signals into a one-dimensional signal and uses various\none-dimensional EMD algorithms to decompose it. To verify the effects of the\nproposed method, synthetic multi-variate time series, artificial 2D images with\nvarious textures and real-world facial images are tested. Compared with\nexisting multi-EMD algorithms, the decomposition time becomes significantly\nreduced. In addition, the results of facial recognition with Intrinsic Mode\nFunctions (IMFs) extracted using our method can achieve a higher accuracy than\nthose obtained by existing multi-EMD algorithms, which demonstrates the\nsuperior performance of our method in terms of the quality of IMFs.\nFurthermore, this method can provide a new perspective to optimize the existing\nEMD algorithms, that is, transforming the structure of the input signal rather\nthan being constrained by developing envelope computation techniques or signal\ndecomposition methods. In summary, the study suggests that the serial-EMD\ntechnique is a highly competitive and fast alternative for multi-dimensional\nsignal analysis.",

In this paper, we\ndesign a similarity embedding neural network that maps input sensor signals\nonto real vectors through carefully designed convolutional and LSTM layers. The\nembedding network is trained with a pairwise similarity loss, encouraging the\nclustering of samples from the same class in the embedded real space, and can\nbe effectively trained on a small dataset and even on a noisy dataset with\nmislabeled samples. Based on the learned embeddings, we further propose both\nnonparametric and parametric approaches for activity recognition. Extensive\nevaluation based on two public datasets has shown that the proposed similarity\nembedding network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep models on HAR\nclassification tasks, is robust to mislabeled samples in the training set, and\ncan also be used to effectively denoise a noisy dataset.",

          "description": "We focus on electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), aiming to improve\naccess and expand their utility, since more than 6 million are publicly\navailable, and they constitute an important corpus to aid research and\neducation across disciplines. The corpus is growing as new born-digital\ndocuments are included, and since millions of older theses and dissertations\nhave been converted to digital form to be disseminated electronically in\ninstitutional repositories. In ETDs, as with other scholarly works, figures and\ntables can communicate a large amount of information in a concise way. Although\nmethods have been proposed for extracting figures and tables from born-digital\nPDFs, they do not work well with scanned ETDs. Considering this problem, our\nassessment of state-of-the-art figure extraction systems is that the reason\nthey do not function well on scanned PDFs is that they have only been trained\non born-digital documents. To address this limitation, we present ScanBank, a\nnew dataset containing 10 thousand scanned page images, manually labeled by\nhumans as to the presence of the 3.3 thousand figures or tables found therein.\nWe use this dataset to train a deep neural network model based on YOLOv5 to\naccurately extract figures and tables from scanned ETDs. We pose and answer\nimportant research questions aimed at finding better methods for figure\nextraction from scanned documents. One of those concerns the value for\ntraining, of data augmentation techniques applied to born-digital documents\nwhich are used to train models better suited for figure extraction from scanned\ndocuments. To the best of our knowledge, ScanBank is the first manually\nannotated dataset for figure and table extraction for scanned ETDs.

          "description": "Deep learning approaches are nowadays ubiquitously used to tackle computer\nvision tasks such as semantic segmentation, requiring large datasets and\nsubstantial computational power. Continual learning for semantic segmentation\n(CSS) is an emerging trend that consists in updating an old model by\nsequentially adding new classes. However, continual learning methods are\nusually prone to catastrophic forgetting. This issue is further aggravated in\nCSS where, at each step, old classes from previous iterations are collapsed\ninto the background. In this paper, we propose Local POD, a multi-scale pooling\ndistillation scheme that preserves long- and short-range spatial relationships\nat feature level. Furthermore, we design an entropy-based pseudo-labelling of\nthe background w.r.t. classes predicted by the old model to deal with\nbackground shift and avoid catastrophic forgetting of the old classes. Finally,\nwe introduce a novel rehearsal method that is particularly suited for\nsegmentation. Our approach, called PLOP, significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in existing CSS scenarios, as well as in newly\nproposed challenging benchmarks.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of predicting the future path of a pedestrian using\nits motion history and the motion history of the surrounding pedestrians,\ncalled social information. Since the seminal paper on Social-LSTM,\ndeep-learning has become the main tool used to model the impact of social\ninteractions on a pedestrian's motion. The demonstration that these models can\nlearn social interactions relies on an ablative study of these models. The\nmodels are compared with and without their social interactions module on two\nstandard metrics, the Average Displacement Error and Final Displacement Error.\nYet, these complex models were recently outperformed by a simple\nconstant-velocity approach. This questions if they actually allow to model\nsocial interactions as well as the validity of the proof. In this paper, we\nfocus on the deep-learning models with a soft-attention mechanism for social\ninteraction modeling and study whether they use social information at\nprediction time. We conduct two experiments across four state-of-the-art\napproaches on the ETH and UCY datasets, which were also used in previous work.\nFirst, the models are trained by replacing the social information with random\nnoise and compared to model trained with actual social information. Second, we\nuse a gating mechanism along with a $L_0$ penalty, allowing models to shut down\ntheir inner components. The models consistently learn to prune their\nsoft-attention mechanism. For both experiments, neither the course of the\nconvergence nor the prediction performance were altered. This demonstrates that\nthe soft-attention mechanism and therefore the social information are ignored\nby the models.",

Most of the current captioning metrics rely\non token level matching between candidate caption and the ground truth label\nsentences. It usually neglects the sentence-level information. Motivated by the\nauto-encoder mechanism and contrastive representation learning advances, we\npropose a learning-based metric for image captioning, which we call Intrinsic\nImage Captioning Evaluation($I^2CE$). We develop three progressive model\nstructures to learn the sentence level representations--single branch model,\ndual branches model, and triple branches model. Our empirical tests show that\n$I^2CE$ trained with dual branches structure achieves better consistency with\nhuman judgments to contemporary image captioning evaluation metrics.\nFurthermore, We select several state-of-the-art image captioning models and\ntest their performances on the MS COCO dataset concerning both contemporary\nmetrics and the proposed $I^2CE$. Experiment results show that our proposed\nmethod can align well with the scores generated from other contemporary\nmetrics.

          "description": "Domain generalization in person re-identification is a highly important\nmeaningful and practical task in which a model trained with data from several\nsource domains is expected to generalize well to unseen target domains. Domain\nadversarial learning is a promising domain generalization method that aims to\nremove domain information in the latent representation through adversarial\ntraining. However, in person re-identification, the domain and class are\ncorrelated, and we theoretically show that domain adversarial learning will\nlose certain information about class due to this domain-class correlation.\nInspired by casual inference, we propose to perform interventions to the domain\nfactor $d$, aiming to decompose the domain-class correlation. To achieve this\ngoal, we proposed estimating the resulting representation $z^{*}$ caused by the\nintervention through first- and second-order statistical characteristic\nmatching. Specifically, we build a memory bank to restore the statistical\ncharacteristics of each domain. Then, we use the newly generated samples\n$\\{z^{*},y,d^{*}\\}$ to compute the loss function. These samples are\ndomain-class correlation decomposed; thus, we can learn a domain-invariant\nrepresentation that can capture more class-related features.

This ability is of\ngreat importance in day-to-day work and special projects undertaken by\nplanners, geo-designers, and architects. In this research, we implemented a\nnovel approach to 3D building models for such matter, which included the\nintegration of geographic information systems (GIS) and 3D Computer Graphics\n(3DCG) components that generate 3D house models from building footprints\n(polygons), and the automated generation of simple and complex roof geometries\nfor rapid roof area damage reporting. These polygons (footprints) are usually\northogonal. A complicated orthogonal polygon can be partitioned into a set of\nrectangles. The proposed GIS and 3DCG integrated system partitions orthogonal\nbuilding polygons into a set of rectangles and places rectangular roofs and\nbox-shaped building bodies on these rectangles. Since technicians are drawing\nthese polygons manually with digitizers, depending on aerial photos, not all\nbuilding polygons are precisely orthogonal. But, when placing a set of boxes as\nbuilding bodies for creating the buildings, there may be gaps or overlaps\nbetween these boxes if building polygons are not precisely orthogonal. In our\nproposal, after approximately orthogonal building polygons are partitioned and\nrectified into a set of mutually orthogonal rectangles, each rectangle knows\nwhich rectangle is adjacent to and which edge of the rectangle is adjacent to,\nwhich will avoid unwanted intersection of windows and doors when building\nbodies combined.",

          "description": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been shown to be susceptible to memorization\nor overfitting in the presence of noisily labelled data. For the problem of\nrobust learning under such noisy data, several algorithms have been proposed. A\nprominent class of algorithms rely on sample selection strategies, motivated by\ncurriculum learning. For example, many algorithms use the `small loss trick'\nwherein a fraction of samples with loss values below a certain threshold are\nselected for training. These algorithms are sensitive to such thresholds, and\nit is difficult to fix or learn these thresholds. Often, these algorithms also\nrequire information such as label noise rates which are typically unavailable\nin practice. In this paper, we propose a data-dependent, adaptive sample\nselection strategy that relies only on batch statistics of a given mini-batch\nto provide robustness against label noise. The algorithm does not have any\nadditional hyperparameters for sample selection, does not need any information\non noise rates, and does not need access to separate data with clean labels. We\nempirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on benchmark\ndatasets.",

          "description": "Fusing live fluoroscopy images with a 3D rotational reconstruction of the\nvasculature allows to navigate endovascular devices in minimally invasive\nneuro-vascular treatment, while reducing the usage of harmful iodine contrast\nmedium. The alignment of the fluoroscopy images and the 3D reconstruction is\ninitialized using the sensor information of the X-ray C-arm geometry. Patient\nmotion is then corrected by an image-based registration algorithm, based on a\ngradient difference similarity measure using digital reconstructed radiographs\nof the 3D reconstruction. This algorithm does not require the vessels in the\nfluoroscopy image to be filled with iodine contrast agent, but rather relies on\ngradients in the image (bone structures, sinuses) as landmark features. This\npaper investigates the accuracy, robustness and computation time aspects of the\nimage-based registration algorithm. Using phantom experiments 97% of the\nregistration attempts passed the success criterion of a residual registration\nerror of less than 1 mm translation and 3{\\deg} rotation. The paper establishes\na new method for validation of 2D-3D registration without requiring changes to\nthe clinical workflow, such as attaching fiducial markers. As a consequence,\nthis method can be retrospectively applied to pre-existing clinical data. For\nclinical data experiments, 87% of the registration attempts passed the\ncriterion of a residual translational error of < 1 mm, and 84% possessed a\nrotational error of < 3{\\deg}.",

To solve this ill-posed problem\nfrom single image, state-of-the-art methods in shape from shading mostly resort\nto supervised training on all the components on either synthetic or real\ndatasets.

We introduce new self-supervised loss terms\nthat leverage the consistencies between multi-lit images (images of the same\nscene under different illuminations). Our approach is applicable to multi-lit\ndatasets. We apply our training approach in two settings: 1) train on a mixture\nof synthetic and real data, 2) train on real datasets with limited supervision.\nWe show-case the effectiveness of our training paradigm on both intrinsic\ndecomposition and relighting and demonstrate how the model struggles in both\ntasks without the self-supervised loss terms in limited supervision settings.\nWe provide results of comprehensive experiments on SfSNet, CelebA and Photoface\ndatasets and verify the performance of our approach on images in the wild.",

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks have been highly successful in image-based\nlearning tasks due to their translation equivariance property. Recent work has\ngeneralized the traditional convolutional layer of a convolutional neural\nnetwork to non-Euclidean spaces and shown group equivariance of the generalized\nconvolution operation. In this paper, we present a novel higher order Volterra\nconvolutional neural network (VolterraNet) for data defined as samples of\nfunctions on Riemannian homogeneous spaces. Analagous to the result for\ntraditional convolutions, we prove that the Volterra functional convolutions\nare equivariant to the action of the isometry group admitted by the Riemannian\nhomogeneous spaces, and under some restrictions, any non-linear equivariant\nfunction can be expressed as our homogeneous space Volterra convolution,\ngeneralizing the non-linear shift equivariant characterization of Volterra\nexpansions in Euclidean space. We also prove that second order functional\nconvolution operations can be represented as cascaded convolutions which leads\nto an efficient implementation. Beyond this, we also propose a dilated\nVolterraNet model. These advances lead to large parameter reductions relative\nto baseline non-Euclidean CNNs. To demonstrate the efficacy of the VolterraNet\nperformance, we present several real data experiments involving classification\ntasks on spherical-MNIST, atomic energy, Shrec17 data sets, and group testing\non diffusion MRI data.

          "description": "In sparse coding, we attempt to extract features of input vectors, assuming\nthat the data is inherently structured as a sparse superposition of basic\nbuilding blocks. Similarly, neural networks perform a given task by learning\nfeatures of the training data set. Recently both data-driven and model-driven\nfeature extracting methods have become extremely popular and have achieved\nremarkable results. Nevertheless, practical implementations are often too slow\nto be employed in real-life scenarios, especially for real-time applications.\nWe propose a speed-up upgraded version of the classic iterative thresholding\nalgorithm, that produces a good approximation of the convolutional sparse code\nwithin 2-5 iterations. The speed advantage is gained mostly from the\nobservation that most solvers are slowed down by inefficient global\nthresholding. The main idea is to normalize each data point by the local\nreceptive field energy, before applying a threshold. This way, the natural\ninclination towards strong feature expressions is suppressed, so that one can\nrely on a global threshold that can be easily approximated, or learned during\ntraining. The proposed algorithm can be employed with a known predetermined\ndictionary, or with a trained dictionary. The trained version is implemented as\na neural net designed as the unfolding of the proposed solver. The performance\nof the proposed solution is demonstrated via the seismic inversion problem in\nboth synthetic and real data scenarios. We also provide theoretical guarantees\nfor a stable support recovery. Namely, we prove that under certain conditions\nthe true support is perfectly recovered within the first iteration.",

          "description": "Temporal action detection (TAD) is a challenging task which aims to\ntemporally localize and recognize the human action in untrimmed videos. Current\nmainstream one-stage TAD approaches localize and classify action proposals\nrelying on pre-defined anchors, where the location and scale for action\ninstances are set by designers. Obviously, such an anchor-based TAD method\nlimits its generalization capability and will lead to performance degradation\nwhen videos contain rich action variation. In this study, we explore to remove\nthe requirement of pre-defined anchors for TAD methods. A novel TAD model\ntermed as Selective Receptive Field Network (SRF-Net) is developed, in which\nthe location offsets and classification scores at each temporal location can be\ndirectly estimated in the feature map and SRF-Net is trained in an end-to-end\nmanner. Innovatively, a building block called Selective Receptive Field\nConvolution (SRFC) is dedicatedly designed which is able to adaptively adjust\nits receptive field size according to multiple scales of input information at\neach temporal location in the feature map. Extensive experiments are conducted\non the THUMOS14 dataset, and superior results are reported comparing to\nstate-of-the-art TAD approaches.",

For example, for autonomous cars equipped with RGB cameras and\nLiDAR, it is crucial to fuse complementary information from different sensors\nfor robust and accurate segmentation. Existing fusion-based methods, however,\nmay not achieve promising performance due to the vast difference between two\nmodalities. In this work, we investigate a collaborative fusion scheme called\nperception-aware multi-sensor fusion (PMF) to exploit perceptual information\nfrom two modalities, namely, appearance information from RGB images and\nspatio-depth information from point clouds. To this end, we first project point\nclouds to the camera coordinates to provide spatio-depth information for RGB\nimages. Then, we propose a two-stream network to extract features from the two\nmodalities, separately, and fuse the features by effective residual-based\nfusion modules. Moreover, we propose additional perception-aware losses to\nmeasure the great perceptual difference between the two modalities. Extensive\nexperiments on two benchmark data sets show the superiority of our method. For\nexample, on nuScenes, our PMF outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.8%\nin mIoU.",

          "description": "Omnidirectional lighting provides the foundation for achieving\nspatially-variant photorealistic 3D rendering, a desirable property for mobile\naugmented reality applications. However, in practice, estimating\nomnidirectional lighting can be challenging due to limitations such as partial\npanoramas of the rendering positions, and the inherent environment lighting and\nmobile user dynamics. A new opportunity arises recently with the advancements\nin mobile 3D vision, including built-in high-accuracy depth sensors and deep\nlearning-powered algorithms, which provide the means to better sense and\nunderstand the physical surroundings. Centering the key idea of 3D vision, in\nthis work, we design an edge-assisted framework called Xihe to provide mobile\nAR applications the ability to obtain accurate omnidirectional lighting\nestimation in real time. Specifically, we develop a novel sampling technique\nthat efficiently compresses the raw point cloud input generated at the mobile\ndevice. This technique is derived based on our empirical analysis of a recent\n3D indoor dataset and plays a key role in our 3D vision-based lighting\nestimator pipeline design. To achieve the real-time goal, we develop a tailored\nGPU pipeline for on-device point cloud processing and use an encoding technique\nthat reduces network transmitted bytes. Finally, we present an adaptive\ntriggering strategy that allows Xihe to skip unnecessary lighting estimations\nand a practical way to provide temporal coherent rendering integration with the\nmobile AR ecosystem. We evaluate both the lighting estimation accuracy and time\nof Xihe using a reference mobile application developed with Xihe's APIs. Our\nresults show that Xihe takes as fast as 20.67ms per lighting estimation and\nachieves 9.4% better estimation accuracy than a state-of-the-art neural\nnetwork.",

          "description": "Depth perception is fundamental for robots to understand the surrounding\nenvironment. As the view of cognitive neuroscience, visual depth perception\nmethods are divided into three categories, namely binocular, active, and\npictorial. The first two categories have been studied for decades in detail.\nHowever, research for the exploration of the third category is still in its\ninfancy and has got momentum by the advent of deep learning methods in recent\nyears. In cognitive neuroscience, it is known that pictorial depth perception\nmechanisms are dependent on the perception of seen objects. Inspired by this\nfact, in this thesis, we investigated the relation of perception of objects and\ndepth estimation convolutional neural networks. For this purpose, we developed\nnew network structures based on a simple depth estimation network that only\nused a single image at its input. Our proposed structures use both an image and\na semantic label of the image as their input. We used semantic labels as the\noutput of object perception. The obtained results of performance comparison\nbetween the developed network and original network showed that our novel\nstructures can improve the performance of depth estimation by 52\\% of relative\nerror of distance in the examined cases. Most of the experimental studies were\ncarried out on synthetic datasets that were generated by game engines to\nisolate the performance comparison from the effect of inaccurate depth and\nsemantic labels of non-synthetic datasets. It is shown that particular\nsynthetic datasets may be used for training of depth networks in cases that an\nappropriate dataset is not available. Furthermore, we showed that in these\ncases, usage of semantic labels improves the robustness of the network against\ndomain shift from synthetic training data to non-synthetic test data.",

We introduce a novel downsampling upsampling architecture named\nTUCaN (Tiny UCapsNet) that exploits the collaboration of convolutional layers\nand capsule layers to obtain a neat colourisation of entities present in every\nsingle image. This is obtained by enforcing collaboration among such layers by\nskip and residual connections.

To\ntrain the network, in contrast with the standard end to end learning method, we\npropose the progressive learning scheme to extract the context of objects by\nonly manipulating the learning process without changing the model. In this\nscheme, the upsampling starts from the reconstruction of low resolution images\nand progressively grows to high resolution images throughout the training\nphase. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our approach\nwith ImageNet10k dataset outperforms existing methods on standard quality\nmetrics and achieves state of the art performances on image colourisation.

To take advantage of the\nlabeled examples and guide unlabeled data learning, we further propose a mask\ngeneration module to generate high-quality pseudo masks for the unlabeled data.\nAlong with supervised learning for labeled data, the prediction of unlabeled\ndata is jointly learned with the generated pseudo masks from the mixed data.\nExtensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context and Cityscapes\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our GuidedMix-Net, which achieves competitive\nsegmentation accuracy and significantly improves the mIoU by +7$\\%$ compared to\nprevious state-of-the-art approaches.",

          "description": "Visual recognition tasks are often limited to dealing with a small subset of\nclasses simply because the labels for the remaining classes are unavailable. We\nare interested in identifying novel concepts in a dataset through\nrepresentation learning based on the examples in both labeled and unlabeled\nclasses, and extending the horizon of recognition to both known and novel\nclasses. To address this challenging task, we propose a combinatorial learning\napproach, which naturally clusters the examples in unseen classes using the\ncompositional knowledge given by multiple supervised meta-classifiers on\nheterogeneous label spaces. We also introduce a metric learning strategy to\nestimate pairwise pseudo-labels for improving representations of unlabeled\nexamples, which preserves semantic relations across known and novel classes\neffectively. The proposed algorithm discovers novel concepts via a joint\noptimization of enhancing the discrimitiveness of unseen classes as well as\nlearning the representations of known classes generalizable to novel ones. Our\nextensive experiments demonstrate remarkable performance gains by the proposed\napproach in multiple image retrieval and novel class discovery benchmarks.",

There is a rich space of object-object\ninteraction scenarios in our daily life, such as placing an object on a messy\ntabletop, fitting an object inside a drawer, pushing an object using a tool,\netc. In this paper, we propose a unified affordance learning framework to learn\nobject-object interaction for various tasks.

          "description": "Deep learning based image recognition systems have been widely deployed on\nmobile devices in today's world. In recent studies, however, deep learning\nmodels are shown vulnerable to adversarial examples. One variant of adversarial\nexamples, called adversarial patch, draws researchers' attention due to its\nstrong attack abilities. Though adversarial patches achieve high attack success\nrates, they are easily being detected because of the visual inconsistency\nbetween the patches and the original images. Besides, it usually requires a\nlarge amount of data for adversarial patch generation in the literature, which\nis computationally expensive and time-consuming. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose an approach to generate inconspicuous adversarial patches with one\nsingle image. In our approach, we first decide the patch locations basing on\nthe perceptual sensitivity of victim models, then produce adversarial patches\nin a coarse-to-fine way by utilizing multiple-scale generators and\ndiscriminators. The patches are encouraged to be consistent with the background\nimages with adversarial training while preserving strong attack abilities. Our\napproach shows the strong attack abilities in white-box settings and the\nexcellent transferability in black-box settings through extensive experiments\non various models with different architectures and training methods. Compared\nto other adversarial patches, our adversarial patches hold the most negligible\nrisks to be detected and can evade human observations, which is supported by\nthe illustrations of saliency maps and results of user evaluations. Lastly, we\nshow that our adversarial patches can be applied in the physical world.",

Moreover, we propose a method to estimate\nthe number of classes for the case where the number of new categories is not\nknown a priori.

Despite its\npervasiveness, we have a poor understanding of what its effectiveness stems\nfrom. It is popularly believed that its effectiveness stems from the visual\nattention explanation, advocating focusing on the important part of input data\nrather than ingesting the entire input. In this paper, we find that there is\nonly a weak consistency between the attention weights of features and their\nimportance. Instead, we verify the crucial role of feature map multiplication\nin attention mechanism and uncover a fundamental impact of feature map\nmultiplication on the learned landscapes of CNNs: with the high order\nnon-linearity brought by the feature map multiplication, it played a\nregularization role on CNNs, which made them learn smoother and more stable\nlandscapes near real samples compared to vanilla CNNs. This smoothness and\nstability induce a more predictive and stable behavior in-between real samples,\nand make CNNs generate better. Moreover, motivated by the proposed\neffectiveness of feature map multiplication, we design feature map\nmultiplication network (FMMNet) by simply replacing the feature map addition in\nResNet with feature map multiplication. FMMNet outperforms ResNet on various\ndatasets, and this indicates that feature map multiplication plays a vital role\nin improving the performance even without finely designed attention mechanism\nin existing methods.",

In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of face recognition models\nusing adversarial patches based on transferability, where the attacker has\nlimited accessibility to the target models. First, we extend the existing\ntransfer-based attack techniques to generate transferable adversarial patches.\nHowever, we observe that the transferability is sensitive to initialization and\ndegrades when the perturbation magnitude is large, indicating the overfitting\nto the substitute models. Second, we propose to regularize the adversarial\npatches on the low dimensional data manifold. The manifold is represented by\ngenerative models pre-trained on legitimate human face images. Using face-like\nfeatures as adversarial perturbations through optimization on the manifold, we\nshow that the gaps between the responses of substitute models and the target\nmodels dramatically decrease, exhibiting a better transferability.

          "description": "This paper studies construction of above-ground biomass (AGB) prediction maps\nfrom synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images. The purpose is to improve\ntraditional regression models based on SAR intensity, trained with a limited\namount of AGB in situ measurements. Although it is costly to collect, data from\nairborne laser scanning (ALS) sensors are highly correlated with AGB.\nTherefore, we propose using AGB predictions based on ALS data as surrogate\nresponse variables for SAR data in a sequential modelling fashion. This\nincreases the amount of training data dramatically. To model the regression\nfunction between SAR intensity and ALS-predicted AGB we propose to utilise a\nconditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), i.e. the Pix2Pix\nconvolutional neural network. This enables the recreation of existing ALS-based\nAGB prediction maps. The generated synthesised ALS-based AGB predictions are\nevaluated qualitatively and quantitatively against ALS-based AGB predictions\nretrieved from a traditional non-sequential regression model trained in the\nsame area. Results show that the proposed architecture manages to capture\ncharacteristics of the actual data. This suggests that the use of ALS-guided\ngenerative models is a promising avenue for AGB prediction from SAR intensity.\nFurther research on this area has the potential of providing both large-scale\nand low-cost predictions of AGB.",

          "description": "The unprecedented performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to large\nstrides in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference tasks, such as object\nand speech recognition. Nevertheless, deploying such AI models across commodity\ndevices faces significant challenges: large computational cost, multiple\nperformance objectives, hardware heterogeneity and a common need for high\naccuracy, together pose critical problems to the deployment of DNNs across the\nvarious embedded and mobile devices in the wild. As such, we have yet to\nwitness the mainstream usage of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms\nacross consumer devices. In this paper, we provide preliminary answers to this\npotentially game-changing question by presenting an array of design techniques\nfor efficient AI systems. We start by examining the major roadblocks when\ntargeting both programmable processors and custom accelerators. Then, we\npresent diverse methods for achieving real-time performance following a\ncross-stack approach. These span model-, system- and hardware-level techniques,\nand their combination. Our findings provide illustrative examples of AI systems\nthat do not overburden mobile hardware, while also indicating how they can\nimprove inference accuracy. Moreover, we showcase how custom ASIC- and\nFPGA-based accelerators can be an enabling factor for next-generation AI\napplications, such as multi-DNN systems. Collectively, these results highlight\nthe critical need for further exploration as to how the various cross-stack\nsolutions can be best combined in order to bring the latest advances in deep\nlearning close to users, in a robust and efficient manner.",

          "description": "The rapid rise of accessibility of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones pose a\nthreat to general security and confidentiality. Most of the commercially\navailable or custom-built drones are multi-rotors and are comprised of multiple\npropellers. Since these propellers rotate at a high-speed, they are generally\nthe fastest moving parts of an image and cannot be directly \"seen\" by a\nclassical camera without severe motion blur. We utilize a class of sensors that\nare particularly suitable for such scenarios called event cameras, which have a\nhigh temporal resolution, low-latency, and high dynamic range.\n\nIn this paper, we model the geometry of a propeller and use it to generate\nsimulated events which are used to train a deep neural network called EVPropNet\nto detect propellers from the data of an event camera. EVPropNet directly\ntransfers to the real world without any fine-tuning or retraining. We present\ntwo applications of our network: (a) tracking and following an unmarked drone\nand (b) landing on a near-hover drone. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate\nthe proposed approach in many real-world experiments with different propeller\nshapes and sizes. Our network can detect propellers at a rate of 85.1% even\nwhen 60% of the propeller is occluded and can run at upto 35Hz on a 2W power\nbudget. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based solution for\ndetecting propellers (to detect drones). Finally, our applications also show an\nimpressive success rate of 92% and 90% for the tracking and landing tasks\nrespectively.",

          "description": "For distant iris recognition, a long focal length lens is generally used to\nensure the resolution ofiris images, which reduces the depth of field and leads\nto potential defocus blur. To accommodate users at different distances, it is\nnecessary to control focus quickly and accurately. While for users in motion,\nit is expected to maintain the correct focus on the iris area continuously. In\nthis paper, we introduced a novel rapid autofocus camera for active refocusing\nofthe iris area ofthe moving objects using a focus-tunable lens. Our end-to-end\ncomputational algorithm can predict the best focus position from one single\nblurred image and generate a lens diopter control signal automatically. This\nscene-based active manipulation method enables real-time focus tracking of the\niris area ofa moving object. We built a testing bench to collect real-world\nfocal stacks for evaluation of the autofocus methods. Our camera has reached an\nautofocus speed ofover 50 fps.

          "description": "Class imbalance is a fundamental problem in computer vision applications such\nas semantic segmentation. Specifically, uneven class distributions in a\ntraining dataset often result in unsatisfactory performance on\nunder-represented classes. Many works have proposed to weight the standard\ncross entropy loss function with pre-computed weights based on class\nstatistics, such as the number of samples and class margins. There are two\nmajor drawbacks to these methods: 1) constantly up-weighting minority classes\ncan introduce excessive false positives in semantic segmentation; 2) a minority\nclass is not necessarily a hard class. The consequence is low precision due to\nexcessive false positives. In this regard, we propose a hard-class mining loss\nby reshaping the vanilla cross entropy loss such that it weights the loss for\neach class dynamically based on instantaneous recall performance. We show that\nthe novel recall loss changes gradually between the standard cross entropy loss\nand the inverse frequency weighted loss. Recall loss also leads to improved\nmean accuracy while offering competitive mean Intersection over Union (IoU)\nperformance. On Synthia dataset, recall loss achieves 9% relative improvement\non mean accuracy with competitive mean IoU using DeepLab-ResNet18 compared to\nthe cross entropy loss.

          "description": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has lately attracted increasing attention due to its\nvital role in securing face recognition systems from presentation attacks\n(PAs).

With the emergence of large-scale academic\ndatasets in the recent decade, deep learning based FAS achieves remarkable\nperformance and dominates this area. However, existing reviews in this field\nmainly focus on the handcrafted features, which are outdated and uninspiring\nfor the progress of FAS community.

These networks are often trained\nend-to-end to directly reconstruct an image from a noisy or corrupted\nmeasurement of that image. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, training on\nlarge and diverse sets of images is considered critical. However, it is often\ndifficult and/or expensive to collect large amounts of training images.\nInspired by the success of Data Augmentation (DA) for classification problems,\nin this paper, we propose a pipeline for data augmentation for accelerated MRI\nreconstruction and study its effectiveness at reducing the required training\ndata in a variety of settings. Our DA pipeline, MRAugment, is specifically\ndesigned to utilize the invariances present in medical imaging measurements as\nnaive DA strategies that neglect the physics of the problem fail. Through\nextensive studies on multiple datasets we demonstrate that in the low-data\nregime DA prevents overfitting and can match or even surpass the state of the\nart while using significantly fewer training data, whereas in the high-data\nregime it has diminishing returns. Furthermore, our findings show that DA can\nimprove the robustness of the model against various shifts in the test\ndistribution.",

          "description": "Novel view synthesis is a long-standing problem in machine learning and\ncomputer vision. Significant progress has recently been made in developing\nneural scene representations and rendering techniques that synthesize\nphotorealistic images from arbitrary views. These representations, however, are\nextremely slow to train and often also slow to render. Inspired by neural\nvariants of image-based rendering, we develop a new neural rendering approach\nwith the goal of quickly learning a high-quality representation which can also\nbe rendered in real-time. Our approach, MetaNLR++, accomplishes this by using a\nunique combination of a neural shape representation and 2D CNN-based image\nfeature extraction, aggregation, and re-projection. To push representation\nconvergence times down to minutes, we leverage meta learning to learn neural\nshape and image feature priors which accelerate training. The optimized shape\nand image features can then be extracted using traditional graphics techniques\nand rendered in real time. We show that MetaNLR++ achieves similar or better\nnovel view synthesis results in a fraction of the time that competing methods\nrequire.",

          "description": "We present a novel multi-view training framework and CNN architecture for\ncombining information from multiple overlapping satellite images and noisy\ntraining labels derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to semantically label\nbuildings and roads across large geographic regions (100 km$^2$). Our approach\nto multi-view semantic segmentation yields a 4-7% improvement in the per-class\nIoU scores compared to the traditional approaches that use the views\nindependently of one another. A unique (and, perhaps, surprising) property of\nour system is that modifications that are added to the tail-end of the CNN for\nlearning from the multi-view data can be discarded at the time of inference\nwith a relatively small penalty in the overall performance. This implies that\nthe benefits of training using multiple views are absorbed by all the layers of\nthe network. Additionally, our approach only adds a small overhead in terms of\nthe GPU-memory consumption even when training with as many as 32 views per\nscene. The system we present is end-to-end automated, which facilitates\ncomparing the classifiers trained directly on true orthophotos vis-a-vis first\ntraining them on the off-nadir images and subsequently translating the\npredicted labels to geographical coordinates. With no human supervision, our\nIoU scores for the buildings and roads classes are 0.8 and 0.64 respectively\nwhich are better than state-of-the-art approaches that use OSM labels and that\nare not completely automated.",

However, existing works only proposed some attention\nmechanism for a specific network. A universal attention mechanism for SISR,\nwhich could further improve the performance of networks without attention and\nprovide a baseline for networks with attention, is still lacking. To fit this\ngap, we propose a lightweight and efficient Balanced Attention Mechanism (BAM),\nwhich consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and Maxpool Spatial\nAttention Module (MSAM) in parallel. The information extraction mechanism of\nACAM and MSAM effectively filters redundant information, making the overall\nstructure of BAM very lightweight. Owing to the parallel structure, during the\ngradient backpropagation process of BAM, ACAM and MSAM not only conduct\nself-optimization, but also mutual optimization so as to generate more balanced\nattention information. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we\napplied it to 12 state-ofthe-art SISR networks. The results on 4 benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that BAM can efficiently improve the networks'\nperformance, and for those with attention, the substitution with BAM further\nreduces the amount of parameters and increase the inference speed.

Our model is a conditional variational autoencoder that can\nbe animated with incomplete driving signals, such as human pose and facial\nkeypoints, and produces a high-quality representation of human geometry and\nview-dependent appearance. The core intuition behind our method is that better\ndrivability and generalization can be achieved by disentangling the driving\nsignals and remaining generative factors, which are not available during\nanimation. To this end, we explicitly account for information deficiency in the\ndriving signal by introducing a latent space that exclusively captures the\nremaining information, thus enabling the imputation of the missing factors\nrequired during full-body animation, while remaining faithful to the driving\nsignal. We also propose a learnable localized compression for the driving\nsignal which promotes better generalization, and helps minimize the influence\nof global chance-correlations often found in real datasets. For a given driving\nsignal, the resulting variational model produces a compact space of uncertainty\nfor missing factors that allows for an imputation strategy best suited to a\nparticular application. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the\nchallenging problem of full-body animation for virtual telepresence with\ndriving signals acquired from minimal sensors placed in the environment and\nmounted on a VR-headset.",

          "description": "The transformer networks are particularly good at modeling long-range\ndependencies within a long sequence. In this paper, we conduct research on\napplying the transformer networks for salient object detection (SOD). We adopt\nthe dense transformer backbone for fully supervised RGB image based SOD, RGB-D\nimage pair based SOD, and weakly supervised SOD within a unified framework\nbased on the observation that the transformer backbone can provide accurate\nstructure modeling, which makes it powerful in learning from weak labels with\nless structure information. Further, we find that the vision transformer\narchitectures do not offer direct spatial supervision, instead encoding\nposition as a feature. Therefore, we investigate the contributions of two\nstrategies to provide stronger spatial supervision through the transformer\nlayers within our unified framework, namely deep supervision and\ndifficulty-aware learning. We find that deep supervision can get gradients back\ninto the higher level features, thus leads to uniform activation within the\nsame semantic object. Difficulty-aware learning on the other hand is capable of\nidentifying the hard pixels for effective hard negative mining. We also\nvisualize features of conventional backbone and transformer backbone before and\nafter fine-tuning them for SOD, and find that transformer backbone encodes more\naccurate object structure information and more distinct semantic information\nwithin the lower and higher level features respectively. We also apply our\nmodel to camouflaged object detection (COD) and achieve similar observations as\nthe above three SOD tasks. Extensive experimental results on various SOD and\nCOD tasks illustrate that transformer networks can transform SOD and COD,\nleading to new benchmarks for each related task.

          "description": "The costly process of obtaining semantic segmentation labels has driven\nresearch towards weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods, using\nonly image-level, point, or box labels. The lack of dense scene representation\nrequires methods to increase complexity to obtain additional semantic\ninformation about the scene, often done through multiple stages of training and\nrefinement. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models leverage image-level labels\nto produce class activation maps (CAMs) which go through multiple stages of\nrefinement before they are thresholded to make pseudo-masks for supervision.\nThe multi-stage approach is computationally expensive, and dependency on\nimage-level labels for CAMs generation lacks generalizability to more complex\nscenes. In contrary, our method offers a single-stage approach generalizable to\narbitrary dataset, that is trainable from scratch, without any dependency on\npre-trained backbones, classification, or separate refinement tasks. We utilize\npoint annotations to generate reliable, on-the-fly pseudo-masks through refined\nand filtered features. While our method requires point annotations that are\nonly slightly more expensive than image-level annotations, we are to\ndemonstrate SOTA performance on benchmark datasets (PascalVOC 2012), as well as\nsignificantly outperform other SOTA WSSS methods on recent real-world datasets\n(CRAID, CityPersons, IAD).",

          "description": "Channel Pruning has been long studied to compress CNNs for efficient image\nclassification. Prior works implement channel pruning in an unexplainable\nmanner, which tends to reduce the final classification errors while failing to\nconsider the internal influence of each channel. In this paper, we conduct\nchannel pruning in a white box. Through deep visualization of feature maps\nactivated by different channels, we observe that different channels have a\nvarying contribution to different categories in image classification. Inspired\nby this, we choose to preserve channels contributing to most categories.\nSpecifically, to model the contribution of each channel to differentiating\ncategories, we develop a class-wise mask for each channel, implemented in a\ndynamic training manner w.r.t. the input image's category. On the basis of the\nlearned class-wise mask, we perform a global voting mechanism to remove\nchannels with less category discrimination. Lastly, a fine-tuning process is\nconducted to recover the performance of the pruned model. To our best\nknowledge, it is the first time that CNN interpretability theory is considered\nto guide channel pruning. Extensive experiments on representative image\nclassification tasks demonstrate the superiority of our White-Box over many\nstate-of-the-arts. For instance, on CIFAR-10, it reduces 65.23% FLOPs with even\n0.62% accuracy improvement for ResNet-110. On ILSVRC-2012, White-Box achieves a\n45.6% FLOPs reduction with only a small loss of 0.83% in the top-1 accuracy for\nResNet-50.",

As a new type of image\nprocessing technology, perceptual image processing algorithms based on\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have produced images with more realistic\ntextures. These output images have completely different characteristics from\ntraditional distortions, thus pose a new challenge for IQA methods to evaluate\ntheir visual quality. In comparison with previous IQA challenges, the training\nand testing datasets in this challenge include the outputs of perceptual image\nprocessing algorithms and the corresponding subjective scores. Thus they can be\nused to develop and evaluate IQA methods on GAN-based distortions. The\nchallenge has 270 registered participants in total. In the final testing stage,\n13 participating teams submitted their models and fact sheets. Almost all of\nthem have achieved much better results than existing IQA methods, while the\nwinning method can demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.",

          "description": "A table arranging data in rows and columns is a very effective data\nstructure, which has been widely used in business and scientific research.\nConsidering large-scale tabular data in online and offline documents, automatic\ntable recognition has attracted increasing attention from the document analysis\ncommunity. Though human can easily understand the structure of tables, it\nremains a challenge for machines to understand that, especially due to a\nvariety of different table layouts and styles. Existing methods usually model a\ntable as either the markup sequence or the adjacency matrix between different\ntable cells, failing to address the importance of the logical location of table\ncells, e.g., a cell is located in the first row and the second column of the\ntable. In this paper, we reformulate the problem of table structure recognition\nas the table graph reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end trainable table\ngraph reconstruction network (TGRNet) for table structure recognition.\nSpecifically, the proposed method has two main branches, a cell detection\nbranch and a cell logical location branch, to jointly predict the spatial\nlocation and the logical location of different cells. Experimental results on\nthree popular table recognition datasets and a new dataset with table graph\nannotations (TableGraph-350K) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nTGRNet for table structure recognition. Code and annotations will be made\npublicly available.",

While making a\nprediction, the human brain tends to relate crucial cues from multiple sources\nof information. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal fusion module that\nlearns to emphasize more contributive features across all modalities.\nSpecifically, the proposed Multimodal Split Attention Fusion (MSAF) module\nsplits each modality into channel-wise equal feature blocks and creates a joint\nrepresentation that is used to generate soft attention for each channel across\nthe feature blocks. Further, the MSAF module is designed to be compatible with\nfeatures of various spatial dimensions and sequence lengths, suitable for both\nCNNs and RNNs. Thus, MSAF can be easily added to fuse features of any unimodal\nnetworks and utilize existing pretrained unimodal model weights. To demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our fusion module, we design three multimodal networks\nwith MSAF for emotion recognition, sentiment analysis, and action recognition\ntasks.

Adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) provides\nreal-time retinal images with resolution down to 2 $\\mu m$ and thus allows\ndetection of the morphologies of individual MAs, a potential marker that might\ndictate MA pathology and affect the progression of DR. In contrast to the\nnumerous automatic models developed for assessing the number of MAs on fundus\nphotographs, currently there is no high throughput image protocol available for\nautomatic analysis of AOSLO photographs. To address this urgency, we introduce\nAOSLO-net, a deep neural network framework with customized training policies to\nautomatically segment MAs from AOSLO images.

          "description": "Transformer, which can benefit from global (long-range) information modeling\nusing self-attention mechanisms, has been successful in natural language\nprocessing and 2D image classification recently. However, both local and global\nfeatures are crucial for dense prediction tasks, especially for 3D medical\nimage segmentation. In this paper, we for the first time exploit Transformer in\n3D CNN for MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation and propose a novel network named\nTransBTS based on the encoder-decoder structure. To capture the local 3D\ncontext information, the encoder first utilizes 3D CNN to extract the\nvolumetric spatial feature maps. Meanwhile, the feature maps are reformed\nelaborately for tokens that are fed into Transformer for global feature\nmodeling. The decoder leverages the features embedded by Transformer and\nperforms progressive upsampling to predict the detailed segmentation map.\nExtensive experimental results on both BraTS 2019 and 2020 datasets show that\nTransBTS achieves comparable or higher results than previous state-of-the-art\n3D methods for brain tumor segmentation on 3D MRI scans.

As ground-truth labels are often missing or expensive\nto obtain in neuroscience, we avoid them in our analysis by combing factor\ndisentanglement with self-supervised learning to identify changes and\nconsistencies across the multiple MRIs acquired of each individual over time.\nSpecifically, we propose a new definition of disentanglement by formulating a\nmultivariate mapping between factors (e.g., brain age) associated with an MRI\nand a latent image representation. Then, factors that evolve across\nacquisitions of longitudinal sequences are disentangled from that mapping by\nself-supervised learning in such a way that changes in a single factor induce\nchange along one direction in the representation space. We implement this\nmodel, named Longitudinal Self-Supervised Learning (LSSL), via a standard\nautoencoding structure with a cosine loss to disentangle brain age from the\nimage representation. We apply LSSL to two longitudinal neuroimaging studies to\nhighlight its strength in extracting the brain-age information from MRI and\nrevealing informative characteristics associated with neurodegenerative and\nneuropsychological disorders. Moreover, the representations learned by LSSL\nfacilitate supervised classification by recording faster convergence and higher\n(or similar) prediction accuracy compared to several other representation\nlearning techniques.",

          "description": "In most existing learning systems, images are typically viewed as 2D pixel\narrays. However, in another paradigm gaining popularity, a 2D image is\nrepresented as an implicit neural representation (INR) - an MLP that predicts\nan RGB pixel value given its (x,y) coordinate. In this paper, we propose two\nnovel architectural techniques for building INR-based image decoders:\nfactorized multiplicative modulation and multi-scale INRs, and use them to\nbuild a state-of-the-art continuous image GAN. Previous attempts to adapt INRs\nfor image generation were limited to MNIST-like datasets and do not scale to\ncomplex real-world data. Our proposed INR-GAN architecture improves the\nperformance of continuous image generators by several times, greatly reducing\nthe gap between continuous image GANs and pixel-based ones. Apart from that, we\nexplore several exciting properties of the INR-based decoders, like\nout-of-the-box superresolution, meaningful image-space interpolation,\naccelerated inference of low-resolution images, an ability to extrapolate\noutside of image boundaries, and strong geometric prior.

However, for simple fixed\nstructured objects like license plates, this approach becomes overkill and\nlengthy to run. This work aims to solve this detect-and-read problem in a\nlightweight way by integrating multi-digit recognition into a one-stage object\ndetection model. Our unified method not only eliminates the duplication in\nfeature extraction (one for localizing, one again for classifying) but also\nprovides useful contextual information around object regions for\nclassification. Additionally, our choice of backbones and modifications in\narchitecture, loss function, data augmentation and training make the method\nrobust, efficient and speedy. Secondly, we made a public benchmark dataset of\ndiverse real-life 1D barcodes for a reliable evaluation, which we collected,\nannotated and checked carefully. Eventually, experimental results prove the\nmethod's efficiency on the barcode problem by outperforming industrial tools in\nboth detecting and decoding rates with a real-time fps at a VGA-similar\nresolution.

An ideal visual system needs to recognize the populated head\nvisual concepts reliably and meanwhile efficiently learn about emerging new\ntail categories with a few training instances. Class-balanced many-shot\nlearning and few-shot learning tackle one side of this problem, by either\nlearning strong classifiers for head or learning to learn few-shot classifiers\nfor the tail. In this paper, we investigate the problem of generalized few-shot\nlearning (GFSL) -- a model during the deployment is required to learn about\ntail categories with few shots and simultaneously classify the head classes. We\npropose the ClAssifier SynThesis LEarning (CASTLE), a learning framework that\nlearns how to synthesize calibrated few-shot classifiers in addition to the\nmulti-class classifiers of head classes with a shared neural dictionary,\nshedding light upon the inductive GFSL. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive\nversion of CASTLE (ACASTLE) that adapts the head classifiers conditioned on the\nincoming tail training examples, yielding a framework that allows effective\nbackward knowledge transfer. As a consequence, ACASTLE can handle GFSL with\nclasses from heterogeneous domains effectively.

          "description": "Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a classification task that points to\nface variants. Hence, there are certain affinity features between facial\nexpressions, receiving little attention in the FER literature. Convolution\npadding, despite helping capture the edge information, causes erosion of the\nfeature map simultaneously. After multi-layer filling convolution, the output\nfeature map named albino feature definitely weakens the representation of the\nexpression. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel architecture named\nAmending Representation Module (ARM). ARM is a substitute for the pooling\nlayer. Theoretically, it can be embedded in the back end of any network to deal\nwith the Padding Erosion. ARM efficiently enhances facial expression\nrepresentation from two different directions: 1) reducing the weight of eroded\nfeatures to offset the side effect of padding, and 2) sharing affinity features\nover mini-batch to strengthen the representation learning. Experiments on\npublic benchmarks prove that our ARM boosts the performance of FER remarkably.\nThe validation accuracies are respectively 92.05% on RAF-DB, 65.2% on\nAffect-Net, and 58.71% on SFEW, exceeding current state-of-the-art methods.

Current face databases are specifically\nconstructed for the development of face recognition applications. Consequently,\nthese databases contain large amount of face images but lack in the number of\nattribute annotations and the overall annotation correctness. In this work, we\npropose MAADFace, a new face annotations database that is characterized by the\nlarge number of its high-quality attribute annotations. MAADFace is build on\nthe VGGFace2 database and thus, consists of 3.3M faces of over 9k individuals.\nUsing a novel annotation transfer-pipeline that allows an accurate\nlabel-transfer from multiple source-datasets to a target-dataset, MAAD-Face\nconsists of 123.9M attribute annotations of 47 different binary attributes.\nConsequently, it provides 15 and 137 times more attribute labels than CelebA\nand LFW. Our investigation on the annotation quality by three human evaluators\ndemonstrated the superiority of the MAAD-Face annotations over existing\ndatabases. Additionally, we make use of the large amount of high-quality\nannotations from MAAD-Face to study the viability of soft-biometrics for\nrecognition, providing insights about which attributes support genuine and\nimposter decisions.

          "description": "Semantic segmentation has made tremendous progress in recent years. However,\nsatisfying performance highly depends on a large number of pixel-level\nannotations. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the semi-supervised\nsegmentation problem where only a small set of labeled data is provided with a\nmuch larger collection of totally unlabeled images. Nevertheless, due to the\nlimited annotations, models may overly rely on the contexts available in the\ntraining data, which causes poor generalization to the scenes unseen before. A\npreferred high-level representation should capture the contextual information\nwhile not losing self-awareness. Therefore, we propose to maintain the\ncontext-aware consistency between features of the same identity but with\ndifferent contexts, making the representations robust to the varying\nenvironments. Moreover, we present the Directional Contrastive Loss (DC Loss)\nto accomplish the consistency in a pixel-to-pixel manner, only requiring the\nfeature with lower quality to be aligned towards its counterpart. In addition,\nto avoid the false-negative samples and filter the uncertain positive samples,\nwe put forward two sampling strategies.

          "description": "Accelerating multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a new and\neffective solution for fast MR imaging, providing superior performance in\nrestoring the target modality from its undersampled counterpart with guidance\nfrom an auxiliary modality. However, existing works simply introduce the\nauxiliary modality as prior information, lacking in-depth investigations on the\npotential mechanisms for fusing two modalities. Further, they usually rely on\nthe convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which focus on local information and\nprevent them from fully capturing the long-distance dependencies of global\nknowledge. To this end, we propose a multi-modal transformer (MTrans), which is\ncapable of transferring multi-scale features from the target modality to the\nauxiliary modality, for accelerated MR imaging. By restructuring the\ntransformer architecture, our MTrans gains a powerful ability to capture deep\nmulti-modal information. More specifically, the target modality and the\nauxiliary modality are first split into two branches and then fused using a\nmulti-modal transformer module. This module is based on an improved multi-head\nattention mechanism, named the cross attention module, which absorbs features\nfrom the auxiliary modality that contribute to the target modality. Our\nframework provides two appealing benefits: (i) MTrans is the first attempt at\nusing improved transformers for multi-modal MR imaging, affording more global\ninformation compared with CNN-based methods. (ii) A new cross attention module\nis proposed to exploit the useful information in each branch at different\nscales. It affords both distinct structural information and subtle pixel-level\ninformation, which supplement the target modality effectively.",

          "description": "Increasing demands for understanding the internal behavior of convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) have led to remarkable improvements in explanation\nmethods. Particularly, several class activation mapping (CAM) based methods,\nwhich generate visual explanation maps by a linear combination of activation\nmaps from CNNs, have been proposed. However, the majority of the methods lack a\nclear theoretical basis on how they assign the coefficients of the linear\ncombination. In this paper, we revisit the intrinsic linearity of CAM with\nrespect to the activation maps; we construct an explanation model of CNN as a\nlinear function of binary variables that denote the existence of the\ncorresponding activation maps. With this approach, the explanation model can be\ndetermined by additive feature attribution methods in an analytic manner. We\nthen demonstrate the adequacy of SHAP values, which is a unique solution for\nthe explanation model with a set of desirable properties, as the coefficients\nof CAM. Since the exact SHAP values are unattainable, we introduce an efficient\napproximation method, LIFT-CAM, based on DeepLIFT. Our proposed LIFT-CAM can\nestimate the SHAP values of the activation maps with high speed and accuracy.\nFurthermore, it greatly outperforms other previous CAM-based methods in both\nqualitative and quantitative aspects.",

By exploiting their highly evolved visual systems, flying\ninsects can effectively detect mates and track prey during rapid pursuits, even\nthough the small targets equate to only a few pixels in their visual field. The\nhigh degree of sensitivity to small target movement is supported by a class of\nspecialized neurons called small target motion detectors (STMDs). Existing\nSTMD-based computational models normally comprise four sequentially arranged\nneural layers interconnected via feedforward loops to extract information on\nsmall target motion from raw visual inputs. However, feedback, another\nimportant regulatory circuit for motion perception, has not been investigated\nin the STMD pathway and its functional roles for small target motion detection\nare not clear.

We\ncompare the properties of the model with and without the time-delay feedback\nloop, and find it shows preference for high-velocity objects. Extensive\nexperiments suggest that the Feedback STMD achieves superior detection\nperformance for fast-moving small targets, while significantly suppressing\nbackground false positive movements which display lower velocities.

          "description": "Monocular depth prediction plays a crucial role in understanding 3D scene\ngeometry. Although recent methods have achieved impressive progress in terms of\nevaluation metrics such as the pixel-wise relative error, most methods neglect\nthe geometric constraints in the 3D space. In this work, we show the importance\nof the high-order 3D geometric constraints for depth prediction. By designing a\nloss term that enforces a simple geometric constraint, namely, virtual normal\ndirections determined by randomly sampled three points in the reconstructed 3D\nspace, we significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of monocular depth\nestimation. Significantly, the virtual normal loss can not only improve the\nperformance of learning metric depth, but also disentangle the scale\ninformation and enrich the model with better shape information. Therefore, when\nnot having access to absolute metric depth training data, we can use virtual\nnormal to learn a robust affine-invariant depth generated on diverse scenes. In\nexperiments, We show state-of-the-art results of learning metric depth on NYU\nDepth-V2 and KITTI. From the high-quality predicted depth, we are now able to\nrecover good 3D structures of the scene such as the point cloud and surface\nnormal directly, eliminating the necessity of relying on additional models as\nwas previously done. To demonstrate the excellent generalizability of learning\naffine-invariant depth on diverse data with the virtual normal loss, we\nconstruct a large-scale and diverse dataset for training affine-invariant\ndepth, termed Diverse Scene Depth dataset (DiverseDepth), and test on five\ndatasets with the zero-shot test setting.

          "description": "Automotive traffic scenes are complex due to the variety of possible\nscenarios, objects, and weather conditions that need to be handled. In contrast\nto more constrained environments, such as automated underground trains,\nautomotive perception systems cannot be tailored to a narrow field of specific\ntasks but must handle an ever-changing environment with unforeseen events. As\ncurrently no single sensor is able to reliably perceive all relevant activity\nin the surroundings, sensor data fusion is applied to perceive as much\ninformation as possible. Data fusion of different sensors and sensor modalities\non a low abstraction level enables the compensation of sensor weaknesses and\nmisdetections among the sensors before the information-rich sensor data are\ncompressed and thereby information is lost after a sensor-individual object\ndetection. This paper develops a low-level sensor fusion network for 3D object\ndetection, which fuses lidar, camera, and radar data. The fusion network is\ntrained and evaluated on the nuScenes data set. On the test set, fusion of\nradar data increases the resulting AP (Average Precision) detection score by\nabout 5.1% in comparison to the baseline lidar network. The radar sensor fusion\nproves especially beneficial in inclement conditions such as rain and night\nscenes. Fusing additional camera data contributes positively only in\nconjunction with the radar fusion, which shows that interdependencies of the\nsensors are important for the detection result. Additionally, the paper\nproposes a novel loss to handle the discontinuity of a simple yaw\nrepresentation for object detection. Our updated loss increases the detection\nand orientation estimation performance for all sensor input configurations. The\ncode for this research has been made available on GitHub.",

          "description": "In large technology companies, the requirements for managing and organizing\ntechnical documents created by engineers and managers in supporting relevant\ndecision making have increased dramatically in recent years, which has led to a\nhigher demand for more scalable, accurate, and automated document\nclassification. Prior studies have primarily focused on processing text for\nclassification and small-scale databases. This paper describes a novel\nmultimodal deep learning architecture, called TechDoc, for technical document\nclassification, which utilizes both natural language and descriptive images to\ntrain hierarchical classifiers. The architecture synthesizes convolutional\nneural networks and recurrent neural networks through an integrated training\nprocess. We applied the architecture to a large multimodal technical document\ndatabase and trained the model for classifying documents based on the\nhierarchical International Patent Classification system. Our results show that\nthe trained neural network presents a greater classification accuracy than\nthose using a single modality and several earlier text classification methods.\nThe trained model can potentially be scaled to millions of real-world technical\ndocuments with both text and figures, which is useful for data and knowledge\nmanagement in large technology companies and organizations.",

          "description": "The recent vision transformer(i.e.for image classification) learns non-local\nattentive interaction of different patch tokens. However, prior arts miss\nlearning the cross-scale dependencies of different pixels, the semantic\ncorrespondence of different labels, and the consistency of the feature\nrepresentations and semantic embeddings, which are critical for biomedical\nsegmentation. In this paper, we tackle the above issues by proposing a unified\ntransformer network, termed Multi-Compound Transformer (MCTrans), which\nincorporates rich feature learning and semantic structure mining into a unified\nframework. Specifically, MCTrans embeds the multi-scale convolutional features\nas a sequence of tokens and performs intra- and inter-scale self-attention,\nrather than single-scale attention in previous works. In addition, a learnable\nproxy embedding is also introduced to model semantic relationship and feature\nenhancement by using self-attention and cross-attention, respectively. MCTrans\ncan be easily plugged into a UNet-like network and attains a significant\nimprovement over the state-of-the-art methods in biomedical image segmentation\nin six standard benchmarks. For example, MCTrans outperforms UNet by 3.64%,\n3.71%, 4.34%, 2.8%, 1.88%, 1.57% in Pannuke, CVC-Clinic, CVC-Colon, Etis,\nKavirs, ISIC2018 dataset, respectively.

          "description": "The past few years have witnessed great progress in the domain of face\nrecognition thanks to advances in deep learning. However, cross pose face\nrecognition remains a significant challenge. It is difficult for many deep\nlearning algorithms to narrow the performance gap caused by pose variations;\nthe main reasons for this relate to the intra-class discrepancy between face\nimages in different poses and the pose imbalances of training datasets.\nLearning pose-robust features by traversing to the feature space of frontal\nfaces provides an effective and cheap way to alleviate this problem. In this\npaper, we present a method for progressively transforming profile face\nrepresentations to the canonical pose with an attentive pair-wise loss.\nFirstly, to reduce the difficulty of directly transforming the profile face\nfeatures into a frontal pose, we propose to learn the feature residual between\nthe source pose and its nearby pose in a block-byblock fashion, and thus\ntraversing to the feature space of a smaller pose by adding the learned\nresidual. Secondly, we propose an attentive pair-wise loss to guide the feature\ntransformation progressing in the most effective direction. Finally, our\nproposed progressive module and attentive pair-wise loss are light-weight and\neasy to implement, adding only about 7:5% extra parameters. Evaluations on the\nCFP and CPLFW datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Code\nis available at https://github.com/hjy1312/AGPM.",

          "description": "Data augmentation is a powerful technique for improving the performance of\nthe few-shot classification task. It generates more samples as supplements, and\nthen this task can be transformed into a common supervised learning issue for\nsolution. However, most mainstream data augmentation based approaches only\nconsider the single modality information, which leads to the low diversity and\nquality of generated features. In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal\ndata augmentation approach named Dizygotic Conditional Variational AutoEncoder\n(DCVAE) for addressing the aforementioned issue. DCVAE conducts feature\nsynthesis via pairing two Conditional Variational AutoEncoders (CVAEs) with the\nsame seed but different modality conditions in a dizygotic symbiosis manner.\nSubsequently, the generated features of two CVAEs are adaptively combined to\nyield the final feature, which can be converted back into its paired conditions\nwhile ensuring these conditions are consistent with the original conditions not\nonly in representation but also in function. DCVAE essentially provides a new\nidea of data augmentation in various multi-modal scenarios by exploiting the\ncomplement of different modality prior information. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate our work achieves state-of-the-art performances on\nminiImageNet, CIFAR-FS and CUB datasets, and is able to work well in the\npartial modality absence case.",

          "description": "Text spotting in natural scene images is of great importance for many image\nunderstanding tasks. It includes two sub-tasks: text detection and recognition.\nIn this work, we propose a unified network that simultaneously localizes and\nrecognizes text with a single forward pass, avoiding intermediate processes\nsuch as image cropping and feature re-calculation, word separation, and\ncharacter grouping.\n\nIn contrast to existing approaches that consider text detection and\nrecognition as two distinct tasks and tackle them one by one, the proposed\nframework settles these two tasks concurrently. The whole framework can be\ntrained end-to-end and is able to handle text of arbitrary shapes. The\nconvolutional features are calculated only once and shared by both detection\nand recognition modules. Through multi-task training, the learned features\nbecome more discriminate and improve the overall performance. By employing the\n$2$D attention model in word recognition, the irregularity of text can be\nrobustly addressed. It provides the spatial location for each character, which\nnot only helps local feature extraction in word recognition, but also indicates\nan orientation angle to refine text localization. Our proposed method has\nachieved state-of-the-art performance on several standard text spotting\nbenchmarks, including both regular and irregular ones.",

          "description": "Location information is proven to benefit the deep learning models on\ncapturing the manifold structure of target objects, and accordingly boosts the\naccuracy of medical image segmentation. However, most existing methods encode\nthe location information in an implicit way, e.g. the distance transform maps,\nwhich describe the relative distance from each pixel to the contour boundary,\nfor the network to learn. These implicit approaches do not fully exploit the\nposition information (i.e. absolute location) of targets. In this paper, we\npropose a novel loss function, namely residual moment (RM) loss, to explicitly\nembed the location information of segmentation targets during the training of\ndeep learning networks. Particularly, motivated by image moments, the\nsegmentation prediction map and ground-truth map are weighted by coordinate\ninformation. Then our RM loss encourages the networks to maintain the\nconsistency between the two weighted maps, which promotes the segmentation\nnetworks to easily locate the targets and extract manifold-structure-related\nfeatures. We validate the proposed RM loss by conducting extensive experiments\non two publicly available datasets, i.e., 2D optic cup and disk segmentation\nand 3D left atrial segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our RM loss, which significantly boosts the accuracy of\nsegmentation networks.",

The proposed approach modifies the\nrecently proposed Convolutional Support Estimator Networks (CSENs).

We further propose and demonstrate\nthat representation-based methods (sparse or collaborative representation) can\nbe used in well-designed regression problems. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first representation-based method proposed for performing a\nregression task by utilizing the modified CSENs; and hence, we name this novel\napproach as Representation-based Regression (RbR). The initial version of CSENs\nhas a proxy mapping stage (i.e., a coarse estimation for the support set) that\nis required for the input. In this study, we improve the CSEN model by\nproposing Compressive Learning CSEN (CL-CSEN) that has the ability to jointly\noptimize the so-called proxy mapping stage along with convolutional layers.

          "description": "Background: Transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsies of the prostate\nis a routine procedure to establish a prostate cancer diagnosis. However, the\n10-12 prostate core biopsies only sample a relatively small volume of the\nprostate, and tumour lesions in regions between biopsy cores can be missed,\nleading to a well-known low sensitivity to detect clinically relevant cancer.\nAs a proof-of-principle, we developed and validated a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork model to distinguish between morphological patterns in benign prostate\nbiopsy whole slide images from men with and without established cancer.\nMethods: This study included 14,354 hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide\nimages from benign prostate biopsies from 1,508 men in two groups: men without\nan established prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and men with at least one core\nbiopsy diagnosed with PCa. 80% of the participants were assigned as training\ndata and used for model optimization (1,211 men), and the remaining 20% (297\nmen) as a held-out test set used to evaluate model performance. An ensemble of\n10 deep convolutional neural network models was optimized for classification of\nbiopsies from men with and without established cancer. Hyperparameter\noptimization and model selection was performed by cross-validation in the\ntraining data . Results: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(ROC-AUC) was estimated as 0.727 (bootstrap 95% CI: 0.708-0.745) on biopsy\nlevel and 0.738 (bootstrap 95% CI: 0.682 - 0.796) on man level. At a\nspecificity of 0.9 the model had an estimated sensitivity of 0.348. Conclusion:\nThe developed model has the ability to detect men with risk of missed PCa due\nto under-sampling of the prostate. The proposed model has the potential to\nreduce the number of false negative cases in routine systematic prostate\nbiopsies and to indicate men who could benefit from MRI-guided re-biopsy.",

Developing high speed and\nhigh efficiency data processing method is of great importance for further\nscientific research. In recent years, deep neural networks have been proposed\nfor detection and classification of celestial objects and have shown better\nperformance than classical methods. In this paper, we further extend abilities\nof the deep neural network based astronomical target detection framework to\nmake it suitable for photometry and astrometry. We add new branches into the\ndeep neural network to obtain types, magnitudes and positions of different\ncelestial objects at the same time. Tested with simulated data, we find that\nour neural network has better performance in photometry than classical methods.\nBecause photometry and astrometry are regression algorithms, which would obtain\nhigh accuracy measurements instead of rough classification results, the\naccuracy of photometry and astrometry results would be affected by different\nobservation conditions. To solve this problem, we further propose to use\nreference stars to train our deep neural network with transfer learning\nstrategy when observation conditions change.

          "description": "Polygonal meshes are ubiquitous, but have only played a relatively minor role\nin the deep learning revolution. State-of-the-art neural generative models for\n3D shapes learn implicit functions and generate meshes via expensive\niso-surfacing. We overcome these challenges by employing a classical spatial\ndata structure from computer graphics, Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), to\nfacilitate 3D learning. The core operation of BSP involves recursive\nsubdivision of 3D space to obtain convex sets. By exploiting this property, we\ndevise BSP-Net, a network that learns to represent a 3D shape via convex\ndecomposition without supervision. The network is trained to reconstruct a\nshape using a set of convexes obtained from a BSP-tree built over a set of\nplanes, where the planes and convexes are both defined by learned network\nweights. BSP-Net directly outputs polygonal meshes from the inferred convexes.\nThe generated meshes are watertight, compact (i.e., low-poly), and well suited\nto represent sharp geometry. We show that the reconstruction quality by BSP-Net\nis competitive with those from state-of-the-art methods while using much fewer\nprimitives. We also explore variations to BSP-Net including using a more\ngeneric decoder for reconstruction, more general primitives than planes, as\nwell as training a generative model with variational auto-encoders.

However, the systematic\nand efficient $\\textit{de novo}$ recognition and recovery of macromolecular\nstructures captured by Cryo-ET are very challenging due to the structural\ncomplexity and imaging limits. Even macromolecules with identical structures\nhave various appearances due to different orientations and imaging limits, such\nas noise and the missing wedge effect.

Kimera-Multi is implemented by a\nteam of robots equipped with visual-inertial sensors. Each robot builds a local\ntrajectory estimate and a local mesh using Kimera. When communication is\navailable, robots initiate a distributed place recognition and robust pose\ngraph optimization protocol based on a novel distributed graduated\nnon-convexity algorithm. The proposed protocol allows the robots to improve\ntheir local trajectory estimates by leveraging inter-robot loop closures while\nbeing robust to outliers. Finally, each robot uses its improved trajectory\nestimate to correct the local mesh using mesh deformation techniques.\n\nWe demonstrate Kimera-Multi in photo-realistic simulations, SLAM benchmarking\ndatasets, and challenging outdoor datasets collected using ground robots. Both\nreal and simulated experiments involve long trajectories (e.g., up to 800\nmeters per robot). The experiments show that Kimera-Multi (i) outperforms the\nstate of the art in terms of robustness and accuracy, (ii) achieves estimation\nerrors comparable to a centralized SLAM system while being fully distributed,\n(iii) is parsimonious in terms of communication bandwidth, (iv) produces\naccurate metric-semantic 3D meshes, and (v) is modular and can be also used for\nstandard 3D reconstruction (i.e., without semantic labels) or for trajectory\nestimation (i.e., without reconstructing a 3D mesh).",

          "description": "Image matting is an ill-posed problem that aims to estimate the opacity of\nforeground pixels in an image. However, most existing deep learning-based\nmethods still suffer from the coarse-grained details. In general, these\nalgorithms are incapable of felicitously distinguishing the degree of\nexploration between deterministic domains (certain FG and BG pixels) and\nundetermined domains (uncertain in-between pixels), or inevitably lose\ninformation in the continuous sampling process, leading to a sub-optimal\nresult. In this paper, we propose a novel network named Prior-Induced\nInformation Alignment Matting Network (PIIAMatting), which can efficiently\nmodel the distinction of pixel-wise response maps and the correlation of\nlayer-wise feature maps. It mainly consists of a Dynamic Gaussian Modulation\nmechanism (DGM) and an Information Alignment strategy (IA). Specifically, the\nDGM can dynamically acquire a pixel-wise domain response map learned from the\nprior distribution. The response map can present the relationship between the\nopacity variation and the convergence process during training. On the other\nhand, the IA comprises an Information Match Module (IMM) and an Information\nAggregation Module (IAM), jointly scheduled to match and aggregate the adjacent\nlayer-wise features adaptively. Besides, we also develop a Multi-Scale\nRefinement (MSR) module to integrate multi-scale receptive field information at\nthe refinement stage to recover the fluctuating appearance details. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed\nPIIAMatting performs favourably against state-of-the-art image matting methods\non the Alphamatting.com, Composition-1K and Distinctions-646 dataset.",

The design of the\nCPC-R algorithm allows preserving all high-dimensional information in 2-D\nimages. The use of pair values mapping instead of single value mapping used in\nthe alternative approaches allows encoding each n-D point with 2 times fewer\nvisual elements. The attributes of an n-D point are divided into pairs of its\nvalues and each pair is visualized as 2-D points in the same 2-D Cartesian\ncoordinates. Next, grey scale or color intensity values are assigned to each\npair to encode the order of pairs. This is resulted in the heatmap image. The\ncomputational experiments with CPC-R are conducted for different CNN\narchitectures, and methods to optimize the CPC-R images showing that the\ncombined CPC-R and deep learning CNN algorithms are able to solve non-image ML\nproblems reaching high accuracy on the benchmark datasets.

In this paper to\nachieve the objectives of semi-fragile watermarking techniques, a method is\nproposed to not have the mentioned shortcomings. In the proposed method, the\nwatermark is generated by relying on image content and a key. Furthermore, the\nembedding scheme causes the watermarked blocks to become dependent on each\nother, using a key. In the embedding phase, the image is partitioned into\nnon-overlapping blocks. In order to detect and separate the different types of\nattacks more precisely, the proposed method embeds three copies of each\nwatermark bit into LWT coefficients of each 4x4 block. In the authentication\nphase, by voting between the extracted bits the error maps are created; these\nmaps indicate image authenticity and reveal the modified regions. Also, in\norder to automate the authentication, the images are classified into four\ncategories using seven features. Classification accuracy in the experiments is\n97.97 percent.

          "description": "When we fine-tune a well-trained deep learning model for a new set of\nclasses, the network learns new concepts but gradually forgets the knowledge of\nold training. In some real-life applications, we may be interested in learning\nnew classes without forgetting the capability of previous experience. Such\nlearning without forgetting problem is often investigated using 2D image\nrecognition tasks. In this paper, considering the growth of depth camera\ntechnology, we address the same problem for the 3D point cloud object data.\nThis problem becomes more challenging in the 3D domain than 2D because of the\nunavailability of large datasets and powerful pretrained backbone models. We\ninvestigate knowledge distillation techniques on 3D data to reduce catastrophic\nforgetting of the previous training. Moreover, we improve the distillation\nprocess by using semantic word vectors of object classes. We observe that\nexploring the interrelation of old and new knowledge during training helps to\nlearn new concepts without forgetting old ones. Experimenting on three 3D point\ncloud recognition backbones (PointNet, DGCNN, and PointConv) and synthetic\n(ModelNet40, ModelNet10) and real scanned (ScanObjectNN) datasets, we establish\nnew baseline results on learning without forgetting for 3D data. This research\nwill instigate many future works in this area.",

          "description": "Many deep learning based methods are designed to remove non-uniform\n(spatially variant) motion blur caused by object motion and camera shake\nwithout knowing the blur kernel. Some methods directly output the latent sharp\nimage in one stage, while others utilize a multi-stage strategy (\\eg\nmulti-scale, multi-patch, or multi-temporal) to gradually restore the sharp\nimage. However, these methods have the following two main issues: 1) The\ncomputational cost of multi-stage is high; 2) The same convolution kernel is\napplied in different regions, which is not an ideal choice for non-uniform\nblur. Hence, non-uniform motion deblurring is still a challenging and open\nproblem. In this paper, we propose a new architecture which consists of\nmultiple Atrous Spatial Pyramid Deformable Convolution (ASPDC) modules to\ndeblur an image end-to-end with more flexibility. Multiple ASPDC modules\nimplicitly learn the pixel-specific motion with different dilation rates in the\nsame layer to handle movements of different magnitude. To improve the training,\nwe also propose a reblurring network to map the deblurred output back to the\nblurred input, which constrains the solution space. Our experimental results\nshow that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the\nbenchmark datasets.",

          "description": "Modern magnetic sensor arrays conventionally utilize state of the art low\npower magnetometers such as parallel and orthogonal fluxgates. Low power\nfluxgates tend to have large Barkhausen jumps that appear as a dc jump in the\nfluxgate output. This phenomenon deteriorates the signal fidelity and\neffectively increases the internal sensor noise. Even if sensors that are more\nprone to dc jumps can be screened during production, the conventional noise\nmeasurement does not always catch the dc jump because of its sparsity.\nMoreover, dc jumps persist in almost all the sensor cores although at a slower\nbut still intolerable rate. Even if dc jumps can be easily detected in a\nshielded environment, when deployed in presence of natural noise and clutter,\nit can be hard to positively detect them. This work fills this gap and presents\nalgorithms that distinguish dc jumps embedded in natural magnetic field data.\nTo improve robustness to noise, we developed two machine learning algorithms\nthat employ temporal and statistical physical-based features of a pre-acquired\nand well-known experimental data set. The first algorithm employs a support\nvector machine classifier, while the second is based on a neural network\narchitecture. We compare these new approaches to a more classical kernel-based\nmethod. To that purpose, the receiver operating characteristic curve is\ngenerated, which allows diagnosis ability of the different classifiers by\ncomparing their performances across various operation points. The accuracy of\nthe machine learning-based algorithms over the classic method is highly\nemphasized. In addition, high generalization and robustness of the neural\nnetwork can be concluded, based on the rapid convergence of the corresponding\nreceiver operating characteristic curves.",

          "description": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is an indispensable and widely used module in face\nrecognition systems. Although high accuracy has been achieved, a FAS system\nwill never be perfect due to the non-stationary applied environments and the\npotential emergence of new types of presentation attacks in real-world\napplications. In practice, given a handful of labeled samples from a new\ndeployment scenario (target domain) and abundant labeled face images in the\nexisting source domain, the FAS system is expected to perform well in the new\nscenario without sacrificing the performance on the original domain. To this\nend, we identify and address a more practical problem: Few-Shot Domain\nExpansion for Face Anti-Spoofing (FSDE-FAS). This problem is challenging since\nwith insufficient target domain training samples, the model may suffer from\nboth overfitting to the target domain and catastrophic forgetting of the source\ndomain. To address the problem, this paper proposes a Style transfer-based\nAugmentation for Semantic Alignment (SASA) framework. We propose to augment the\ntarget data by generating auxiliary samples based on photorealistic style\ntransfer. With the assistant of the augmented data, we further propose a\ncarefully designed mechanism to align different domains from both\ninstance-level and distribution-level, and then stabilize the performance on\nthe source domain with a less-forgetting constraint. Two benchmarks are\nproposed to simulate the FSDE-FAS scenarios, and the experimental results show\nthat the proposed SASA method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "In order to objectively assess new medical imaging technologies via\ncomputer-simulations, it is important to account for all sources of variability\nthat contribute to image data. One important source of variability that can\nsignificantly limit observer performance is associated with the variability in\nthe ensemble of objects to-be-imaged. This source of variability can be\ndescribed by stochastic object models (SOMs), which are generative models that\ncan be employed to sample from a distribution of to-be-virtually-imaged\nobjects. It is generally desirable to establish SOMs from experimental imaging\nmeasurements acquired by use of a well-characterized imaging system, but this\ntask has remained challenging. Deep generative neural networks, such as\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) hold potential for such tasks. To\nestablish SOMs from imaging measurements, an AmbientGAN has been proposed that\naugments a GAN with a measurement operator. However, the original AmbientGAN\ncould not immediately benefit from modern training procedures and GAN\narchitectures, which limited its ability to be applied to realistically sized\nmedical image data. To circumvent this, in this work, a modified AmbientGAN\ntraining strategy is proposed that is suitable for modern progressive or\nmulti-resolution training approaches such as employed in the Progressive\nGrowing of GANs and Style-based GANs. AmbientGANs established by use of the\nproposed training procedure are systematically validated in a controlled way by\nuse of computer-simulated measurement data corresponding to a stylized imaging\nsystem. Finally, emulated single-coil experimental magnetic resonance imaging\ndata are employed to demonstrate the methods under less stylized conditions.",

In particular, there has been an\nemphasis on Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS); the clinical term for early-stage\nbreast cancer. Large companies have given their fair share of research into\nthis subject, among these Google Deepmind who developed a model in 2020 that\nhas proven to be better than radiologists themselves to diagnose breast cancer\ncorrectly.\n\nWe found that among the issues which exist, there is a need for an\nexplanatory system that goes through the hidden layers of a CNN to highlight\nthose pixels that contributed to the classification of a mammogram. We then\nchose an open-source, reasonably successful project developed by Prof. Shen,\nusing the CBIS-DDSM image database to run our experiments on. It was later\nimproved using the Resnet-50 and VGG-16 patch-classifiers, analytically\ncomparing the outcome of both. The results showed that the Resnet-50 one\nconverged earlier in the experiments.\n\nFollowing the research by Montavon and Binder, we used the DeepTaylor\nLayer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) model to highlight those pixels and\nregions within a mammogram which contribute most to its classification. This is\nrepresented as a map of those pixels in the original image, which contribute to\nthe diagnosis and the extent to which they contribute to the final\nclassification. The most significant advantage of this algorithm is that it\nperforms exceptionally well with the Resnet-50 patch classifier architecture.",

          "description": "Learning guarantees often rely on assumptions of i.i.d. data, which will\nlikely be violated in practice once predictors are deployed to perform\nreal-world tasks. Domain adaptation approaches thus appeared as a useful\nframework yielding extra flexibility in that distinct train and test data\ndistributions are supported, provided that other assumptions are satisfied such\nas covariate shift, which expects the conditional distributions over labels to\nbe independent of the underlying data distribution. Several approaches were\nintroduced in order to induce generalization across varying train and test data\nsources, and those often rely on the general idea of domain-invariance, in such\na way that the data-generating distributions are to be disregarded by the\nprediction model. In this contribution, we tackle the problem of generalizing\nacross data sources by approaching it from the opposite direction: we consider\na conditional modeling approach in which predictions, in addition to being\ndependent on the input data, use information relative to the underlying\ndata-generating distribution. For instance, the model has an explicit mechanism\nto adapt to changing environments and/or new data sources. We argue that such\nan approach is more generally applicable than current domain adaptation methods\nsince it does not require extra assumptions such as covariate shift and further\nyields simpler training algorithms that avoid a common source of training\ninstabilities caused by minimax formulations, often employed in\ndomain-invariant methods.",

However, due to the differences on\ncamera styles, illumination and backgrounds, there exists a large gap between\nsource domain and target domain, introducing a great challenge on cross-domain\nmatching. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a novel method named\nDual-stream Reciprocal Disentanglement Learning (DRDL), which is quite\nefficient in learning domain-invariant features. In DRDL, two encoders are\nfirst constructed for id-related and id-unrelated feature extractions, which\nare respectively measured by their associated classifiers. Furthermore,\nfollowed by an adversarial learning strategy, both streams reciprocally and\npositively effect each other, so that the id-related features and id-unrelated\nfeatures are completely disentangled from a given image, allowing the encoder\nto be powerful enough to obtain the discriminative but domain-invariant\nfeatures. In contrast to existing approaches, our proposed method is free from\nimage generation, which not only reduces the computational complexity\nremarkably, but also removes redundant information from id-related features.\nExtensive experiments substantiate the superiority of our proposed method\ncompared with the state-of-the-arts.

This paper focuses on the\ntask of mapping between different sensor raw-RGB color spaces. Prior work\naddressed this problem using a pairwise calibration to achieve accurate color\nmapping. Although being accurate, this approach is less practical as it\nrequires: (1) capturing pair of images by both camera devices with a color\ncalibration object placed in each new scene; (2) accurate image alignment or\nmanual annotation of the color calibration object. This paper aims to tackle\ncolor mapping in the raw space through a more practical setup.

          "description": "In this paper, we propose a novel encoder, called ShapeEditor, for\nhigh-resolution, realistic and high-fidelity face exchange. First of all, in\norder to ensure sufficient clarity and authenticity, our key idea is to use an\nadvanced pretrained high-quality random face image generator, i.e. StyleGAN, as\nbackbone. Secondly, we design ShapeEditor, a two-step encoder, to make the\nswapped face integrate the identity and attribute of the input faces. In the\nfirst step, we extract the identity vector of the source image and the\nattribute vector of the target image respectively; in the second step, we map\nthe concatenation of identity vector and attribute vector into the\n$\\mathcal{W+}$ potential space. In addition, for learning to map into the\nlatent space of StyleGAN, we propose a set of self-supervised loss functions\nwith which the training data do not need to be labeled manually. Extensive\nexperiments on the test dataset show that the results of our method not only\nhave a great advantage in clarity and authenticity than other state-of-the-art\nmethods, but also reflect the sufficient integration of identity and attribute.",

          "description": "Pose transfer of human videos aims to generate a high fidelity video of a\ntarget person imitating actions of a source person. A few studies have made\ngreat progress either through image translation with deep latent features or\nneural rendering with explicit 3D features. However, both of them rely on large\namounts of training data to generate realistic results, and the performance\ndegrades on more accessible internet videos due to insufficient training\nframes. In this paper, we demonstrate that the dynamic details can be preserved\neven trained from short monocular videos. Overall, we propose a neural video\nrendering framework coupled with an image-translation-based dynamic details\ngeneration network (D2G-Net), which fully utilizes both the stability of\nexplicit 3D features and the capacity of learning components. To be specific, a\nnovel texture representation is presented to encode both the static and\npose-varying appearance characteristics, which is then mapped to the image\nspace and rendered as a detail-rich frame in the neural rendering stage.\nMoreover, we introduce a concise temporal loss in the training stage to\nsuppress the detail flickering that is made more visible due to high-quality\ndynamic details generated by our method. Through extensive comparisons, we\ndemonstrate that our neural human video renderer is capable of achieving both\nclearer dynamic details and more robust performance even on accessible short\nvideos with only 2k - 4k frames.",

For the task of\nclassification, techniques such as meta-learning, zero-shot learning, and\nfew-shot learning showcase the ability to learn information about novel classes\nbased on prior knowledge. Recent techniques try to learn a cross-modal mapping\nbetween the semantic space and the image space. However, they tend to ignore\nthe local and global semantic knowledge. To overcome this problem, we propose a\nMultimodal Variational Auto-Encoder (M-VAE) which can learn the shared latent\nspace of image features and the semantic space. In our approach we concatenate\nmultimodal data to a single embedding before passing it to the VAE for learning\nthe latent space. We propose the use of a multi-modal loss during the\nreconstruction of the feature embedding through the decoder. Our approach is\ncapable to correlating modalities and exploit the local and global semantic\nknowledge for novel sample predictions.

          "description": "Image style transfer aims to manipulate the appearance of a source image, or\n\"content\" image, to share similar texture and colors of a target \"style\" image.\nIdeally, the style transfer manipulation should also preserve the semantic\ncontent of the source image. A commonly used approach to assist in transferring\nstyles is based on Gram matrix optimization. One problem of Gram matrix-based\noptimization is that it does not consider the correlation between colors and\ntheir styles. Specifically, certain textures or structures should be associated\nwith specific colors. This is particularly challenging when the target style\nimage exhibits multiple style types. In this work, we propose a color-aware\nmulti-style transfer method that generates aesthetically pleasing results while\npreserving the style-color correlation between style and generated images. We\nachieve this desired outcome by introducing a simple but efficient modification\nto classic Gram matrix-based style transfer optimization. A nice feature of our\nmethod is that it enables the users to manually select the color associations\nbetween the target style and content image for more transfer flexibility. We\nvalidated our method with several qualitative comparisons, including a user\nstudy conducted with 30 participants. In comparison with prior work, our method\nis simple, easy to implement, and achieves visually appealing results when\ntargeting images that have multiple styles.

Robust PCA (RPCA), under different robust\ndistance metrics, such as l1-norm and l2, p-norm, can deal with noise or\noutliers to some extent. However, real-world data may display structures that\ncan not be fully captured by these simple functions. In addition, existing\nmethods treat complex and simple samples equally. By contrast, a learning\npattern typically adopted by human beings is to learn from simple to complex\nand less to more. Based on this principle, we propose a novel method called\nSelf-paced PCA (SPCA) to further reduce the effect of noise and outliers.\nNotably, the complexity of each sample is calculated at the beginning of each\niteration in order to integrate samples from simple to more complex into\ntraining. Based on an alternating optimization, SPCA finds an optimal\nprojection matrix and filters out outliers iteratively. Theoretical analysis is\npresented to show the rationality of SPCA.

          "description": "Collaborative inference enables resource-constrained edge devices to make\ninferences by uploading inputs (e.g., images) to a server (i.e., cloud) where\nthe heavy deep learning models run. While this setup works cost-effectively for\nsuccessful inferences, it severely underperforms when the model faces input\nsamples on which the model was not trained (known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\nsamples). If the edge devices could, at least, detect that an input sample is\nan OOD, that could potentially save communication and computation resources by\nnot uploading those inputs to the server for inference workload. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel lightweight OOD detection approach that mines important\nfeatures from the shallow layers of a pretrained CNN model and detects an input\nsample as ID (In-Distribution) or OOD based on a distance function defined on\nthe reduced feature space. Our technique (a) works on pretrained models without\nany retraining of those models, and (b) does not expose itself to any OOD\ndataset (all detection parameters are obtained from the ID training dataset).\nTo this end, we develop EARLIN (EARLy OOD detection for Collaborative\nINference) that takes a pretrained model and partitions the model at the OOD\ndetection layer and deploys the considerably small OOD part on an edge device\nand the rest on the cloud. By experimenting using real datasets and a prototype\nimplementation, we show that our technique achieves better results than other\napproaches in terms of overall accuracy and cost when tested against popular\nOOD datasets on top of popular deep learning models pretrained on benchmark\ndatasets.",

This paper demonstrates that the combination of\nstate-of-the-art object tracking with passively adaptive mechanical hardware\ncan be leveraged to complete precision manipulation tasks with tight,\nindustrially-relevant tolerances (0.25mm). The proposed control method closes\nthe loop through vision by tracking the relative 6D pose of objects in the\nrelevant workspace. It adjusts the control reference of both the compliant\nmanipulator and the hand to complete object insertion tasks via within-hand\nmanipulation. Contrary to previous efforts for insertion, our method does not\nrequire expensive force sensors, precision manipulators, or time-consuming,\nonline learning, which is data hungry. Instead, this effort leverages\nmechanical compliance and utilizes an object agnostic manipulation model of the\nhand learned offline, off-the-shelf motion planning, and an RGBD-based object\ntracker trained solely with synthetic data. These features allow the proposed\nsystem to easily generalize and transfer to new tasks and environments.

          "description": "Recent advances in the areas of multimodal machine learning and artificial\nintelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the\nintersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI.\nWhereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or\ntwo of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center\nof all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered,\nmore focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as\nopposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the\nfield. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning\n(EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation\nproblems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a\ntaxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison\nof the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments,\nas well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core\nchallenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we\nadvocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers\nreal-world deployment.",

          "description": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet-50, DenseNet-40 and\nResNeXt-56 are severely over-parameterized, necessitating a consequent increase\nin the computational resources required for model training which scales\nexponentially for increments in model depth. In this paper, we propose an\nEntropy-Based Convolutional Layer Estimation (EBCLE) heuristic which is robust\nand simple, yet effective in resolving the problem of over-parameterization\nwith regards to network depth of CNN model. The EBCLE heuristic employs a\npriori knowledge of the entropic data distribution of input datasets to\ndetermine an upper bound for convolutional network depth, beyond which identity\ntransformations are prevalent offering insignificant contributions for\nenhancing model performance. Restricting depth redundancies by forcing feature\ncompression and abstraction restricts over-parameterization while decreasing\ntraining time by 24.99% - 78.59% without degradation in model performance. We\npresent empirical evidence to emphasize the relative effectiveness of broader,\nyet shallower models trained using the EBCLE heuristic, which maintains or\noutperforms baseline classification accuracies of narrower yet deeper models.\nThe EBCLE heuristic is architecturally agnostic and EBCLE based CNN models\nrestrict depth redundancies resulting in enhanced utilization of the available\ncomputational resources. The proposed EBCLE heuristic is a compelling technique\nfor researchers to analytically justify their HyperParameter (HP) choices for\nCNNs. Empirical validation of the EBCLE heuristic in training CNN models was\nestablished on five benchmarking datasets (ImageNet32, CIFAR-10/100, STL-10,\nMNIST) and four network architectures (DenseNet, ResNet, ResNeXt and\nEfficientNet B0-B2) with appropriate statistical tests employed to infer any\nconclusive claims presented in this paper.",

Most of them are studied\nseparately depending on the applications. Our focus, however, is on\naccommodating the opposite task, e.g., image outpainting, which would benefit\nthe target applications, e.g., image inpainting. Our self-supervision method,\nIn-N-Out, is summarized as a training approach that leverages the knowledge of\nthe opposite task into the target model. We empirically show that In-N-Out --\nwhich explores the complementary information -- effectively takes advantage\nover the traditional pipelines where only task-specific learning takes place in\ntraining. In experiments, we compare our method to the traditional procedure\nand analyze the effectiveness of our method on different applications: image\ninpainting, image extrapolation, and environment map estimation. For these\ntasks, we demonstrate that In-N-Out consistently improves the performance of\nthe recent works with In-N-Out self-supervision to their training procedure.\nAlso, we show that our approach achieves better results than an existing\ntraining approach for outpainting.",

However, it\ncan be difficulty to settle the optimal network depth and make the middle\nlayers learn distinguished features. This paper proposes the Interflow\nalgorithm specially for traditional CNN models. Interflow divides CNNs into\nseveral stages according to the depth and makes predictions by the feature\nmappings in each stage. Subsequently, we input these prediction branches into a\nwell-designed attention module, which learns the weights of these prediction\nbranches, aggregates them and obtains the final output. Interflow weights and\nfuses the features learned in both shallower and deeper layers, making the\nfeature information at each stage processed reasonably and effectively,\nenabling the middle layers to learn more distinguished features, and enhancing\nthe model representation ability. In addition, Interflow can alleviate gradient\nvanishing problem, lower the difficulty of network depth selection, and lighten\npossible over-fitting problem by introducing attention mechanism. Besides, it\ncan avoid network degradation as a byproduct. Compared with the original model,\nthe CNN model with Interflow achieves higher test accuracy on multiple\nbenchmark datasets.",

Deep neural networks commonly used for image\nclassification are deterministic maps from an input image to an output class.\nAs such, their outcome on a given datum involves no uncertainty, so we must\nspecify what variability we are referring to when defining, measuring and\ninterpreting \"confidence.\" To this end, we introduce the Wellington Posterior,\nwhich is the distribution of outcomes that would have been obtained in response\nto data that could have been generated by the same scene that produced the\ngiven image. Since there are infinitely many scenes that could have generated\nthe given image, the Wellington Posterior requires induction from scenes other\nthan the one portrayed. We explore alternate methods using data augmentation,\nensembling, and model linearization. Additional alternatives include generative\nadversarial networks, conditional prior networks, and supervised single-view\nreconstruction. We test these alternatives against the empirical posterior\nobtained by inferring the class of temporally adjacent frames in a video.

          "description": "In this work we propose a novel and fully automated method for extracting the\nyarn geometrical features in woven composites so that a direct parametrization\nof the textile reinforcement is achieved (e.g., FE mesh). Thus, our aim is not\nonly to perform yarn segmentation from tomographic images but rather to provide\na complete descriptive modeling of the fabric. As such, this direct approach\nimproves on previous methods that use voxel-wise masks as intermediate\nrepresentations followed by re-meshing operations (yarn envelope estimation).\nThe proposed approach employs two deep neural network architectures (U-Net and\nMask RCNN). First, we train the U-Net to generate synthetic CT images from the\ncorresponding FE simulations. This allows to generate large quantities of\nannotated data without requiring costly manual annotations. This data is then\nused to train the Mask R-CNN, which is focused on predicting contour points\naround each of the yarns in the image. Experimental results show that our\nmethod is accurate and robust for performing yarn instance segmentation on CT\nimages, this is further validated by quantitative and qualitative analyses.",

By relying only on the semantics of the scene, our modular generative\nframework can, for the first time, synthesize a panoramic color image from a\ngiven full 3D LiDAR point cloud.

The same semantic segmentation is applied to the corresponding camera\nimage.

          "description": "Deep neural networks have amply demonstrated their prowess but estimating the\nreliability of their predictions remains challenging. Deep Ensembles are widely\nconsidered as being one of the best methods for generating uncertainty\nestimates but are very expensive to train and evaluate. MC-Dropout is another\npopular alternative, which is less expensive, but also less reliable. Our\ncentral intuition is that there is a continuous spectrum of ensemble-like\nmodels of which MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles are extreme examples. The first\nuses an effectively infinite number of highly correlated models while the\nsecond relies on a finite number of independent models.\n\nTo combine the benefits of both, we introduce Masksembles. Instead of\nrandomly dropping parts of the network as in MC-dropout, Masksemble relies on a\nfixed number of binary masks, which are parameterized in a way that allows to\nchange correlations between individual models. Namely, by controlling the\noverlap between the masks and their density one can choose the optimal\nconfiguration for the task at hand. This leads to a simple and easy to\nimplement method with performance on par with Ensembles at a fraction of the\ncost. We experimentally validate Masksembles on two widely used datasets,\nCIFAR10 and ImageNet.",

They are useful for reducing maintenance overhead for deploying\nmodels to devices with different memory constraints and are useful for\noptimizing the efficiency of a system with many CNNs. However, existing\nslimmable network approaches either do not optimize layer-wise widths or\noptimize the shared-weights and layer-wise widths independently, thereby\nleaving significant room for improvement by joint width and weight\noptimization. In this work, we propose a general framework to enable joint\noptimization for both width configurations and weights of slimmable networks.\nOur framework subsumes conventional and NAS-based slimmable methods as special\ncases and provides flexibility to improve over existing methods. From a\npractical standpoint, we propose Joslim, an algorithm that jointly optimizes\nboth the widths and weights for slimmable nets, which outperforms existing\nmethods for optimizing slimmable networks across various networks, datasets,\nand objectives. Quantitatively, improvements up to 1.7% and 8% in top-1\naccuracy on the ImageNet dataset can be attained for MobileNetV2 considering\nFLOPs and memory footprint, respectively.

          "description": "Quantitative MR imaging is increasingly favoured for its richer information\ncontent and standardised measures. However, computing quantitative parameter\nmaps, such as those encoding longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), apparent\ntransverse relaxation rate (R2*) or magnetisation-transfer saturation (MTsat),\ninvolves inverting a highly non-linear function. Many methods for deriving\nparameter maps assume perfect measurements and do not consider how noise is\npropagated through the estimation procedure, resulting in needlessly noisy\nmaps. Instead, we propose a probabilistic generative (forward) model of the\nentire dataset, which is formulated and inverted to jointly recover (log)\nparameter maps with a well-defined probabilistic interpretation (e.g., maximum\nlikelihood or maximum a posteriori). The second order optimisation we propose\nfor model fitting achieves rapid and stable convergence thanks to a novel\napproximate Hessian. We demonstrate the utility of our flexible framework in\nthe context of recovering more accurate maps from data acquired using the\npopular multi-parameter mapping protocol. We also show how to incorporate a\njoint total variation prior to further decrease the noise in the maps, noting\nthat the probabilistic formulation allows the uncertainty on the recovered\nparameter maps to be estimated.

The position and extent\nof scars provide important information of the pathophysiology and progression\nof atrial fibrillation (AF). Hence, LA scar segmentation and quantification\nfrom LGE MRI can be useful in computer-assisted diagnosis and treatment\nstratification of AF patients. Since manual delineation can be time-consuming\nand subject to intra- and inter-expert variability, automating this computing\nis highly desired, which nevertheless is still challenging and\nunder-researched.\n\nThis paper aims to provide a systematic review on computing methods for LA\ncavity, wall, scar and ablation gap segmentation and quantification from LGE\nMRI, and the related literature for AF studies. Specifically, we first\nsummarize AF-related imaging techniques, particularly LGE MRI. Then, we review\nthe methodologies of the four computing tasks in detail, and summarize the\nvalidation strategies applied in each task. Finally, the possible future\ndevelopments are outlined, with a brief survey on the potential clinical\napplications of the aforementioned methods. The review shows that the research\ninto this topic is still in early stages. Although several methods have been\nproposed, especially for LA segmentation, there is still large scope for\nfurther algorithmic developments due to performance issues related to the high\nvariability of enhancement appearance and differences in image acquisition.",

          "description": "The recent research explosion around implicit neural representations, such as\nNeRF, shows that there is immense potential for implicitly storing high-quality\nscene and lighting information in compact neural networks. However, one major\nlimitation preventing the use of NeRF in real-time rendering applications is\nthe prohibitive computational cost of excessive network evaluations along each\nview ray, requiring dozens of petaFLOPS. In this work, we bring compact neural\nrepresentations closer to practical rendering of synthetic content in real-time\napplications, such as games and virtual reality. We show that the number of\nsamples required for each view ray can be significantly reduced when samples\nare placed around surfaces in the scene without compromising image quality. To\nthis end, we propose a depth oracle network that predicts ray sample locations\nfor each view ray with a single network evaluation. We show that using a\nclassification network around logarithmically discretized and spherically\nwarped depth values is essential to encode surface locations rather than\ndirectly estimating depth. The combination of these techniques leads to DONeRF,\nour compact dual network design with a depth oracle network as its first step\nand a locally sampled shading network for ray accumulation. With DONeRF, we\nreduce the inference costs by up to 48x compared to NeRF when conditioning on\navailable ground truth depth information. Compared to concurrent acceleration\nmethods for raymarching-based neural representations, DONeRF does not require\nadditional memory for explicit caching or acceleration structures, and can\nrender interactively (20 frames per second) on a single GPU.",

          "description": "In current clinical practice, noisy and artifact-ridden weekly cone-beam\ncomputed tomography (CBCT) images are only used for patient setup during\nradiotherapy. Treatment planning is done once at the beginning of the treatment\nusing high-quality planning CT (pCT) images and manual contours for\norgans-at-risk (OARs) structures. If the quality of the weekly CBCT images can\nbe improved while simultaneously segmenting OAR structures, this can provide\ncritical information for adapting radiotherapy mid-treatment as well as for\nderiving biomarkers for treatment response. Using a novel physics-based data\naugmentation strategy, we synthesize a large dataset of perfectly/inherently\nregistered planning CT and synthetic-CBCT pairs for locally advanced lung\ncancer patient cohort, which are then used in a multitask 3D deep learning\nframework to simultaneously segment and translate real weekly CBCT images to\nhigh-quality planning CT-like images. We compared the synthetic CT and OAR\nsegmentations generated by the model to real planning CT and manual OAR\nsegmentations and showed promising results. The real week 1 (baseline) CBCT\nimages which had an average MAE of 162.77 HU compared to pCT images are\ntranslated to synthetic CT images that exhibit a drastically improved average\nMAE of 29.31 HU and average structural similarity of 92% with the pCT images.\nThe average DICE scores of the 3D organs-at-risk segmentations are: lungs 0.96,\nheart 0.88, spinal cord 0.83 and esophagus 0.66. This approach could allow\nclinicians to adjust treatment plans using only the routine low-quality CBCT\nimages, potentially improving patient outcomes.

We consider the problem of learning\nrepresentations independent to multiple biases. In literature, this is mostly\nsolved by purging the bias information from learned representations. We however\nexpect this strategy to harm the diversity of information in the\nrepresentation, and thus limiting its prospective usage (e.g., interpretation).\nTherefore, we propose to mitigate the bias while keeping almost all information\nin the latent representations, which enables us to observe and interpret them\nas well. To achieve this, we project latent features onto a learned vector\ndirection, and enforce the independence between biases and projected features\nrather than all learned features. To interpret the mapping between projected\nfeatures and input data, we propose projection-wise disentangling: a sampling\nand reconstruction along the learned vector direction.

          "description": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and their variants have been\nwidely used in large scale face recognition(FR) recently. Existing methods have\nachieved good performance on many FR benchmarks. However, most of them suffer\nfrom two major problems. First, these methods converge quite slowly since they\noptimize the loss functions in a high-dimensional and sparse Gaussian Sphere.\nSecond, the high dimensionality of features, despite the powerful descriptive\nability, brings difficulty to the optimization, which may lead to a sub-optimal\nlocal optimum. To address these problems, we propose a simple yet efficient\ntraining mechanism called MultiFace, where we approximate the original\nhigh-dimensional features by the ensemble of low-dimensional features. The\nproposed mechanism is also generic and can be easily applied to many advanced\nFR models. Moreover, it brings the benefits of good interpretability to FR\nmodels via the clustering effect. In detail, the ensemble of these\nlow-dimensional features can capture complementary yet discriminative\ninformation, which can increase the intra-class compactness and inter-class\nseparability. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can\naccelerate 2-3 times with the softmax loss and 1.2-1.5 times with Arcface or\nCosface, while achieving state-of-the-art performances in several benchmark\ndatasets. Especially, the significant improvements on large-scale\ndatasets(e.g., IJB and MageFace) demonstrate the flexibility of our new\ntraining mechanism.",

In this paper, we address this problem with the aid of neural scene\nrepresentation networks. Our method is completely different from existing\nmethods that rely on intermediate representations like 2D landmarks or 3D face\nmodels to bridge the gap between audio input and video output. Specifically,\nthe feature of input audio signal is directly fed into a conditional implicit\nfunction to generate a dynamic neural radiance field, from which a\nhigh-fidelity talking-head video corresponding to the audio signal is\nsynthesized using volume rendering. Another advantage of our framework is that\nnot only the head (with hair) region is synthesized as previous methods did,\nbut also the upper body is generated via two individual neural radiance fields.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our novel framework can (1) produce\nhigh-fidelity and natural results, and (2) support free adjustment of audio\nsignals, viewing directions, and background images.",

          "description": "In this paper we undertake the task of text-based video moment retrieval from\na corpus of videos. To train the model, text-moment paired datasets were used\nto learn the correct correspondences. In typical training methods, ground-truth\ntext-moment pairs are used as positive pairs, whereas other pairs are regarded\nas negative pairs. However, aside from the ground-truth pairs, some text-moment\npairs should be regarded as positive. In this case, one text annotation can be\npositive for many video moments. Conversely, one video moment can be\ncorresponded to many text annotations. Thus, there are many-to-many\ncorrespondences between the text annotations and video moments. Based on these\ncorrespondences, we can form potentially relevant pairs, which are not given as\nground truth yet are not negative; effectively incorporating such relevant\npairs into training can improve the retrieval performance. The text query\nshould describe what is happening in a video moment. Hence, different video\nmoments annotated with similar texts, which contain a similar action, are\nlikely to hold the similar action, thus these pairs can be considered as\npotentially relevant pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel training method\nthat takes advantage of potentially relevant pairs, which are detected based on\nlinguistic analysis about text annotation.

          "description": "We consider a category-level perception problem, where one is given 3D sensor\ndata picturing an object of a given category (e.g. a car), and has to\nreconstruct the pose and shape of the object despite intra-class variability\n(i.e. different car models have different shapes). We consider an active shape\nmodel, where -- for an object category -- we are given a library of potential\nCAD models describing objects in that category, and we adopt a standard\nformulation where pose and shape estimation are formulated as a non-convex\noptimization. Our first contribution is to provide the first certifiably\noptimal solver for pose and shape estimation. In particular, we show that\nrotation estimation can be decoupled from the estimation of the object\ntranslation and shape, and we demonstrate that (i) the optimal object rotation\ncan be computed via a tight (small-size) semidefinite relaxation, and (ii) the\ntranslation and shape parameters can be computed in closed-form given the\nrotation. Our second contribution is to add an outlier rejection layer to our\nsolver, hence making it robust to a large number of misdetections. Towards this\ngoal, we wrap our optimal solver in a robust estimation scheme based on\ngraduated non-convexity. To further enhance robustness to outliers, we also\ndevelop the first graph-theoretic formulation to prune outliers in\ncategory-level perception, which removes outliers via convex hull and maximum\nclique computations; the resulting approach is robust to 70%-90% outliers. Our\nthird contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation. Besides providing\nan ablation study on a simulated dataset and on the PASCAL3D+ dataset, we\ncombine our solver with a deep-learned keypoint detector, and show that the\nresulting approach improves over the state of the art in vehicle pose\nestimation in the ApolloScape datasets.",

          "description": "Recently, bladder cancer has been significantly increased in terms of\nincidence and mortality. Currently, two subtypes are known based on tumour\ngrowth: non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).\nIn this work, we focus on the MIBC subtype because it is of the worst prognosis\nand can spread to adjacent organs. We present a self-learning framework to\ngrade bladder cancer from histological images stained via immunohistochemical\ntechniques. Specifically, we propose a novel Deep Convolutional Embedded\nAttention Clustering (DCEAC) which allows classifying histological patches into\ndifferent severity levels of the disease, according to the patterns established\nin the literature. The proposed DCEAC model follows a two-step fully\nunsupervised learning methodology to discern between non-tumour, mild and\ninfiltrative patterns from high-resolution samples of 512x512 pixels. Our\nsystem outperforms previous clustering-based methods by including a\nconvolutional attention module, which allows refining the features of the\nlatent space before the classification stage. The proposed network exceeds\nstate-of-the-art approaches by 2-3% across different metrics, achieving a final\naverage accuracy of 0.9034 in a multi-class scenario. Furthermore, the reported\nclass activation maps evidence that our model is able to learn by itself the\nsame patterns that clinicians consider relevant, without incurring prior\nannotation steps. This fact supposes a breakthrough in muscle-invasive bladder\ncancer grading which bridges the gap with respect to train the model on\nlabelled data.",

          "description": "Point cloud upsampling using deep learning has been paid various efforts in\nthe past few years. Recent supervised deep learning methods are restricted to\nthe size of training data and is limited in terms of covering all shapes of\npoint clouds. Besides, the acquisition of such amount of data is unrealistic,\nand the network generally performs less powerful than expected on unseen\nrecords. In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach to upsample point\nclouds internally referred as \"Zero Shot\" Point Cloud Upsampling (ZSPU) at\nholistic level. Our approach is solely based on the internal information\nprovided by a particular point cloud without patching in both self-training and\ntesting phases. This single-stream design significantly reduces the training\ntime of the upsampling task, by learning the relation between low-resolution\n(LR) point clouds and their high (original) resolution (HR) counterparts. This\nassociation will provide super-resolution (SR) outputs when original point\nclouds are loaded as input. We demonstrate competitive performance on benchmark\npoint cloud datasets when compared to other upsampling methods. Furthermore,\nZSPU achieves superior qualitative results on shapes with complex local details\nor high curvatures.",

          "description": "Recently, transformers have shown great superiority in solving computer\nvision tasks by modeling images as a sequence of manually-split patches with\nself-attention mechanism. However, current architectures of vision transformers\n(ViTs) are simply inherited from natural language processing (NLP) tasks and\nhave not been sufficiently investigated and optimized. In this paper, we make a\nfurther step by examining the intrinsic structure of transformers for vision\ntasks and propose an architecture search method, dubbed ViTAS, to search for\nthe optimal architecture with similar hardware budgets. Concretely, we design a\nnew effective yet efficient weight sharing paradigm for ViTs, such that\narchitectures with different token embedding, sequence size, number of heads,\nwidth, and depth can be derived from a single super-transformer. Moreover, to\ncater for the variance of distinct architectures, we introduce \\textit{private}\nclass token and self-attention maps in the super-transformer. In addition, to\nadapt the searching for different budgets, we propose to search the sampling\nprobability of identity operation. Experimental results show that our ViTAS\nattains excellent results compared to existing pure transformer architectures.\nFor example, with $1.3$G FLOPs budget, our searched architecture achieves\n$74.7\\%$ top-$1$ accuracy on ImageNet and is $2.5\\%$ superior than the current\nbaseline ViT architecture.

          "description": "Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide and Optical\nCoherence Tomography (OCT) is the quintessential imaging technique for its\ndetection. Unlike most of the state-of-the-art studies focused on glaucoma\ndetection, in this paper, we propose, for the first time, a novel framework for\nglaucoma grading using raw circumpapillary B-scans. In particular, we set out a\nnew OCT-based hybrid network which combines hand-driven and deep learning\nalgorithms. An OCT-specific descriptor is proposed to extract hand-crafted\nfeatures related to the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). In parallel, an\ninnovative CNN is developed using skip-connections to include tailored residual\nand attention modules to refine the automatic features of the latent space. The\nproposed architecture is used as a backbone to conduct a novel few-shot\nlearning based on static and dynamic prototypical networks. The k-shot paradigm\nis redefined giving rise to a supervised end-to-end system which provides\nsubstantial improvements discriminating between healthy, early and advanced\nglaucoma samples. The training and evaluation processes of the dynamic\nprototypical network are addressed from two fused databases acquired via\nHeidelberg Spectralis system. Validation and testing results reach a\ncategorical accuracy of 0.9459 and 0.8788 for glaucoma grading, respectively.\nBesides, the high performance reported by the proposed model for glaucoma\ndetection deserves a special mention. The findings from the class activation\nmaps are directly in line with the clinicians' opinion since the heatmaps\npointed out the RNFL as the most relevant structure for glaucoma diagnosis.",

          "description": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) aims to learn multi-modal representations\nfrom image-text pairs and serves for downstream vision-language tasks in a\nfine-tuning fashion. The dominant VLP models adopt a CNN-Transformer\narchitecture, which embeds images with a CNN, and then aligns images and text\nwith a Transformer. Visual relationship between visual contents plays an\nimportant role in image understanding and is the basic for inter-modal\nalignment learning. However, CNNs have limitations in visual relation learning\ndue to local receptive field's weakness in modeling long-range dependencies.\nThus the two objectives of learning visual relation and inter-modal alignment\nare encapsulated in the same Transformer network. Such design might restrict\nthe inter-modal alignment learning in the Transformer by ignoring the\nspecialized characteristic of each objective. To tackle this, we propose a\nfully Transformer visual embedding for VLP to better learn visual relation and\nfurther promote inter-modal alignment. Specifically, we propose a metric named\nInter-Modality Flow (IMF) to measure the interaction between vision and\nlanguage modalities (i.e., inter-modality). We also design a novel masking\noptimization mechanism named Masked Feature Regression (MFR) in Transformer to\nfurther promote the inter-modality learning. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first study to explore the benefit of Transformer for visual feature\nlearning in VLP. We verify our method on a wide range of vision-language tasks,\nincluding Visual Question Answering (VQA), Visual Entailment and Visual\nReasoning. Our approach not only outperforms the state-of-the-art VLP\nperformance, but also shows benefits on the IMF metric.",

In particular, a customized convolution layer termed as\nembedding layer is designed for network building. The embedding layer is added\ninto the region proposal networks, enabling the networks to learn\ndiscriminative features based on similarity learning. Features obtained by\nsimilarity learning can significantly boost the classification performance\ncompared to conventional methods. SRPN can be easily integrated into standard\nconvolutional neural networks architectures such as the Faster R-CNN and\nRetinaNet. We test the proposed approach on tasks of multi-organ nuclei\ndetection and signet ring cells detection in histological images. Experimental\nresults show that networks applying similarity learning achieved superior\nperformance on both tasks when compared to their counterparts. In particular,\nthe proposed SRPN achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MoNuSeg benchmark\nfor nuclei segmentation and detection while compared to previous methods, and\non the signet ring cell detection benchmark when compared with baselines.

          "description": "Recent studies have shown that neural network (NN) based image classifiers\nare highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, which poses a threat to\nsecurity-sensitive image recognition task. Prior work has shown that JPEG\ncompression can combat the drop in classification accuracy on adversarial\nexamples to some extent. But, as the compression ratio increases, traditional\nJPEG compression is insufficient to defend those attacks but can cause an\nabrupt accuracy decline to the benign images. In this paper, with the aim of\nfully filtering the adversarial perturbations, we firstly make modifications to\ntraditional JPEG compression algorithm which becomes more favorable for NN.\nSpecifically, based on an analysis of the frequency coefficient, we design a\nNN-favored quantization table for compression. Considering compression as a\ndata augmentation strategy, we then combine our model-agnostic preprocess with\nnoisy training. We fine-tune the pre-trained model by training with images\nencoded at different compression levels, thus generating multiple classifiers.\nFinally, since lower (higher) compression ratio can remove both perturbations\nand original features slightly (aggressively), we use these trained multiple\nmodels for model ensemble. The majority vote of the ensemble of models is\nadopted as final predictions. Experiments results show our method can improve\ndefense efficiency while maintaining original accuracy.",

This improves\nthe expressiveness and greatly eases the learning compared to Gaussians used in\nthe literature. 2) We model the sequential dependency structure of parts via a\nTransformer, which is more powerful and easier to train compared to RNNs used\nin the literature. 3) We propose an effective heuristic parsing algorithm to\npre-train the prior.

The proposed approach is data-driven\nand adopts for the first time the transformer architecture in the registration\ntask. Our method is general and applies to different settings. Given a fixed\ntemplate with some desired properties (e.g. skinning weights or other animation\ncues), we can register raw acquired data to it, thereby transferring all the\ntemplate properties to the input geometry. Alternatively, given a pair of\nshapes, our method can register the first onto the second (or vice-versa),\nobtaining a high-quality dense correspondence between the two. In both\ncontexts, the quality of our results enables us to target real applications\nsuch as texture transfer and shape interpolation. Furthermore, we also show\nthat including an estimation of the underlying density of the surface eases the\nlearning process. By exploiting the potential of this architecture, we can\ntrain our model requiring only a sparse set of ground truth correspondences\n($10\\sim20\\%$ of the total points).

To help address this, we present a high-fidelity\nsimulation environment that is designed for developing algorithms for causal\ndiscovery and counterfactual reasoning in the safety-critical context. A core\ncomponent of our work is to introduce \\textit{agency}, such that it is simple\nto define and create complex scenarios using high-level definitions. The\nvehicles then operate with agency to complete these objectives, meaning\nlow-level behaviors need only be controlled if necessary. We perform\nexperiments with three state-of-the-art methods to create baselines and\nhighlight the affordances of this environment. Finally, we highlight challenges\nand opportunities for future work.",

          "description": "Previous methods for skeleton-based gesture recognition mostly arrange the\nskeleton sequence into a pseudo picture or spatial-temporal graph and apply\ndeep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)\nfor feature extraction. Although achieving superior results, these methods have\ninherent limitations in dynamically capturing local features of interactive\nhand parts, and the computing efficiency still remains a serious issue. In this\nwork, the self-attention mechanism is introduced to alleviate this problem.\nConsidering the hierarchical structure of hand joints, we propose an efficient\nhierarchical self-attention network (HAN) for skeleton-based gesture\nrecognition, which is based on pure self-attention without any CNN, RNN or GCN\noperators. Specifically, the joint self-attention module is used to capture\nspatial features of fingers, the finger self-attention module is designed to\naggregate features of the whole hand. In terms of temporal features, the\ntemporal self-attention module is utilized to capture the temporal dynamics of\nthe fingers and the entire hand. Finally, these features are fused by the\nfusion self-attention module for gesture classification.

To obtain\nphysically consistent predictions, we train deep neural networks on the\nreduced-order manifold that, through the employ of inductive biases, ensure the\nfulfillment of the principles of thermodynamics.

In this study, we demonstrate the\nuse of agronomic knowledge of crop growth drivers in a Long Short-Term\nMemory-based, Domain-guided neural network (DgNN) for in-season crop progress\nestimation. The DgNN uses a branched structure and attention to separate\nindependent crop growth drivers and capture their varying importance throughout\nthe growing season. The DgNN is implemented for corn, using RS data in Iowa for\nthe period 2003-2019, with USDA crop progress reports used as ground truth.\nState-wide DgNN performance shows significant improvement over sequential and\ndense-only NN structures, and a widely-used Hidden Markov Model method. The\nDgNN had a 3.5% higher Nash-Sutfliffe efficiency over all growth stages and 33%\nmore weeks with highest cosine similarity than the other NNs during test years.\nThe DgNN and Sequential NN were more robust during periods of abnormal crop\nprogress, though estimating the Silking-Grainfill transition was difficult for\nall methods. Finally, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection\nvisualizations of layer activations showed how LSTM-based NNs separate crop\ngrowth time-series differently from a dense-only structure. Results from this\nstudy exhibit both the viability of NNs in crop growth stage estimation (CGSE)\nand the benefits of using domain knowledge.

However, the uncontrollable\nself-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively\nanswering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered\nHamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically,\nfacial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered\nevaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered\nevaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to\nevidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding\nquestion-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the\nSDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical\nframework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on\nthe questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a\nhierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern\nexploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for\nquestion-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term\nFE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of\neach video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative\ninformation and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity.\nThen, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire\nscores for final depression detection.

In this\npaper, we study the saliency prediction problem from the perspective of\ngenerative models by learning a conditional probability distribution over\nsaliency maps given an image, and treating the prediction as a sampling\nprocess. Specifically, we propose a generative cooperative saliency prediction\nframework based on the generative cooperative networks, where a conditional\nlatent variable model and a conditional energy-based model are jointly trained\nto predict saliency in a cooperative manner. We call our model the SalCoopNets.\nThe latent variable model serves as a fast but coarse predictor to efficiently\nproduce an initial prediction, which is then refined by the iterative Langevin\nrevision of the energy-based model that serves as a fine predictor. Such a\ncoarse-to-fine cooperative saliency prediction strategy offers the best of both\nworlds. Moreover, we generalize our framework to the scenario of weakly\nsupervised saliency prediction, where saliency annotation of training images is\npartially observed, by proposing a cooperative learning while recovering\nstrategy. Lastly, we show that the learned energy function can serve as a\nrefinement module that can refine the results of other pre-trained saliency\nprediction models.

This mechanism is materialized into a\nfamily of general-purpose neural units and their multi-level architecture\ncalled Hierarchical Object-oriented Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (HOSTR) networks.\nThis neural model maintains the objects' consistent lifelines in the form of a\nhierarchically nested spatio-temporal graph. Within this graph, the dynamic\ninteractive object-oriented representations are built up along the video\nsequence, hierarchically abstracted in a bottom-up manner, and converge toward\nthe key information for the correct answer. The method is evaluated on multiple\nmajor Video QA datasets and establishes new state-of-the-arts in these tasks.\nAnalysis into the model's behavior indicates that object-oriented reasoning is\na reliable, interpretable and efficient approach to Video QA.",

          "description": "In this paper, we address the problem of high performance and computationally\nefficient content-based video retrieval in large-scale datasets. Current\nmethods typically propose either: (i) fine-grained approaches employing\nspatio-temporal representations and similarity calculations, achieving high\nperformance at a high computational cost or (ii) coarse-grained approaches\nrepresenting/indexing videos as global vectors, where the spatio-temporal\nstructure is lost, providing low performance but also having low computational\ncost. In this work, we propose a Knowledge Distillation framework, which we\ncall Distill-and-Select (DnS), that starting from a well-performing\nfine-grained Teacher Network learns: a) Student Networks at different retrieval\nperformance and computational efficiency trade-offs and b) a Selection Network\nthat at test time rapidly directs samples to the appropriate student to\nmaintain both high retrieval performance and high computational efficiency. We\ntrain several students with different architectures and arrive at different\ntrade-offs of performance and efficiency, i.e., speed and storage requirements,\nincluding fine-grained students that store index videos using binary\nrepresentations. Importantly, the proposed scheme allows Knowledge Distillation\nin large, unlabelled datasets -- this leads to good students. We evaluate DnS\non five public datasets on three different video retrieval tasks and\ndemonstrate a) that our students achieve state-of-the-art performance in\nseveral cases and b) that our DnS framework provides an excellent trade-off\nbetween retrieval performance, computational speed, and storage space. In\nspecific configurations, our method achieves similar mAP with the teacher but\nis 20 times faster and requires 240 times less storage space.

          "description": "One-class learning is the classic problem of fitting a model to the data for\nwhich annotations are available only for a single class. In this paper, we\nexplore novel objectives for one-class learning, which we collectively refer to\nas Generalized One-class Discriminative Subspaces (GODS). Our key idea is to\nlearn a pair of complementary classifiers to flexibly bound the one-class data\ndistribution, where the data belongs to the positive half-space of one of the\nclassifiers in the complementary pair and to the negative half-space of the\nother. To avoid redundancy while allowing non-linearity in the classifier\ndecision surfaces, we propose to design each classifier as an orthonormal frame\nand seek to learn these frames via jointly optimizing for two conflicting\nobjectives, namely: i) to minimize the distance between the two frames, and ii)\nto maximize the margin between the frames and the data. The learned orthonormal\nframes will thus characterize a piecewise linear decision surface that allows\nfor efficient inference, while our objectives seek to bound the data within a\nminimal volume that maximizes the decision margin, thereby robustly capturing\nthe data distribution. We explore several variants of our formulation under\ndifferent constraints on the constituent classifiers, including kernelized\nfeature maps. We demonstrate the empirical benefits of our approach via\nexperiments on data from several applications in computer vision, such as\nanomaly detection in video sequences, human poses, and human activities. We\nalso explore the generality and effectiveness of GODS for non-vision tasks via\nexperiments on several UCI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.",

Our method allows illumination to\nbe changed synthetically, while coherently rendering cast shadows and complex\nglossy materials. We start with multiple images of the scene and a 3D mesh\nobtained by multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction. We assume that lighting is\nwell-explained as the sum of a view-independent diffuse component and a\nview-dependent glossy term concentrated around the mirror reflection direction.\nWe design a convolutional network around input feature maps that facilitate\nlearning of an implicit representation of scene materials and illumination,\nenabling both relighting and free-viewpoint navigation. We generate these input\nmaps by exploiting the best elements of both image-based and physically-based\nrendering. We sample the input views to estimate diffuse scene irradiance, and\ncompute the new illumination caused by user-specified light sources using path\ntracing. To facilitate the network's understanding of materials and synthesize\nplausible glossy reflections, we reproject the views and compute mirror images.\nWe train the network on a synthetic dataset where each scene is also\nreconstructed with MVS.

In this paper, we first analyze the noisy client statement,\nand then model noisy clients with different noise distributions (e.g.,\nBernoulli and truncated Gaussian distributions). To learn with noisy clients,\nwe propose a simple yet effective FL framework, named Federated Noisy Client\nLearning (Fed-NCL), which is a plug-and-play algorithm and contains two main\ncomponents: a data quality measurement (DQM) to dynamically quantify the data\nquality of each participating client, and a noise robust aggregation (NRA) to\nadaptively aggregate the local models of each client by jointly considering the\namount of local training data and the data quality of each client. Our Fed-NCL\ncan be easily applied in any standard FL workflow to handle the noisy client\nissue.

In spite of the impressive success\nmade by transformers in a variety of vision tasks, it still suffers from heavy\ncomputation and intensive memory cost. To address this limitation, this paper\npresents an Interpretability-Aware REDundancy REDuction framework (IA-RED$^2$).\nWe start by observing a large amount of redundant computation, mainly spent on\nuncorrelated input patches, and then introduce an interpretable module to\ndynamically and gracefully drop these redundant patches. This novel framework\nis then extended to a hierarchical structure, where uncorrelated tokens at\ndifferent stages are gradually removed, resulting in a considerable shrinkage\nof computational cost. We include extensive experiments on both image and video\ntasks, where our method could deliver up to 1.4X speed-up for state-of-the-art\nmodels like DeiT and TimeSformer, by only sacrificing less than 0.7% accuracy.\nMore importantly, contrary to other acceleration approaches, our method is\ninherently interpretable with substantial visual evidence, making vision\ntransformer closer to a more human-understandable architecture while being\nlighter. We demonstrate that the interpretability that naturally emerged in our\nframework can outperform the raw attention learned by the original visual\ntransformer, as well as those generated by off-the-shelf interpretation\nmethods, with both qualitative and quantitative results.

Although adversarial training (AT)\nmethods such as Adversarial Query (AQ) can improve the adversarially robust\nperformance of meta-learning models, AT is still computationally expensive\ntraining. On the other hand, meta-learning models trained with AT will drop\nsignificant accuracy on the original clean images.

LCAT will update meta-learning\nmodel parameters cross along the natural and adversarial sample distribution\ndirection with long-term to improve both adversarial and clean few-shot\nclassification accuracy. Due to cross-adversarial training, LCAT only needs\nhalf of the adversarial training epoch than AQ, resulting in a low adversarial\ntraining computation.

Although these methods show strong results\non outdoor datasets such as KITTI, they do not match performance of supervised\nmethods on indoor environments with camera rotation. Indoor, rotated scenes are\ncommon for less constrained applications and pose problems for two reasons:\nabundance of low texture regions and increased complexity of depth cues for\nimages under rotation. In an effort to extend self-supervised learning to more\ngeneralised environments we propose two additions. First, we propose a novel\nFilled Disparity Loss term that corrects for ambiguity of image reconstruction\nerror loss in textureless regions. Specifically, we interpolate disparity in\nuntextured regions, using the estimated disparity from surrounding textured\nareas, and use L1 loss to correct the original estimation. Our experiments show\nthat depth estimation is substantially improved on low-texture scenes, without\nany loss on textured scenes, when compared to Monodepth by Godard et al.\nSecondly, we show that training with an application's representative rotations,\nin both pitch and roll, is sufficient to significantly improve performance over\nthe entire range of expected rotation. We demonstrate that depth estimation is\nsuccessfully generalised as performance is not lost when evaluated on test sets\nwith no camera rotation.

          "description": "Lane detection is an essential part of the perception sub-architecture of any\nautomated driving (AD) or advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). When\nfocusing on low-cost, large scale products for automated driving, model-driven\napproaches for the detection of lane markings have proven good performance.\nMore recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed that target the\ndrivable area / freespace mainly in inner-city applications. Focus of these\napproaches is less on lane-based driving due to the fact that the lane concept\ndoes not fully apply in unstructured, residential inner-city environments.\nSo-far the concept of drivable area is seldom used for highway and inter-urban\napplications due to the specific requirements of these scenarios that require\nclear lane associations of all traffic participants. We believe that\nlane-based, mapless driving in inter-urban and highway scenarios is still not\nfully handled with sufficient robustness and availability. Especially for\nchallenging weather situations such as heavy rain, fog, low-standing sun,\ndarkness or reflections in puddles, the mapless detection of lane markings\ndecreases significantly or completely fails. We see potential in applying\nspecifically designed data-driven freespace approaches in more lane-based\ndriving applications for highways and inter-urban use. Therefore, we propose to\nclassify specifically a drivable corridor of the ego lane on pixel level with a\ndeep learning approach. Our approach is kept computationally efficient with\nonly 0.66 million parameters allowing its application in large scale products.\nThus, we were able to easily integrate into an online AD system of a test\nvehicle. We demonstrate the performance of our approach under challenging\nconditions qualitatively and quantitatively in comparison to a state-of-the-art\nmodel-driven approach.",

          "description": "Few-shot learning is a challenging task, which aims to learn a classifier for\nnovel classes with few examples. Pre-training based meta-learning methods\neffectively tackle the problem by pre-training a feature extractor and then\nfine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based meta-learning. However,\nresults show that the fine-tuning step makes very marginal improvements. In\nthis paper, 1) we figure out the key reason, i.e., in the pre-trained feature\nspace, the base classes already form compact clusters while novel classes\nspread as groups with large variances, which implies that fine-tuning the\nfeature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning the feature\nextractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes during\nmeta-learning. Consequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based\nmeta-learning framework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge\n(i.e., class-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative\nattribute features as priors. Then, we design a prototype completion network to\nlearn to complete prototypes with these priors. To avoid the prototype\ncompletion error caused by primitive knowledge noises or class differences, we\nfurther develop a Gaussian based prototype fusion strategy that combines the\nmean-based and completed prototypes by exploiting the unlabeled samples.\nExtensive experiments show that our method: (i) can obtain more accurate\nprototypes; (ii) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 2% - 9% in terms of\nclassification accuracy.

          "description": "The scarcity of labeled data often impedes the application of deep learning\nto the segmentation of medical images. Semi-supervised learning seeks to\novercome this limitation by exploiting unlabeled examples in the learning\nprocess. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised segmentation method\nthat leverages mutual information (MI) on categorical distributions to achieve\nboth global representation invariance and local smoothness. In this method, we\nmaximize the MI for intermediate feature embeddings that are taken from both\nthe encoder and decoder of a segmentation network. We first propose a global MI\nloss constraining the encoder to learn an image representation that is\ninvariant to geometric transformations. Instead of resorting to\ncomputationally-expensive techniques for estimating the MI on continuous\nfeature embeddings, we use projection heads to map them to a discrete cluster\nassignment where MI can be computed efficiently. Our method also includes a\nlocal MI loss to promote spatial consistency in the feature maps of the decoder\nand provide a smoother segmentation. Since mutual information does not require\na strict ordering of clusters in two different assignments, we incorporate a\nfinal consistency regularization loss on the output which helps align the\ncluster labels throughout the network. We evaluate the method on four\nchallenging publicly-available datasets for medical image segmentation.\nExperimental results show our method to outperform recently-proposed approaches\nfor semi-supervised segmentation and provide an accuracy near to full\nsupervision while training with very few annotated images.",

          "description": "Understanding the semantics of human movement -- the what, how and why of the\nmovement -- is an important problem that requires datasets of human actions\nwith semantic labels. Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale\nvideo datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D\nhuman motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body\nmotions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we\npresent BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions\nbeing performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about\n43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of\nabstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and\nframe labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame\nlabel is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the\nmocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence\nlabels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action\ncategories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action\nrecognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To\ndemonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of\nmodels on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting\nlearning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve\nas a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition.

Therefore, it is valuable to develop accurate and real-time vision\nprocessing models that only require limited computational resources. To this\nend, we propose the Spatial-detail Guided Context Propagation Network (SGCPNet)\nfor achieving real-time semantic segmentation. In SGCPNet, we propose the\nstrategy of spatial-detail guided context propagation. It uses the spatial\ndetails of shallow layers to guide the propagation of the low-resolution global\ncontexts, in which the lost spatial information can be effectively\nreconstructed. In this way, the need for maintaining high-resolution features\nalong the network is freed, therefore largely improving the model efficiency.\nOn the other hand, due to the effective reconstruction of spatial details, the\nsegmentation accuracy can be still preserved. In the experiments, we validate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SGCPNet model. On the\nCitysacpes dataset, for example, our SGCPNet achieves 69.5 % mIoU segmentation\naccuracy, while its speed reaches 178.5 FPS on 768x1536 images on a GeForce GTX\n1080 Ti GPU card.",

          "description": "Detecting human-object interactions (HOI) is an important step toward a\ncomprehensive visual understanding of machines. While detecting non-temporal\nHOIs (e.g., sitting on a chair) from static images is feasible, it is unlikely\neven for humans to guess temporal-related HOIs (e.g., opening/closing a door)\nfrom a single video frame, where the neighboring frames play an essential role.\nHowever, conventional HOI methods operating on only static images have been\nused to predict temporal-related interactions, which is essentially guessing\nwithout temporal contexts and may lead to sub-optimal performance. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by detecting video-based HOIs with explicit temporal\ninformation. We first show that a naive temporal-aware variant of a common\naction detection baseline does not work on video-based HOIs due to a\nfeature-inconsistency issue. We then propose a simple yet effective\narchitecture named Spatial-Temporal HOI Detection (ST-HOI) utilizing temporal\ninformation such as human and object trajectories, correctly-localized visual\nfeatures, and spatial-temporal masking pose features. We construct a new video\nHOI benchmark dubbed VidHOI where our proposed approach serves as a solid\nbaseline.",

          "description": "Deformable image registration is a fundamental task in medical imaging. Due\nto the large computational complexity of deformable registration of volumetric\nimages, conventional iterative methods usually face the tradeoff between the\nregistration accuracy and the computation time in practice. In order to boost\nthe registration performance in both accuracy and runtime, we propose a fast\nconvolutional neural network. Specially, to efficiently utilize the memory\nresources and enlarge the model capacity, we adopt additive forwarding instead\nof channel concatenation and deepen the network in each encoder and decoder\nstage. To facilitate the learning efficiency, we leverage skip connection\nwithin the encoder and decoder stages to enable residual learning and employ an\nauxiliary loss at the bottom layer with lowest resolution to involve deep\nsupervision. Particularly, the low-resolution auxiliary loss is weighted by an\nexponentially decayed parameter during the training phase. In conjunction with\nthe main loss in high-resolution grid, a coarse-to-fine learning strategy is\nachieved. Last but not least, we introduce an auxiliary loss based on the\nsegmentation prior to improve the registration performance in Dice score.\nComparing to the auxiliary loss using average Dice score, the proposed\nmulti-label segmentation loss does not induce additional memory cost in the\ntraining phase and can be employed on images with arbitrary amount of\ncategories. In the experiments, we show FDRN outperforms the existing\nstate-of-the-art registration methods for brain MR images by resorting to the\ncompact network structure and efficient learning. Besides, FDRN is a\ngeneralized framework for image registration which is not confined to a\nparticular type of medical images or anatomy.",

          "description": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are able to reconstruct scenes with\nunprecedented fidelity, and various recent works have extended NeRF to handle\ndynamic scenes. A common approach to reconstruct such non-rigid scenes is\nthrough the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in each\ninput image into a canonical template coordinate space. However, these\ndeformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, as\ntopological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these\ndeformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limitation by\nlifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5D\nradiance field corresponding to each individual input image as a slice through\nthis \"hyper-space\". Our method is inspired by level set methods, which model\nthe evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. We\nevaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly between \"moments\",\ni.e., configurations of the scene, seen in the input images while maintaining\nvisual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We show\nthat our method, which we dub HyperNeRF, outperforms existing methods on both\ntasks by significant margins. Compared to Nerfies, HyperNeRF reduces average\nerror rates by 8.6% for interpolation and 8.8% for novel-view synthesis, as\nmeasured by LPIPS.",

          "description": "An agent that is capable of predicting what happens next can perform a\nvariety of tasks through planning with no additional training. Furthermore,\nsuch an agent can internally represent the complex dynamics of the real-world\nand therefore can acquire a representation useful for a variety of visual\nperception tasks. This makes predicting the future frames of a video,\nconditioned on the observed past and potentially future actions, an interesting\ntask which remains exceptionally challenging despite many recent advances.\nExisting video prediction models have shown promising results on simple narrow\nbenchmarks but they generate low quality predictions on real-life datasets with\nmore complicated dynamics or broader domain. There is a growing body of\nevidence that underfitting on the training data is one of the primary causes\nfor the low quality predictions. In this paper, we argue that the inefficient\nuse of parameters in the current video models is the main reason for\nunderfitting. Therefore, we introduce a new architecture, named FitVid, which\nis capable of severe overfitting on the common benchmarks while having similar\nparameter count as the current state-of-the-art models. We analyze the\nconsequences of overfitting, illustrating how it can produce unexpected\noutcomes such as generating high quality output by repeating the training data,\nand how it can be mitigated using existing image augmentation techniques. As a\nresult, FitVid outperforms the current state-of-the-art models across four\ndifferent video prediction benchmarks on four different metrics.",

          "description": "The 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) is a powerful statistical tool for representing\n3D face shapes. To build a 3DMM, a training set of face scans in full\npoint-to-point correspondence is required, and its modeling capabilities\ndirectly depend on the variability contained in the training data. Thus, to\nincrease the descriptive power of the 3DMM, establishing a dense correspondence\nacross heterogeneous scans with sufficient diversity in terms of identities,\nethnicities, or expressions becomes essential. In this manuscript, we present a\nfully automatic approach that leverages a 3DMM to transfer its dense semantic\nannotation across raw 3D faces, establishing a dense correspondence between\nthem. We propose a novel formulation to learn a set of sparse deformation\ncomponents with local support on the face that, together with an original\nnon-rigid deformation algorithm, allow the 3DMM to precisely fit unseen faces\nand transfer its semantic annotation. We extensively experimented our approach,\nshowing it can effectively generalize to highly diverse samples and accurately\nestablish a dense correspondence even in presence of complex facial\nexpressions. The accuracy of the dense registration is demonstrated by building\na heterogeneous, large-scale 3DMM from more than 9,000 fully registered scans\nobtained by joining three large datasets together.",

          "description": "Face recognition systems are extremely vulnerable to morphing attacks, in\nwhich a morphed facial reference image can be successfully verified as two or\nmore distinct identities. In this paper, we propose a morph attack detection\nalgorithm that leverages an undecimated 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for\nidentifying morphed face images. The core of our framework is that artifacts\nresulting from the morphing process that are not discernible in the image\ndomain can be more easily identified in the spatial frequency domain. A\ndiscriminative wavelet sub-band can accentuate the disparity between a real and\na morphed image. To this end, multi-level DWT is applied to all images,\nyielding 48 mid and high-frequency sub-bands each. The entropy distributions\nfor each sub-band are calculated separately for both bona fide and morph\nimages. For some of the sub-bands, there is a marked difference between the\nentropy of the sub-band in a bona fide image and the identical sub-band's\nentropy in a morphed image. Consequently, we employ Kullback-Liebler Divergence\n(KLD) to exploit these differences and isolate the sub-bands that are the most\ndiscriminative. We measure how discriminative a sub-band is by its KLD value\nand the 22 sub-bands with the highest KLD values are chosen for network\ntraining. Then, we train a deep Siamese neural network using these 22 selected\nsub-bands for differential morph attack detection. We examine the efficacy of\ndiscriminative wavelet sub-bands for morph attack detection and show that a\ndeep neural network trained on these sub-bands can accurately identify morph\nimagery.",

Existing\ncollaborative learning approaches generally do not account for the presence of\nheterogeneity in data among institutions, or only mildly skewed label\ndistributions are studied. In this paper, we present a novel generative replay\nstrategy to address the challenge of data heterogeneity in collaborative\nlearning methods. Instead of directly training a model for task performance, we\nleverage recent image synthesis techniques to develop a novel dual model\narchitecture: a primary model learns the desired task, and an auxiliary\n\"generative replay model\" either synthesizes images that closely resemble the\ninput images or helps extract latent variables. The generative replay strategy\nis flexible to use, can either be incorporated into existing collaborative\nlearning methods to improve their capability of handling data heterogeneity\nacross institutions, or be used as a novel and individual collaborative\nlearning framework (termed FedReplay) to reduce communication cost.\nExperimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in\nhandling heterogeneous data across institutions. On highly heterogeneous data\npartitions, our model achieves ~4.88% improvement in the prediction accuracy on\na diabetic retinopathy classification dataset, and ~49.8% reduction of mean\nabsolution value on a Bone Age prediction dataset, respectively, compared to\nthe state-of-the art collaborative learning methods.",

          "description": "Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment camouflaged objects hiding\nin the environment, which is challenging due to the similar appearance of\ncamouflaged objects and their surroundings. Research in biology suggests that\ndepth can provide useful object localization cues for camouflaged object\ndiscovery, as all the animals have 3D perception ability. However, the depth\ninformation has not been exploited for camouflaged object detection. To explore\nthe contribution of depth for camouflage detection, we present a depth-guided\ncamouflaged object detection network with pre-computed depth maps from existing\nmonocular depth estimation methods. Due to the domain gap between the depth\nestimation dataset and our camouflaged object detection dataset, the generated\ndepth may not be accurate enough to be directly used in our framework. We then\nintroduce a depth quality assessment module to evaluate the quality of depth\nbased on the model prediction from both RGB COD branch and RGB-D COD branch.\nDuring training, only high-quality depth is used to update the modal\ninteraction module for multi-modal learning. During testing, our depth quality\nassessment module can effectively determine the contribution of depth and\nselect the RGB branch or RGB-D branch for camouflage prediction. Extensive\nexperiments on various camouflaged object detection datasets prove the\neffectiveness of our solution in exploring the depth information for\ncamouflaged object detection.

To reduce\nfatalities, developing intelligent driving systems assisting drivers to\nidentify potential risks is in urgent need.

We believe a more generic\ndefinition is required. In this work, we propose a novel driver-centric\ndefinition of risk, i.e., risky objects influence driver behavior. Based on\nthis definition, a new task called risk object identification is introduced. We\nformulate the task as a cause-effect problem and present a novel two-stage risk\nobject identification framework, taking inspiration from models of situation\nawareness and causal inference. A driver-centric Risk Object Identification\n(ROI) dataset is curated to evaluate the proposed system.

          "description": "The ability to estimate how a tumor might evolve in the future could have\ntremendous clinical benefits, from improved treatment decisions to better dose\ndistribution in radiation therapy. Recent work has approached the glioma growth\nmodeling problem via deep learning and variational inference, thus learning\ngrowth dynamics entirely from a real patient data distribution. So far, this\napproach was constrained to predefined image acquisition intervals and\nsequences of fixed length, which limits its applicability in more realistic\nscenarios. We overcome these limitations by extending Neural Processes, a class\nof conditional generative models for stochastic time series, with a\nhierarchical multi-scale representation encoding including a spatio-temporal\nattention mechanism. The result is a learned growth model that can be\nconditioned on an arbitrary number of observations, and that can produce a\ndistribution of temporally consistent growth trajectories on a continuous time\naxis. On a dataset of 379 patients, the approach successfully captures both\nglobal and finer-grained variations in the images, exhibiting superior\nperformance compared to other learned growth models.",

          "description": "Depth completion aims to generate a dense depth map from the sparse depth map\nand aligned RGB image. However, current depth completion methods use extremely\nexpensive 64-line LiDAR(about $100,000) to obtain sparse depth maps, which will\nlimit their application scenarios. Compared with the 64-line LiDAR, the\nsingle-line LiDAR is much less expensive and much more robust. Therefore, we\npropose a method to tackle the problem of single-line depth completion, in\nwhich we aim to generate a dense depth map from the single-line LiDAR info and\nthe aligned RGB image. A single-line depth completion dataset is proposed based\non the existing 64-line depth completion dataset(KITTI). A network called\nSemantic Guided Two-Branch Network(SGTBN) which contains global and local\nbranches to extract and fuse global and local info is proposed for this task. A\nSemantic guided depth upsampling module is used in our network to make full use\nof the semantic info in RGB images. Except for the usual MSE loss, we add the\nvirtual normal loss to increase the constraint of high-order 3D geometry in our\nnetwork.

          "description": "Understanding the 3D world from 2D projected natural images is a fundamental\nchallenge in computer vision and graphics. Recently, an unsupervised learning\napproach has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantages in data\ncollection. However, to mitigate training limitations, typical methods need to\nimpose assumptions for viewpoint distribution (e.g., a dataset containing\nvarious viewpoint images) or object shape (e.g., symmetric objects). These\nassumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to\nnon-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or\nbird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose\naperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip\naperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and\ndepth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the\nambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth\ntexture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs),\nwe develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real\nimage distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise\na center focus prior to guiding the learning direction. In the experiments, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of AR-GANs in various datasets, such as flower,\nbird, and face images, demonstrate their portability by incorporating them into\nother 3D representation learning GANs, and validate their applicability in\nshallow DoF rendering.",

          "description": "Existing scene text removal methods mainly train an elaborate network with\npaired images to realize the function of text localization and background\nreconstruction simultaneously, but there exists two problems: 1) lacking the\nexhaustive erasure of text region and 2) causing the excessive erasure to\ntext-free areas. To handle these issues, this paper provides a novel\nProgrEssively Region-based scene Text eraser (PERT), which introduces\nregion-based modification strategy to progressively erase the pixels in only\ntext region. Firstly, PERT decomposes the STR task to several erasing stages.\nAs each stage aims to take a further step toward the text-removed image rather\nthan directly regress to the final result, the decomposed operation reduces the\nlearning difficulty in each stage, and an exhaustive erasure result can be\nobtained by iterating over lightweight erasing blocks with shared parameters.\nThen, PERT introduces a region-based modification strategy to ensure the\nintegrity of text-free areas by decoupling text localization from erasure\nprocess to guide the removal. Benefiting from the simplicity architecture, PERT\nis a simple and strong baseline, and is easy to be followed and developed.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that PERT obtains the state-of-the-art\nresults on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

          "description": "Monte Carlo rendering algorithms are widely used to produce photorealistic\ncomputer graphics images. However, these algorithms need to sample a\nsubstantial amount of rays per pixel to enable proper global illumination and\nthus require an immense amount of computation. In this paper, we present a\nhybrid rendering method to speed up Monte Carlo rendering algorithms. Our\nmethod first generates two versions of a rendering: one at a low resolution\nwith a high sample rate (LRHS) and the other at a high resolution with a low\nsample rate (HRLS). We then develop a deep convolutional neural network to fuse\nthese two renderings into a high-quality image as if it were rendered at a high\nresolution with a high sample rate. Specifically, we formulate this fusion task\nas a super resolution problem that generates a high resolution rendering from a\nlow resolution input (LRHS), assisted with the HRLS rendering. The HRLS\nrendering provides critical high frequency details which are difficult to\nrecover from the LRHS for any super resolution methods. Our experiments show\nthat our hybrid rendering algorithm is significantly faster than the\nstate-of-the-art Monte Carlo denoising methods while rendering high-quality\nimages when tested on both our own BCR dataset and the Gharbi dataset.\n\\url{https://github.com/hqqxyy/msspl}",

In this work, we propose an occlusion-robust block, Region Feature\nCompletion (RFC), for occluded reID. Different from most previous works that\ndiscard the occluded regions, RFC block can recover the semantics of occluded\nregions in feature space. Firstly, a Spatial RFC (SRFC) module is developed.\nSRFC exploits the long-range spatial contexts from non-occluded regions to\npredict the features of occluded regions. The unit-wise prediction task leads\nto an encoder/decoder architecture, where the region-encoder models the\ncorrelation between non-occluded and occluded region, and the region-decoder\nutilizes the spatial correlation to recover occluded region features. Secondly,\nwe introduce Temporal RFC (TRFC) module which captures the long-term temporal\ncontexts to refine the prediction of SRFC. RFC block is lightweight, end-to-end\ntrainable and can be easily plugged into existing CNNs to form RFCnet.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on occluded and commonly holistic reID\nbenchmarks.

However, replacing speech\nwith sign language proves to be a practical solution while communicating with\npeople suffering from hearing loss. Therefore, we eliminate the need of using\ntext as input and design techniques that work for more natural, continuous,\nfreely uttered speech covering an extensive vocabulary. Since the current\ndatasets are inadequate for generating sign language directly from speech, we\ncollect and release the first Indian sign language dataset comprising\nspeech-level annotations, text transcripts, and the corresponding sign-language\nvideos. Next, we propose a multi-tasking transformer network trained to\ngenerate signer's poses from speech segments. With speech-to-text as an\nauxiliary task and an additional cross-modal discriminator, our model learns to\ngenerate continuous sign pose sequences in an end-to-end manner. Extensive\nexperiments and comparisons with other baselines demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach. We also conduct additional ablation studies to analyze the\neffect of different modules of our network. A demo video containing several\nresults is attached to the supplementary material.",

          "description": "High-resolution image segmentation remains challenging and error-prone due to\nthe enormous size of intermediate feature maps. Conventional methods avoid this\nproblem by using patch based approaches where each patch is segmented\nindependently. However, independent patch segmentation induces errors,\nparticularly at the patch boundary due to the lack of contextual information in\nvery high-resolution images where the patch size is much smaller compared to\nthe full image. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework to segment a particular patch by incorporating contextual\ninformation from its neighboring patches. This allows the segmentation network\nto see the target patch with a wider field of view without the need of larger\nfeature maps. Comparative analysis from a number of experiments shows that our\nproposed framework is able to segment high resolution images with significantly\nimproved mean Intersection over Union and overall accuracy.",

This work aims at developing and\nevaluating a deep learning-based framework, named VinDr-SpineXR, for the\nclassification and localization of abnormalities from spine X-rays. First, we\nbuild a large dataset, comprising 10,468 spine X-ray images from 5,000 studies,\neach of which is manually annotated by an experienced radiologist with bounding\nboxes around abnormal findings in 13 categories. Using this dataset, we then\ntrain a deep learning classifier to determine whether a spine scan is abnormal\nand a detector to localize 7 crucial findings amongst the total 13. The\nVinDr-SpineXR is evaluated on a test set of 2,078 images from 1,000 studies,\nwhich is kept separate from the training set. It demonstrates an area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 88.61% (95% CI 87.19%,\n90.02%) for the image-level classification task and a mean average precision\n(mAP@0.5) of 33.56% for the lesion-level localization task.

          "description": "The astounding success made by artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare and\nother fields proves that AI can achieve human-like performance. However,\nsuccess always comes with challenges. Deep learning algorithms are\ndata-dependent and require large datasets for training. The lack of data in the\nmedical imaging field creates a bottleneck for the application of deep learning\nto medical image analysis. Medical image acquisition, annotation, and analysis\nare costly, and their usage is constrained by ethical restrictions. They also\nrequire many resources, such as human expertise and funding. That makes it\ndifficult for non-medical researchers to have access to useful and large\nmedical data. Thus, as comprehensive as possible, this paper provides a\ncollection of medical image datasets with their associated challenges for deep\nlearning research. We have collected information of around three hundred\ndatasets and challenges mainly reported between 2013 and 2020 and categorized\nthem into four categories: head & neck, chest & abdomen, pathology & blood, and\n``others''. Our paper has three purposes: 1) to provide a most up to date and\ncomplete list that can be used as a universal reference to easily find the\ndatasets for clinical image analysis, 2) to guide researchers on the\nmethodology to test and evaluate their methods' performance and robustness on\nrelevant datasets, 3) to provide a ``route'' to relevant algorithms for the\nrelevant medical topics, and challenge leaderboards.",

          "description": "With the rapid progress of deepfake techniques in recent years, facial video\nforgery can generate highly deceptive video contents and bring severe security\nthreats. And detection of such forgery videos is much more urgent and\nchallenging. Most existing detection methods treat the problem as a vanilla\nbinary classification problem. In this paper, the problem is treated as a\nspecial fine-grained classification problem since the differences between fake\nand real faces are very subtle. It is observed that most existing face forgery\nmethods left some common artifacts in the spatial domain and time domain,\nincluding generative defects in the spatial domain and inter-frame\ninconsistencies in the time domain. And a spatial-temporal model is proposed\nwhich has two components for capturing spatial and temporal forgery traces in\nglobal perspective respectively. The two components are designed using a novel\nlong distance attention mechanism. The one component of the spatial domain is\nused to capture artifacts in a single frame, and the other component of the\ntime domain is used to capture artifacts in consecutive frames. They generate\nattention maps in the form of patches. The attention method has a broader\nvision which contributes to better assembling global information and extracting\nlocal statistic information. Finally, the attention maps are used to guide the\nnetwork to focus on pivotal parts of the face, just like other fine-grained\nclassification methods. The experimental results on different public datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance,\nand the proposed long distance attention method can effectively capture pivotal\nparts for face forgery.",

Next, we discuss some popular datasets for multi-modal 3D\nobject detection, with a special focus on the sensor data included in each\ndataset. Then we present in-depth reviews of recent multi-modal 3D detection\nnetworks by considering the following three aspects of the fusion: fusion\nlocation, fusion data representation, and fusion granularity.

In this paper,\nwe proposed a multi-modal registration based SLAM algorithm, which estimates\nthe location of a planet UAV using a nadir view camera on the UAV compared with\npre-existing digital terrain model. To overcome the scale and appearance\ndifference between on-board UAV images and pre-installed digital terrain model,\na theoretical model is proposed to prove that topographic features of UAV image\nand DEM can be correlated in frequency domain via cross power spectrum. To\nprovide the six-DOF of the UAV, we also developed an optimization approach\nwhich fuses the geo-referencing result into a SLAM system via LBA (Local Bundle\nAdjustment) to achieve robust and accurate vision-based navigation even in\nfeatureless planetary areas. To test the robustness and effectiveness of the\nproposed localization algorithm, a new cross-source drone-based localization\ndataset for planetary exploration is proposed. The proposed dataset includes\n40200 synthetic drone images taken from nine planetary scenes with related DEM\nquery images. Comparison experiments carried out demonstrate that over the\nflight distance of 33.8km, the proposed method achieved average localization\nerror of 0.45 meters, compared to 1.31 meters by ORB-SLAM, with the processing\nspeed of 12hz which will ensure a real-time performance.

          "description": "Novelty Detection methods identify samples that are not representative of a\nmodel's training set thereby flagging misleading predictions and bringing a\ngreater flexibility and transparency at deployment time. However, research in\nthis area has only considered Novelty Detection in the offline setting.\nRecently, there has been a growing realization in the computer vision community\nthat applications demand a more flexible framework - Continual Learning - where\nnew batches of data representing new domains, new classes or new tasks become\navailable at different points in time. In this setting, Novelty Detection\nbecomes more important, interesting and challenging. This work identifies the\ncrucial link between the two problems and investigates the Novelty Detection\nproblem under the Continual Learning setting. We formulate the Continual\nNovelty Detection problem and present a benchmark, where we compare several\nNovelty Detection methods under different Continual Learning settings.\n\nWe show that Continual Learning affects the behaviour of novelty detection\nalgorithms, while novelty detection can pinpoint insights in the behaviour of a\ncontinual learner. We further propose baselines and discuss possible research\ndirections. We believe that the coupling of the two problems is a promising\ndirection to bring vision models into practice.",

It places image retrieval in the practical context of physical\nagents operating in a physical world.

In the following, we argue that due to variations of this\npractical context and individual design decisions, place recognition\nexperiments are barely comparable across different papers and that there is a\nvariety of properties that can change from one experiment to another. We\nprovide an extensive list of such properties and give examples how they can be\nused to setup a place recognition experiment easier or harder.

          "description": "Traditional feature-based image stitching technologies rely heavily on\nfeature detection quality, often failing to stitch images with few features or\nlow resolution. The learning-based image stitching solutions are rarely studied\ndue to the lack of labeled data, making the supervised methods unreliable. To\naddress the above limitations, we propose an unsupervised deep image stitching\nframework consisting of two stages: unsupervised coarse image alignment and\nunsupervised image reconstruction. In the first stage, we design an\nablation-based loss to constrain an unsupervised homography network, which is\nmore suitable for large-baseline scenes. Moreover, a transformer layer is\nintroduced to warp the input images in the stitching-domain space. In the\nsecond stage, motivated by the insight that the misalignments in pixel-level\ncan be eliminated to a certain extent in feature-level, we design an\nunsupervised image reconstruction network to eliminate the artifacts from\nfeatures to pixels. Specifically, the reconstruction network can be implemented\nby a low-resolution deformation branch and a high-resolution refined branch,\nlearning the deformation rules of image stitching and enhancing the resolution\nsimultaneously. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning\nframework, a comprehensive real-world image dataset for unsupervised deep image\nstitching is presented and released. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method over other state-of-the-art solutions. Even compared\nwith the supervised solutions, our image stitching quality is still preferred\nby users.",

          "description": "Arbitrary-shaped text detection is a challenging task since curved texts in\nthe wild are of the complex geometric layouts. Existing mainstream methods\nfollow the instance segmentation pipeline to obtain the text regions. However,\narbitraryshaped texts are difficult to be depicted through one single\nsegmentation network because of the varying scales. In this paper, we propose a\ntwo-stage segmentation-based detector, termed as NASK (Need A Second looK), for\narbitrary-shaped text detection. Compared to the traditional single-stage\nsegmentation network, our NASK conducts the detection in a coarse-to-fine\nmanner with the first stage segmentation spotting the rectangle text proposals\nand the second one retrieving compact representations. Specifically, NASK is\ncomposed of a Text Instance Segmentation (TIS) network (1st stage), a\nGeometry-aware Text RoI Alignment (GeoAlign) module, and a Fiducial pOint\neXpression (FOX) module (2nd stage). Firstly, TIS extracts the augmented\nfeatures with a novel Group Spatial and Channel Attention (GSCA) module and\nconducts instance segmentation to obtain rectangle proposals. Then, GeoAlign\nconverts these rectangles into the fixed size and encodes RoI-wise feature\nrepresentation. Finally, FOX disintegrates the text instance into serval\npivotal geometrical attributes to refine the detection results. Extensive\nexperimental results on three public benchmarks including Total-Text,\nSCUTCTW1500, and ICDAR 2015 verify that our NASK outperforms recent\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Compressed Sensing (CS) theory simultaneously realizes the signal sampling\nand compression process, and can use fewer observations to achieve accurate\nsignal recovery, providing a solution for better and faster transmission of\nmassive data. In this paper, a ternary sampling matrix-based method with\nattention mechanism is proposed with the purpose to solve the problem that the\nCS sampling matrices in most cases are random matrices, which are irrelative to\nthe sampled signal and need a large storage space. The proposed method consists\nof three components, i.e., ternary sampling, initial reconstruction and deep\nreconstruction, with the emphasis on the ternary sampling. The main idea of the\nternary method (-1, 0, +1) is to introduce the attention mechanism to evaluate\nthe importance of parameters at the sampling layer after the sampling matrix is\nbinarized (-1, +1), followed by pruning weight of parameters, whose importance\nis below a predefined threshold, to achieve ternarization. Furthermore, a\ncompressed sensing algorithm especially for image reconstruction is\nimplemented, on the basis of the ternary sampling matrix, which is called\nATP-Net, i.e., Attention-based ternary projection network. Experimental results\nshow that the quality of image reconstruction by means of ATP-Net maintains a\nsatisfactory level with the employment of the ternary sampling matrix, i.e.,\nthe average PSNR on Set11 is 30.4 when the sampling rate is 0.25, approximately\n6% improvement compared with that of DR2-Net.",

          "description": "Quite a few people in the world have to stay under permanent surveillance for\nhealth reasons; they include diabetic people or people with some other chronic\nconditions, the elderly and the disabled.These groups may face heightened risk\nof having life-threatening falls or of being struck by a syncope. Due to\nlimited availability of resources a substantial part of people at risk can not\nreceive necessary monitoring and thus are exposed to excessive danger.\nNowadays, this problem is usually solved via applying Human Activity\nRecognition (HAR) methods. HAR is a perspective and fast-paced Data Science\nfield, which has a wide range of application areas such as healthcare, sport,\nsecurity etc. However, the currently techniques of recognition are markedly\nlacking in accuracy, hence, the present paper suggests a highly accurate method\nfor human activity classification. Wepropose a new workflow to address the HAR\nproblem and evaluate it on the UniMiB SHAR dataset, which consists of the\naccelerometer signals. The model we suggest is based on continuous wavelet\ntransform (CWT) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Wavelet transform\nlocalizes signal features both in time and frequency domains and after that a\nCNN extracts these features and recognizes activity. It is also worth noting\nthat CWT converts 1D accelerometer signal into 2D images and thus enables to\nobtain better results as 2D networks have a significantly higher predictive\ncapacity. In the course of the work we build a convolutional neural network and\nvary such model parameters as number of spatial axes, number of layers, number\nof neurons in each layer, image size, type of mother wavelet, the order of zero\nmoment of mother wavelet etc. Besides, we also apply models with residual\nblocks which resulted in significantly higher metric values. Finally, we\nsucceed to reach 99.26 % accuracy and it is a worthy performance for this\nproblem.",

          "description": "Many works in the recent literature introduce semantic mapping methods that\nuse CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to recognize semantic properties in\nimages. The types of properties (eg.: room size, place category, and objects)\nand their classes (eg.: kitchen and bathroom, for place category) are usually\npredefined and restricted to a specific task. Thus, all the visual data\nacquired and processed during the construction of the maps are lost and only\nthe recognized semantic properties remain on the maps. In contrast, this work\nintroduces a topological semantic mapping method that uses deep visual features\nextracted by a CNN, the GoogLeNet, from 2D images captured in multiple views of\nthe environment as the robot operates, to create consolidated representations\nof visual features acquired in the regions covered by each topological node.\nThese consolidated representations allow flexible recognition of semantic\nproperties of the regions and use in a range of visual tasks. The experiments,\nperformed using a real-world indoor dataset, showed that the method is able to\nconsolidate the visual features of regions and use them to recognize objects\nand place categories as semantic properties, and to indicate the topological\nlocation of images, with very promising results. The objects are classified\nusing the classification layer of GoogLeNet, without retraining, and the place\ncategories are recognized using a shallow Multilayer Perceptron.",

          "description": "Transformers have become a standard architecture for many NLP problems. This\nhas motivated theoretically analyzing their capabilities as models of language,\nin order to understand what makes them successful, and what their potential\nweaknesses might be. Recent work has shown that transformers with hard\nattention are quite limited in capacity, and in fact can be simulated by\nconstant-depth circuits. However, hard attention is a restrictive assumption,\nwhich may complicate the relevance of these results for practical transformers.\nIn this work, we analyze the circuit complexity of transformers with saturated\nattention: a generalization of hard attention that more closely captures the\nattention patterns learnable in practical transformers. We show that saturated\ntransformers transcend the limitations of hard-attention transformers. With\nsome minor assumptions, we prove that the number of bits needed to represent a\nsaturated transformer memory vector is $O(\\log n)$, which implies saturated\ntransformers can be simulated by log-depth circuits. Thus, the jump from hard\nto saturated attention can be understood as increasing the transformer's\neffective circuit depth by a factor of $O(\\log n)$.",

          "description": "Policy optimization methods are popular reinforcement learning algorithms,\nbecause their incremental and on-policy nature makes them more stable than the\nvalue-based counterparts. However, the same properties also make them slow to\nconverge and sample inefficient, as the on-policy requirement precludes data\nreuse and the incremental updates couple large iteration complexity into the\nsample complexity. These characteristics have been observed in experiments as\nwell as in theory in the recent work of~\\citet{agarwal2020pc}, which provides a\npolicy optimization method PCPG that can robustly find near optimal polices for\napproximately linear Markov decision processes but suffers from an extremely\npoor sample complexity compared with value-based techniques.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a new algorithm, COPOE, that overcomes the sample\ncomplexity issue of PCPG while retaining its robustness to model\nmisspecification. Compared with PCPG, COPOE makes several important algorithmic\nenhancements, such as enabling data reuse, and uses more refined analysis\ntechniques, which we expect to be more broadly applicable to designing new\nreinforcement learning algorithms. The result is an improvement in sample\ncomplexity from $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^{11})$ for PCPG to\n$\\widetilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^3)$ for PCPG, nearly bridging the gap with\nvalue-based techniques.",

A\n$k$-clustering is said to be explainable if it is given by a decision tree\nwhere each internal node splits data points with a threshold cut in a single\ndimension (feature), and each of the $k$ leaves corresponds to a cluster. We\ngive an algorithm that outputs an explainable clustering that loses at most a\nfactor of $O(\\log^2 k)$ compared to an optimal (not necessarily explainable)\nclustering for the $k$-medians objective, and a factor of $O(k \\log^2 k)$ for\nthe $k$-means objective. This improves over the previous best upper bounds of\n$O(k)$ and $O(k^2)$, respectively, and nearly matches the previous $\\Omega(\\log\nk)$ lower bound for $k$-medians and our new $\\Omega(k)$ lower bound for\n$k$-means. The algorithm is remarkably simple. In particular, given an initial\nnot necessarily explainable clustering in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, it is oblivious to\nthe data points and runs in time $O(dk \\log^2 k)$, independent of the number of\ndata points $n$.

While temporally-extended macro-actions help to cut down the\neffective planning horizon and significantly improve computational efficiency,\nhow do we acquire good macro-actions? This paper proposes Macro-Action\nGenerator-Critic (MAGIC), which performs offline learning of macro-actions\noptimized for online POMDP planning. Specifically, MAGIC learns a macro-action\ngenerator end-to-end, using an online planner's performance as the feedback.\nDuring online planning, the generator generates on the fly situation-aware\nmacro-actions conditioned on the robot's belief and the environment context. We\nevaluated MAGIC on several long-horizon planning tasks both in simulation and\non a real robot. The experimental results show that the learned macro-actions\noffer significant benefits in online planning performance, compared with\nprimitive actions and handcrafted macro-actions.",

          "description": "Current black-box variational inference (BBVI) methods require the user to\nmake numerous design choices -- such as the selection of variational objective\nand approximating family -- yet there is little principled guidance on how to\ndo so. We develop a conceptual framework and set of experimental tools to\nunderstand the effects of these choices, which we leverage to propose best\npractices for maximizing posterior approximation accuracy. Our approach is\nbased on studying the pre-asymptotic tail behavior of the density ratios\nbetween the joint distribution and the variational approximation, then\nexploiting insights and tools from the importance sampling literature. Our\nframework and supporting experiments help to distinguish between the behavior\nof BBVI methods for approximating low-dimensional versus\nmoderate-to-high-dimensional posteriors. In the latter case, we show that\nmass-covering variational objectives are difficult to optimize and do not\nimprove accuracy, but flexible variational families can improve accuracy and\nthe effectiveness of importance sampling -- at the cost of additional\noptimization challenges. Therefore, for moderate-to-high-dimensional posteriors\nwe recommend using the (mode-seeking) exclusive KL divergence since it is the\neasiest to optimize, and improving the variational family or using model\nparameter transformations to make the posterior and optimal variational\napproximation more similar. On the other hand, in low-dimensional settings, we\nshow that heavy-tailed variational families and mass-covering divergences are\neffective and can increase the chances that the approximation can be improved\nby importance sampling.",

          "description": "Scalable training of large models (like BERT and GPT-3) requires careful\noptimization rooted in model design, architecture, and system capabilities.\nFrom a system standpoint, communication has become a major bottleneck,\nespecially on commodity systems with standard TCP interconnects that offer\nlimited network bandwidth. Communication compression is an important technique\nto reduce training time on such systems. One of the most effective methods is\nerror-compensated compression, which offers robust convergence speed even under\n1-bit compression. However, state-of-the-art error compensation techniques only\nwork with basic optimizers like SGD and momentum SGD, which are linearly\ndependent on the gradients. They do not work with non-linear gradient-based\noptimizers like Adam, which offer state-of-the-art convergence efficiency and\naccuracy for models like BERT. In this paper, we propose 1-bit Adam that\nreduces the communication volume by up to $5\\times$, offers much better\nscalability, and provides the same convergence speed as uncompressed Adam. Our\nkey finding is that Adam's variance (non-linear term) becomes stable (after a\nwarmup phase) and can be used as a fixed precondition for the rest of the\ntraining (compression phase). Experiments on up to 256 GPUs show that 1-bit\nAdam enables up to $3.3\\times$ higher throughput for BERT-Large pre-training\nand up to $2.9\\times$ higher throughput for SQuAD fine-tuning.

However, it is\nstill unclear if such methods are truly competitive with respect to\nconventional methods in realistic scenarios and under practical constraints. In\naddition to enabling accurate signal reconstruction on realistic channel\nmodels, MU-MIMO receive algorithms must allow for easy adaptation to a varying\nnumber of users without the need for retraining. In contrast to existing work,\nwe propose an ML-enhanced MU-MIMO receiver that builds on top of a conventional\nlinear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) architecture. It preserves the\ninterpretability and scalability of the LMMSE receiver, while improving its\naccuracy in two ways. First, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to\ncompute an approximation of the second-order statistics of the channel\nestimation error which are required for accurate equalization. Second, a\nCNN-based demapper jointly processes a large number of orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols and subcarriers, which allows it\nto compute better log likelihood ratios (LLRs) by compensating for channel\naging. The resulting architecture can be used in the up- and downlink and is\ntrained in an end-to-end manner, removing the need for hard-to-get perfect\nchannel state information (CSI) during the training phase.

To show\nthe applicability of \\fw{}, we use it to evaluate a model trained to predict\nacute myeloid leukemia therapy response and we also assess its scalability via\nexperiments on synthetic data. The experiments show that we efficiently compute\nexactly the same AUC with both evaluation metrics in a privacy preserving\nmanner as one can obtain on the pooled test samples in the plaintext domain.\nOur solution provides security against semi-honest corruption of at most one of\nthe servers performing the secure computation.",

          "description": "The Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW) is a combinatorial\noptimization problem where the goal is to maximize the total score collected\nfrom different visited locations. The application of neural network models to\ncombinatorial optimization has recently shown promising results in dealing with\nsimilar problems, like the Travelling Salesman Problem. A neural network allows\nlearning solutions using reinforcement learning or supervised learning,\ndepending on the available data. After the learning stage, it can be\ngeneralized and quickly fine-tuned to further improve performance and\npersonalization. The advantages are evident since, for real-world applications,\nsolution quality, personalization, and execution times are all important\nfactors that should be taken into account.\n\nThis study explores the use of Pointer Network models trained using\nreinforcement learning to solve the OPTW problem. We propose a modified\narchitecture that leverages Pointer Networks to better address problems related\nwith dynamic time-dependent constraints. Among its various applications, the\nOPTW can be used to model the Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP). We train the\nPointer Network with the TTDP problem in mind, by sampling variables that can\nchange across tourists visiting a particular instance-region: starting\nposition, starting time, available time, and the scores given to each point of\ninterest. Once a model-region is trained, it can infer a solution for a\nparticular tourist using beam search. We based the assessment of our approach\non several existing benchmark OPTW instances. We show that it generalizes\nacross different tourists that visit each region and that it generally\noutperforms the most commonly used heuristic, while computing the solution in\nrealistic times.",

We show\nthat such networks can be recognized as monotonic and (weakly) scalable\nfunctions within the framework of nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. This fact\nenables us to derive conditions for the existence of a nonempty fixed point set\nof the neural networks, and these conditions are weaker than those obtained\nrecently using arguments in convex analysis, which are typically based on the\nassumption of nonexpansivity of the activation functions. Furthermore, we prove\nthat the shape of the fixed point set of monotonic and weakly scalable neural\nnetworks is often an interval, which degenerates to a point for the case of\nscalable networks.

          "description": "Variational Inference (VI) is a popular alternative to asymptotically exact\nsampling in Bayesian inference. Its main workhorse is optimization over a\nreverse Kullback-Leibler divergence (RKL), which typically underestimates the\ntail of the posterior leading to miscalibration and potential degeneracy.\nImportance sampling (IS), on the other hand, is often used to fine-tune and\nde-bias the estimates of approximate Bayesian inference procedures. The quality\nof IS crucially depends on the choice of the proposal distribution. Ideally,\nthe proposal distribution has heavier tails than the target, which is rarely\nachievable by minimizing the RKL. We thus propose a novel combination of\noptimization and sampling techniques for approximate Bayesian inference by\nconstructing an IS proposal distribution through the minimization of a forward\nKL (FKL) divergence. This approach guarantees asymptotic consistency and a fast\nconvergence towards both the optimal IS estimator and the optimal variational\napproximation.

          "description": "Current radio frequency (RF) sensors at the Edge lack the computational\nresources to support practical, in-situ training for intelligent spectrum\nmonitoring, and sensor data classification in general. We propose a solution\nvia Deep Delay Loop Reservoir Computing (DLR), a processing architecture that\nsupports general machine learning algorithms on compact mobile devices by\nleveraging delay-loop reservoir computing in combination with innovative\nelectrooptical hardware. With both digital and photonic realizations of our\ndesign of the loops, DLR delivers reductions in form factor, hardware\ncomplexity and latency, compared to the State-of-the-Art (SoA). The main impact\nof the reservoir is to project the input data into a higher dimensional space\nof reservoir state vectors in order to linearly separate the input classes.\nOnce the classes are well separated, traditionally complex, power-hungry\nclassification models are no longer needed for the learning process. Yet, even\nwith simple classifiers based on Ridge regression (RR), the complexity grows at\nleast quadratically with the input size. Hence, the hardware reduction required\nfor training on compact devices is in contradiction with the large dimension of\nstate vectors. DLR employs a RR-based classifier to exceed the SoA accuracy,\nwhile further reducing power consumption by leveraging the architecture of\nparallel (split) loops. We present DLR architectures composed of multiple\nsmaller loops whose state vectors are linearly combined to create a lower\ndimensional input into Ridge regression.

          "description": "The Hessian of a neural network captures parameter interactions through\nsecond-order derivatives of the loss. It is a fundamental object of study,\nclosely tied to various problems in deep learning, including model design,\noptimization, and generalization. Most prior work has been empirical, typically\nfocusing on low-rank approximations and heuristics that are blind to the\nnetwork structure. In contrast, we develop theoretical tools to analyze the\nrange of the Hessian map, providing us with a precise understanding of its rank\ndeficiency as well as the structural reasons behind it. This yields exact\nformulas and tight upper bounds for the Hessian rank of deep linear networks,\nallowing for an elegant interpretation in terms of rank deficiency. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that our bounds remain faithful as an estimate of the numerical\nHessian rank, for a larger class of models such as rectified and hyperbolic\ntangent networks. Further, we also investigate the implications of model\narchitecture (e.g.~width, depth, bias) on the rank deficiency. Overall, our\nwork provides novel insights into the source and extent of redundancy in\noverparameterized networks.",

          "description": "In this work, we revisit the theoretical properties of Hamiltonian stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDEs) for Bayesian posterior sampling, and we study the\ntwo types of errors that arise from numerical SDE simulation: the\ndiscretization error and the error due to noisy gradient estimates in the\ncontext of data subsampling. We consider overlooked results describing the\nergodic convergence rates of numerical integration schemes, and we produce a\nnovel analysis for the effect of mini-batches through the lens of differential\noperator splitting. In our analysis, the stochastic component of the proposed\nHamiltonian SDE is decoupled from the gradient noise, for which we make no\nnormality assumptions. This allows us to derive interesting connections among\ndifferent sampling schemes, including the original Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\n(HMC) algorithm, and explain their performance. We show that for a careful\nselection of numerical integrators, both errors vanish at a rate\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\eta^2)$, where $\\eta$ is the integrator step size.

          "description": "Despite a series of recent successes in reinforcement learning (RL), many RL\nalgorithms remain sensitive to hyperparameters. As such, there has recently\nbeen interest in the field of AutoRL, which seeks to automate design decisions\nto create more general algorithms. Recent work suggests that population based\napproaches may be effective AutoRL algorithms, by learning hyperparameter\nschedules on the fly. In particular, the PB2 algorithm is able to achieve\nstrong performance in RL tasks by formulating online hyperparameter\noptimization as time varying GP-bandit problem, while also providing\ntheoretical guarantees. However, PB2 is only designed to work for continuous\nhyperparameters, which severely limits its utility in practice. In this paper\nwe introduce a new (provably) efficient hierarchical approach for optimizing\nboth continuous and categorical variables, using a new time-varying bandit\nalgorithm specifically designed for the population based training regime. We\nevaluate our approach on the challenging Procgen benchmark, where we show that\nexplicitly modelling dependence between data augmentation and other\nhyperparameters improves generalization.",

This\npaper develops a grey-box modelling approach to improve the predictions of the\nforce on structural members. A grey-box model intends to exploit the enhanced\npredictive capabilities of data-based modelling whilst retaining physical\ninsight into the behaviour of the system; in the context of the work carried\nout here, this can be considered as physics-informed machine learning. There\nare a number of possible approaches to establish a grey-box model. This paper\ndemonstrates two means of combining physics (white box) and data-based (black\nbox) components; one where the model is a simple summation of the two\ncomponents, the second where the white-box prediction is fed into the black box\nas an additional input. Here Morison's equation is used as the physics-based\ncomponent in combination with a data-based Gaussian process NARX - a dynamic\nvariant of the more well-known Gaussian process regression. Two key challenges\nwith employing the GP-NARX formulation that are addressed here are the\nselection of appropriate lag terms and the proper treatment of uncertainty\npropagation within the dynamic GP. The best performing grey-box model, the\nresidual modelling GP-NARX, was able to achieve a 29.13\\% and 5.48\\% relative\nreduction in NMSE over Morison's Equation and a black-box GP-NARX respectively,\nalongside significant benefits in extrapolative capabilities of the model, in\ncircumstances of low dataset coverage.",

Even with large-scale real-world data collection, robust\nperception and manipulation of transparent and reflective objects across\nvarious lighting conditions remain challenging. To address these challenges we\npropose an approach to performing sim-to-real transfer of robotic perception.\nThe underlying model, SimNet, is trained as a single multi-headed neural\nnetwork using simulated stereo data as input and simulated object segmentation\nmasks, 3D oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), object keypoints, and disparity as\noutput. A key component of SimNet is the incorporation of a learned stereo\nsub-network that predicts disparity. SimNet is evaluated on 2D car detection,\nunknown object detection, and deformable object keypoint detection and\nsignificantly outperforms a baseline that uses a structured light RGB-D sensor.\nBy inferring grasp positions using the OBB and keypoint predictions, SimNet can\nbe used to perform end-to-end manipulation of unknown objects in both easy and\nhard scenarios using our fleet of Toyota HSR robots in four home environments.\nIn unknown object grasping experiments, the predictions from the baseline RGB-D\nnetwork and SimNet enable successful grasps of most of the easy objects.\nHowever, the RGB-D baseline only grasps 35% of the hard (e.g., transparent)\nobjects, while SimNet grasps 95%, suggesting that SimNet can enable robust\nmanipulation of unknown objects, including transparent objects, in unknown\nenvironments.",

          "description": "Machine Learning (ML) has recently been demonstrated to rival expert-level\nhuman accuracy in prediction and detection tasks in a variety of domains,\nincluding medicine. Despite these impressive findings, however, a key barrier\nto the full realization of ML's potential in medical prognoses is technology\nacceptance. Recent efforts to produce explainable AI (XAI) have made progress\nin improving the interpretability of some ML models, but these efforts suffer\nfrom limitations intrinsic to their design: they work best at identifying why a\nsystem fails, but do poorly at explaining when and why a model's prediction is\ncorrect. We posit that the acceptability of ML predictions in expert domains is\nlimited by two key factors: the machine's horizon of prediction that extends\nbeyond human capability, and the inability for machine predictions to\nincorporate human intuition into their models. We propose the use of a novel ML\narchitecture, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to enhance human\nunderstanding and encourage acceptability. Our approach prioritizes human\ncognitive intuition at the center of the algorithm design, and offers a\ndistribution of predictions rather than single outputs. We explain how this\napproach may significantly improve human-machine collaboration in prediction\ntasks in expert domains such as medical prognoses. We propose a model and\ndemonstrate, by expanding a concrete example from the literature, how our model\nadvances the vision of future hybrid Human-AI systems.",

This trend leads to great concerns, including but not\nlimited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the\nexclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this\npaper, we dispel the myth that transformers are \"data hungry\" and therefore can\nonly be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the\nright size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with\nstate-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets. Our model eliminates the requirement\nfor class token and positional embeddings through a novel sequence pooling\nstrategy and the use of convolutions. We show that compared to CNNs, our\ncompact transformers have fewer parameters and MACs, while obtaining similar\naccuracies. Our method is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as\nlittle as 0.28M parameters and achieve reasonable results. It can reach an\naccuracy of 95.29 % when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is comparable\nwith modern CNN based approaches, and a significant improvement over previous\nTransformer based models. Our simple and compact design democratizes\ntransformers by making them accessible to those equipped with basic computing\nresources and/or dealing with important small datasets. Our method works on\nlarger datasets, such as ImageNet (80.28% accuracy with 29% parameters of ViT),\nand NLP tasks as well.

          "description": "Transferability estimation is an essential problem in transfer learning to\npredict how good the performance is when transferring a source model (or source\ntask) to a target task. Recent analytical transferability metrics have been\nwidely used for source model selection and multi-task learning. A major\nchallenge is how to make transfereability estimation robust under the\ncross-domain cross-task settings. The recently proposed OTCE score solves this\nproblem by considering both domain and task differences, with the help of\ntransfer experiences on auxiliary tasks, which causes an efficiency overhead.\nIn this work, we propose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score\nthat dramatically improves the robustness of the task difference estimation in\nOTCE, thus removing the need for auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we build the\njoint correspondences between source and target data via solving an optimal\ntransport problem with a ground cost considering both the sample distance and\nlabel distance, and then compute the transferability score as the negative\nconditional entropy of the matched labels. Extensive validations under the\nintra-dataset and inter-dataset transfer settings demonstrate that our JC-NCE\nscore outperforms the auxiliary-task free version of OTCE for 7% and 12%,\nrespectively, and is also more robust than other existing transferability\nmetrics on average.",

Although some methods recently have been proposed to solve\nthe bilevel problems, these methods do not consider using adaptive learning\nrates. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a class of fast and effective\nadaptive methods for solving bilevel optimization problems that the outer\nproblem is possibly nonconvex and the inner problem is strongly-convex.\nSpecifically, we propose a fast single-loop BiAdam algorithm based on the basic\nmomentum technique, which achieves a sample complexity of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ for finding an $\\epsilon$-stationary point. At the\nsame time, we propose an accelerated version of BiAdam algorithm (VR-BiAdam) by\nusing variance reduced technique, which reaches the best known sample\ncomplexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$. To further reduce computation in\nestimating derivatives, we propose a fast single-loop stochastic approximated\nBiAdam algorithm (saBiAdam) by avoiding the Hessian inverse, which still\nachieves a sample complexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ without large\nbatches. We further present an accelerated version of saBiAdam algorithm\n(VR-saBiAdam), which also reaches the best known sample complexity of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$. We apply the unified adaptive matrices to our\nmethods as the SUPER-ADAM \\citep{huang2021super}, which including many types of\nadaptive learning rates. Moreover, our framework can flexibly use the momentum\nand variance reduced techniques. In particular, we provide a useful convergence\nanalysis framework for both the constrained and unconstrained bilevel\noptimization.

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require a relatively large number of labeled\nnodes and a reliable/uncorrupted graph connectivity structure in order to\nobtain good performance on the semi-supervised node classification task. The\nperformance of GNNs can degrade significantly as the number of labeled nodes\ndecreases or the graph connectivity structure is corrupted by adversarial\nattacks or due to noises in data measurement /collection. Therefore, it is\nimportant to develop GNN models that are able to achieve good performance when\nthere is limited supervision knowledge -- a few labeled nodes and noisy graph\nstructures. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual GNN learning framework to\naddress this challenge task. The proposed framework has two GNN based node\nprediction modules. The primary module uses the input graph structure to induce\nregular node embeddings and predictions with a regular GNN baseline, while the\nauxiliary module constructs a new graph structure through fine-grained spectral\nclusterings and learns new node embeddings and predictions. By integrating the\ntwo modules in a dual GNN learning framework, we perform joint learning in an\nend-to-end fashion. This general framework can be applied on many GNN baseline\nmodels. The experimental results validate that the proposed dual GNN framework\ncan greatly outperform the GNN baseline methods when the labeled nodes are\nscarce and the graph connectivity structure is noisy.",

          "description": "This paper proposes a novel framework for lung sound event detection,\nsegmenting continuous lung sound recordings into discrete events and performing\nrecognition on each event. Exploiting the lightweight nature of Temporal\nConvolution Networks (TCNs) and their superior results compared to their\nrecurrent counterparts, we propose a lightweight, yet robust, and completely\ninterpretable framework for lung sound event detection. We propose the use of a\nmulti-branch TCN architecture and exploit a novel fusion strategy to combine\nthe resultant features from these branches. This not only allows the network to\nretain the most salient information across different temporal granularities and\ndisregards irrelevant information, but also allows our network to process\nrecordings of arbitrary length. Results: The proposed method is evaluated on\nmultiple public and in-house benchmarks of irregular and noisy recordings of\nthe respiratory auscultation process for the identification of numerous\nauscultation events including inhalation, exhalation, crackles, wheeze,\nstridor, and rhonchi. We exceed the state-of-the-art results in all\nevaluations. Furthermore, we empirically analyse the effect of the proposed\nmulti-branch TCN architecture and the feature fusion strategy and provide\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations to illustrate their efficiency.\nMoreover, we provide an end-to-end model interpretation pipeline that\ninterprets the operations of all the components of the proposed framework. Our\nanalysis of different feature fusion strategies shows that the proposed feature\nconcatenation method leads to better suppression of non-informative features,\nwhich drastically reduces the classifier overhead resulting in a robust\nlightweight network.The lightweight nature of our model allows it to be\ndeployed in end-user devices such as smartphones, and it has the ability to\ngenerate predictions in real-time.",

          "description": "Multi-goal reinforcement learning is widely applied in planning and robot\nmanipulation. Two main challenges in multi-goal reinforcement learning are\nsparse rewards and sample inefficiency. Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) aims\nto tackle the two challenges via goal relabeling. However, HER-related works\nstill need millions of samples and a huge computation. In this paper, we\npropose Multi-step Hindsight Experience Replay (MHER), incorporating multi-step\nrelabeled returns based on $n$-step relabeling to improve sample efficiency.\nDespite the advantages of $n$-step relabeling, we theoretically and\nexperimentally prove the off-policy $n$-step bias introduced by $n$-step\nrelabeling may lead to poor performance in many environments. To address the\nabove issue, two bias-reduced MHER algorithms, MHER($\\lambda$) and Model-based\nMHER (MMHER) are presented. MHER($\\lambda$) exploits the $\\lambda$ return while\nMMHER benefits from model-based value expansions. Experimental results on\nnumerous multi-goal robotic tasks show that our solutions can successfully\nalleviate off-policy $n$-step bias and achieve significantly higher sample\nefficiency than HER and Curriculum-guided HER with little additional\ncomputation beyond HER.",

          "description": "Episodic reinforcement learning and contextual bandits are two widely studied\nsequential decision-making problems. Episodic reinforcement learning\ngeneralizes contextual bandits and is often perceived to be more difficult due\nto long planning horizon and unknown state-dependent transitions.

We propose a new algorithm, \\textbf{M}onotonic \\textbf{V}alue\n\\textbf{P}ropagation (MVP), which relies on a new Bernstein-type bonus.\nCompared to existing bonus constructions, the new bonus is tighter since it is\nbased on a well-designed monotonic value function.

The first stage includes a homeomorphic\nsparse coordinate transformation to learn low-dimensional representations\nwithout destroying topology and a local isometry constraint to preserve local\ngeometry. In the second stage, a linear compression is implemented for the\ntrade-off between the target dimension and the incurred information loss in\nexcessive DR scenarios. Experiments are conducted on seven datasets with a\nneural network implementation of inv-ML, called i-ML-Enc. Empirically, i-ML-Enc\nachieves invertible DR in comparison with typical existing methods as well as\nreveals the characteristics of the learned manifolds.

          "description": "In the online continual learning paradigm, agents must learn from a changing\ndistribution while respecting memory and compute constraints. Previous work in\nthis setting often tries to reduce catastrophic forgetting by limiting changes\nin the space of model parameters. In this work we instead focus on the change\nin representations of observed data that arises when previously unobserved\nclasses appear in the incoming data stream, and new classes must be\ndistinguished from previous ones. Starting from a popular approach, experience\nreplay, we consider metric learning based loss functions which, when adjusted\nto appropriately select negative samples, can effectively nudge the learned\nrepresentations to be more robust to new future classes. We show that this\nselection of negatives is in fact critical for reducing representation drift of\npreviously observed data. Motivated by this we further introduce a simple\nadjustment to the standard cross entropy loss used in prior experience replay\nthat achieves similar effect. Our approach directly improves the performance of\nexperience replay for this setting, obtaining state-of-the-art results on\nseveral existing benchmarks in online continual learning, while remaining\nefficient in both memory and compute.

          "description": "For deep linear networks (DLN), various hyperparameters alter the dynamics of\ntraining dramatically. We investigate how the rank of the linear map found by\ngradient descent is affected by (1) the initialization norm and (2) the\naddition of $L_{2}$ regularization on the parameters. For (1), we study two\nregimes: (1a) the linear/lazy regime, for large norm initialization; (1b) a\n\\textquotedbl saddle-to-saddle\\textquotedbl{} regime for small initialization\nnorm. In the (1a) setting, the dynamics of a DLN of any depth is similar to\nthat of a standard linear model, without any low-rank bias. In the (1b)\nsetting, we conjecture that throughout training, gradient descent approaches a\nsequence of saddles, each corresponding to linear maps of increasing rank,\nuntil reaching a minimal rank global minimum. We support this conjecture with a\npartial proof and some numerical experiments. For (2), we show that adding a\n$L_{2}$ regularization on the parameters corresponds to the addition to the\ncost of a $L_{p}$-Schatten (quasi)norm on the linear map with $p=\\frac{2}{L}$\n(for a depth-$L$ network), leading to a stronger low-rank bias as $L$ grows.\nThe effect of $L_{2}$ regularization on the loss surface depends on the depth:\nfor shallow networks, all critical points are either strict saddles or global\nminima, whereas for deep networks, some local minima appear. We numerically\nobserve that these local minima can generalize better than global ones in some\nsettings.",

We evaluate the proposed algorithm on H\\&E slides of 60\nhematolymphoid neoplasm patients and further compared it with three cell level\ngraph-based algorithms, including the global cell graph, cluster cell graph,\nand FLocK. The proposed algorithm achieves a mean diagnosis accuracy of 0.703\nwith the repeated 5-fold cross-validation scheme. In conclusion, our algorithm\nshows superior performance over the existing methods and can be potentially\napplied to other cancer types.",

          "description": "Transformer models have achieved great progress on computer vision tasks\nrecently. The rapid development of vision transformers is mainly contributed by\ntheir high representation ability for extracting informative features from\ninput images. However, the mainstream transformer models are designed with deep\narchitectures, and the feature diversity will be continuously reduced as the\ndepth increases, i.e., feature collapse. In this paper, we theoretically\nanalyze the feature collapse phenomenon and study the relationship between\nshortcuts and feature diversity in these transformer models. Then, we present\nan augmented shortcut scheme, which inserts additional paths with learnable\nparameters in parallel on the original shortcuts. To save the computational\ncosts, we further explore an efficient approach that uses the block-circulant\nprojection to implement augmented shortcuts. Extensive experiments conducted on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which\nbrings about 1% accuracy increase of the state-of-the-art visual transformers\nwithout obviously increasing their parameters and FLOPs.",

          "description": "Federated learning enables machine learning algorithms to be trained over a\nnetwork of multiple decentralized edge devices without requiring the exchange\nof local datasets. Successfully deploying federated learning requires ensuring\nthat agents (e.g., mobile devices) faithfully execute the intended algorithm,\nwhich has been largely overlooked in the literature. In this study, we first\nuse risk bounds to analyze how the key feature of federated learning,\nunbalanced and non-i.i.d. data, affects agents' incentives to voluntarily\nparticipate and obediently follow traditional federated learning algorithms.\n\nTo be more specific, our analysis reveals that agents with less typical data\ndistributions and relatively more samples are more likely to opt out of or\ntamper with federated learning algorithms. To this end, we formulate the first\nfaithful implementation problem of federated learning and design two faithful\nfederated learning mechanisms which satisfy economic properties, scalability,\nand privacy. Further, the time complexity of computing all agents' payments in\nthe number of agents is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. First, we design a Faithful Federated\nLearning (FFL) mechanism which approximates the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)\npayments via an incremental computation. We show that it achieves (probably\napproximate) optimality, faithful implementation, voluntary participation, and\nsome other economic properties (such as budget balance). Second, by\npartitioning agents into several subsets, we present a scalable VCG mechanism\napproximation. We further design a scalable and Differentially Private FFL\n(DP-FFL) mechanism, the first differentially private faithful mechanism, that\nmaintains the economic properties. Our mechanism enables one to make three-way\nperformance tradeoffs among privacy, the iterations needed, and payment\naccuracy loss.",

This is motivated\nby the observation that deep generative models, in addition to a likelihood\nmodel $p(x|z)$, often also use an inference model $q(z|x)$ for data\nrepresentation, but they rely on a usually uninformative prior distribution\n$p(z)$ to define a joint distribution, which may render problems like posterior\ncollapse and manifold mismatch. To explore the possibility to model a joint\ndistribution using only $p(x|z)$ and $q(z|x)$, we study their compatibility and\ndeterminacy, corresponding to the existence and uniqueness of a joint\ndistribution whose conditional distributions coincide with them. We develop a\ngeneral theory for novel and operable equivalence criteria for compatibility,\nand sufficient conditions for determinacy. Based on the theory, we propose the\nCyGen framework for cyclic-conditional generative modeling, including methods\nto enforce compatibility and use the determined distribution to fit and\ngenerate data. With the prior constraint removed, CyGen better fits data and\ncaptures more representative features, supported by experiments showing better\ngeneration and downstream classification performance.",

          "description": "Graph signal processing is a ubiquitous task in many applications such as\nsensor, social, transportation and brain networks, point cloud processing, and\ngraph neural networks. Graph signals are often corrupted through sensing\nprocesses, and need to be restored for the above applications. In this paper,\nwe propose two graph signal restoration methods based on deep algorithm\nunrolling (DAU). First, we present a graph signal denoiser by unrolling\niterations of the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). We then\npropose a general restoration method for linear degradation by unrolling\niterations of Plug-and-Play ADMM (PnP-ADMM). In the second method, the unrolled\nADMM-based denoiser is incorporated as a submodule. Therefore, our restoration\nmethod has a nested DAU structure. Thanks to DAU, parameters in the proposed\ndenoising/restoration methods are trainable in an end-to-end manner. Since the\nproposed restoration methods are based on iterations of a (convex) optimization\nalgorithm, the method is interpretable and keeps the number of parameters small\nbecause we only need to tune graph-independent regularization parameters. We\nsolve two main problems in existing graph signal restoration methods: 1)\nlimited performance of convex optimization algorithms due to fixed parameters\nwhich are often determined manually. 2) large number of parameters of graph\nneural networks that result in difficulty of training. Several experiments for\ngraph signal denoising and interpolation are performed on synthetic and\nreal-world data. The proposed methods show performance improvements to several\nexisting methods in terms of root mean squared error in both tasks.",

          "description": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is critical for safely deploying\ndeep learning models in an open-world setting. However, existing OOD detection\nsolutions can be brittle in the open world, facing various types of adversarial\nOOD inputs. While methods leveraging auxiliary OOD data have emerged, our\nanalysis on illuminative examples reveals a key insight that the majority of\nauxiliary OOD examples may not meaningfully improve or even hurt the decision\nboundary of the OOD detector, which is also observed in empirical results on\nreal data. In this paper, we provide a theoretically motivated method,\nAdversarial Training with informative Outlier Mining (ATOM), which improves the\nrobustness of OOD detection. We show that, by mining informative auxiliary OOD\ndata, one can significantly improve OOD detection performance, and somewhat\nsurprisingly, generalize to unseen adversarial attacks. ATOM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance under a broad family of classic and adversarial\nOOD evaluation tasks. For example, on the CIFAR-10 in-distribution dataset,\nATOM reduces the FPR (at TPR 95%) by up to 57.99% under adversarial OOD inputs,\nsurpassing the previous best baseline by a large margin.",

          "description": "Recent works demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models are\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks which can decrease the victim's total reward\nby manipulating the observations. Compared with adversarial attacks in\nsupervised learning, it is much more challenging to deceive a DRL model since\nthe adversary has to infer the environmental dynamics. To address this issue,\nwe reformulate the problem of adversarial attacks in function space and\nseparate the previous gradient based attacks into several subspace. Following\nthe analysis of the function space, we design a generic two-stage framework in\nthe subspace where the adversary lures the agent to a target trajectory or a\ndeceptive policy. In the first stage, we train a deceptive policy by hacking\nthe environment, and discover a set of trajectories routing to the lowest\nreward. The adversary then misleads the victim to imitate the deceptive policy\nby perturbing the observations. Our method provides a tighter theoretical upper\nbound for the attacked agent's performance than the existing approaches.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method and we achieve\nthe state-of-the-art performance on both Atari and MuJoCo environments.",

Given semantic annotations such as class labels\nand pairwise similarities of the training data, hashing methods can learn and\ngenerate effective and compact binary codes.

However, existing zeor-shot hashing\nmethods focus on the retrieval of single-label images, and cannot handle\nmulti-label images. In this paper, for the first time, a novel transductive\nzero-shot hashing method is proposed for multi-label unseen image retrieval. In\norder to predict the labels of the unseen/target data, a visual-semantic bridge\nis built via instance-concept coherence ranking on the seen/source data.

Policies learned through\nself-play may adopt arbitrary conventions and implicitly rely on multi-step\nreasoning based on fragile assumptions about other agents' actions and thus\nfail when paired with humans or independently trained agents at test time. To\naddress this, we present off-belief learning (OBL). At each timestep OBL agents\nfollow a policy $\\pi_1$ that is optimized assuming past actions were taken by a\ngiven, fixed policy ($\\pi_0$), but assuming that future actions will be taken\nby $\\pi_1$. When $\\pi_0$ is uniform random, OBL converges to an optimal policy\nthat does not rely on inferences based on other agents' behavior (an optimal\ngrounded policy). OBL can be iterated in a hierarchy, where the optimal policy\nfrom one level becomes the input to the next, thereby introducing multi-level\ncognitive reasoning in a controlled manner. Unlike existing approaches, which\nmay converge to any equilibrium policy, OBL converges to a unique policy,\nmaking it suitable for zero-shot coordination (ZSC).

Nevertheless, its\nperformance on few-shot classification is far behind many recent algorithms\ndedicated to the problem. In this paper, we point out several key facets of how\nto train MAML to excel in few-shot classification. First, we find that a large\nnumber of gradient steps are needed for the inner loop update, which\ncontradicts the common usage of MAML for few-shot classification. Second, we\nfind that MAML is sensitive to the permutation of class assignments in\nmeta-testing: for a few-shot task of $N$ classes, there are exponentially many\nways to assign the learned initialization of the $N$-way classifier to the $N$\nclasses, leading to an unavoidably huge variance. Third, we investigate several\nways for permutation invariance and find that learning a shared classifier\ninitialization for all the classes performs the best. On benchmark datasets\nsuch as MiniImageNet and TieredImageNet, our approach, which we name\nUNICORN-MAML, performs on a par with or even outperforms state-of-the-art\nalgorithms, while keeping the simplicity of MAML without adding any extra\nsub-networks.",

Unfortunately, loss landscapes are\nnotoriously difficult to visualize in a human-comprehensible fashion. One\ncommon way to address this problem is to plot linear slices of the landscape,\nfor example from the initial state of the network to the final state after\noptimization. On the basis of this analysis, prior work has drawn broader\nconclusions about the difficulty of the optimization problem. In this paper, we\nput inferences of this kind to the test, systematically evaluating how linear\ninterpolation and final performance vary when altering the data, choice of\ninitialization, and other optimizer and architecture design choices. Further,\nwe use linear interpolation to study the role played by individual layers and\nsubstructures of the network. We find that certain layers are more sensitive to\nthe choice of initialization and optimizer hyperparameter settings, and we\nexploit these observations to design custom optimization schemes.

To find these in-distribution errors, we introduce an\nevolution strategies (ES) based approach, which we call CMA-Search. Despite\ntraining with a large-scale (0.5 million images), unbiased dataset of camera\nand light variations, in over 71% cases CMA-Search can find camera parameters\nin the vicinity of a correctly classified image which lead to in-distribution\nmisclassifications with < 3.6% change in parameters.

However, amongst online\npractical scenarios where the features are evolving (e.g., some features are\nvanished and some new features are augmented), most metric learning models\ncannot be successfully applied to these scenarios, although they can tackle the\nevolving instances efficiently. To address the challenge, we develop a new\nonline Evolving Metric Learning (EML) model for incremental and decremental\nfeatures, which can handle the instance and feature evolutions simultaneously\nby incorporating with a smoothed Wasserstein metric distance. Specifically, our\nmodel contains two essential stages: a Transforming stage (T-stage) and a\nInheriting stage (I-stage). For the T-stage, we propose to extract important\ninformation from vanished features while neglecting non-informative knowledge,\nand forward it into survived features by transforming them into a low-rank\ndiscriminative metric space. It further explores the intrinsic low-rank\nstructure of heterogeneous samples to reduce the computation and memory burden\nespecially for highly-dimensional large-scale data. For the I-stage, we inherit\nthe metric performance of survived features from the T-stage and then expand to\ninclude the new augmented features. Moreover, a smoothed Wasserstein distance\nis utilized to characterize the similarity relationships among the\nheterogeneous and complex samples, since the evolving features are not strictly\naligned in the different stages. In addition to tackling the challenges in\none-shot case, we also extend our model into multishot scenario.

Based on non-asymptotic estimates of the metric entropy of\nellipsoids -- that prove to generalize to infinite dimensions -- and on a\nchaining argument, our uniform concentration bounds involve an effective\ndimension instead of the global dimension, improving over existing results. We\nshow the importance of taking advantage of non-isotropic properties in learning\nproblems with the following applications: i) we improve state-of-the-art\nresults in statistical preconditioning for communication-efficient distributed\noptimization, ii) we introduce a non-isotropic randomized smoothing for\nnon-smooth optimization.

          "description": "Graphs are a common model for complex relational data such as social networks\nand protein interactions, and such data can evolve over time (e.g., new\nfriendships) and be noisy (e.g., unmeasured interactions). Link prediction aims\nto predict future edges or infer missing edges in the graph, and has diverse\napplications in recommender systems, experimental design, and complex systems.\nEven though link prediction algorithms strongly depend on the set of edges in\nthe graph, existing approaches typically do not modify the graph topology to\nimprove performance. Here, we demonstrate how simply adding a set of edges,\nwhich we call a \\emph{proposal set}, to the graph as a pre-processing step can\nimprove the performance of several link prediction algorithms. The underlying\nidea is that if the edges in the proposal set generally align with the\nstructure of the graph, link prediction algorithms are further guided towards\npredicting the right edges; in other words, adding a proposal set of edges is a\nsignal-boosting pre-processing step. We show how to use existing link\nprediction algorithms to generate effective proposal sets and evaluate this\napproach on various synthetic and empirical datasets. We find that proposal\nsets meaningfully improve the accuracy of link prediction algorithms based on\nboth neighborhood heuristics and graph neural networks.

In this work, we present a universal learning framework\nfor extracting predictive models from nonlinear systems based on observations.\nOur framework can readily incorporate first principle knowledge because it\nnaturally models nonlinear systems as continuous-time systems.

We show that sparse linear networks can have spurious strict\nminima, which is in sharp contrast to dense linear networks which do not even\nhave spurious minima.

Many\nmodels are proposed in the literature, and compared through different metrics\nmeasured on various datasets. The most popular metrics used to compare\nperformances are F1-score, AUC and AVPR. In this paper, we show that F1-score\nand AVPR are highly sensitive to the contamination rate. One consequence is\nthat it is possible to artificially increase their values by modifying the\ntrain-test split procedure. This leads to misleading comparisons between\nalgorithms in the literature, especially when the evaluation protocol is not\nwell detailed. Moreover, we show that the F1-score and the AVPR cannot be used\nto compare performances on different datasets as they do not reflect the\nintrinsic difficulty of modeling such data. Based on these observations, we\nclaim that F1-score and AVPR should not be used as metrics for anomaly\ndetection. We recommend a generic evaluation procedure for unsupervised anomaly\ndetection, including the use of other metrics such as the AUC, which are more\nrobust to arbitrary choices in the evaluation protocol.",

The basic idea is\nto change the autoencoder from an unsupervised learning method into a\nclassifier. The CAE is a modified autoencoder, where the encoder is used to\ncompress samples with different labels into disjoint compression spaces and the\ndecoder is used to recover a sample with a given label from the corresponding\ncompression space. The encoder is used as a classifier and the decoder is used\nto decide whether the classification given by the encoder is correct by\ncomparing the input sample with the output. Since adversary samples are seeming\ninevitable for the current DNN framework, we introduce the list classification\nbased on CAE to defend adversaries, which outputs several labels and the\ncorresponding samples recovered by the CAE. The CAE is evaluated using the\nMNIST dataset in great detail.

To\ncounteract this exploit, often adversarial training is used.

In this work we\naddress the computationally particularly demanding task of semantic\nsegmentation and propose a new step size control algorithm that increases the\nrobustness of single-step adversarial training. The proposed algorithm does not\nincrease the computational effort of single-step adversarial training\nconsiderably and also simplifies training, because it is free of\nmeta-parameter.

          "description": "Motivated by graph theory, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are\ntraditionally structured as layers of neurons (nodes), which learn useful\ninformation by the passage of data through interconnections (edges). In the\nmachine learning realm, graph structures (i.e., neurons and connections) of\nANNs have recently been explored using various graph-theoretic measures linked\nto their predictive performance. On the other hand, in network science\n(NetSci), certain graph measures including entropy and curvature are known to\nprovide insight into the robustness and fragility of real-world networks. In\nthis work, we use these graph measures to explore the robustness of various\nANNs to adversarial attacks. To this end, we (1) explore the design space of\ninter-layer and intra-layers connectivity regimes of ANNs in the graph domain\nand record their predictive performance after training under different types of\nadversarial attacks, (2) use graph representations for both inter-layer and\nintra-layers connectivity regimes to calculate various graph-theoretic\nmeasures, including curvature and entropy, and (3) analyze the relationship\nbetween these graph measures and the adversarial performance of ANNs. We show\nthat curvature and entropy, while operating in the graph domain, can quantify\nthe robustness of ANNs without having to train these ANNs. Our results suggest\nthat the real-world networks, including brain networks, financial networks, and\nsocial networks may provide important clues to the neural architecture search\nfor robust ANNs. We propose a search strategy that efficiently finds robust\nANNs amongst a set of well-performing ANNs without having a need to train all\nof these ANNs.",

          "description": "Instances-reweighted adversarial training (IRAT) can significantly boost the\nrobustness of trained models, where data being less/more vulnerable to the\ngiven attack are assigned smaller/larger weights during training. However, when\ntested on attacks different from the given attack simulated in training, the\nrobustness may drop significantly (e.g., even worse than no reweighting). In\nthis paper, we study this problem and propose our solution--locally reweighted\nadversarial training (LRAT). The rationale behind IRAT is that we do not need\nto pay much attention to an instance that is already safe under the attack. We\nargue that the safeness should be attack-dependent, so that for the same\ninstance, its weight can change given different attacks based on the same\nmodel. Thus, if the attack simulated in training is mis-specified, the weights\nof IRAT are misleading. To this end, LRAT pairs each instance with its\nadversarial variants and performs local reweighting inside each pair, while\nperforming no global reweighting--the rationale is to fit the instance itself\nif it is immune to the attack, but not to skip the pair, in order to passively\ndefend different attacks in future. Experiments show that LRAT works better\nthan both IRAT (i.e., global reweighting) and the standard AT (i.e., no\nreweighting) when trained with an attack and tested on different attacks.",

          "description": "The memorization effect of deep neural network (DNN) plays a pivotal role in\nmany state-of-the-art label-noise learning methods. To exploit this property,\nthe early stopping trick, which stops the optimization at the early stage of\ntraining, is usually adopted. Current methods generally decide the early\nstopping point by considering a DNN as a whole. However, a DNN can be\nconsidered as a composition of a series of layers, and we find that the latter\nlayers in a DNN are much more sensitive to label noise, while their former\ncounterparts are quite robust. Therefore, selecting a stopping point for the\nwhole network may make different DNN layers antagonistically affected each\nother, thus degrading the final performance. In this paper, we propose to\nseparate a DNN into different parts and progressively train them to address\nthis problem. Instead of the early stopping, which trains a whole DNN all at\nonce, we initially train former DNN layers by optimizing the DNN with a\nrelatively large number of epochs. During training, we progressively train the\nlatter DNN layers by using a smaller number of epochs with the preceding layers\nfixed to counteract the impact of noisy labels. We term the proposed method as\nprogressive early stopping (PES). Despite its simplicity, compared with the\nearly stopping, PES can help to obtain more promising and stable results.\nFurthermore, by combining PES with existing approaches on noisy label training,\nwe achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification benchmarks.",

          "description": "To reduce annotation labor associated with object detection, an increasing\nnumber of studies focus on transferring the learned knowledge from a labeled\nsource domain to another unlabeled target domain. However, existing methods\nassume that the labeled data are sampled from a single source domain, which\nignores a more generalized scenario, where labeled data are from multiple\nsource domains. For the more challenging task, we propose a unified Faster\nR-CNN based framework, termed Divide-and-Merge Spindle Network (DMSN), which\ncan simultaneously enhance domain invariance and preserve discriminative power.\nSpecifically, the framework contains multiple source subnets and a pseudo\ntarget subnet. First, we propose a hierarchical feature alignment strategy to\nconduct strong and weak alignments for low- and high-level features,\nrespectively, considering their different effects for object detection. Second,\nwe develop a novel pseudo subnet learning algorithm to approximate optimal\nparameters of pseudo target subset by weighted combination of parameters in\ndifferent source subnets. Finally, a consistency regularization for region\nproposal network is proposed to facilitate each subnet to learn more abstract\ninvariances. Extensive experiments on different adaptation scenarios\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

          "description": "Graph neural networks have recently achieved remarkable success in\nrepresenting graph-structured data, with rapid progress in both the node\nembedding and graph pooling methods. Yet, they mostly focus on capturing\ninformation from the nodes considering their connectivity, and not much work\nhas been done in representing the edges, which are essential components of a\ngraph. However, for tasks such as graph reconstruction and generation, as well\nas graph classification tasks for which the edges are important for\ndiscrimination, accurately representing edges of a given graph is crucial to\nthe success of the graph representation learning. To this end, we propose a\nnovel edge representation learning framework based on Dual Hypergraph\nTransformation (DHT), which transforms the edges of a graph into the nodes of a\nhypergraph. This dual hypergraph construction allows us to apply message\npassing techniques for node representations to edges. After obtaining edge\nrepresentations from the hypergraphs, we then cluster or drop edges to obtain\nholistic graph-level edge representations. We validate our edge representation\nlearning method with hypergraphs on diverse graph datasets for graph\nrepresentation and generation performance, on which our method largely\noutperforms existing graph representation learning methods. Moreover, our edge\nrepresentation learning and pooling method also largely outperforms\nstate-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification, not only\nbecause of its accurate edge representation learning, but also due to its\nlossless compression of the nodes and removal of irrelevant edges for effective\nmessage passing.",

          "description": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many graph-based\ntasks. Much work is dedicated to empowering GNNs with the adaptive locality\nability, which enables measuring the importance of neighboring nodes to the\ntarget node by a node-specific mechanism. However, the current node-specific\nmechanisms are deficient in distinguishing the importance of nodes in the\ntopology structure. We believe that the structural importance of neighboring\nnodes is closely related to their importance in aggregation. In this paper, we\nintroduce discrete graph curvature (the Ricci curvature) to quantify the\nstrength of structural connection of pairwise nodes. And we propose Curvature\nGraph Neural Network (CGNN), which effectively improves the adaptive locality\nability of GNNs by leveraging the structural property of graph curvature. To\nimprove the adaptability of curvature to various datasets, we explicitly\ntransform curvature into the weights of neighboring nodes by the necessary\nNegative Curvature Processing Module and Curvature Normalization Module. Then,\nwe conduct numerous experiments on various synthetic datasets and real-world\ndatasets. The experimental results on synthetic datasets show that CGNN\neffectively exploits the topology structure information, and the performance is\nimproved significantly. CGNN outperforms the baselines on 5 dense node\nclassification benchmark datasets. This study deepens the understanding of how\nto utilize advanced topology information and assign the importance of\nneighboring nodes from the perspective of graph curvature and encourages us to\nbridge the gap between graph theory and neural networks.",

          "description": "We investigate a correspondence between two formalisms for discrete\nprobabilistic modeling: probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and tensor\nnetworks (TNs), a powerful modeling framework for simulating complex quantum\nsystems. The graphical calculus of PGMs and TNs exhibits many similarities,\nwith discrete undirected graphical models (UGMs) being a special case of TNs.\nHowever, more general probabilistic TN models such as Born machines (BMs)\nemploy complex-valued hidden states to produce novel forms of correlation among\nthe probabilities. While representing a new modeling resource for capturing\nstructure in discrete probability distributions, this behavior also renders the\ndirect application of standard PGM tools impossible. We aim to bridge this gap\nby introducing a hybrid PGM-TN formalism that integrates quantum-like\ncorrelations into PGM models in a principled manner, using the\nphysically-motivated concept of decoherence. We first prove that applying\ndecoherence to the entirety of a BM model converts it into a discrete UGM, and\nconversely, that any subgraph of a discrete UGM can be represented as a\ndecohered BM. This method allows a broad family of probabilistic TN models to\nbe encoded as partially decohered BMs, a fact we leverage to combine the\nrepresentational strengths of both model families. We experimentally verify the\nperformance of such hybrid models in a sequential modeling task, and identify\npromising uses of our method within the context of existing applications of\ngraphical models.",

          "description": "When a deep learning model is deployed in the wild, it can encounter test\ndata drawn from distributions different from the training data distribution and\nsuffer drop in performance. For safe deployment, it is essential to estimate\nthe accuracy of the pre-trained model on the test data. However, the labels for\nthe test inputs are usually not immediately available in practice, and\nobtaining them can be expensive. This observation leads to two challenging\ntasks: (1) unsupervised accuracy estimation, which aims to estimate the\naccuracy of a pre-trained classifier on a set of unlabeled test inputs; (2)\nerror detection, which aims to identify mis-classified test inputs. In this\npaper, we propose a principled and practically effective framework that\nsimultaneously addresses the two tasks.

We present the most common multiagent problem representations and\ntheir main challenges, and identify five research areas that address one or\nmore of these challenges: centralised training and decentralised execution,\nopponent modelling, communication, efficient coordination, and reward shaping.\nWe find that many computational studies rely on unrealistic assumptions or are\nnot generalisable to other settings; they struggle to overcome the curse of\ndimensionality or nonstationarity. Approaches from psychology and sociology\ncapture promising relevant behaviours such as communication and coordination.\nWe suggest that, for multiagent reinforcement learning to be successful, future\nresearch addresses these challenges with an interdisciplinary approach to open\nup new possibilities for more human-oriented solutions in multiagent\nreinforcement learning.",

          "description": "In recent years there has been a special interest in word embeddings as a new\napproach to convert words to vectors. It has been a focal point to understand\nhow much of the semantics of the the words has been transferred into embedding\nvectors. This is important as the embedding is going to be used as the basis\nfor downstream NLP applications and it will be costly to evaluate the\napplication end-to-end in order to identify quality of the used embedding\nmodel. Generally the word embeddings are evaluated through a number of tests,\nincluding analogy test. In this paper we propose a test framework for Persian\nembedding models. Persian is a low resource language and there is no rich\nsemantic benchmark to evaluate word embedding models for this language. In this\npaper we introduce an evaluation framework including a hand crafted Persian SAT\nbased analogy dataset, a colliquial test set (specific to Persian) and a\nbenchmark to study the impact of various parameters on the semantic evaluation\ntask.",

With recent advancement in\nrobot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, rich information including surgical\nvideos and robotic kinematics can be recorded, which provide complementary\nknowledge for understanding surgical gestures. However, existing methods either\nsolely adopt uni-modal data or directly concatenate multi-modal\nrepresentations, which can not sufficiently exploit the informative\ncorrelations inherent in visual and kinematics data to boost gesture\nrecognition accuracies. In this regard, we propose a novel online approach of\nmulti-modal relational graph network (i.e., MRG-Net) to dynamically integrate\nvisual and kinematics information through interactive message propagation in\nthe latent feature space. In specific, we first extract embeddings from video\nand kinematics sequences with temporal convolutional networks and LSTM units.\nNext, we identify multi-relations in these multi-modal embeddings and leverage\nthem through a hierarchical relational graph learning module. The effectiveness\nof our method is demonstrated with state-of-the-art results on the public\nJIGSAWS dataset, outperforming current uni-modal and multi-modal methods on\nboth suturing and knot typing tasks.

We focus here on the\nproblem of learning control flow that deviates from a strict step-by-step\nexecution of instructions -- that is, control flow that may skip forward over\nparts of the instructions or return backward to previously completed or skipped\nsteps. Demand for such flexible control arises in two fundamental ways:\nexplicitly when control is specified in the instructions themselves (such as\nconditional branching and looping) and implicitly when stochastic environment\ndynamics require re-completion of instructions whose effects have been\nperturbed, or opportunistic skipping of instructions whose effects are already\npresent. We formulate an attention-based architecture that meets these\nchallenges by learning, from task reward only, to flexibly attend to and\ncondition behavior on an internal encoding of the instructions. We test the\narchitecture's ability to learn both explicit and implicit control in two\nillustrative domains -- one inspired by Minecraft and the other by StarCraft --\nand show that the architecture exhibits zero-shot generalization to novel\ninstructions of length greater than those in a training set, at a performance\nlevel unmatched by two baseline recurrent architectures and one ablation\narchitecture.",

For\ntwo layer linear convolutional networks with $C$ output channels and kernel\nsize $K$, we show the following: (a) If the inputs to the network have a single\nchannel, the induced regularizer for any $K$ is a norm given by a semidefinite\nprogram (SDP) that is independent of the number of output channels $C$. (b) In\ncontrast, for networks with multi-channel inputs, multiple output channels can\nbe necessary to merely realize all matrix-valued linear functions and thus the\ninductive bias does depend on $C$. Further, for sufficiently large $C$, the\ninduced regularizer for $K=1$ and $K=D$ are the nuclear norm and the\n$\\ell_{2,1}$ group-sparse norm, respectively, of the Fourier coefficients. (c)\nComplementing our theoretical results, we show through experiments on MNIST and\nCIFAR-10 that our key findings extend to implicit biases from gradient descent\nin overparameterized networks.",

          "description": "This paper addresses the growing need to process non-Euclidean data, by\nintroducing a geometric deep learning (GDL) framework for building universal\nfeedforward-type models compatible with differentiable manifold geometries. We\nshow that our GDL models can approximate any continuous target function\nuniformly on compacts of a controlled maximum diameter. We obtain curvature\ndependant lower-bounds on this maximum diameter and upper-bounds on the depth\nof our approximating GDL models. Conversely, we find that there is always a\ncontinuous function between any two non-degenerate compact manifolds that any\n\"locally-defined\" GDL model cannot uniformly approximate. Our last main result\nidentifies data-dependent conditions guaranteeing that the GDL model\nimplementing our approximation breaks \"the curse of dimensionality.\" We find\nthat any \"real-world\" (i.e. finite) dataset always satisfies our condition and,\nconversely, any dataset satisfies our requirement if the target function is\nsmooth. As applications, we confirm the universal approximation capabilities of\nthe following GDL models: Ganea et al.

          "description": "Unsupervised disentanglement has been shown to be theoretically impossible\nwithout inductive biases on the models and the data. As an alternative\napproach, recent methods rely on limited supervision to disentangle the factors\nof variation and allow their identifiability. While annotating the true\ngenerative factors is only required for a limited number of observations, we\nargue that it is infeasible to enumerate all the factors of variation that\ndescribe a real-world image distribution. To this end, we propose a method for\ndisentangling a set of factors which are only partially labeled, as well as\nseparating the complementary set of residual factors that are never explicitly\nspecified. Our success in this challenging setting, demonstrated on synthetic\nbenchmarks, gives rise to leveraging off-the-shelf image descriptors to\npartially annotate a subset of attributes in real image domains (e.g. of human\nfaces) with minimal manual effort. Specifically, we use a recent language-image\nembedding model (CLIP) to annotate a set of attributes of interest in a\nzero-shot manner and demonstrate state-of-the-art disentangled image\nmanipulation results.",

          "description": "Video frame interpolation is the task of creating an interframe between two\nadjacent frames along the time axis. So, instead of simply averaging two\nadjacent frames to create an intermediate image, this operation should maintain\nsemantic continuity with the adjacent frames. Most conventional methods use\noptical flow, and various tools such as occlusion handling and object smoothing\nare indispensable. Since the use of these various tools leads to complex\nproblems, we tried to tackle the video interframe generation problem without\nusing problematic optical flow . To enable this , we have tried to use a deep\nneural network with an invertible structure, and developed an U-Net based\nGenerative Flow which is a modified normalizing flow. In addition, we propose a\nlearning method with a new consistency loss in the latent space to maintain\nsemantic temporal consistency between frames. The resolution of the generated\nimage is guaranteed to be identical to that of the original images by using an\ninvertible network. Furthermore, as it is not a random image like the ones by\ngenerative models, our network guarantees stable outputs without flicker.\nThrough experiments, we \\sam {confirmed the feasibility of the proposed\nalgorithm and would like to suggest the U-Net based Generative Flow as a new\npossibility for baseline in video frame interpolation. This paper is meaningful\nin that it is the world's first attempt to use invertible networks instead of\noptical flows for video interpolation.",

          "description": "Networks have been widely used to represent the relations between objects\nsuch as academic networks and social networks, and learning embedding for\nnetworks has thus garnered plenty of research attention. Self-supervised\nnetwork representation learning aims at extracting node embedding without\nexternal supervision. Recently, maximizing the mutual information between the\nlocal node embedding and the global summary (e.g. Deep Graph Infomax, or DGI\nfor short) has shown promising results on many downstream tasks such as node\nclassification. However, there are two major limitations of DGI. Firstly, DGI\nmerely considers the extrinsic supervision signal (i.e., the mutual information\nbetween node embedding and global summary) while ignores the intrinsic signal\n(i.e., the mutual dependence between node embedding and node attributes).\nSecondly, nodes in a real-world network are usually connected by multiple edges\nwith different relations, while DGI does not fully explore the various\nrelations among nodes. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a\nnovel framework, called High-order Deep Multiplex Infomax (HDMI), for learning\nnode embedding on multiplex networks in a self-supervised way. To be more\nspecific, we first design a joint supervision signal containing both extrinsic\nand intrinsic mutual information by high-order mutual information, and we\npropose a High-order Deep Infomax (HDI) to optimize the proposed supervision\nsignal. Then we propose an attention based fusion module to combine node\nembedding from different layers of the multiplex network. Finally, we evaluate\nthe proposed HDMI on various downstream tasks such as unsupervised clustering\nand supervised classification. The experimental results show that HDMI achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on these tasks.",

However, existing\napproaches usually require a large set of human annotated explanations for\ntraining while collecting a large set of explanations is not only time\nconsuming but also expensive. In this paper, we develop a general framework for\ninterpretable natural language understanding that requires only a small set of\nhuman annotated explanations for training. Our framework treats natural\nlanguage explanations as latent variables that model the underlying reasoning\nprocess of a neural model. We develop a variational EM framework for\noptimization where an explanation generation module and an\nexplanation-augmented prediction module are alternatively optimized and\nmutually enhance each other. Moreover, we further propose an explanation-based\nself-training method under this framework for semi-supervised learning. It\nalternates between assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data and generating new\nexplanations to iteratively improve each other. Experiments on two natural\nlanguage understanding tasks demonstrate that our framework can not only make\neffective predictions in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, but also\ngenerate good natural language explanation.",

An accurate\nprediction with a 30, 60, or 90 minute prediction horizon has the potential of\nsaving millions of dollars in emergency care costs. In this paper, we treat the\nproblem as one of function approximation, where the value of the BG level at\ntime $t+h$ (where $h$ the prediction horizon) is considered to be an unknown\nfunction of $d$ readings prior to the time $t$. This unknown function may be\nsupported in particular on some unknown submanifold of the $d$-dimensional\nEuclidean space. While manifold learning is classically done in a\nsemi-supervised setting, where the entire data has to be known in advance, we\nuse recent ideas to achieve an accurate function approximation in a supervised\nsetting; i.e., construct a model for the target function. We use the\nstate-of-the-art clinically relevant PRED-EGA grid to evaluate our results, and\ndemonstrate that for a real life dataset, our method performs better than a\nstandard deep network, especially in hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic regimes.\nOne noteworthy aspect of this work is that the training data and test data may\ncome from different distributions.",

The vertex separators are then used to\nconstruct a nested dissection ordering to permute a sparse matrix so that its\ntriangular factorization will incur less fill-in.

          "description": "Near-field Acoustic Holography (NAH) is a well-known problem aimed at\nestimating the vibrational velocity field of a structure by means of acoustic\nmeasurements. In this paper, we propose a NAH technique based on Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN). The devised CNN predicts the vibrational field on the\nsurface of arbitrary shaped plates (violin plates) with orthotropic material\nproperties from a limited number of measurements. In particular, the\narchitecture, named Super Resolution CNN (SRCNN), is able to estimate the\nvibrational field with a higher spatial resolution compared to the input\npressure. The pressure and velocity datasets have been generated through Finite\nElement Method simulations. We validate the proposed method by comparing the\nestimates with the synthesized ground truth and with a state-of-the-art\ntechnique. Moreover, we evaluate the robustness of the devised network against\nnoisy input data.",

          "description": "The Poisson equation is commonly encountered in engineering, for instance in\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) where it is needed to compute corrections to\nthe pressure field to ensure the incompressibility of the velocity field. In\nthe present work, we propose a novel fully convolutional neural network (CNN)\narchitecture to infer the solution of the Poisson equation on a 2D Cartesian\ngrid with different resolutions given the right hand side term, arbitrary\nboundary conditions and grid parameters. It provides unprecedented versatility\nfor a CNN approach dealing with partial differential equations. The boundary\nconditions are handled using a novel approach by decomposing the original\nPoisson problem into a homogeneous Poisson problem plus four inhomogeneous\nLaplace sub-problems. The model is trained using a novel loss function\napproximating the continuous $L^p$ norm between the prediction and the target.\nEven when predicting on grids denser than previously encountered, our model\ndemonstrates encouraging capacity to reproduce the correct solution profile.\nThe proposed model, which outperforms well-known neural network models, can be\nincluded in a CFD solver to help with solving the Poisson equation. Analytical\ntest cases indicate that our CNN architecture is capable of predicting the\ncorrect solution of a Poisson problem with mean percentage errors below 10%, an\nimprovement by comparison to the first step of conventional iterative methods.\nPredictions from our model, used as the initial guess to iterative algorithms\nlike Multigrid, can reduce the RMS error after a single iteration by more than\n90% compared to a zero initial guess.",

          "description": "In the domain generalization literature, a common objective is to learn\nrepresentations independent of the domain after conditioning on the class\nlabel. We show that this objective is not sufficient: there exist\ncounter-examples where a model fails to generalize to unseen domains even after\nsatisfying class-conditional domain invariance. We formalize this observation\nthrough a structural causal model and show the importance of modeling\nwithin-class variations for generalization. Specifically, classes contain\nobjects that characterize specific causal features, and domains can be\ninterpreted as interventions on these objects that change non-causal features.\nWe highlight an alternative condition: inputs across domains should have the\nsame representation if they are derived from the same object. Based on this\nobjective, we propose matching-based algorithms when base objects are observed\n(e.g., through data augmentation) and approximate the objective when objects\nare not observed (MatchDG). Our simple matching-based algorithms are\ncompetitive to prior work on out-of-domain accuracy for rotated MNIST,\nFashion-MNIST, PACS, and Chest-Xray datasets. Our method MatchDG also recovers\nground-truth object matches: on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, top-10 matches from\nMatchDG have over 50% overlap with ground-truth matches.",

          "description": "To measure the difference between two probability distributions, referred to\nas the source and target, respectively, we exploit both the chain rule and\nBayes' theorem to construct conditional transport (CT), which is constituted by\nboth a forward component and a backward one. The forward CT is the expected\ncost of moving a source data point to a target one, with their joint\ndistribution defined by the product of the source probability density function\n(PDF) and a source-dependent conditional distribution, which is related to the\ntarget PDF via Bayes' theorem. The backward CT is defined by reversing the\ndirection. The CT cost can be approximated by replacing the source and target\nPDFs with their discrete empirical distributions supported on mini-batches,\nmaking it amenable to implicit distributions and stochastic gradient\ndescent-based optimization. When applied to train a generative model, CT is\nshown to strike a good balance between mode-covering and mode-seeking behaviors\nand strongly resist mode collapse.

          "description": "When studying the expressive power of neural networks, a main challenge is to\nunderstand how the size and depth of the network affect its ability to\napproximate real functions. However, not all functions are interesting from a\npractical viewpoint: functions of interest usually have a polynomially-bounded\nLipschitz constant, and can be computed efficiently. We call functions that\nsatisfy these conditions \"benign\", and explore the benefits of size and depth\nfor approximation of benign functions with ReLU networks. As we show, this\nproblem is more challenging than the corresponding problem for non-benign\nfunctions. We give barriers to showing depth-lower-bounds: Proving existence of\na benign function that cannot be approximated by polynomial-size networks of\ndepth $4$ would settle longstanding open problems in computational complexity.\nIt implies that beyond depth $4$ there is a barrier to showing depth-separation\nfor benign functions, even between networks of constant depth and networks of\nnonconstant depth. We also study size-separation, namely, whether there are\nbenign functions that can be approximated with networks of size $O(s(d))$, but\nnot with networks of size $O(s'(d))$. We show a complexity-theoretic barrier to\nproving such results beyond size $O(d\\log^2(d))$, but also show an explicit\nbenign function, that can be approximated with networks of size $O(d)$ and not\nwith networks of size $o(d/\\log d)$. For approximation in $L_\\infty$ we achieve\nsuch separation already between size $O(d)$ and size $o(d)$. Moreover, we show\nsuperpolynomial size lower bounds and barriers to such lower bounds, depending\non the assumptions on the function. Our size-separation results rely on an\nanalysis of size lower bounds for Boolean functions, which is of independent\ninterest: We show linear size lower bounds for computing explicit Boolean\nfunctions with neural networks and threshold circuits.",

The goal of the threat is to cause miss-classification with\nrespect to as many labels as possible, with the same input perturbation. Our\nwork gains in-depth understanding about the multi-label adversarial attack by\nfirst characterizing the transferability of the attack based on the functional\nproperties of the multi-label classifier. We unveil how the transferability\nlevel of the attack determines the attackability of the classifier via\nestablishing an information-theoretic analysis of the adversarial risk.\nFurthermore, we propose a transferability-centered attackability assessment,\nnamed Soft Attackability Estimator (SAE), to evaluate the intrinsic\nvulnerability level of the targeted multi-label classifier. This estimator is\nthen integrated as a transferability-tuning regularization term into the\nmulti-label learning paradigm to achieve adversarially robust classification.\nThe experimental study on real-world data echos the theoretical analysis and\nverify the validity of the transferability-regularized multi-label learning\nmethod.",

          "description": "With the development of blockchain technologies, the number of smart\ncontracts deployed on blockchain platforms is growing exponentially, which\nmakes it difficult for users to find desired services by manual screening. The\nautomatic classification of smart contracts can provide blockchain users with\nkeyword-based contract searching and helps to manage smart contracts\neffectively. Current research on smart contract classification focuses on\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) solutions which are based on contract source\ncode. However, more than 94% of smart contracts are not open-source, so the\napplication scenarios of NLP methods are very limited. Meanwhile, NLP models\nare vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a classification\nmodel based on features from contract bytecode instead of source code to solve\nthese problems. We also use feature selection and ensemble learning to optimize\nthe model. Our experimental studies on over 3,300 real-world Ethereum smart\ncontracts show that our model can classify smart contracts without source code\nand has better performance than baseline models. Our model also has good\nresistance to adversarial attacks compared with NLP-based models. In addition,\nour analysis reveals that account features used in many smart contract\nclassification models have little effect on classification and can be excluded.",

To solve this problem, special external devices, correctors, are\ndeveloped. They should provide quick and non-iterative system fix without\nmodification of a legacy AI system. A common universal part of the AI corrector\nis a classifier that should separate undesired and erroneous behavior from\nnormal operation. Training of such classifiers is a grand challenge at the\nheart of the one- and few-shot learning methods. Effectiveness of one- and\nfew-short methods is based on either significant dimensionality reductions or\nthe blessing of dimensionality effects. Stochastic separability is a blessing\nof dimensionality phenomenon that allows one-and few-shot error correction: in\nhigh-dimensional datasets under broad assumptions each point can be separated\nfrom the rest of the set by simple and robust linear discriminant. The\nhierarchical structure of data universe is introduced where each data cluster\nhas a granular internal structure, etc. New stochastic separation theorems for\nthe data distributions with fine-grained structure are formulated and proved.\nSeparation theorems in infinite-dimensional limits are proven under assumptions\nof compact embedding of patterns into data space.

First, the most\nprominent meta features that describe the space of MLC data sets are the ones\nassessing different aspects of the label space. Second, the meta models show\nthat the most important meta features describe the label space, and, the meta\nfeatures describing the relationships among the labels tend to occur a bit more\noften than the meta features describing the distributions between and within\nthe individual labels. Third, the optimization of the hyperparameters can\nimprove the predictive performance, however, quite often the extent of the\nimprovements does not always justify the resource utilization.",

          "description": "Federated learning aims to learn a global model that performs well on client\ndevices with limited cross-client communication. Personalized federated\nlearning (PFL) further extends this setup to handle data heterogeneity between\nclients by learning personalized models. A key challenge in this setting is to\nlearn effectively across clients even though each client has unique data that\nis often limited in size. Here we present pFedGP, a solution to PFL that is\nbased on Gaussian processes (GPs) with deep kernel learning. GPs are highly\nexpressive models that work well in the low data regime due to their Bayesian\nnature. However, applying GPs to PFL raises multiple challenges. Mainly, GPs\nperformance depends heavily on access to a good kernel function, and learning a\nkernel requires a large training set. Therefore, we propose learning a shared\nkernel function across all clients, parameterized by a neural network, with a\npersonal GP classifier for each client. We further extend pFedGP to include\ninducing points using two novel methods, the first helps to improve\ngeneralization in the low data regime and the second reduces the computational\ncost. We derive a PAC-Bayes generalization bound on novel clients and\nempirically show that it gives non-vacuous guarantees. Extensive experiments on\nstandard PFL benchmarks with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10, and on a new\nsetup of learning under input noise show that pFedGP achieves well-calibrated\npredictions while significantly outperforming baseline methods, reaching up to\n21% in accuracy gain.",

Since it is defined as an\nexpectation over random projections, SW is commonly approximated by Monte\nCarlo. We adopt a new perspective to approximate SW by making use of the\nconcentration of measure phenomenon: under mild assumptions, one-dimensional\nprojections of a high-dimensional random vector are approximately Gaussian.\nBased on this observation, we develop a simple deterministic approximation for\nSW. Our method does not require sampling a number of random projections, and is\ntherefore both accurate and easy to use compared to the usual Monte Carlo\napproximation. We derive nonasymptotical guarantees for our approach, and show\nthat the approximation error goes to zero as the dimension increases, under a\nweak dependence condition on the data distribution. We validate our theoretical\nfindings on synthetic datasets, and illustrate the proposed approximation on a\ngenerative modeling problem.",

Fitting this type of data using statistical\nmodels with continuous dynamics is not only promising at an intuitive level but\nalso has practical benefits, including the ability to generate continuous\ntrajectories and to perform inference on previously unseen time stamps. Despite\nexciting progress in this area, the existing models still face challenges in\nterms of their representational power and the quality of their variational\napproximations.

          "description": "We study the problem of reconstructing a causal graphical model from data in\nthe presence of latent variables. The main problem of interest is recovering\nthe causal structure over the latent variables while allowing for general,\npotentially nonlinear dependence between the variables. In many practical\nproblems, the dependence between raw observations (e.g. pixels in an image) is\nmuch less relevant than the dependence between certain high-level, latent\nfeatures (e.g. concepts or objects), and this is the setting of interest. We\nprovide conditions under which both the latent representations and the\nunderlying latent causal model are identifiable by a reduction to a mixture\noracle. The proof is constructive, and leads to several algorithms for\nexplicitly reconstructing the full graphical model. We discuss efficient\nalgorithms and provide experiments illustrating the algorithms in practice.",

          "description": "The performance of supervised deep learning algorithms depends significantly\non the scale, quality and diversity of the data used for their training.\nCollecting and manually annotating large amount of data can be both\ntime-consuming and costly tasks to perform. In the case of tasks related to\nvisual human-centric perception, the collection and distribution of such data\nmay also face restrictions due to legislation regarding privacy. In addition,\nthe design and testing of complex systems, e.g., robots, which often employ\ndeep learning-based perception models, may face severe difficulties as even\nstate-of-the-art methods trained on real and large-scale datasets cannot always\nperform adequately as they have not adapted to the visual differences between\nthe virtual and the real world data. As an attempt to tackle and mitigate the\neffect of these issues, we present a method that automatically generates\nrealistic synthetic data with annotations for a) person detection, b) face\nrecognition, and c) human pose estimation. The proposed method takes as input\nreal background images and populates them with human figures in various poses.\nInstead of using hand-made 3D human models, we propose the use of models\ngenerated through deep learning methods, further reducing the dataset creation\ncosts, while maintaining a high level of realism. In addition, we provide\nopen-source and easy to use tools that implement the proposed pipeline,\nallowing for generating highly-realistic synthetic datasets for a variety of\ntasks.

          "description": "Bayesian optimization is a promising methodology for analog circuit\nsynthesis. However, the sequential nature of the Bayesian optimization\nframework significantly limits its ability to fully utilize real-world\ncomputational resources. In this paper, we propose an efficient parallelizable\nBayesian optimization algorithm via Multi-objective ACquisition function\nEnsemble (MACE) to further accelerate the optimization procedure. By sampling\nquery points from the Pareto front of the probability of improvement (PI),\nexpected improvement (EI) and lower confidence bound (LCB), we combine the\nbenefits of state-of-the-art acquisition functions to achieve a delicate\ntradeoff between exploration and exploitation for the unconstrained\noptimization problem. Based on this batch design, we further adjust the\nalgorithm for the constrained optimization problem. By dividing the\noptimization procedure into two stages and first focusing on finding an initial\nfeasible point, we manage to gain more information about the valid region and\ncan better avoid sampling around the infeasible area. After achieving the first\nfeasible point, we favor the feasible region by adopting a specially designed\npenalization term to the acquisition function ensemble. The experimental\nresults quantitatively demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce the\noverall simulation time by up to 74 times compared to differential evolution\n(DE) for the unconstrained optimization problem when the batch size is 15. For\nthe constrained optimization problem, our proposed algorithm can speed up the\noptimization process by up to 15 times compared to the weighted expected\nimprovement based Bayesian optimization (WEIBO) approach, when the batch size\nis 15.",

Yet, with the unique design of nested\ninner-loop and outer-loop updates which respectively govern the task-specific\nand meta-model-centric learning, the underlying learning objective of MAML\nstill remains implicit and thus impedes a more straightforward understanding of\nit. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to the working mechanism of\nMAML and discover that: MAML is analogous to a meta-learner using a supervised\ncontrastive objective function, where the query features are pulled towards the\nsupport features of the same class and against those of different classes, in\nwhich such contrastiveness is experimentally verified via an analysis based on\nthe cosine similarity. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the vanilla MAML\nalgorithm has an undesirable interference term originating from the random\ninitialization and the cross-task interaction. We therefore propose a simple\nbut effective technique, zeroing trick, to alleviate such interference, where\nthe extensive experiments are then conducted on both miniImagenet and Omniglot\ndatasets to demonstrate the consistent improvement brought by our proposed\ntechnique thus well validating its effectiveness.",

          "description": "Having access to an exploring restart distribution (the so-called wide\ncoverage assumption) is critical with policy gradient methods. This is due to\nthe fact that, while the objective function is insensitive to updates in\nunlikely states, the agent may still need improvements in those states in order\nto reach a nearly optimal payoff. For this reason, wide coverage is used in\nsome form when analyzing theoretical properties of practical policy gradient\nmethods. However, this assumption can be unfeasible in certain environments,\nfor instance when learning is online, or when restarts are possible only from a\nfixed initial state. In these cases, classical policy gradient algorithms can\nhave very poor convergence properties and sample efficiency. In this paper, we\ndevelop Curious Explorer, a novel and simple iterative state space exploration\nstrategy that can be used with any starting distribution $\\rho$. Curious\nExplorer starts from $\\rho$, then using intrinsic rewards assigned to the set\nof poorly visited states produces a sequence of policies, each one more\nexploratory than the previous one in an informed way, and finally outputs a\nrestart model $\\mu$ based on the state visitation distribution of the\nexploratory policies. Curious Explorer is provable, in the sense that we\nprovide theoretical upper bounds on how often an optimal policy visits poorly\nvisited states. These bounds can be used to prove PAC convergence and sample\nefficiency results when a PAC optimizer is plugged in Curious Explorer. This\nallows to achieve global convergence and sample efficiency results without any\ncoverage assumption for REINFORCE, and potentially for any other policy\ngradient method ensuring PAC convergence with wide coverage. Finally, we plug\n(the output of) Curious Explorer into REINFORCE and TRPO, and show empirically\nthat it can improve performance in MDPs with challenging exploration.",

The policy is implicitly defined on these optimal\nvalue estimates, rather than being decomposed among the subtasks. As a\nconsequence, our approach can learn the globally optimal policy, and does not\nsuffer from the non-stationarity of high-level decisions. If several partitions\nhave equivalent dynamics, the subtasks of those partitions can be shared.

          "description": "Scientific and engineering problems often require the use of artificial\nintelligence to aid understanding and the search for promising designs. While\nGaussian processes (GP) stand out as easy-to-use and interpretable learners,\nthey have difficulties in accommodating big datasets, categorical inputs, and\nmultiple responses, which has become a common challenge for a growing number of\ndata-driven design applications. In this paper, we propose a GP model that\nutilizes latent variables and functions obtained through variational inference\nto address the aforementioned challenges simultaneously. The method is built\nupon the latent variable Gaussian process (LVGP) model where categorical\nfactors are mapped into a continuous latent space to enable GP modeling of\nmixed-variable datasets. By extending variational inference to LVGP models, the\nlarge training dataset is replaced by a small set of inducing points to address\nthe scalability issue. Output response vectors are represented by a linear\ncombination of independent latent functions, forming a flexible kernel\nstructure to handle multiple responses that might have distinct behaviors.\nComparative studies demonstrate that the proposed method scales well for large\ndatasets with over 10^4 data points, while outperforming state-of-the-art\nmachine learning methods without requiring much hyperparameter tuning. In\naddition, an interpretable latent space is obtained to draw insights into the\neffect of categorical factors, such as those associated with building blocks of\narchitectures and element choices in metamaterial and materials design.

          "description": "Spreadsheet formula prediction has been an important program synthesis\nproblem with many real-world applications. Previous works typically utilize\ninput-output examples as the specification for spreadsheet formula synthesis,\nwhere each input-output pair simulates a separate row in the spreadsheet.\nHowever, this formulation does not fully capture the rich context in real-world\nspreadsheets. First, spreadsheet data entries are organized as tables, thus\nrows and columns are not necessarily independent from each other. In addition,\nmany spreadsheet tables include headers, which provide high-level descriptions\nof the cell data. However, previous synthesis approaches do not consider\nheaders as part of the specification. In this work, we present the first\napproach for synthesizing spreadsheet formulas from tabular context, which\nincludes both headers and semi-structured tabular data. In particular, we\npropose SpreadsheetCoder, a BERT-based model architecture to represent the\ntabular context in both row-based and column-based formats. We train our model\non a large dataset of spreadsheets, and demonstrate that SpreadsheetCoder\nachieves top-1 prediction accuracy of 42.51%, which is a considerable\nimprovement over baselines that do not employ rich tabular context. Compared to\nthe rule-based system, SpreadsheetCoder assists 82% more users in composing\nformulas on Google Sheets.",

          "description": "Gene expression datasets consist of thousand of genes with relatively small\nsamplesizes (i.e. are large-$p$-small-$n$). Moreover, dependencies of various\norders co-exist in the datasets. In the Undirected probabilistic Graphical\nModel (UGM) framework the Glasso algorithm has been proposed to deal with high\ndimensional micro-array datasets forcing sparsity. Also, modifications of the\ndefault Glasso algorithm are developed to overcome the problem of complex\ninteraction structure. In this work we advocate the use of a simple score-based\nHill Climbing algorithm (HC) that learns Gaussian Bayesian Networks (BNs)\nleaning on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). We compare HC with Glasso and its\nmodifications in the UGM framework on their capability to reconstruct GRNs from\nmicro-array data belonging to the Escherichia Coli genome. We benefit from the\nanalytical properties of the Joint Probability Density (JPD) function on which\nboth directed and undirected PGMs build to convert DAGs to UGMs.\n\nWe conclude that dependencies in complex data are learned best by the HC\nalgorithm, presenting them most accurately and efficiently, simultaneously\nmodelling strong local and weaker but significant global connections coexisting\nin the gene expression dataset. The HC algorithm adapts intrinsically to the\ncomplex dependency structure of the dataset, without forcing a specific\nstructure in advance. On the contrary, Glasso and modifications model\nunnecessary dependencies at the expense of the probabilistic information in the\nnetwork and of a structural bias in the JPD function that can only be relieved\nincluding many parameters.",

These approaches often need\nto explore a large number of concepts to find adequate hypotheses. This need\narguably stems from current approaches relying on myopic heuristic functions to\nguide their search through an infinite concept space. In turn, deep\nreinforcement learning provides effective means to address myopia by estimating\nhow much discounted cumulated future reward states promise. In this work, we\nleverage deep reinforcement learning to accelerate the learning of concepts in\n$\\mathcal{ALC}$ by proposing DRILL -- a novel class expression learning\napproach that uses a convolutional deep Q-learning model to steer its search.\nBy virtue of its architecture, DRILL is able to compute the expected discounted\ncumulated future reward of more than $10^3$ class expressions in a second on\nstandard hardware. We evaluate DRILL on four benchmark datasets against\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

          "description": "Critical role of Internet of Things (IoT) in various domains like smart city,\nhealthcare, supply chain and transportation has made them the target of\nmalicious attacks. Past works in this area focused on centralized Intrusion\nDetection System (IDS), assuming the existence of a central entity to perform\ndata analysis and identify threats. However, such IDS may not always be\nfeasible, mainly due to spread of data across multiple sources and gathering at\ncentral node can be costly. Also, the earlier works primarily focused on\nimproving True Positive Rate (TPR) and ignored the False Positive Rate (FPR),\nwhich is also essential to avoid unnecessary downtime of the systems. In this\npaper, we first present an architecture for IDS based on hybrid ensemble model,\nnamed PHEC, which gives improved performance compared to state-of-the-art\narchitectures. We then adapt this model to a federated learning framework that\nperforms local training and aggregates only the model parameters. Next, we\npropose Noise-Tolerant PHEC in centralized and federated settings to address\nthe label-noise problem. The proposed idea uses classifiers using weighted\nconvex surrogate loss functions. Natural robustness of KNN classifier towards\nnoisy data is also used in the proposed architecture. Experimental results on\nfour benchmark datasets drawn from various security attacks show that our model\nachieves high TPR while keeping FPR low on noisy and clean data. Further, they\nalso demonstrate that the hybrid ensemble models achieve performance in\nfederated settings close to that of the centralized settings.",

This budget is a scarce resource that must\nbe carefully managed to maximize the number of successfully trained models.\n\nWe describe PrivateKube, an extension to the popular Kubernetes datacenter\norchestrator that adds privacy as a new type of resource to be managed\nalongside other traditional compute resources, such as CPU, GPU, and memory.\nThe abstractions we design for the privacy resource mirror those defined by\nKubernetes for traditional resources, but there are also major differences. For\nexample, traditional compute resources are replenishable while privacy is not:\na CPU can be regained after a model finishes execution while privacy budget\ncannot.

          "description": "Network estimation from multi-variate point process or time series data is a\nproblem of fundamental importance. Prior work has focused on parametric\napproaches that require a known parametric model, which makes estimation\nprocedures less robust to model mis-specification, non-linearities and\nheterogeneities. In this paper, we develop a semi-parametric approach based on\nthe monotone single-index multi-variate autoregressive model (SIMAM) which\naddresses these challenges. We provide theoretical guarantees for dependent\ndata and an alternating projected gradient descent algorithm. Significantly we\ndo not explicitly assume mixing conditions on the process (although we do\nrequire conditions analogous to restricted strong convexity) and we achieve\nrates of the form $O(T^{-\\frac{1}{3}} \\sqrt{s\\log(TM)})$ (optimal in the\nindependent design case) where $s$ is the threshold for the maximum in-degree\nof the network that indicates the sparsity level, $M$ is the number of actors\nand $T$ is the number of time points. In addition, we demonstrate the superior\nperformance both on simulated data and two real data examples where our SIMAM\napproach out-performs state-of-the-art parametric methods both in terms of\nprediction and network estimation.",

          "description": "The lasso is a popular method to induce shrinkage and sparsity in the\nsolution vector (coefficients) of regression problems, particularly when there\nare many predictors relative to the number of observations. Solving the lasso\nin this high-dimensional setting can, however, be computationally demanding.\nFortunately, this demand can be alleviated via the use of screening rules that\ndiscard predictors prior to fitting the model, leading to a reduced problem to\nbe solved. In this paper, we present a new screening strategy: look-ahead\nscreening. Our method uses safe screening rules to find a range of penalty\nvalues for which a given predictor cannot enter the model, thereby screening\npredictors along the remainder of the path. In experiments we show that these\nlook-ahead screening rules outperform the active warm-start version of the Gap\nSafe rules.",

We conduct experiments on a number of RL tasks to investigate the\ngeneralization performance of the proposed method by comparing it with the\nstandard baselines and the state-of-the-art mixreg approach.

Three retrospective databases were built for the AI model training,\nvalidation, and testing, with a balanced distribution of studies per body\nregion.

We annotate key\nfeatures of papers which reveal their values: how they justify their choice of\nproject, which aspects they uplift, their consideration of potential negative\nconsequences, and their institutional affiliations and funding sources.

We present extensive\ntextual evidence and analysis of how these values are operationalized.

Issues in the\ncurrent literature include sometimes contradictory observations on the\nperformance of different AL algorithms, unintended exclusion of important\ngeneralization approaches such as data augmentation and SGD for optimization, a\nlack of study of evaluation facets like the labeling efficiency of AL, and\nlittle or no clarity on the scenarios in which AL outperforms random sampling\n(RS).

On the positive side, we show\nthat AL techniques are 2x to 4x more label-efficient compared to RS with the\nuse of data augmentation. Surprisingly, when data augmentation is included,\nthere is no longer a consistent gain in using BADGE, a state-of-the-art\napproach, over simple uncertainty sampling. We then do a careful analysis of\nhow existing approaches perform with varying amounts of redundancy and number\nof examples per class. Finally, we provide several insights for AL\npractitioners to consider in future work, such as the effect of the AL batch\nsize, the effect of initialization, the importance of retraining a new model at\nevery round, and other insights.",

Our\nalgorithm also keeps asynchronous copies of the Q-network and expert network,\npredicting the target values using the same manner as of Double Q-learning.\n\nWe compared on the game of Othello our algorithm with the state-of-the-art\nQ-learning algorithm, which was a combination of Double Q-learning and Dueling\nQ-learning. The results showed that Expert Q-learning was indeed useful and\nmore resistant to the overestimation bias of Q-learning. The baseline\nQ-learning algorithm exhibited unstable and suboptimal behavior, especially\nwhen playing against a stochastic player, whereas Expert Q-learning\ndemonstrated more robust performance with higher scores. Expert Q-learning\nwithout using examples has also gained better results than the baseline\nalgorithm when trained and tested against a fixed player. On the other hand,\nExpert Q-learning without examples cannot win against the baseline Q-learning\nalgorithm in direct game competitions despite the fact that it has also shown\nthe strength of reducing the overestimation bias.",

          "description": "Min-max saddle point games have recently been intensely studied, due to their\nwide range of applications, including training Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs). However, most of the recent efforts for solving them are limited to\nspecial regimes such as convex-concave games. Further, it is customarily\nassumed that the underlying optimization problem is solved either by a single\nmachine or in the case of multiple machines connected in centralized fashion,\nwherein each one communicates with a central node. The latter approach becomes\nchallenging, when the underlying communications network has low bandwidth. In\naddition, privacy considerations may dictate that certain nodes can communicate\nwith a subset of other nodes. Hence, it is of interest to develop methods that\nsolve min-max games in a decentralized manner. To that end, we develop a\ndecentralized adaptive momentum (ADAM)-type algorithm for solving min-max\noptimization problem under the condition that the objective function satisfies\na Minty Variational Inequality condition, which is a generalization to\nconvex-concave case. The proposed method overcomes shortcomings of recent\nnon-adaptive gradient-based decentralized algorithms for min-max optimization\nproblems that do not perform well in practice and require careful tuning. In\nthis paper, we obtain non-asymptotic rates of convergence of the proposed\nalgorithm (coined DADAM$^3$) for finding a (stochastic) first-order Nash\nequilibrium point and subsequently evaluate its performance on training GANs.\nThe extensive empirical evaluation shows that DADAM$^3$ outperforms recently\ndeveloped methods, including decentralized optimistic stochastic gradient for\nsolving such min-max problems.",

However, conventional CL is sensitive to how many negative samples are\nincluded and how they are selected. Proposed in this paper is a doubly CL\nstrategy that contrasts positive samples and negative ones within themselves\nseparately. We realize this strategy with contrastive attraction and\ncontrastive repulsion (CACR) makes the query not only exert a greater force to\nattract more distant positive samples but also do so to repel closer negative\nsamples. Theoretical analysis reveals the connection between CACR and CL from\nthe perspectives of both positive attraction and negative repulsion and shows\nthe benefits in both efficiency and robustness brought by separately\ncontrasting within the sampled positive and negative pairs. Extensive\nlarge-scale experiments on standard vision tasks show that CACR not only\nconsistently outperforms existing CL methods on benchmark datasets in\nrepresentation learning, but also provides interpretable contrastive weights,\ndemonstrating the efficacy of the proposed doubly contrastive strategy.",

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks have been highly successful in image-based\nlearning tasks due to their translation equivariance property. Recent work has\ngeneralized the traditional convolutional layer of a convolutional neural\nnetwork to non-Euclidean spaces and shown group equivariance of the generalized\nconvolution operation. In this paper, we present a novel higher order Volterra\nconvolutional neural network (VolterraNet) for data defined as samples of\nfunctions on Riemannian homogeneous spaces. Analagous to the result for\ntraditional convolutions, we prove that the Volterra functional convolutions\nare equivariant to the action of the isometry group admitted by the Riemannian\nhomogeneous spaces, and under some restrictions, any non-linear equivariant\nfunction can be expressed as our homogeneous space Volterra convolution,\ngeneralizing the non-linear shift equivariant characterization of Volterra\nexpansions in Euclidean space. We also prove that second order functional\nconvolution operations can be represented as cascaded convolutions which leads\nto an efficient implementation. Beyond this, we also propose a dilated\nVolterraNet model. These advances lead to large parameter reductions relative\nto baseline non-Euclidean CNNs. To demonstrate the efficacy of the VolterraNet\nperformance, we present several real data experiments involving classification\ntasks on spherical-MNIST, atomic energy, Shrec17 data sets, and group testing\non diffusion MRI data.

This work studies an important aspect of these methods: splitting the\ndata from each task into train (support) and validation (query) sets during\nmeta-training. Inspired by recent work (Raghu et al., 2020), we view such\nmeta-learning methods through the lens of representation learning and argue\nthat the train-validation split encourages the learned representation to be\nlow-rank without compromising on expressivity, as opposed to the non-splitting\nvariant that encourages high-rank representations. Since sample efficiency\nbenefits from low-rankness, the splitting strategy will require very few\nsamples to solve unseen test tasks.

To address this limitation, we present ScanBank, a\nnew dataset containing 10 thousand scanned page images, manually labeled by\nhumans as to the presence of the 3.3 thousand figures or tables found therein.\nWe use this dataset to train a deep neural network model based on YOLOv5 to\naccurately extract figures and tables from scanned ETDs.

          "description": "We consider the problem of predicting the future path of a pedestrian using\nits motion history and the motion history of the surrounding pedestrians,\ncalled social information. Since the seminal paper on Social-LSTM,\ndeep-learning has become the main tool used to model the impact of social\ninteractions on a pedestrian's motion. The demonstration that these models can\nlearn social interactions relies on an ablative study of these models. The\nmodels are compared with and without their social interactions module on two\nstandard metrics, the Average Displacement Error and Final Displacement Error.\nYet, these complex models were recently outperformed by a simple\nconstant-velocity approach. This questions if they actually allow to model\nsocial interactions as well as the validity of the proof. In this paper, we\nfocus on the deep-learning models with a soft-attention mechanism for social\ninteraction modeling and study whether they use social information at\nprediction time. We conduct two experiments across four state-of-the-art\napproaches on the ETH and UCY datasets, which were also used in previous work.\nFirst, the models are trained by replacing the social information with random\nnoise and compared to model trained with actual social information. Second, we\nuse a gating mechanism along with a $L_0$ penalty, allowing models to shut down\ntheir inner components. The models consistently learn to prune their\nsoft-attention mechanism. For both experiments, neither the course of the\nconvergence nor the prediction performance were altered. This demonstrates that\nthe soft-attention mechanism and therefore the social information are ignored\nby the models.",

Therefore, it is\noften difficult to jointly train these two subtasks simultaneously. We propose\na novel feature called spatial cue-augmented log-spectrogram (SALSA) with exact\ntime-frequency mapping between the signal power and the source\ndirection-of-arrival. The feature includes multichannel log-spectrograms\nstacked along with the estimated direct-to-reverberant ratio and a normalized\nversion of the principal eigenvector of the spatial covariance matrix at each\ntime-frequency bin on the spectrograms. Experimental results on the DCASE 2021\ndataset for sound event localization and detection with directional\ninterference showed that the deep learning-based models trained on this new\nfeature outperformed the DCASE challenge baseline by a large margin. We\ncombined several models with slightly different architectures that were trained\non the new feature to further improve the system performances for the DCASE\nsound event localization and detection challenge.",

          "description": "In sparse coding, we attempt to extract features of input vectors, assuming\nthat the data is inherently structured as a sparse superposition of basic\nbuilding blocks. Similarly, neural networks perform a given task by learning\nfeatures of the training data set. Recently both data-driven and model-driven\nfeature extracting methods have become extremely popular and have achieved\nremarkable results. Nevertheless, practical implementations are often too slow\nto be employed in real-life scenarios, especially for real-time applications.\nWe propose a speed-up upgraded version of the classic iterative thresholding\nalgorithm, that produces a good approximation of the convolutional sparse code\nwithin 2-5 iterations. The speed advantage is gained mostly from the\nobservation that most solvers are slowed down by inefficient global\nthresholding. The main idea is to normalize each data point by the local\nreceptive field energy, before applying a threshold. This way, the natural\ninclination towards strong feature expressions is suppressed, so that one can\nrely on a global threshold that can be easily approximated, or learned during\ntraining. The proposed algorithm can be employed with a known predetermined\ndictionary, or with a trained dictionary. The trained version is implemented as\na neural net designed as the unfolding of the proposed solver. The performance\nof the proposed solution is demonstrated via the seismic inversion problem in\nboth synthetic and real data scenarios. We also provide theoretical guarantees\nfor a stable support recovery. Namely, we prove that under certain conditions\nthe true support is perfectly recovered within the first iteration.",

We want to apply multidimensional statistical analysis to reveal more\nfacts than the monotone mainstream media. Our paper has three parts. First, we\nproposed a new method to quantify fatal police shooting news reporting\ndeviation of mainstream media, which includes CNN, FOX, ABC, and NBC. Second,\nwe analyzed the most comprehensive US fatal police shooting dataset from\nWashington Post. We used FP-growth to reveal the frequent patterns and DBSCAN\nclustering to find fatal shooting hotspots. We brought multi-attributes (social\neconomics, demographics, political tendency, education, gun ownership rate,\npolice training hours, etc.) to reveal connections under the iceberg. We found\nthat the police shooting rate of a state depends on many variables. The top\nfour most relevant attributes were state joined year, state land area, gun\nownership rate, and violent crime rate. Third, we proposed four regression\nmodels to predict police shooting rates at the state level. The best model\nKstar could predict the fatal police shooting rate with about 88.53%\ncorrelation coefficient. We also proposed classification models, including\nGradient Boosting Machine, Multi-class Classifier, Logistic Regression, and\nNaive Bayes Classifier, to predict the race of fatal police shooting victims.\nOur classification models show no significant evidence to conclude that racial\ndiscrimination happened during fatal police shootings recorded by the WP\ndataset.",

Administrators at the state and local level are faced with the\nexceedingly difficult task of ensuring that each of their jurisdictions is\nproperly managed, while also monitoring for improper modifications to the\ndatabase. Monitoring changes to Voter Registration Files (VRFs) is crucial,\ngiven that a malicious actor wishing to disrupt the democratic process in the\nUS would be well-advised to manipulate the contents of these files in order to\nachieve their goals. In 2020, we saw election officials perform admirably when\nfaced with administering one of the most contentious elections in US history,\nbut much work remains to secure and monitor the election systems Americans rely\non. Using data created by comparing snapshots taken of VRFs over time, we\npresent a set of methods that make use of machine learning to ease the burden\non analysts and administrators in protecting voter rolls. We first evaluate the\neffectiveness of multiple unsupervised anomaly detection methods in detecting\nVRF modifications by modeling anomalous changes as sparse additive noise. In\nthis setting we determine that statistical models comparing administrative\ndistricts within a short time span and non-negative matrix factorization are\nmost effective for surfacing anomalous events for review. These methods were\ndeployed during 2019-2020 in our organization's monitoring system and were used\nin collaboration with the office of the Iowa Secretary of State. Additionally,\nwe propose a newly deployed model which uses historical and demographic\nmetadata to label the likely root cause of database modifications. We hope to\nuse this model to predict which modifications have known causes and therefore\nbetter identify potentially anomalous modifications.",

Deep\ngenerative models have also made significant advances through better modelling\nof the local correlations in the graph topology, which have been very useful\nfor predicting unobserved graph components, such as the existence of a link or\nthe class of a node, from nearby observed graph components. A complete\nscientific understanding of graph data should address both global and local\nstructure. In this paper, we propose a joint model for both as complementary\nobjectives in a graph VAE framework. Global structure is captured by\nincorporating graph kernels in a probabilistic model whose loss function is\nclosely related to the maximum mean discrepancy(MMD) between the global\nstructures of the reconstructed and the input graphs. The ELBO objective\nderived from the model regularizes a standard local link reconstruction term\nwith an MMD term. Our experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in the\nrealism of the generated graph structures, typically by 1-2 orders of magnitude\nof graph structure metrics, compared to leading graph VAEand GAN models.

Recent results suggest\nthat trilinear products of quaternion-valued embeddings can be a more effective\nmeans to tackle link prediction. In addition, models based on convolutions on\nreal-valued embeddings often yield state-of-the-art results for link\nprediction. In this paper, we investigate a composition of convolution\noperations with hypercomplex multiplications. We propose the four approaches\nQMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO to tackle the link prediction problem. QMult and\nOMult can be considered as quaternion and octonion extensions of previous\nstate-of-the-art approaches, including DistMult and ComplEx.

          "description": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been shown to be susceptible to memorization\nor overfitting in the presence of noisily labelled data. For the problem of\nrobust learning under such noisy data, several algorithms have been proposed. A\nprominent class of algorithms rely on sample selection strategies, motivated by\ncurriculum learning. For example, many algorithms use the `small loss trick'\nwherein a fraction of samples with loss values below a certain threshold are\nselected for training. These algorithms are sensitive to such thresholds, and\nit is difficult to fix or learn these thresholds. Often, these algorithms also\nrequire information such as label noise rates which are typically unavailable\nin practice. In this paper, we propose a data-dependent, adaptive sample\nselection strategy that relies only on batch statistics of a given mini-batch\nto provide robustness against label noise. The algorithm does not have any\nadditional hyperparameters for sample selection, does not need any information\non noise rates, and does not need access to separate data with clean labels. We\nempirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on benchmark\ndatasets.",

Nevertheless, deploying such AI models across commodity\ndevices faces significant challenges: large computational cost, multiple\nperformance objectives, hardware heterogeneity and a common need for high\naccuracy, together pose critical problems to the deployment of DNNs across the\nvarious embedded and mobile devices in the wild. As such, we have yet to\nwitness the mainstream usage of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms\nacross consumer devices.

Then, we\npresent diverse methods for achieving real-time performance following a\ncross-stack approach. These span model-, system- and hardware-level techniques,\nand their combination. Our findings provide illustrative examples of AI systems\nthat do not overburden mobile hardware, while also indicating how they can\nimprove inference accuracy. Moreover, we showcase how custom ASIC- and\nFPGA-based accelerators can be an enabling factor for next-generation AI\napplications, such as multi-DNN systems.

          "description": "In many classification problems, collecting massive clean-annotated data is\nnot easy, and thus a lot of researches have been done to handle data with noisy\nlabels. Most recent state-of-art solutions for noisy label problems are built\non the small-loss strategy which exploits the memorization effect. While it is\na powerful tool, the memorization effect has several drawbacks. The\nperformances are sensitive to the choice of a training epoch required for\nutilizing the memorization effect. In addition, when the labels are heavily\ncontaminated or imbalanced, the memorization effect may not occur in which case\nthe methods based on the small-loss strategy fail to identify clean labeled\ndata. We introduce a new method called INN(Integration with the Nearest\nNeighborhoods) to refine clean labeled data from training data with noisy\nlabels. The proposed method is based on a new discovery that a prediction\npattern at neighbor regions of clean labeled data is consistently different\nfrom that of noisy labeled data regardless of training epochs. The INN method\nrequires more computation but is much stable and powerful than the small-loss\nstrategy. By carrying out various experiments, we demonstrate that the INN\nmethod resolves the shortcomings in the memorization effect successfully and\nthus is helpful to construct more accurate deep prediction models with training\ndata with noisy labels.",

Despite its\npervasiveness, we have a poor understanding of what its effectiveness stems\nfrom. It is popularly believed that its effectiveness stems from the visual\nattention explanation, advocating focusing on the important part of input data\nrather than ingesting the entire input. In this paper, we find that there is\nonly a weak consistency between the attention weights of features and their\nimportance. Instead, we verify the crucial role of feature map multiplication\nin attention mechanism and uncover a fundamental impact of feature map\nmultiplication on the learned landscapes of CNNs: with the high order\nnon-linearity brought by the feature map multiplication, it played a\nregularization role on CNNs, which made them learn smoother and more stable\nlandscapes near real samples compared to vanilla CNNs. This smoothness and\nstability induce a more predictive and stable behavior in-between real samples,\nand make CNNs generate better. Moreover, motivated by the proposed\neffectiveness of feature map multiplication, we design feature map\nmultiplication network (FMMNet) by simply replacing the feature map addition in\nResNet with feature map multiplication. FMMNet outperforms ResNet on various\ndatasets, and this indicates that feature map multiplication plays a vital role\nin improving the performance even without finely designed attention mechanism\nin existing methods.",

To\ntrain the network, in contrast with the standard end to end learning method, we\npropose the progressive learning scheme to extract the context of objects by\nonly manipulating the learning process without changing the model. In this\nscheme, the upsampling starts from the reconstruction of low resolution images\nand progressively grows to high resolution images throughout the training\nphase. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our approach\nwith ImageNet10k dataset outperforms existing methods on standard quality\nmetrics and achieves state of the art performances on image colourisation. We\nperformed a user study to quantify the perceptual realism of the colourisation\nresults demonstrating: that progressive learning let the TUCaN achieve better\ncolours than the end to end scheme; and pointing out the limitations of the\nexisting evaluation metrics.",

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled\nsource domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous methods focus on learning\ndomain-invariant features to decrease the discrepancy between the feature\ndistributions as well as minimizing the source error and have made remarkable\nprogress. However, a recently proposed theory reveals that such a strategy is\nnot sufficient for a successful domain adaptation. It shows that besides a\nsmall source error, both the discrepancy between the feature distributions and\nthe discrepancy between the labeling functions should be small across domains.\nThe discrepancy between the labeling functions is essentially the cross-domain\nerrors which are ignored by existing methods. To overcome this issue, in this\npaper, a novel method is proposed to integrate all the objectives into a\nunified optimization framework. Moreover, the incorrect pseudo labels widely\nused in previous methods can lead to error accumulation during learning. To\nalleviate this problem, the pseudo labels are obtained by utilizing structural\ninformation of the target domain besides source classifier and we propose a\ncurriculum learning based strategy to select the target samples with more\naccurate pseudo-labels during training.

With modeling each feature separately, the\ntendency that the model learns the relationship between two features can be\nmitigated.",

          "description": "This paper studies construction of above-ground biomass (AGB) prediction maps\nfrom synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images. The purpose is to improve\ntraditional regression models based on SAR intensity, trained with a limited\namount of AGB in situ measurements. Although it is costly to collect, data from\nairborne laser scanning (ALS) sensors are highly correlated with AGB.\nTherefore, we propose using AGB predictions based on ALS data as surrogate\nresponse variables for SAR data in a sequential modelling fashion. This\nincreases the amount of training data dramatically. To model the regression\nfunction between SAR intensity and ALS-predicted AGB we propose to utilise a\nconditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), i.e. the Pix2Pix\nconvolutional neural network. This enables the recreation of existing ALS-based\nAGB prediction maps. The generated synthesised ALS-based AGB predictions are\nevaluated qualitatively and quantitatively against ALS-based AGB predictions\nretrieved from a traditional non-sequential regression model trained in the\nsame area. Results show that the proposed architecture manages to capture\ncharacteristics of the actual data. This suggests that the use of ALS-guided\ngenerative models is a promising avenue for AGB prediction from SAR intensity.\nFurther research on this area has the potential of providing both large-scale\nand low-cost predictions of AGB.",

          "description": "Autonomous navigation in uninstrumented and unprepared environments is a\nfundamental demand for next generation indoor and outdoor location-based\nservices. To bring about such ambition, a suite of collaborative sensing\nmodalities is required in order to sustain performance irrespective of\nchallenging dynamic conditions. Of the many modalities on offer, inertial\ntracking plays a key role under momentary unfavourable operational conditions\nowing to its independence of the surrounding environment. However, inertial\ntracking has traditionally (i) suffered from excessive error growth and (ii)\nrequired extensive and cumbersome tuning. Both of these issues have limited the\nappeal and utility of inertial tracking. In this paper, we present DIT: a novel\nDeep learning Inertial Tracking system that overcomes prior limitations;\nnamely, by (i) significantly reducing tracking drift and (ii) seamlessly\nconstructing robust and generalisable learned models. DIT describes two core\ncontributions: (i) DIT employs a robotic platform augmented with a mechanical\nslider subsystem that automatically samples inertial signal variabilities\narising from different sensor mounting geometries. We use the platform to\ncurate in-house a 7.2 million sample dataset covering an aggregate distance of\n21 kilometres split into 11 indexed sensor mounting geometries. (ii) DIT uses\ndeep learning, optimal transport, and domain adaptation (DA) to create a model\nwhich is robust to variabilities in sensor mounting geometry. The overall\nsystem synthesises high-performance and generalisable inertial navigation\nmodels in an end-to-end, robotic-learning fashion. In our evaluation, DIT\noutperforms an industrial-grade sensor fusion baseline by 10x (90th percentile)\nand a state-of-the-art adversarial DA technique by > 2.5x in performance (90th\npercentile) and >10x in training time.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks often exhibit poor performance on data that is unlikely\nunder the train-time data distribution, for instance data affected by\ncorruptions. Previous works demonstrate that test-time adaptation to data\nshift, for instance using entropy minimization, effectively improves\nperformance on such shifted distributions. This paper focuses on the fully\ntest-time adaptation setting, where only unlabeled data from the target\ndistribution is required. This allows adapting arbitrary pretrained networks.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel loss that improves test-time adaptation by\naddressing both premature convergence and instability of entropy minimization.\nThis is achieved by replacing the entropy by a non-saturating surrogate and\nadding a diversity regularizer based on batch-wise entropy maximization that\nprevents convergence to trivial collapsed solutions. Moreover, we propose to\nprepend an input transformation module to the network that can partially undo\ntest-time distribution shifts. Surprisingly, this preprocessing can be learned\nsolely using the fully test-time adaptation loss in an end-to-end fashion\nwithout any target domain labels or source domain data.

However, recent work raised\nconcerns on these two methods: (1) their fixed points do not correspond to the\nstationary points of the original optimization problem, and (2) the common\nmodel found might not generalize well locally.\n\nIn this paper, we alleviate these concerns. Towards this, we adopt the\nstatistical learning perspective yet allow the distributions to be\nheterogeneous and the local data to be unbalanced. We show, in the general\nkernel regression setting, that both FedAvg and FedProx converge to the\nminimax-optimal error rates. Moreover, when the kernel function has a finite\nrank, the convergence is exponentially fast. Our results further analytically\nquantify the impact of the model heterogeneity and characterize the federation\ngain - the reduction of the estimation error for a worker to join the federated\nlearning compared to the best local estimator. To the best of our knowledge, we\nare the first to show the achievability of minimax error rates under FedAvg and\nFedProx, and the first to characterize the gains in joining FL.

In this setting, we show that the trajectory of\nthe gradient descent iterations from small random initialization can be\napproximately decomposed into three phases: (I) a spectral or alignment phase\nwhere we show that that the iterates have an implicit spectral bias akin to\nspectral initialization allowing us to show that at the end of this phase the\ncolumn space of the iterates and the underlying low-rank matrix are\nsufficiently aligned, (II) a saddle avoidance/refinement phase where we show\nthat the trajectory of the gradient iterates moves away from certain degenerate\nsaddle points, and (III) a local refinement phase where we show that after\navoiding the saddles the iterates converge quickly to the underlying low-rank\nmatrix. Underlying our analysis are insights for the analysis of\noverparameterized nonconvex optimization schemes that may have implications for\ncomputational problems beyond low-rank reconstruction.",

          "description": "Face recognition is greatly improved by deep convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs). Recently, these face recognition models have been used for identity\nauthentication in security sensitive applications. However, deep CNNs are\nvulnerable to adversarial patches, which are physically realizable and\nstealthy, raising new security concerns on the real-world applications of these\nmodels. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of face recognition models\nusing adversarial patches based on transferability, where the attacker has\nlimited accessibility to the target models. First, we extend the existing\ntransfer-based attack techniques to generate transferable adversarial patches.\nHowever, we observe that the transferability is sensitive to initialization and\ndegrades when the perturbation magnitude is large, indicating the overfitting\nto the substitute models. Second, we propose to regularize the adversarial\npatches on the low dimensional data manifold. The manifold is represented by\ngenerative models pre-trained on legitimate human face images. Using face-like\nfeatures as adversarial perturbations through optimization on the manifold, we\nshow that the gaps between the responses of substitute models and the target\nmodels dramatically decrease, exhibiting a better transferability. Extensive\ndigital world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed method in the black-box setting. We apply the proposed method in the\nphysical world as well.",

Despite their popularity, the\nliterature on two-stage recommenders is relatively scarce, and the algorithms\nare often treated as the sum of their parts. Such treatment presupposes that\nthe two-stage performance is explained by the behavior of individual components\nif they were deployed independently. This is not the case: using synthetic and\nreal-world data, we demonstrate that interactions between the ranker and the\nnominators substantially affect the overall performance. Motivated by these\nfindings, we derive a generalization lower bound which shows that careful\nchoice of each nominator's training set is sometimes the only difference\nbetween a poor and an optimal two-stage recommender. Since searching for a good\nchoice manually is difficult, we learn one instead.

In addition,\nour methods also give sharp lower bounds on the Kolmogorov $n$-widths of this\nconvex hull, which show that the variation spaces corresponding to shallow\nneural networks cannot be efficiently approximated by linear methods.

          "description": "Depth perception is fundamental for robots to understand the surrounding\nenvironment. As the view of cognitive neuroscience, visual depth perception\nmethods are divided into three categories, namely binocular, active, and\npictorial. The first two categories have been studied for decades in detail.\nHowever, research for the exploration of the third category is still in its\ninfancy and has got momentum by the advent of deep learning methods in recent\nyears. In cognitive neuroscience, it is known that pictorial depth perception\nmechanisms are dependent on the perception of seen objects. Inspired by this\nfact, in this thesis, we investigated the relation of perception of objects and\ndepth estimation convolutional neural networks. For this purpose, we developed\nnew network structures based on a simple depth estimation network that only\nused a single image at its input. Our proposed structures use both an image and\na semantic label of the image as their input. We used semantic labels as the\noutput of object perception. The obtained results of performance comparison\nbetween the developed network and original network showed that our novel\nstructures can improve the performance of depth estimation by 52\\% of relative\nerror of distance in the examined cases. Most of the experimental studies were\ncarried out on synthetic datasets that were generated by game engines to\nisolate the performance comparison from the effect of inaccurate depth and\nsemantic labels of non-synthetic datasets. It is shown that particular\nsynthetic datasets may be used for training of depth networks in cases that an\nappropriate dataset is not available. Furthermore, we showed that in these\ncases, usage of semantic labels improves the robustness of the network against\ndomain shift from synthetic training data to non-synthetic test data.",

          "description": "Over the last decade, the bandwidth expansion and MU-MIMO spectral efficiency\nhave promised to increase data throughput by allowing concurrent communication\nbetween one Access Point and multiple users. However, we are still a long way\nfrom enjoying such MU-MIMO MAC protocol improvements for bandwidth hungry\napplications such as video streaming in practical WiFi network settings due to\nheterogeneous channel conditions and devices, unreliable transmissions, and\nlack of useful feedback exchange among the lower and upper layers'\nrequirements. This paper introduces MuViS, a novel dual-phase optimization\nframework that proposes a Quality of Experience (QoE) aware MU-MIMO\noptimization for multi-user video streaming over IEEE 802.11ac. MuViS first\nemploys reinforcement learning to optimize the MU-MIMO user group and mode\nselection for users based on their PHY/MAC layer characteristics. The video\nbitrate is then optimized based on the user's mode (Multi-User (MU) or\nSingle-User (SU)). We present our design and its evaluation on smartphones and\nlaptops using 802.11ac WiFi. Our experimental results in various indoor\nenvironments and configurations show a scalable framework that can support a\nlarge number of users with streaming at high video rates and satisfying QoE\nrequirements.",

          "description": "Machine unlearning is the task of updating machine learning (ML) models after\na subset of the training data they were trained on is deleted. Methods for the\ntask are desired to combine effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., they should\neffectively \"unlearn\" deleted data, but in a way that does not require\nexcessive computation effort (e.g., a full retraining) for a small amount of\ndeletions. Such a combination is typically achieved by tolerating some amount\nof approximation in the unlearning. In addition, laws and regulations in the\nspirit of \"the right to be forgotten\" have given rise to requirements for\ncertifiability, i.e., the ability to demonstrate that the deleted data has\nindeed been unlearned by the ML model.\n\nIn this paper, we present an experimental study of the three state-of-the-art\napproximate unlearning methods for linear models and demonstrate the trade-offs\nbetween efficiency, effectiveness and certifiability offered by each method. In\nimplementing the study, we extend some of the existing works and describe a\ncommon ML pipeline to compare and evaluate the unlearning methods on six\nreal-world datasets and a variety of settings. We provide insights into the\neffect of the quantity and distribution of the deleted data on ML models and\nthe performance of each unlearning method in different settings.

For regression and other\nnumerical linear algebra related tasks, we consider the row arrival streaming\nmodel.

To the best of our\nknowledge, these are the first adversarially robust results for these problems\nyet require no new algorithmic implementations.

          "description": "Molecular graph generation is a fundamental but challenging task in various\napplications such as drug discovery and material science, which requires\ngenerating valid molecules with desired properties. Auto-regressive models,\nwhich usually construct graphs following sequential actions of adding nodes and\nedges at the atom-level, have made rapid progress in recent years. However,\nthese atom-level models ignore high-frequency subgraphs that not only capture\nthe regularities of atomic combination in molecules but also are often related\nto desired chemical properties. In this paper, we propose a method to\nautomatically discover such common substructures, which we call {\\em graph\npieces}, from given molecular graphs.

The keys to its success are the reliable policy updates\nthrough the clipping mechanism and the multiple epochs of minibatch updates.\nThe aim of this research is to give new simple but effective alternatives to\nthe former. For this, we propose linearly and exponentially decaying clipping\nrange approaches throughout the training. With these, we would like to provide\nhigher exploration at the beginning and stronger restrictions at the end of the\nlearning phase. We investigate their performance in several classical control\nand locomotive robotic environments. During the analysis, we found that they\ninfluence the achieved rewards and are effective alternatives to the constant\nclipping method in many reinforcement learning tasks.",

This system of equations can be solved with relative ease\nby the computational power of Wolfram Mathematica, where the obtained optimal\naction-values point to the optimal policy.

How many queries are needed to obtain a $1+\\epsilon$\nrelative error approximation of the optimum? While this problem has been\nextensively studied for least squares regression, little is known for other\nlosses. An important example is least absolute deviation regression ($\\ell_1$\nregression) which enjoys superior robustness to outliers compared to least\nsquares. We develop a new framework for analyzing importance sampling methods\nin regression problems, which enables us to show that the query complexity of\nleast absolute deviation regression is $\\Theta(d/\\epsilon^2)$ up to logarithmic\nfactors. We further extend our techniques to show the first bounds on the query\ncomplexity for any $\\ell_p$ loss with $p\\in(1,2)$. As a key novelty in our\nanalysis, we introduce the notion of robust uniform convergence, which is a new\napproximation guarantee for the empirical loss. While it is inspired by uniform\nconvergence in statistical learning, our approach additionally incorporates a\ncorrection term to avoid unnecessary variance due to outliers.

          "description": "Machine learning analysis of longitudinal neuroimaging data is typically\nbased on supervised learning, which requires a large number of ground-truth\nlabels to be informative. As ground-truth labels are often missing or expensive\nto obtain in neuroscience, we avoid them in our analysis by combing factor\ndisentanglement with self-supervised learning to identify changes and\nconsistencies across the multiple MRIs acquired of each individual over time.\nSpecifically, we propose a new definition of disentanglement by formulating a\nmultivariate mapping between factors (e.g., brain age) associated with an MRI\nand a latent image representation. Then, factors that evolve across\nacquisitions of longitudinal sequences are disentangled from that mapping by\nself-supervised learning in such a way that changes in a single factor induce\nchange along one direction in the representation space. We implement this\nmodel, named Longitudinal Self-Supervised Learning (LSSL), via a standard\nautoencoding structure with a cosine loss to disentangle brain age from the\nimage representation. We apply LSSL to two longitudinal neuroimaging studies to\nhighlight its strength in extracting the brain-age information from MRI and\nrevealing informative characteristics associated with neurodegenerative and\nneuropsychological disorders. Moreover, the representations learned by LSSL\nfacilitate supervised classification by recording faster convergence and higher\n(or similar) prediction accuracy compared to several other representation\nlearning techniques.",

          "description": "Signal processing, communications, and control have traditionally relied on\nclassical statistical modeling techniques. Such model-based methods utilize\nmathematical formulations that represent the underlying physics, prior\ninformation and additional domain knowledge. Simple classical models are useful\nbut sensitive to inaccuracies and may lead to poor performance when real\nsystems display complex or dynamic behavior. On the other hand, purely\ndata-driven approaches that are model-agnostic are becoming increasingly\npopular as datasets become abundant and the power of modern deep learning\npipelines increases. Deep neural networks (DNNs) use generic architectures\nwhich learn to operate from data, and demonstrate excellent performance,\nespecially for supervised problems. However, DNNs typically require massive\namounts of data and immense computational resources, limiting their\napplicability for some signal processing scenarios. We are interested in hybrid\ntechniques that combine principled mathematical models with data-driven systems\nto benefit from the advantages of both approaches. Such model-based deep\nlearning methods exploit both partial domain knowledge, via mathematical\nstructures designed for specific problems, as well as learning from limited\ndata. In this article we survey the leading approaches for studying and\ndesigning model-based deep learning systems. We divide hybrid\nmodel-based/data-driven systems into categories based on their inference\nmechanism. We provide a comprehensive review of the leading approaches for\ncombining model-based algorithms with deep learning in a systematic manner,\nalong with concrete guidelines and detailed signal processing oriented examples\nfrom recent literature.

          "description": "Graph neural networks have been widely used on modeling graph data, achieving\nimpressive results on node classification and link prediction tasks. Yet,\nobtaining an accurate representation for a graph further requires a pooling\nfunction that maps a set of node representations into a compact form. A simple\nsum or average over all node representations considers all node features\nequally without consideration of their task relevance, and any structural\ndependencies among them. Recently proposed hierarchical graph pooling methods,\non the other hand, may yield the same representation for two different graphs\nthat are distinguished by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, as they suboptimally\npreserve information from the node features. To tackle these limitations of\nexisting graph pooling methods, we first formulate the graph pooling problem as\na multiset encoding problem with auxiliary information about the graph\nstructure, and propose a Graph Multiset Transformer (GMT) which is a multi-head\nattention based global pooling layer that captures the interaction between\nnodes according to their structural dependencies. We show that GMT satisfies\nboth injectiveness and permutation invariance, such that it is at most as\npowerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. Moreover, our methods\ncan be easily extended to the previous node clustering approaches for\nhierarchical graph pooling. Our experimental results show that GMT\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph\nclassification benchmarks with high memory and time efficiency, and obtains\neven larger performance gain on graph reconstruction and generation tasks.",

Graph similarity computation for metrics such\nas Graph Edit Distance (GED) is typically NP-hard, and existing\nheuristics-based algorithms usually achieves a unsatisfactory trade-off between\naccuracy and efficiency. Recently the development of deep learning techniques\nprovides a promising solution for this problem by a data-driven approach which\ntrains a network to encode graphs to their own feature vectors and computes\nsimilarity based on feature vectors. These deep-learning methods can be\nclassified to two categories, embedding models and matching models. Embedding\nmodels such as GCN-Mean and GCN-Max, which directly map graphs to respective\nfeature vectors, run faster but the performance is usually poor due to the lack\nof interactions across graphs. Matching models such as GMN, whose encoding\nprocess involves interaction across the two graphs, are more accurate but\ninteraction between whole graphs brings a significant increase in time\nconsumption (at least quadratic time complexity over number of nodes). Inspired\nby large biological molecular identification where the whole molecular is first\nmapped to functional groups and then identified based on these functional\ngroups, our \"embedding-coarsening-matching\" learning framework first embeds and\ncoarsens large graphs to coarsened graphs with denser local topology and then\nmatching mechanism is deployed on the coarsened graphs for the final similarity\nscores.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of generalized few-shot\nlearning (GFSL) -- a model during the deployment is required to learn about\ntail categories with few shots and simultaneously classify the head classes. We\npropose the ClAssifier SynThesis LEarning (CASTLE), a learning framework that\nlearns how to synthesize calibrated few-shot classifiers in addition to the\nmulti-class classifiers of head classes with a shared neural dictionary,\nshedding light upon the inductive GFSL. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive\nversion of CASTLE (ACASTLE) that adapts the head classifiers conditioned on the\nincoming tail training examples, yielding a framework that allows effective\nbackward knowledge transfer. As a consequence, ACASTLE can handle GFSL with\nclasses from heterogeneous domains effectively. CASTLE and ACASTLE demonstrate\nsuperior performances than existing GFSL algorithms and strong baselines on\nMiniImageNet as well as TieredImageNet datasets. More interestingly, they\noutperform previous state-of-the-art methods when evaluated with standard\nfew-shot learning criteria.",

          "description": "Although achieving remarkable progress, it is very difficult to induce a\nsupervised classifier without any labeled data. Unsupervised domain adaptation\nis able to overcome this challenge by transferring knowledge from a labeled\nsource domain to an unlabeled target domain. Transferability and\ndiscriminability are two key criteria for characterizing the superiority of\nfeature representations to enable successful domain adaptation. In this paper,\na novel method called \\textit{learning TransFerable and Discriminative Features\nfor unsupervised domain adaptation} (TFDF) is proposed to optimize these two\nobjectives simultaneously. On the one hand, distribution alignment is performed\nto reduce domain discrepancy and learn more transferable representations.\nInstead of adopting \\textit{Maximum Mean Discrepancy} (MMD) which only captures\nthe first-order statistical information to measure distribution discrepancy, we\nadopt a recently proposed statistic called \\textit{Maximum Mean and Covariance\nDiscrepancy} (MMCD), which can not only capture the first-order statistical\ninformation but also capture the second-order statistical information in the\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). On the other hand, we propose to\nexplore both local discriminative information via manifold regularization and\nglobal discriminative information via minimizing the proposed \\textit{class\nconfusion} objective to learn more discriminative features, respectively. We\nintegrate these two objectives into the \\textit{Structural Risk Minimization}\n(RSM) framework and learn a domain-invariant classifier. Comprehensive\nexperiments are conducted on five real-world datasets and the results verify\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method.",

While making a\nprediction, the human brain tends to relate crucial cues from multiple sources\nof information. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal fusion module that\nlearns to emphasize more contributive features across all modalities.\nSpecifically, the proposed Multimodal Split Attention Fusion (MSAF) module\nsplits each modality into channel-wise equal feature blocks and creates a joint\nrepresentation that is used to generate soft attention for each channel across\nthe feature blocks. Further, the MSAF module is designed to be compatible with\nfeatures of various spatial dimensions and sequence lengths, suitable for both\nCNNs and RNNs. Thus, MSAF can be easily added to fuse features of any unimodal\nnetworks and utilize existing pretrained unimodal model weights. To demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our fusion module, we design three multimodal networks\nwith MSAF for emotion recognition, sentiment analysis, and action recognition\ntasks. Our approach achieves competitive results in each task and outperforms\nother application-specific networks and multimodal fusion benchmarks.",

The algorithms have two components: a\nscoring metric and a search procedure. The scoring metric takes a network\nstructure, statistical data, and a user's prior knowledge, and returns a score\nproportional to the posterior probability of the network structure given the\ndata. The search procedure generates networks for evaluation by the scoring\nmetric. Previous work has concentrated on metrics for domains containing only\ndiscrete variables, under the assumption that data represents a multinomial\nsample. In this paper, we extend this work, developing scoring metrics for\ndomains containing all continuous variables or a mixture of discrete and\ncontinuous variables, under the assumption that continuous data is sampled from\na multivariate normal distribution. Our work extends traditional statistical\napproaches for identifying vanishing regression coefficients in that we\nidentify two important assumptions, called event equivalence and parameter\nmodularity, that when combined allow the construction of prior distributions\nfor multivariate normal parameters from a single prior Bayesian network\nspecified by a user.",

In this paper, we propose an\nEntropy-Based Convolutional Layer Estimation (EBCLE) heuristic which is robust\nand simple, yet effective in resolving the problem of over-parameterization\nwith regards to network depth of CNN model. The EBCLE heuristic employs a\npriori knowledge of the entropic data distribution of input datasets to\ndetermine an upper bound for convolutional network depth, beyond which identity\ntransformations are prevalent offering insignificant contributions for\nenhancing model performance. Restricting depth redundancies by forcing feature\ncompression and abstraction restricts over-parameterization while decreasing\ntraining time by 24.99% - 78.59% without degradation in model performance. We\npresent empirical evidence to emphasize the relative effectiveness of broader,\nyet shallower models trained using the EBCLE heuristic, which maintains or\noutperforms baseline classification accuracies of narrower yet deeper models.\nThe EBCLE heuristic is architecturally agnostic and EBCLE based CNN models\nrestrict depth redundancies resulting in enhanced utilization of the available\ncomputational resources. The proposed EBCLE heuristic is a compelling technique\nfor researchers to analytically justify their HyperParameter (HP) choices for\nCNNs. Empirical validation of the EBCLE heuristic in training CNN models was\nestablished on five benchmarking datasets (ImageNet32, CIFAR-10/100, STL-10,\nMNIST) and four network architectures (DenseNet, ResNet, ResNeXt and\nEfficientNet B0-B2) with appropriate statistical tests employed to infer any\nconclusive claims presented in this paper.",

The CPC-R algorithm presented in this chapter converts\nnon-image data into images by visualizing non-image data. Then deep learning\nCNN algorithms solve the learning problems on these images. The design of the\nCPC-R algorithm allows preserving all high-dimensional information in 2-D\nimages. The use of pair values mapping instead of single value mapping used in\nthe alternative approaches allows encoding each n-D point with 2 times fewer\nvisual elements. The attributes of an n-D point are divided into pairs of its\nvalues and each pair is visualized as 2-D points in the same 2-D Cartesian\ncoordinates. Next, grey scale or color intensity values are assigned to each\npair to encode the order of pairs. This is resulted in the heatmap image.

Using\nStochastic Mirror Descent algorithm as a building block, we develop a\nmultistage procedure for recovery of sparse solutions to Stochastic\nOptimization problem under assumption of smoothness and quadratic minoration on\nthe expected objective. An interesting feature of the proposed algorithm is\nlinear convergence of the approximate solution during the preliminary phase of\nthe routine when the component of stochastic error in the gradient observation\nwhich is due to bad initial approximation of the optimal solution is larger\nthan the \"ideal\" asymptotic error component owing to observation noise \"at the\noptimal solution.\" We also show how one can straightforwardly enhance\nreliability of the corresponding solution by using Median-of-Means like\ntechniques.\n\nWe illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms in application to\nclassical problems of recovery of sparse and low rank signals in linear\nregression framework. We show, under rather weak assumption on the regressor\nand noise distributions, how they lead to parameter estimates which obey (up to\nfactors which are logarithmic in problem dimension and confidence level) the\nbest known to us accuracy bounds.",

However, deep learning-based wind power\nforecasting studies have not investigated two aspects.

In the second stage, the model extrapolation issue has\nnot been investigated. Therefore, we develop four deep neural networks for the\nfirst stage to learn data features considering the input-and-output structure.\nWe then explore the model extrapolation issue in the second stage using\ndifferent modeling methods. Considering the overfitting issue, we propose a new\nmoving window-based algorithm using a validation set in the first stage to\nupdate the training data in both stages with two different moving window\nprocesses.Experiments were conducted at three wind farms, and the results\ndemonstrate that the model with single input multiple output structure obtains\nbetter forecasting accuracy compared to existing models.

          "description": "Training large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs) currently requires a\nsignificant amount of energy, leading to serious environmental impacts. One\npromising approach to reduce the energy costs is representing DNNs with\nlow-precision numbers. While it is common to train DNNs with forward and\nbackward propagation in low-precision, training directly over low-precision\nweights, without keeping a copy of weights in high-precision, still remains to\nbe an unsolved problem. This is due to complex interactions between learning\nalgorithms and low-precision number systems. To address this, we jointly design\na low-precision training framework involving a logarithmic number system (LNS)\nand a multiplicative weight update training method, termed LNS-Madam. LNS has a\nhigh dynamic range even in a low-bitwidth setting, leading to high energy\nefficiency and making it relevant for on-board training in energy-constrained\nedge devices. We design LNS to have the flexibility of choosing different bases\nfor weights and gradients, as they usually require different quantization gaps\nand dynamic ranges during training. By drawing the connection between LNS and\nmultiplicative update, LNS-Madam ensures low quantization error during weight\nupdate, leading to a stable convergence even if the bitwidth is limited.\nCompared to using a fixed-point or floating-point number system and training\nwith popular learning algorithms such as SGD and Adam, our joint design with\nLNS and LNS-Madam optimizer achieves better accuracy while requiring smaller\nbitwidth. Notably, with only 5-bit for gradients, the proposed training\nframework achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision state-of-the-art\nmodels such as ResNet-50 and BERT. After conducting energy estimations by\nanalyzing the math datapath units during training, the results show that our\ndesign achieves over 60x energy reduction compared to FP32 on BERT models.",

In this paper, we propose two\nnovel architectural techniques for building INR-based image decoders:\nfactorized multiplicative modulation and multi-scale INRs, and use them to\nbuild a state-of-the-art continuous image GAN. Previous attempts to adapt INRs\nfor image generation were limited to MNIST-like datasets and do not scale to\ncomplex real-world data.

          "description": "Normalizing flows are among the most popular paradigms in generative\nmodeling, especially for images, primarily because we can efficiently evaluate\nthe likelihood of a data point. This is desirable both for evaluating the fit\nof a model, and for ease of training, as maximizing the likelihood can be done\nby gradient descent. However, training normalizing flows comes with\ndifficulties as well: models which produce good samples typically need to be\nextremely deep -- which comes with accompanying vanishing/exploding gradient\nproblems. A very related problem is that they are often poorly conditioned:\nsince they are parametrized as invertible maps from $\\mathbb{R}^d \\to\n\\mathbb{R}^d$, and typical training data like images intuitively is\nlower-dimensional, the learned maps often have Jacobians that are close to\nbeing singular.\n\nIn our paper, we tackle representational aspects around depth and\nconditioning of normalizing flows: both for general invertible architectures,\nand for a particular common architecture, affine couplings. We prove that\n$\\Theta(1)$ affine coupling layers suffice to exactly represent a permutation\nor $1 \\times 1$ convolution, as used in GLOW, showing that representationally\nthe choice of partition is not a bottleneck for depth. We also show that\nshallow affine coupling networks are universal approximators in Wasserstein\ndistance if ill-conditioning is allowed, and experimentally investigate related\nphenomena involving padding.

          "description": "The multivariate Bayesian structural time series (MBSTS) model\n\\citep{qiu2018multivariate,Jammalamadaka2019Predicting} as a generalized\nversion of many structural time series models, deals with inference and\nprediction for multiple correlated time series, where one also has the choice\nof using a different candidate pool of contemporaneous predictors for each\ntarget series. The MBSTS model has wide applications and is ideal for feature\nselection, time series forecasting, nowcasting, inferring causal impact, and\nothers. This paper demonstrates how to use the R package \\pkg{mbsts} for MBSTS\nmodeling, establishing a bridge between user-friendly and developer-friendly\nfunctions in package and the corresponding methodology. A simulated dataset and\nobject-oriented functions in the \\pkg{mbsts} package are explained in the way\nthat enables users to flexibly add or deduct some components, as well as to\nsimplify or complicate some settings.",

          "description": "The trend towards larger wind turbines and remote locations of wind farms\nfuels the demand for automated condition monitoring strategies that can reduce\nthe operating cost and avoid unplanned downtime. Normal behaviour modelling has\nbeen introduced to detect anomalous deviations from normal operation based on\nthe turbine's SCADA data. A growing number of machine learning models of the\nnormal behaviour of turbine subsystems are being developed by wind farm\nmanagers to this end. However, these models need to be kept track of, be\nmaintained and require frequent updates. This research explores multi-target\nmodels as a new approach to capturing a wind turbine's normal behaviour. We\npresent an overview of multi-target regression methods, motivate their\napplication and benefits in wind turbine condition monitoring, and assess their\nperformance in a wind farm case study. We find that multi-target models are\nadvantageous in comparison to single-target modelling in that they can reduce\nthe cost and effort of practical condition monitoring without compromising on\nthe accuracy. We also outline some areas of future research.",

However, measuring progress in the field has been\nchallenging due to the lack of realistic retrospective benchmarks, and the\nlarge cost of prospective validation. To close this gap, we propose a benchmark\nbased on docking, a popular computational method for assessing molecule binding\nto a protein. Concretely, the goal is to generate drug-like molecules that are\nscored highly by SMINA, a popular docking software. We observe that popular\ngraph-based generative models fail to generate molecules with a high docking\nscore when trained using a realistically sized training set. This suggests a\nlimitation of the current incarnation of models for de novo drug design.\nFinally, we propose a simplified version of the benchmark based on a simpler\nscoring function, and show that the tested models are able to partially solve\nit.

First, we present a\nnovel probabilistic autoregressive architecture that models the distribution\nover future poses with a normalizing flow conditioned on previous poses as well\nas music context, using a multimodal transformer encoder.

          "description": "In this paper, we are concerned with differentially private {stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD)} algorithms in the setting of stochastic convex\noptimization (SCO). Most of the existing work requires the loss to be Lipschitz\ncontinuous and strongly smooth, and the model parameter to be uniformly\nbounded. However, these assumptions are restrictive as many popular losses\nviolate these conditions including the hinge loss for SVM, the absolute loss in\nrobust regression, and even the least square loss in an unbounded domain. We\nsignificantly relax these restrictive assumptions and establish privacy and\ngeneralization (utility) guarantees for private SGD algorithms using output and\ngradient perturbations associated with non-smooth convex losses. Specifically,\nthe loss function is relaxed to have an $\\alpha$-H\\\"{o}lder continuous gradient\n(referred to as $\\alpha$-H\\\"{o}lder smoothness) which instantiates the\nLipschitz continuity ($\\alpha=0$) and the strong smoothness ($\\alpha=1$). We\nprove that noisy SGD with $\\alpha$-H\\\"older smooth losses using gradient\nperturbation can guarantee $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) and\nattain optimal excess population risk\n$\\mathcal{O}\\Big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d\\log(1/\\delta)}}{n\\epsilon}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\Big)$,\nup to logarithmic terms, with the gradient complexity $ \\mathcal{O}(\nn^{2-\\alpha\\over 1+\\alpha}+ n).$ This shows an important trade-off between\n$\\alpha$-H\\\"older smoothness of the loss and the computational complexity for\nprivate SGD with statistically optimal performance. In particular, our results\nindicate that $\\alpha$-H\\\"older smoothness with $\\alpha\\ge {1/2}$ is sufficient\nto guarantee $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP of noisy SGD algorithms while achieving\noptimal excess risk with the linear gradient complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n).$",

Yet, in many scenarios this\napproach is overly conservative, especially for \"typical\" data points which\nincur little privacy loss by participation in most of the analyses.

A filter is a tool that ensures that the privacy parameter of a\ncomposed sequence of algorithms with adaptively-chosen privacy parameters does\nnot exceed a pre-specified budget. Our filter is simpler and tighter than the\nknown filter for $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy by Rogers et al.

          "description": "Deep equilibrium networks (DEQs) are a new class of models that eschews\ntraditional depth in favor of finding the fixed point of a single nonlinear\nlayer. These models have been shown to achieve performance competitive with the\nstate-of-the-art deep networks while using significantly less memory. Yet they\nare also slower, brittle to architectural choices, and introduce potential\ninstability to the model. In this paper, we propose a regularization scheme for\nDEQ models that explicitly regularizes the Jacobian of the fixed-point update\nequations to stabilize the learning of equilibrium models. We show that this\nregularization adds only minimal computational cost, significantly stabilizes\nthe fixed-point convergence in both forward and backward passes, and scales\nwell to high-dimensional, realistic domains (e.g., WikiText-103 language\nmodeling and ImageNet classification). Using this method, we demonstrate, for\nthe first time, an implicit-depth model that runs with approximately the same\nspeed and level of performance as popular conventional deep networks such as\nResNet-101, while still maintaining the constant memory footprint and\narchitectural simplicity of DEQs.

          "description": "It is well known that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to\nadversarial examples, in which great efforts have been made to improve the\nrobustness. However, such examples are usually imperceptible to humans, and\nthus their effect on biological neural circuits is largely unknown. This paper\nwill investigate the adversarial robustness in a simulated cerebellum, a\nwell-studied supervised learning system in computational neuroscience.\nSpecifically, we propose to study three unique characteristics revealed in the\ncerebellum: (i) network width; (ii) long-term depression on the parallel\nfiber-Purkinje cell synapses; (iii) sparse connectivity in the granule layer,\nand hypothesize that they will be beneficial for improving robustness. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to examine the adversarial\nrobustness in simulated cerebellum models.\n\nThe results are negative in the experimental phase -- no significant\nimprovements in robustness are discovered from the proposed three mechanisms.\nConsequently, the cerebellum is expected to be vulnerable to adversarial\nexamples as the deep neural networks under batch training. Neuroscientists are\nencouraged to fool the biological system in experiments with adversarial\nattacks.",

          "description": "The common practice of quality monitoring in industry relies on manual\ninspection well-known to be slow, error-prone and operator-dependent. This\nissue raises strong demand for automated real-time quality monitoring developed\nfrom data-driven approaches thus alleviating from operator dependence and\nadapting to various process uncertainties. Nonetheless, current approaches do\nnot take into account the streaming nature of sensory information while relying\nheavily on hand-crafted features making them application-specific. This paper\nproposes the online quality monitoring methodology developed from recently\ndeveloped deep learning algorithms for data streams, Neural Networks with\nDynamically Evolved Capacity (NADINE), namely NADINE++. It features the\nintegration of 1-D and 2-D convolutional layers to extract natural features of\ntime-series and visual data streams captured from sensors and cameras of the\ninjection molding machines from our own project. Real-time experiments have\nbeen conducted where the online quality monitoring task is simulated on the fly\nunder the prequential test-then-train fashion - the prominent data stream\nevaluation protocol. Comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques clearly\nexhibits the advantage of NADINE++ with 4.68\\% improvement on average for the\nquality monitoring task in streaming environments.

[2020]: given a set of\npoints $P$ of size $n$, a set of $k$ centers induces a fair clustering if for\nevery point $v\\in P$, $v$ can find a center among its $n/k$ closest neighbors.\nRecently, Mahabadi and Vakilian [2020] showed how to get a\n$(p^{O(p)},7)$-bicriteria approximation for the problem of fair $k$-clustering\nwith $\\ell_p$-norm cost: every point finds a center within distance at most $7$\ntimes its distance to its $(n/k)$-th closest neighbor and the $\\ell_p$-norm\ncost of the solution is at most $p^{O(p)}$ times the cost of an optimal fair\nsolution. In this work, for any $\\varepsilon>0$, we present an improved $(16^p\n+\\varepsilon,3)$-bicriteria approximation for the fair $k$-clustering with\n$\\ell_p$-norm cost. To achieve our guarantees, we extend the framework of\n[Charikar et al., 2002, Swamy, 2016] and devise a $16^p$-approximation\nalgorithm for the facility location with $\\ell_p$-norm cost under matroid\nconstraint which might be of an independent interest.

Gravitational interferometers such as the LIGO detectors\ncapture cosmic events such as black hole mergers which happen at unknown times\nand of varying durations, producing time-series data. We have developed a new\narchitecture capable of accelerating RNN inference for analyzing time-series\ndata from LIGO detectors. This architecture is based on optimizing the\ninitiation intervals (II) in a multi-layer LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)\nnetwork, by identifying appropriate reuse factors for each layer. A\ncustomizable template for this architecture has been designed, which enables\nthe generation of low-latency FPGA designs with efficient resource utilization\nusing high-level synthesis tools. The proposed approach has been evaluated\nbased on two LSTM models, targeting a ZYNQ 7045 FPGA and a U250 FPGA.\nExperimental results show that with balanced II, the number of DSPs can be\nreduced up to 42% while achieving the same IIs.

          "description": "Learning guarantees often rely on assumptions of i.i.d. data, which will\nlikely be violated in practice once predictors are deployed to perform\nreal-world tasks. Domain adaptation approaches thus appeared as a useful\nframework yielding extra flexibility in that distinct train and test data\ndistributions are supported, provided that other assumptions are satisfied such\nas covariate shift, which expects the conditional distributions over labels to\nbe independent of the underlying data distribution. Several approaches were\nintroduced in order to induce generalization across varying train and test data\nsources, and those often rely on the general idea of domain-invariance, in such\na way that the data-generating distributions are to be disregarded by the\nprediction model. In this contribution, we tackle the problem of generalizing\nacross data sources by approaching it from the opposite direction: we consider\na conditional modeling approach in which predictions, in addition to being\ndependent on the input data, use information relative to the underlying\ndata-generating distribution. For instance, the model has an explicit mechanism\nto adapt to changing environments and/or new data sources. We argue that such\nan approach is more generally applicable than current domain adaptation methods\nsince it does not require extra assumptions such as covariate shift and further\nyields simpler training algorithms that avoid a common source of training\ninstabilities caused by minimax formulations, often employed in\ndomain-invariant methods.",

          "description": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a fundamental role in modeling and\nsimulating problems across a wide range of disciplines. Recent advances in deep\nlearning have shown the great potential of physics-informed neural networks\n(PINNs) to solve PDEs as a basis for data-driven modeling and inverse analysis.\nHowever, the majority of existing PINN methods, based on fully-connected NNs,\npose intrinsic limitations to low-dimensional spatiotemporal parameterizations.\nMoreover, since the initial/boundary conditions (I/BCs) are softly imposed via\npenalty, the solution quality heavily relies on hyperparameter tuning. To this\nend, we propose the novel physics-informed convolutional-recurrent learning\narchitectures (PhyCRNet and PhyCRNet-s) for solving PDEs without any labeled\ndata. Specifically, an encoder-decoder convolutional long short-term memory\nnetwork is proposed for low-dimensional spatial feature extraction and temporal\nevolution learning. The loss function is defined as the aggregated discretized\nPDE residuals, while the I/BCs are hard-encoded in the network to ensure\nforcible satisfaction (e.g., periodic boundary padding). The networks are\nfurther enhanced by autoregressive and residual connections that explicitly\nsimulate time marching. The performance of our proposed methods has been\nassessed by solving three nonlinear PDEs (e.g., 2D Burgers' equations, the\n$\\lambda$-$\\omega$ and FitzHugh Nagumo reaction-diffusion equations), and\ncompared against the start-of-the-art baseline algorithms.

Simply storing an indicator\ntensor for all relationships is already intractable for moderately sized $n$,\nprompting previous approaches to restrict the number of vertices a hyperedge\nconnects.

We leverage the property that most hypergraphs of interest are\nsparsely connected and reduce the memory requirement to $\\mathcal{O}(nk)$,\nwhere $k$ is the maximum number of positive edges, i.e., edges that actually\nexist. In order to counteract the linearly growing memory cost from training a\nlengthening sequence of refinement steps, we further propose an algorithm that\napplies backpropagation through time on randomly sampled subsequences.

In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Busemann Learning.\nThe main idea behind our approach is to position prototypes on the ideal\nboundary of the Poincare ball, which does not require prior label knowledge. To\nbe able to compute proximities to ideal prototypes, we introduce the penalised\nBusemann loss. We provide theory supporting the use of ideal prototypes and the\nproposed loss by proving its equivalence to logistic regression in the\none-dimensional case.

          "description": "As people spend up to 87% of their time indoors, intelligent Heating,\nVentilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings are essential for\nmaintaining occupant comfort and reducing energy consumption. Those HVAC\nsystems in modern smart buildings rely on real-time sensor readings, which in\npractice often suffer from various faults and could also be vulnerable to\nmalicious attacks. Such faulty sensor inputs may lead to the violation of\nindoor environment requirements (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) and the\nincrease of energy consumption. While many model-based approaches have been\nproposed in the literature for building HVAC control, it is costly to develop\naccurate physical models for ensuring their performance and even more\nchallenging to address the impact of sensor faults. In this work, we present a\nnovel learning-based framework for sensor fault-tolerant HVAC control, which\nincludes three deep learning based components for 1) generating temperature\nproposals with the consideration of possible sensor faults, 2) selecting one of\nthe proposals based on the assessment of their accuracy, and 3) applying\nreinforcement learning with the selected temperature proposal. Moreover, to\naddress the challenge of training data insufficiency in building-related tasks,\nwe propose a model-assisted learning method leveraging an abstract model of\nbuilding physical dynamics. Through extensive numerical experiments, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed fault-tolerant HVAC control framework can\nsignificantly reduce building temperature violations under a variety of sensor\nfault patterns while maintaining energy efficiency.",

For each halfspace $h \\in \\mathcal{H}_d$\ndefine a function $\\Phi(h)$ that measures the \"difference\" between the fraction\nof red and fraction of blue points which fall in the range $h$.

Using by-target, users would provide input tables (e.g., csv or json\nfiles), and point us to a \"target table\" (e.g., an existing database table or\nBI dashboard) to demonstrate how the output from the desired pipeline would\nschematically \"look like\". While the problem is seemingly underspecified, our\nunique insight is that implicit table constraints such as FDs and keys can be\nexploited to significantly constrain the space to make the problem tractable.\nWe develop an Auto-Pipeline system that learns to synthesize pipelines using\nreinforcement learning and search.

          "description": "We develop and study new adversarial perturbations that enable an attacker to\ngain control over decisions in generic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems\nincluding deep learning neural networks. In contrast to adversarial data\nmodification, the attack mechanism we consider here involves alterations to the\nAI system itself. Such a stealth attack could be conducted by a mischievous,\ncorrupt or disgruntled member of a software development team. It could also be\nmade by those wishing to exploit a \"democratization of AI\" agenda, where\nnetwork architectures and trained parameter sets are shared publicly. Building\non work by [Tyukin et al., International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,\n2020], we develop a range of new implementable attack strategies with\naccompanying analysis, showing that with high probability a stealth attack can\nbe made transparent, in the sense that system performance is unchanged on a\nfixed validation set which is unknown to the attacker, while evoking any\ndesired output on a trigger input of interest. The attacker only needs to have\nestimates of the size of the validation set and the spread of the AI's relevant\nlatent space. In the case of deep learning neural networks, we show that a one\nneuron attack is possible - a modification to the weights and bias associated\nwith a single neuron - revealing a vulnerability arising from\nover-parameterization. We illustrate these concepts in a realistic setting.\nGuided by the theory and computational results, we also propose strategies to\nguard against stealth attacks.",

Its interpretation and classification includes\nan initial evaluation of swallow-level outcomes and then derivation of a\nstudy-level diagnosis based on Chicago Classification (CC), using a tree-like\nalgorithm. This diagnostic approach on motility disordered using HRM was\nmirrored using a multi-stage modeling framework developed using a combination\nof various machine learning approaches. Specifically, the framework includes\ndeep-learning models at the swallow-level stage and feature-based machine\nlearning models at the study-level stage. In the swallow-level stage, three\nmodels based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed to predict\nswallow type, swallow pressurization, and integrated relaxation pressure (IRP).\nAt the study-level stage, model selection from families of the\nexpert-knowledge-based rule models, xgboost models and artificial neural\nnetwork(ANN) models were conducted, with the latter two model designed and\naugmented with motivation from the export knowledge. A simple model-agnostic\nstrategy of model balancing motivated by Bayesian principles was utilized,\nwhich gave rise to model averaging weighted by precision scores. The averaged\n(blended) models and individual models were compared and evaluated, of which\nthe best performance on test dataset is 0.81 in top-1 prediction, 0.92 in top-2\npredictions. This is the first artificial-intelligence-style model to\nautomatically predict CC diagnosis of HRM study from raw multi-swallow data.\nMoreover, the proposed modeling framework could be easily extended to\nmulti-modal tasks, such as diagnosis of esophageal patients based on clinical\ndata from both HRM and functional luminal imaging probe panometry (FLIP).",

          "description": "We propose a method to estimate the uncertainty of the outcome of an image\nclassifier on a given input datum. Deep neural networks commonly used for image\nclassification are deterministic maps from an input image to an output class.\nAs such, their outcome on a given datum involves no uncertainty, so we must\nspecify what variability we are referring to when defining, measuring and\ninterpreting \"confidence.\" To this end, we introduce the Wellington Posterior,\nwhich is the distribution of outcomes that would have been obtained in response\nto data that could have been generated by the same scene that produced the\ngiven image. Since there are infinitely many scenes that could have generated\nthe given image, the Wellington Posterior requires induction from scenes other\nthan the one portrayed. We explore alternate methods using data augmentation,\nensembling, and model linearization. Additional alternatives include generative\nadversarial networks, conditional prior networks, and supervised single-view\nreconstruction. We test these alternatives against the empirical posterior\nobtained by inferring the class of temporally adjacent frames in a video. These\ndevelopments are only a small step towards assessing the reliability of deep\nnetwork classifiers in a manner that is compatible with safety-critical\napplications.",

          "description": "Variation Autoencoder (VAE) has become a powerful tool in modeling the\nnon-linear generative process of data from a low-dimensional latent space.\nRecently, several studies have proposed to use VAE for unsupervised clustering\nby using mixture models to capture the multi-modal structure of latent\nrepresentations. This strategy, however, is ineffective when there are outlier\ndata samples whose latent representations are meaningless, yet contaminating\nthe estimation of key major clusters in the latent space. This exact problem\narises in the context of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) analysis, where\nclustering major functional connectivity patterns is often hindered by heavy\nnoise of rs-fMRI and many minor clusters (rare connectivity patterns) of no\ninterest to analysis. In this paper we propose a novel generative process, in\nwhich we use a Gaussian-mixture to model a few major clusters in the data, and\nuse a non-informative uniform distribution to capture the remaining data. We\nembed this truncated Gaussian-Mixture model in a Variational AutoEncoder\nframework to obtain a general joint clustering and outlier detection approach,\ncalled tGM-VAE. We demonstrated the applicability of tGM-VAE on the MNIST\ndataset and further validated it in the context of rs-fMRI connectivity\nanalysis.",

          "description": "A basic requirement for a mathematical model is often that its solution\n(output) shouldn't change much if the model's parameters (input) are perturbed.\nThis is important because the exact values of parameters may not be known and\none would like to avoid being mislead by an output obtained using incorrect\nvalues. Thus, it's rarely enough to address an application by formulating a\nmodel, solving the resulting optimization problem and presenting the solution\nas the answer. One would need to confirm that the model is suitable, i.e.,\n\"good,\" and this can, at least in part, be achieved by considering a family of\noptimization problems constructed by perturbing parameters of concern. The\nresulting sensitivity analysis uncovers troubling situations with unstable\nsolutions, which we referred to as \"bad\" models, and indicates better model\nformulations. Embedding an actual problem of interest within a family of\nproblems is also a primary path to optimality conditions as well as\ncomputationally attractive, alternative problems, which under ideal\ncircumstances, and when properly tuned, may even furnish the minimum value of\nthe actual problem. The tuning of these alternative problems turns out to be\nintimately tied to finding multipliers in optimality conditions and thus\nemerges as a main component of several optimization algorithms. In fact, the\ntuning amounts to solving certain dual optimization problems. In this tutorial,\nwe'll discuss the opportunities and insights afforded by this broad\nperspective.",

          "description": "In multi-party collaborative learning, the parameter server sends a global\nmodel to each data holder for local training and then aggregates committed\nmodels globally to achieve privacy protection. However, both the dragger issue\nof synchronous collaborative learning and the staleness issue of asynchronous\ncollaborative learning make collaborative learning inefficient in real-world\nheterogeneous environments. We propose a novel and efficient collaborative\nlearning framework named AdaptCL, which generates an adaptive sub-model\ndynamically from the global base model for each data holder, without any prior\ninformation about worker capability. All workers (data holders) achieve\napproximately identical update time as the fastest worker by equipping them\nwith capability-adapted pruned models. Thus the training process can be\ndramatically accelerated. Besides, we tailor the efficient pruned rate learning\nalgorithm and pruning approach for AdaptCL. Meanwhile, AdaptCL provides a\nmechanism for handling the trade-off between accuracy and time overhead and can\nbe combined with other techniques to accelerate training further. Empirical\nresults show that AdaptCL introduces little computing and communication\noverhead. AdaptCL achieves time savings of more than 41\\% on average and\nimproves accuracy in a low heterogeneous environment.

We propose an algorithm inspired by so-called model-based\noptimization (MBO) [35, 36], which replaces a non-convex objective with a\nconvex model function and alternates between optimizing the model function and\nupdating the solution. We apply this to robust regression, proposing SADM, a\nstochastic variant of the Online Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(OADM) [50] to solve the inner optimization in MBO. We show that SADM converges\nwith the rate O(log T/T).

However, many of the\nexisting methods of OSR only makes a binary decision, i.e., they only identify\nthe existence of the unknown class. Hence, such methods cannot distinguish test\ninstances belonging to incremental unseen classes. On the other hand, the\nmajority of NEL methods often make a parametric assumption over the data\ndistribution, which either fail to return good results, due to the reason that\nreal-life complex datasets may not follow a well-known data distribution. In\nthis paper, we propose a new online non-exhaustive learning model, namely,\nNon-Exhaustive Gaussian Mixture Generative Adversarial Networks (NE-GM-GAN) to\naddress these issues. Our proposed model synthesizes Gaussian mixture based\nlatent representation over a deep generative model, such as GAN, for\nincremental detection of instances of emerging classes in the test data.\nExtensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that\nNE-GM-GAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in detecting\ninstances of novel classes in streaming data.",

          "description": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is essential for the diagnosis of epilepsy, but\nit requires expertise and experience to identify abnormalities. It is thus\ncrucial to develop automated models for the detection of abnormalities in EEGs\nrelated to epilepsy. This paper describes the development of a novel class of\ncompact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting abnormal patterns\nand electrodes in EEGs for epilepsy. The designed model is inspired by a CNN\ndeveloped for brain-computer interfacing called multichannel EEGNet (mEEGNet).\nUnlike the EEGNet, the proposed model, mEEGNet, has the same number of\nelectrode inputs and outputs to detect abnormal patterns. The mEEGNet was\nevaluated with a clinical dataset consisting of 29 cases of juvenile and\nchildhood absence epilepsy labeled by a clinical expert. The labels were given\nto paroxysmal discharges visually observed in both ictal (seizure) and\ninterictal (nonseizure) durations. Results showed that the mEEGNet detected\nabnormalities with the area under the curve, F1-values, and sensitivity\nequivalent to or higher than those of existing CNNs. Moreover, the number of\nparameters is much smaller than other CNN models. To our knowledge, the dataset\nof absence epilepsy validated with machine learning through this research is\nthe largest in the literature.",

          "description": "Most edge AI focuses on prediction tasks on resource-limited edge devices\nwhile the training is done at server machines. However, retraining or\ncustomizing a model is required at edge devices as the model is becoming\noutdated due to environmental changes over time. To follow such a concept\ndrift, a neural-network based on-device learning approach is recently proposed,\nso that edge devices train incoming data at runtime to update their model. In\nthis case, since a training is done at distributed edge devices, the issue is\nthat only a limited amount of training data can be used for each edge device.\nTo address this issue, one approach is a cooperative learning or federated\nlearning, where edge devices exchange their trained results and update their\nmodel by using those collected from the other devices. In this paper, as an\non-device learning algorithm, we focus on OS-ELM (Online Sequential Extreme\nLearning Machine) to sequentially train a model based on recent samples and\ncombine it with autoencoder for anomaly detection. We extend it for an\non-device federated learning so that edge devices can exchange their trained\nresults and update their model by using those collected from the other edge\ndevices. This cooperative model update is one-shot while it can be repeatedly\napplied to synchronize their model. Our approach is evaluated with anomaly\ndetection tasks generated from a driving dataset of cars, a human activity\ndataset, and MNIST dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed on-device\nfederated learning can produce a merged model by integrating trained results\nfrom multiple edge devices as accurately as traditional backpropagation based\nneural networks and a traditional federated learning approach with lower\ncomputation or communication cost.",

When observation data comes\nfrom high-velocity, user-generated data streams, machine learning methods\nperform a balancing act between model complexity, training time, and\ncomputational costs. Furthermore, when model freshness is critical, the\ntraining of models becomes time-constrained. Parallelized batch offline\ntraining, although horizontally scalable, is often not time-considerate or\ncost-effective.

We show that the resulting model of our framework closely estimates a\nperiodically updated model trained on offline data and outperforms it when\nmodel updates are time-sensitive. We provide theoretical proof that the\nincremental learning updates improve the loss-function over a stale batch\nmodel.

          "description": "Dropout is a powerful and widely used technique to regularize the training of\ndeep neural networks.

Specifically, for each training sample, R-Drop minimizes the\nbidirectional KL-divergence between the output distributions of two sub models\nsampled by dropout.

          "description": "Learning efficiently a causal model of the environment is a key challenge of\nmodel-based RL agents operating in POMDPs. We consider here a scenario where\nthe learning agent has the ability to collect online experiences through direct\ninteractions with the environment (interventional data), but has also access to\na large collection of offline experiences, obtained by observing another agent\ninteracting with the environment (observational data). A key ingredient, that\nmakes this situation non-trivial, is that we allow the observed agent to\ninteract with the environment based on hidden information, which is not\nobserved by the learning agent. We then ask the following questions: can the\nonline and offline experiences be safely combined for learning a causal model ?\nAnd can we expect the offline experiences to improve the agent's performances ?\nTo answer these questions, we import ideas from the well-established causal\nframework of do-calculus, and we express model-based reinforcement learning as\na causal inference problem. Then, we propose a general yet simple methodology\nfor leveraging offline data during learning. In a nutshell, the method relies\non learning a latent-based causal transition model that explains both the\ninterventional and observational regimes, and then using the recovered latent\nvariable to infer the standard POMDP transition model via deconfounding. We\nprove our method is correct and efficient in the sense that it attains better\ngeneralization guarantees due to the offline data (in the asymptotic case), and\nwe illustrate its effectiveness empirically on synthetic toy problems. Our\ncontribution aims at bridging the gap between the fields of reinforcement\nlearning and causality.",

In this paper, we propose a model, \\textbf{SSI}, to improve\nsequential recommendation consistency with Self-Supervised Imitation.\nPrecisely, we extract the consistency knowledge by utilizing three\nself-supervised pre-training tasks, where temporal consistency and persona\nconsistency capture user-interaction dynamics in terms of the chronological\norder and persona sensitivities, respectively. Furthermore, to provide the\nmodel with a global perspective, global session consistency is introduced by\nmaximizing the mutual information among global and local interaction sequences.\nFinally, to comprehensively take advantage of all three independent aspects of\nconsistency-enhanced knowledge, we establish an integrated imitation learning\nframework. The consistency knowledge is effectively internalized and\ntransferred to the student model by imitating the conventional prediction logit\nas well as the consistency-enhanced item representations. In addition, the\nflexible self-supervised imitation framework can also benefit other student\nrecommenders. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that SSI effectively\noutperforms the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.",

          "description": "A major obstacle to achieving global convergence in distributed and federated\nlearning is the misalignment of gradients across clients, or mini-batches due\nto heterogeneity and stochasticity of the distributed data. One way to\nalleviate this problem is to encourage the alignment of gradients across\ndifferent clients throughout training. Our analysis reveals that this goal can\nbe accomplished by utilizing the right optimization method that replicates the\nimplicit regularization effect of SGD, leading to gradient alignment as well as\nimprovements in test accuracies. Since the existence of this regularization in\nSGD completely relies on the sequential use of different mini-batches during\ntraining, it is inherently absent when training with large mini-batches. To\nobtain the generalization benefits of this regularization while increasing\nparallelism, we propose a novel GradAlign algorithm that induces the same\nimplicit regularization while allowing the use of arbitrarily large batches in\neach update. We experimentally validate the benefit of our algorithm in\ndifferent distributed and federated learning settings.",

When graphs are modeling relations between\npeople, however, they will inevitably reflect biases, prejudices, and other\nforms of inequity and inequality. An important challenge is thus to design\naccurate graph modeling approaches while guaranteeing fairness according to the\nspecific notion of fairness that the problem requires. Yet, past work on the\ntopic remains scarce, is limited to debiasing specific graph modeling methods,\nand often aims to ensure fairness in an indirect manner.\n\nWe propose a generic approach applicable to most probabilistic graph modeling\napproaches. Specifically, we first define the class of fair graph models\ncorresponding to a chosen set of fairness criteria. Given this, we propose a\nfairness regularizer defined as the KL-divergence between the graph model and\nits I-projection onto the set of fair models. We demonstrate that using this\nfairness regularizer in combination with existing graph modeling approaches\nefficiently trades-off fairness with accuracy, whereas the state-of-the-art\nmodels can only make this trade-off for the fairness criterion that they were\nspecifically designed for.",

          "description": "Polygonal meshes are ubiquitous, but have only played a relatively minor role\nin the deep learning revolution. State-of-the-art neural generative models for\n3D shapes learn implicit functions and generate meshes via expensive\niso-surfacing. We overcome these challenges by employing a classical spatial\ndata structure from computer graphics, Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), to\nfacilitate 3D learning. The core operation of BSP involves recursive\nsubdivision of 3D space to obtain convex sets. By exploiting this property, we\ndevise BSP-Net, a network that learns to represent a 3D shape via convex\ndecomposition without supervision. The network is trained to reconstruct a\nshape using a set of convexes obtained from a BSP-tree built over a set of\nplanes, where the planes and convexes are both defined by learned network\nweights. BSP-Net directly outputs polygonal meshes from the inferred convexes.\nThe generated meshes are watertight, compact (i.e., low-poly), and well suited\nto represent sharp geometry. We show that the reconstruction quality by BSP-Net\nis competitive with those from state-of-the-art methods while using much fewer\nprimitives. We also explore variations to BSP-Net including using a more\ngeneric decoder for reconstruction, more general primitives than planes, as\nwell as training a generative model with variational auto-encoders.

          "description": "Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a computational technique to estimate\nthe power loads' appliance-by-appliance from the whole consumption measured by\na single meter. In this paper, we propose a conditional density estimation\nmodel, based on deep neural networks, that joins a Conditional Variational\nAutoencoder with a Conditional Invertible Normalizing Flow model to estimate\nthe individual appliance's power demand. The resulting model is called Prior\nFlow Variational Autoencoder or, for simplicity PFVAE. Thus, instead of having\none model per appliance, the resulting model is responsible for estimating the\npower demand, appliance-by-appliance, at once. We train and evaluate our\nproposed model in a publicly available dataset composed of power demand\nmeasures from a poultry feed factory located in Brazil. The proposed model's\nquality is evaluated by comparing the obtained normalized disaggregation error\n(NDE) and signal aggregated error (SAE) with the previous work values on the\nsame dataset. Our proposal achieves highly competitive results, and for six of\nthe eight machines belonging to the dataset, we observe consistent improvements\nthat go from 28% up to 81% in NDE and from 27% up to 86% in SAE.",

A well-known advantage of mean\nembeddings and MMD is their low computational cost and low sample complexity.\nHowever, kernel mean embeddings have had limited applications to problems that\nconsist in optimizing distributions, due to the difficulty of characterizing\nwhich Hilbert space vectors correspond to a probability distribution.

          "description": "Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks -- slight\nbut carefully constructed perturbations of the inputs which can drastically\nimpair the network's performance. Many defense methods have been proposed for\nimproving robustness of deep networks by training them on adversarially\nperturbed inputs. However, these models often remain vulnerable to new types of\nattacks not seen during training, and even to slightly stronger versions of\npreviously seen attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to\nadversarial robustness, which builds upon the insights from the domain\nadaptation field. Our method, called Adversarial Feature Desensitization (AFD),\naims at learning features that are invariant towards adversarial perturbations\nof the inputs. This is achieved through a game where we learn features that are\nboth predictive and robust (insensitive to adversarial attacks), i.e. cannot be\nused to discriminate between natural and adversarial data. Empirical results on\nseveral benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nagainst a wide range of attack types and attack strengths.",

Stochastic spectral\nmethods have achieved great success in quantifying the impact of process\nvariations, but they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Recently,\nlow-rank tensor methods have been developed to mitigate this issue, but two\nfundamental challenges remain open: how to automatically determine the tensor\nrank and how to adaptively pick the informative simulation samples. This paper\nproposes a novel tensor regression method to address these two challenges. We\nuse a $\\ell_{q}/ \\ell_{2}$ group-sparsity regularization to determine the\ntensor rank. The resulting optimization problem can be efficiently solved via\nan alternating minimization solver. We also propose a two-stage adaptive\nsampling method to reduce the simulation cost. Our method considers both\nexploration and exploitation via the estimated Voronoi cell volume and\nnonlinearity measurement respectively. The proposed model is verified with\nsynthetic and some realistic circuit benchmarks, on which our method can well\ncapture the uncertainty caused by 19 to 100 random variables with only 100 to\n600 simulation samples.",

Stochastic optimization and\nflow simulations have identified escape patterns that are consistent with those\nobserved in natural larval swimmers. However, these patterns have been limited\nby the specification of a particular cost function and depend on a prescribed\nfunctional form of the body motion. Here, we deploy reinforcement learning to\ndiscover swimmer escape patterns for larval fish under energy constraints. The\nidentified patterns include the C-start mechanism, in addition to more\nenergetically efficient escapes. We find that maximizing distance with limited\nenergy requires swimming via short bursts of accelerating motion interlinked\nwith phases of gliding. The present, data efficient, reinforcement learning\nalgorithm results in an array of patterns that reveal practical flow\noptimization principles for efficient swimming and the methodology can be\ntransferred to the control of aquatic robotic devices operating under energy\nconstraints.",

This discrepancy is problematic because -- as we\nshow on numerous benchmarks -- meta-learning methods that perform better on\nexisting OOD datasets may perform significantly worse in the ID setting.

          "description": "Machine learning (ML) methods are ubiquitous in wireless communication\nsystems and have proven powerful for applications including radio-frequency\n(RF) fingerprinting, automatic modulation classification, and cognitive radio.\nHowever, the large size of ML models can make them difficult to implement on\nedge devices for latency-sensitive downstream tasks. In wireless communication\nsystems, ML data processing at a sub-millisecond scale will enable real-time\nnetwork monitoring to improve security and prevent infiltration. In addition,\ncompact and integratable hardware platforms which can implement ML models at\nthe chip scale will find much broader application to wireless communication\nnetworks. Toward real-time wireless signal classification at the edge, we\npropose a novel compact deep network that consists of a\nphotonic-hardware-inspired recurrent neural network model in combination with a\nsimplified convolutional classifier, and we demonstrate its application to the\nidentification of RF emitters by their random transmissions. With the proposed\nmodel, we achieve 96.32% classification accuracy over a set of 30 identical\nZigBee devices when using 50 times fewer training parameters than an existing\nstate-of-the-art CNN classifier. Thanks to the large reduction in network size,\nwe demonstrate real-time RF fingerprinting with 0.219 ms latency using a\nsmall-scale FPGA board, the PYNQ-Z1.",

          "description": "Adversarial training (AT) is currently one of the most successful methods to\nobtain the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks. However, the\nphenomenon of robust overfitting, i.e., the robustness starts to decrease\nsignificantly during AT, has been problematic, not only making practitioners\nconsider a bag of tricks for a successful training, e.g., early stopping, but\nalso incurring a significant generalization gap in the robustness. In this\npaper, we propose an effective regularization technique that prevents robust\noverfitting by optimizing an auxiliary 'consistency' regularization loss during\nAT. Specifically, it forces the predictive distributions after attacking from\ntwo different augmentations of the same instance to be similar with each other.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that such a simple regularization\ntechnique brings significant improvements in the test robust accuracy of a wide\nrange of AT methods. More remarkably, we also show that our method could\nsignificantly help the model to generalize its robustness against unseen\nadversaries, e.g., other types or larger perturbations compared to those used\nduring training.

          "description": "We propose a method for learning linear models whose predictive performance\nis robust to causal interventions on unobserved variables, when noisy proxies\nof those variables are available. Our approach takes the form of a\nregularization term that trades off between in-distribution performance and\nrobustness to interventions. Under the assumption of a linear structural causal\nmodel, we show that a single proxy can be used to create estimators that are\nprediction optimal under interventions of bounded strength. This strength\ndepends on the magnitude of the measurement noise in the proxy, which is, in\ngeneral, not identifiable. In the case of two proxy variables, we propose a\nmodified estimator that is prediction optimal under interventions up to a known\nstrength. We further show how to extend these estimators to scenarios where\nadditional information about the \"test time\" intervention is available during\ntraining.

          "description": "During online decision making in Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB), one needs to\nconduct inference on the true mean reward of each arm based on data collected\nso far at each step. However, since the arms are adaptively selected--thereby\nyielding non-iid data--conducting inference accurately is not straightforward.\nIn particular, sample averaging, which is used in the family of UCB and\nThompson sampling (TS) algorithms, does not provide a good choice as it suffers\nfrom bias and a lack of good statistical properties (e.g. asymptotic\nnormality). Our thesis in this paper is that more sophisticated inference\nschemes that take into account the adaptive nature of the sequentially\ncollected data can unlock further performance gains, even though both UCB and\nTS type algorithms are optimal in the worst case. In particular, we propose a\nvariant of TS-style algorithms--which we call doubly adaptive TS--that\nleverages recent advances in causal inference and adaptively reweights the\nterms of a doubly robust estimator on the true mean reward of each arm. Through\n20 synthetic domain experiments and a semi-synthetic experiment based on data\nfrom an A/B test of a web service, we demonstrate that using an adaptive\ninferential scheme (while still retaining the exploration efficacy of TS)\nprovides clear benefits in online decision making: the proposed DATS algorithm\nhas superior empirical performance to existing baselines (UCB and TS) in terms\nof regret and sample complexity in identifying the best arm. In addition, we\nalso provide a finite-time regret bound of doubly adaptive TS that matches (up\nto log factors) those of UCB and TS algorithms, thereby establishing that its\nimproved practical benefits do not come at the expense of worst-case\nsuboptimality.",

          "description": "Self-supervised learning on graph-structured data has drawn recent interest\nfor learning generalizable, transferable and robust representations from\nunlabeled graphs. Among many, graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) has emerged\nwith promising representation learning performance. Unfortunately, unlike its\ncounterpart on image data, the effectiveness of GraphCL hinges on ad-hoc data\naugmentations, which have to be manually picked per dataset, by either rules of\nthumb or trial-and-errors, owing to the diverse nature of graph data. That\nsignificantly limits the more general applicability of GraphCL. Aiming to fill\nin this crucial gap, this paper proposes a unified bi-level optimization\nframework to automatically, adaptively and dynamically select data\naugmentations when performing GraphCL on specific graph data. The general\nframework, dubbed JOint Augmentation Optimization (JOAO), is instantiated as\nmin-max optimization. The selections of augmentations made by JOAO are shown to\nbe in general aligned with previous \"best practices\" observed from handcrafted\ntuning: yet now being automated, more flexible and versatile. Moreover, we\npropose a new augmentation-aware projection head mechanism, which will route\noutput features through different projection heads corresponding to different\naugmentations chosen at each training step. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat JOAO performs on par with or sometimes better than the state-of-the-art\ncompetitors including GraphCL, on multiple graph datasets of various scales and\ntypes, yet without resorting to any laborious dataset-specific tuning on\naugmentation selection.

          "description": "Learning decent representations from unlabeled time-series data with temporal\ndynamics is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised\nTime-Series representation learning framework via Temporal and Contextual\nContrasting (TS-TCC), to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data.\nFirst, the raw time-series data are transformed into two different yet\ncorrelated views by using weak and strong augmentations. Second, we propose a\nnovel temporal contrasting module to learn robust temporal representations by\ndesigning a tough cross-view prediction task. Last, to further learn\ndiscriminative representations, we propose a contextual contrasting module\nbuilt upon the contexts from the temporal contrasting module. It attempts to\nmaximize the similarity among different contexts of the same sample while\nminimizing similarity among contexts of different samples. Experiments have\nbeen carried out on three real-world time-series datasets. The results manifest\nthat training a linear classifier on top of the features learned by our\nproposed TS-TCC performs comparably with the supervised training. Additionally,\nour proposed TS-TCC shows high efficiency in few-labeled data and transfer\nlearning scenarios. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/emadeldeen24/TS-TCC.",

Our approach\nto multi-view semantic segmentation yields a 4-7% improvement in the per-class\nIoU scores compared to the traditional approaches that use the views\nindependently of one another. A unique (and, perhaps, surprising) property of\nour system is that modifications that are added to the tail-end of the CNN for\nlearning from the multi-view data can be discarded at the time of inference\nwith a relatively small penalty in the overall performance. This implies that\nthe benefits of training using multiple views are absorbed by all the layers of\nthe network. Additionally, our approach only adds a small overhead in terms of\nthe GPU-memory consumption even when training with as many as 32 views per\nscene. The system we present is end-to-end automated, which facilitates\ncomparing the classifiers trained directly on true orthophotos vis-a-vis first\ntraining them on the off-nadir images and subsequently translating the\npredicted labels to geographical coordinates. With no human supervision, our\nIoU scores for the buildings and roads classes are 0.8 and 0.64 respectively\nwhich are better than state-of-the-art approaches that use OSM labels and that\nare not completely automated.",

          "description": "Random forest (RF) is one of the most popular methods for estimating\nregression functions. The local nature of the RF algorithm, based on intra-node\nmeans and variances, is ideal when errors are i.i.d. For dependent error\nprocesses like time series and spatial settings where data in all the nodes\nwill be correlated, operating locally ignores this dependence. Also, RF will\ninvolve resampling of correlated data, violating the principles of bootstrap.\nTheoretically, consistency of RF has been established for i.i.d. errors, but\nlittle is known about the case of dependent errors.\n\nWe propose RF-GLS, a novel extension of RF for dependent error processes in\nthe same way Generalized Least Squares (GLS) fundamentally extends Ordinary\nLeast Squares (OLS) for linear models under dependence. The key to this\nextension is the equivalent representation of the local decision-making in a\nregression tree as a global OLS optimization which is then replaced with a GLS\nloss to create a GLS-style regression tree. This also synergistically addresses\nthe resampling issue, as the use of GLS loss amounts to resampling uncorrelated\ncontrasts (pre-whitened data) instead of the correlated data. For spatial\nsettings, RF-GLS can be used in conjunction with Gaussian Process correlated\nerrors to generate kriging predictions at new locations. RF becomes a special\ncase of RF-GLS with an identity working covariance matrix.\n\nWe establish consistency of RF-GLS under beta- (absolutely regular) mixing\nerror processes and show that this general result subsumes important cases like\nautoregressive time series and spatial Matern Gaussian Processes. As a\nbyproduct, we also establish consistency of RF for beta-mixing processes, which\nto our knowledge, is the first such result for RF under dependence.\n\nWe empirically demonstrate the improvement achieved by RF-GLS over RF for\nboth estimation and prediction under dependence.",

Then, we propose a context-aware version of the\n\"Track-and-Stop\" strategy, wherein the proportion of the arm draws tracks the\nset of optimal allocations and prove that the expected number of arm draws\nmatches the lower bound asymptotically. We demonstrate that contextual\ninformation can be used to improve the efficiency of the identification of the\nbest marginalized mean reward compared with the results of Garivier & Kaufmann\n(2016). We experimentally confirm that context information contributes to\nfaster best-arm identification.",

          "description": "Sparse coding is a class of unsupervised methods for learning a sparse\nrepresentation of the input data in the form of a linear combination of a\ndictionary and a sparse code. This learning framework has led to\nstate-of-the-art results in various image and video processing tasks. However,\nclassical methods learn the dictionary and the sparse code based on alternative\noptimizations, usually without theoretical guarantees for either optimality or\nconvergence due to non-convexity of the problem. Recent works on sparse coding\nwith a complete dictionary provide strong theoretical guarantees thanks to the\ndevelopment of the non-convex optimization. However, initial non-convex\napproaches learn the dictionary in the sparse coding problem sequentially in an\natom-by-atom manner, which leads to a long execution time. More recent works\nseek to directly learn the entire dictionary at once, which substantially\nreduces the execution time. However, the associated recovery performance is\ndegraded with a finite number of data samples. In this paper, we propose an\nefficient sparse coding scheme with a two-stage optimization. The proposed\nscheme leverages the global and local Riemannian geometry of the two-stage\noptimization problem and facilitates fast implementation for superb dictionary\nrecovery performance by a finite number of samples without atom-by-atom\ncalculation. We further prove that, with high probability, the proposed scheme\ncan exactly recover any atom in the target dictionary with a finite number of\nsamples if it is adopted to recover one atom of the dictionary. An application\non wireless sensor data compression is also proposed. Experiments on both\nsynthetic and real-world data verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the\nproposed scheme.",

          "description": "In order to objectively assess new medical imaging technologies via\ncomputer-simulations, it is important to account for all sources of variability\nthat contribute to image data. One important source of variability that can\nsignificantly limit observer performance is associated with the variability in\nthe ensemble of objects to-be-imaged. This source of variability can be\ndescribed by stochastic object models (SOMs), which are generative models that\ncan be employed to sample from a distribution of to-be-virtually-imaged\nobjects. It is generally desirable to establish SOMs from experimental imaging\nmeasurements acquired by use of a well-characterized imaging system, but this\ntask has remained challenging. Deep generative neural networks, such as\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) hold potential for such tasks. To\nestablish SOMs from imaging measurements, an AmbientGAN has been proposed that\naugments a GAN with a measurement operator. However, the original AmbientGAN\ncould not immediately benefit from modern training procedures and GAN\narchitectures, which limited its ability to be applied to realistically sized\nmedical image data. To circumvent this, in this work, a modified AmbientGAN\ntraining strategy is proposed that is suitable for modern progressive or\nmulti-resolution training approaches such as employed in the Progressive\nGrowing of GANs and Style-based GANs. AmbientGANs established by use of the\nproposed training procedure are systematically validated in a controlled way by\nuse of computer-simulated measurement data corresponding to a stylized imaging\nsystem. Finally, emulated single-coil experimental magnetic resonance imaging\ndata are employed to demonstrate the methods under less stylized conditions.",

          "description": "Location information is proven to benefit the deep learning models on\ncapturing the manifold structure of target objects, and accordingly boosts the\naccuracy of medical image segmentation. However, most existing methods encode\nthe location information in an implicit way, e.g. the distance transform maps,\nwhich describe the relative distance from each pixel to the contour boundary,\nfor the network to learn. These implicit approaches do not fully exploit the\nposition information (i.e. absolute location) of targets. In this paper, we\npropose a novel loss function, namely residual moment (RM) loss, to explicitly\nembed the location information of segmentation targets during the training of\ndeep learning networks. Particularly, motivated by image moments, the\nsegmentation prediction map and ground-truth map are weighted by coordinate\ninformation. Then our RM loss encourages the networks to maintain the\nconsistency between the two weighted maps, which promotes the segmentation\nnetworks to easily locate the targets and extract manifold-structure-related\nfeatures. We validate the proposed RM loss by conducting extensive experiments\non two publicly available datasets, i.e., 2D optic cup and disk segmentation\nand 3D left atrial segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our RM loss, which significantly boosts the accuracy of\nsegmentation networks.",

          "description": "In many important graph data processing applications the acquired information\nincludes both node features and observations of the graph topology. Graph\nneural networks (GNNs) are designed to exploit both sources of evidence but\nthey do not optimally trade-off their utility and integrate them in a manner\nthat is also universal. Here, universality refers to independence on homophily\nor heterophily graph assumptions. We address these issues by introducing a new\nGeneralized PageRank (GPR) GNN architecture that adaptively learns the GPR\nweights so as to jointly optimize node feature and topological information\nextraction, regardless of the extent to which the node labels are homophilic or\nheterophilic. Learned GPR weights automatically adjust to the node label\npattern, irrelevant on the type of initialization, and thereby guarantee\nexcellent learning performance for label patterns that are usually hard to\nhandle. Furthermore, they allow one to avoid feature over-smoothing, a process\nwhich renders feature information nondiscriminative, without requiring the\nnetwork to be shallow. Our accompanying theoretical analysis of the GPR-GNN\nmethod is facilitated by novel synthetic benchmark datasets generated by the\nso-called contextual stochastic block model. We also compare the performance of\nour GNN architecture with that of several state-of-the-art GNNs on the problem\nof node-classification, using well-known benchmark homophilic and heterophilic\ndatasets. The results demonstrate that GPR-GNN offers significant performance\nimprovement compared to existing techniques on both synthetic and benchmark\ndata.",

Although\nresearchers affirm the association between cognitive cues and emotional\nmanifestations, most of the current multimodal approaches in sentiment analysis\ndisregard user-specific aspects. To tackle this issue, we devise a novel method\nto perform multimodal sentiment prediction using cognitive cues, such as\npersonality. Our framework constructs an adaptive tree by hierarchically\ndividing users and trains the LSTM-based submodels, utilizing an\nattention-based fusion to transfer cognitive-oriented knowledge within the\ntree. Subsequently, the framework consumes the conclusive agglomerative\nknowledge from the adaptive tree to predict final sentiments.

The empirical results on real-world datasets determine\nthat our proposed model for sentiment prediction can surpass trending rivals.\nMoreover, compared to other ensemble approaches, the proposed transfer-based\nalgorithm can better utilize the latent cognitive cues and foster the\nprediction outcomes.

          "description": "Modern magnetic sensor arrays conventionally utilize state of the art low\npower magnetometers such as parallel and orthogonal fluxgates. Low power\nfluxgates tend to have large Barkhausen jumps that appear as a dc jump in the\nfluxgate output. This phenomenon deteriorates the signal fidelity and\neffectively increases the internal sensor noise. Even if sensors that are more\nprone to dc jumps can be screened during production, the conventional noise\nmeasurement does not always catch the dc jump because of its sparsity.\nMoreover, dc jumps persist in almost all the sensor cores although at a slower\nbut still intolerable rate. Even if dc jumps can be easily detected in a\nshielded environment, when deployed in presence of natural noise and clutter,\nit can be hard to positively detect them. This work fills this gap and presents\nalgorithms that distinguish dc jumps embedded in natural magnetic field data.\nTo improve robustness to noise, we developed two machine learning algorithms\nthat employ temporal and statistical physical-based features of a pre-acquired\nand well-known experimental data set. The first algorithm employs a support\nvector machine classifier, while the second is based on a neural network\narchitecture. We compare these new approaches to a more classical kernel-based\nmethod. To that purpose, the receiver operating characteristic curve is\ngenerated, which allows diagnosis ability of the different classifiers by\ncomparing their performances across various operation points. The accuracy of\nthe machine learning-based algorithms over the classic method is highly\nemphasized. In addition, high generalization and robustness of the neural\nnetwork can be concluded, based on the rapid convergence of the corresponding\nreceiver operating characteristic curves.",

          "description": "Stochastic nested optimization, including stochastic compositional, min-max\nand bilevel optimization, is gaining popularity in many machine learning\napplications. While the three problems share the nested structure, existing\nworks often treat them separately, and thus develop problem-specific algorithms\nand their analyses. Among various exciting developments, simple SGD-type\nupdates (potentially on multiple variables) are still prevalent in solving this\nclass of nested problems, but they are believed to have slower convergence rate\ncompared to that of the non-nested problems. This paper unifies several\nSGD-type updates for stochastic nested problems into a single SGD approach that\nwe term ALternating Stochastic gradient dEscenT (ALSET) method. By leveraging\nthe hidden smoothness of the problem, this paper presents a tighter analysis of\nALSET for stochastic nested problems. Under the new analysis, to achieve an\n$\\epsilon$-stationary point of the nested problem, it requires ${\\cal\nO}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ samples. Under certain regularity conditions, applying our\nresults to stochastic compositional, min-max and reinforcement learning\nproblems either improves or matches the best-known sample complexity in the\nrespective cases. Our results explain why simple SGD-type algorithms in\nstochastic nested problems all work very well in practice without the need for\nfurther modifications.",

In recent years, the question of learning in MFG\nand MFC has garnered interest, both as a way to compute solutions and as a way\nto model how large populations of learners converge to an equilibrium. Of\nparticular interest is the setting where the agents do not know the model,\nwhich leads to the development of reinforcement learning (RL) methods. After\nreviewing the literature on this topic, we present a two timescale approach\nwith RL for MFG and MFC, which relies on a unified Q-learning algorithm. The\nmain novelty of this method is to simultaneously update an action-value\nfunction and a distribution but with different rates, in a model-free fashion.\nDepending on the ratio of the two learning rates, the algorithm learns either\nthe MFG or the MFC solution. To illustrate this method, we apply it to a mean\nfield problem of accumulated consumption in finite horizon with HARA utility\nfunction, and to a trader's optimal liquidation problem.",

Partial\ndifferential equations involving fuzzy and interval fields are traditionally\nsolved using the finite element method where the input fields are sampled using\nsome basis function expansion methods. This approach however is problematic, as\nit is reliant on knowledge about the spatial correlation fields.

The resulting network structures termed\ninterval physics-informed neural networks (iPINNs) and fuzzy physics-informed\nneural networks (fPINNs) show promising results for obtaining bounded solutions\nof equations involving spatially uncertain parameter fields. In contrast to\nfinite element approaches, no correlation length specification of the input\nfields as well as no averaging via Monte-Carlo simulations are necessary.

          "description": "Recent advances in image synthesis enables one to translate images by\nlearning the mapping between a source domain and a target domain. Existing\nmethods tend to learn the distributions by training a model on a variety of\ndatasets, with results evaluated largely in a subjective manner. Relatively few\nworks in this area, however, study the potential use of semantic image\ntranslation methods for image recognition tasks. In this paper, we explore the\nuse of Single Image Texture Translation (SITT) for data augmentation. We first\npropose a lightweight model for translating texture to images based on a single\ninput of source texture, allowing for fast training and testing. Based on SITT,\nwe then explore the use of augmented data in long-tailed and few-shot image\nclassification tasks. We find the proposed method is capable of translating\ninput data into a target domain, leading to consistent improved image\nrecognition performance. Finally, we examine how SITT and related image\ntranslation methods can provide a basis for a data-efficient, augmentation\nengineering approach to model training.",

          "description": "Genetic mutations can cause disease by disrupting normal gene function.\nIdentifying the disease-causing mutations from millions of genetic variants\nwithin an individual patient is a challenging problem. Computational methods\nwhich can prioritize disease-causing mutations have, therefore, enormous\napplications. It is well-known that genes function through a complex regulatory\nnetwork. However, existing variant effect prediction models only consider a\nvariant in isolation. In contrast, we propose VEGN, which models variant effect\nprediction using a graph neural network (GNN) that operates on a heterogeneous\ngraph with genes and variants. The graph is created by assigning variants to\ngenes and connecting genes with an gene-gene interaction network. In this\ncontext, we explore an approach where a gene-gene graph is given and another\nwhere VEGN learns the gene-gene graph and therefore operates both on given and\nlearnt edges. The graph neural network is trained to aggregate information\nbetween genes, and between genes and variants. Variants can exchange\ninformation via the genes they connect to.

Recently, there has been a line of work on\nincorporating the formal privacy notion of differential privacy with FL.

Such\nclipping operation is substantially different from its counterpart of gradient\nclipping in the centralized differentially private SGD and has not been\nwell-understood. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate that the\nclipped FedAvg can perform surprisingly well even with substantial data\nheterogeneity when training neural networks, which is partly because the\nclients' updates become similar for several popular deep architectures. Based\non this key observation, we provide the convergence analysis of a differential\nprivate (DP) FedAvg algorithm and highlight the relationship between clipping\nbias and the distribution of the clients' updates.

To achieve zero-shot AutoML we train a\ngraph neural network with these description embeddings and the data\nmeta-features.

          "description": "The abundant sequential documents such as online archival, social media and\nnews feeds are streamingly updated, where each chunk of documents is\nincorporated with smoothly evolving yet dependent topics. Such digital texts\nhave attracted extensive research on dynamic topic modeling to infer hidden\nevolving topics and their temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing\napproaches focus on single-topic-thread evolution and ignore the fact that a\ncurrent topic may be coupled with multiple relevant prior topics. In addition,\nthese approaches also incur the intractable inference problem when inferring\nlatent parameters, resulting in a high computational cost and performance\ndegradation. In this work, we assume that a current topic evolves from all\nprior topics with corresponding coupling weights, forming the\nmulti-topic-thread evolution. Our method models the dependencies between\nevolving topics and thoroughly encodes their complex multi-couplings across\ntime steps. To conquer the intractable inference challenge, a new solution with\na set of novel data augmentation techniques is proposed, which successfully\ndiscomposes the multi-couplings between evolving topics. A fully conjugate\nmodel is thus obtained to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency of the\ninference technique. A novel Gibbs sampler with a backward-forward filter\nalgorithm efficiently learns latent timeevolving parameters in a closed-form.\nIn addition, the latent Indian Buffet Process (IBP) compound distribution is\nexploited to automatically infer the overall topic number and customize the\nsparse topic proportions for each sequential document without bias. The\nproposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets against\nthe competitive baselines, demonstrating its superiority over the baselines in\nterms of the low per-word perplexity, high coherent topics, and better document\ntime prediction.",

          "description": "Building classifiers on multiple domains is a practical problem in the real\nlife. Instead of building classifiers one by one, multi-domain learning (MDL)\nsimultaneously builds classifiers on multiple domains. MDL utilizes the\ninformation shared among the domains to improve the performance. As a\nsupervised learning problem, the labeling effort is still high in MDL problems.\nUsually, this high labeling cost issue could be relieved by using active\nlearning. Thus, it is natural to utilize active learning to reduce the labeling\neffort in MDL, and we refer this setting as multi-domain active learning\n(MDAL). However, there are only few works which are built on this setting. And\nwhen the researches have to face this problem, there is no off-the-shelf\nsolutions. Under this circumstance, combining the current multi-domain learning\nmodels and single-domain active learning strategies might be a preliminary\nsolution for MDAL problem. To find out the potential of this preliminary\nsolution, a comparative study over 5 models and 4 selection strategies is made\nin this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work provides\nthe formal definition of MDAL. Besides, this is the first comparative work for\nMDAL problem.

          "description": "Although the tailored metal active sites and porous architectures of MOFs\nhold great promise for engineering challenges ranging from gas separations to\ncatalysis, a lack of understanding of how to improve their stability limits\ntheir use in practice. To overcome this limitation, we extract thousands of\npublished reports of the key aspects of MOF stability necessary for their\npractical application: the ability to withstand high temperatures without\ndegrading and the capacity to be activated by removal of solvent molecules.\nFrom nearly 4,000 manuscripts, we use natural language processing and automated\nimage analysis to obtain over 2,000 solvent-removal stability measures and\n3,000 thermal degradation temperatures. We analyze the relationships between\nstability properties and the chemical and geometric structures in this set to\nidentify limits of prior heuristics derived from smaller sets of MOFs. By\ntraining predictive machine learning (ML, i.e., Gaussian process and artificial\nneural network) models to encode the structure-property relationships with\ngraph- and pore-structure-based representations, we are able to make\npredictions of stability orders of magnitude faster than conventional\nphysics-based modeling or experiment. Interpretation of important features in\nML models provides insights that we use to identify strategies to engineer\nincreased stability into typically unstable 3d-containing MOFs that are\nfrequently targeted for catalytic applications. We expect our approach to\naccelerate the time to discovery of stable, practical MOF materials for a wide\nrange of applications.",

          "description": "Time series forecasting based on deep architectures has been gaining\npopularity in recent years due to their ability to model complex non-linear\ntemporal dynamics. The recurrent neural network is one such model capable of\nhandling variable-length input and output. In this paper, we leverage recent\nadvances in deep generative models and the concept of state space models to\npropose a stochastic adaptation of the recurrent neural network for\nmultistep-ahead time series forecasting, which is trained with stochastic\ngradient variational Bayes. In our model design, the transition function of the\nrecurrent neural network, which determines the evolution of the hidden states,\nis stochastic rather than deterministic as in a regular recurrent neural\nnetwork; this is achieved by incorporating a latent random variable into the\ntransition process which captures the stochasticity of the temporal dynamics.\nOur model preserves the architectural workings of a recurrent neural network\nfor which all relevant information is encapsulated in its hidden states, and\nthis flexibility allows our model to be easily integrated into any deep\narchitecture for sequential modelling. We test our model on a wide range of\ndatasets from finance to healthcare; results show that the stochastic recurrent\nneural network consistently outperforms its deterministic counterpart.",

          "description": "Various incremental learning (IL) approaches have been proposed to help deep\nlearning models learn new tasks/classes continuously without forgetting what\nwas learned previously (i.e., avoid catastrophic forgetting). With the growing\nnumber of deployed audio sensing applications that need to dynamically\nincorporate new tasks and changing input distribution from users, the ability\nof IL on-device becomes essential for both efficiency and user privacy.\n\nHowever, prior works suffer from high computational costs and storage demands\nwhich hinders the deployment of IL on-device. In this work, to overcome these\nlimitations, we develop an end-to-end and on-device IL framework, FastICARL,\nthat incorporates an exemplar-based IL and quantization in the context of\naudio-based applications. We first employ k-nearest-neighbor to reduce the\nlatency of IL. Then, we jointly utilize a quantization technique to decrease\nthe storage requirements of IL. We implement FastICARL on two types of mobile\ndevices and demonstrate that FastICARL remarkably decreases the IL time up to\n78-92% and the storage requirements by 2-4 times without sacrificing its\nperformance. FastICARL enables complete on-device IL, ensuring user privacy as\nthe user data does not need to leave the device.",

          "description": "Structured stochastic multi-armed bandits provide accelerated regret rates\nover the standard unstructured bandit problems. Most structured bandits,\nhowever, assume the knowledge of the structural parameter such as Lipschitz\ncontinuity, which is often not available. To cope with the latent structural\nparameter, we consider a transfer learning setting in which an agent must learn\nto transfer the structural information from the prior tasks to the next task,\nwhich is inspired by practical problems such as rate adaptation in wireless\nlink. We propose a novel framework to provably and accurately estimate the\nLipschitz constant based on previous tasks and fully exploit it for the new\ntask at hand. We analyze the efficiency of the proposed framework in two folds:\n(i) the sample complexity of our estimator matches with the\ninformation-theoretic fundamental limit; and (ii) our regret bound on the new\ntask is close to that of the oracle algorithm with the full knowledge of the\nLipschitz constant under mild assumptions. Our analysis reveals a set of useful\ninsights on transfer learning for latent Lipschitzconstants such as the\nfundamental challenge a learner faces.

Expert judgements, whether human or artificial, can help in\ntaking correct decisions, especially when exploration of alternative solutions\nis costly. As expert opinions might deviate, the problem of finding the right\nalternative can be approached as a collective decision making problem (CDM).\nCurrent state-of-the-art approaches to solve CDM are limited by the quality of\nthe best expert in the group, and perform poorly if experts are not qualified\nor if they are overly biased, thus potentially derailing the decision-making\nprocess.

During offline training,\na mapping function is built between high and low resolution representations of\na given design domain. The mapping is expressed by a FE-CNN, which targets a\ncommon objective function value (e.g., structural compliance) across design\ndomains of differing resolutions. During online optimization, an arbitrary\ndesign domain of high resolution is reduced to low resolution through the\ntrained mapping function. The original high-resolution domain is thus designed\nby computations performed on only the low-resolution version, followed by an\ninverse mapping back to the high-resolution domain. Numerical examples\ndemonstrate that this approach can accelerate optimization by up to an order of\nmagnitude in computational time.

Graph contrastive learning (GCL), by training GNNs to maximize the\ncorrespondence between the representations of the same graph in its different\naugmented forms, may yield robust and transferable GNNs even without using\nlabels. However, GNNs trained by traditional GCL often risk capturing redundant\ngraph features and thus may be brittle and provide sub-par performance in\ndownstream tasks. Here, we propose a novel principle, termed adversarial-GCL\n(AD-GCL), which enables GNNs to avoid capturing redundant information during\nthe training by optimizing adversarial graph augmentation strategies used in\nGCL. We pair AD-GCL with theoretical explanations and design a practical\ninstantiation based on trainable edge-dropping graph augmentation. We\nexperimentally validate AD-GCL by comparing with the state-of-the-art GCL\nmethods and achieve performance gains of up-to $14\\%$ in unsupervised, $6\\%$ in\ntransfer, and $3\\%$ in semi-supervised learning settings overall with 18\ndifferent benchmark datasets for the tasks of molecule property regression and\nclassification, and social network classification.",

          "description": "While multifidelity modeling provides a cost-effective way to conduct\nuncertainty quantification with computationally expensive models, much greater\nefficiency can be achieved by adaptively deciding the number of required\nhigh-fidelity (HF) simulations, depending on the type and complexity of the\nproblem and the desired accuracy in the results. We propose a framework for\nactive learning with multifidelity modeling emphasizing the efficient\nestimation of rare events. Our framework works by fusing a low-fidelity (LF)\nprediction with an HF-inferred correction, filtering the corrected LF\nprediction to decide whether to call the high-fidelity model, and for enhanced\nsubsequent accuracy, adapting the correction for the LF prediction after every\nHF model call. The framework does not make any assumptions as to the LF model\ntype or its correlations with the HF model. In addition, for improved\nrobustness when estimating smaller failure probabilities, we propose using\ndynamic active learning functions that decide when to call the HF model. We\ndemonstrate our framework using several academic case studies and two finite\nelement (FE) model case studies: estimating Navier-Stokes velocities using the\nStokes approximation and estimating stresses in a transversely isotropic model\nsubjected to displacements via a coarsely meshed isotropic model. Across these\ncase studies, not only did the proposed framework estimate the failure\nprobabilities accurately, but compared with either Monte Carlo or a standard\nvariance reduction method, it also required only a small fraction of the calls\nto the HF model.",

          "description": "Recently, bladder cancer has been significantly increased in terms of\nincidence and mortality. Currently, two subtypes are known based on tumour\ngrowth: non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).\nIn this work, we focus on the MIBC subtype because it is of the worst prognosis\nand can spread to adjacent organs. We present a self-learning framework to\ngrade bladder cancer from histological images stained via immunohistochemical\ntechniques. Specifically, we propose a novel Deep Convolutional Embedded\nAttention Clustering (DCEAC) which allows classifying histological patches into\ndifferent severity levels of the disease, according to the patterns established\nin the literature. The proposed DCEAC model follows a two-step fully\nunsupervised learning methodology to discern between non-tumour, mild and\ninfiltrative patterns from high-resolution samples of 512x512 pixels. Our\nsystem outperforms previous clustering-based methods by including a\nconvolutional attention module, which allows refining the features of the\nlatent space before the classification stage. The proposed network exceeds\nstate-of-the-art approaches by 2-3% across different metrics, achieving a final\naverage accuracy of 0.9034 in a multi-class scenario. Furthermore, the reported\nclass activation maps evidence that our model is able to learn by itself the\nsame patterns that clinicians consider relevant, without incurring prior\nannotation steps. This fact supposes a breakthrough in muscle-invasive bladder\ncancer grading which bridges the gap with respect to train the model on\nlabelled data.",

          "description": "In this paper, we introduce TITAN, a novel inerTIal block majorizaTion\nminimizAtioN framework for non-smooth non-convex optimization problems. To the\nbest of our knowledge, TITAN is the first framework of block-coordinate update\nmethod that relies on the majorization-minimization framework while embedding\ninertial force to each step of the block updates. The inertial force is\nobtained via an extrapolation operator that subsumes heavy-ball and\nNesterov-type accelerations for block proximal gradient methods as special\ncases. By choosing various surrogate functions, such as proximal, Lipschitz\ngradient, Bregman, quadratic, and composite surrogate functions, and by varying\nthe extrapolation operator, TITAN produces a rich set of inertial\nblock-coordinate update methods. We study sub-sequential convergence as well as\nglobal convergence for the generated sequence of TITAN. We illustrate the\neffectiveness of TITAN on two important machine learning problems, namely\nsparse non-negative matrix factorization and matrix completion.",

          "description": "Data augmentation is a key element of deep learning pipelines, as it informs\nthe network during training about transformations of the input data that keep\nthe label unchanged. Manually finding adequate augmentation methods and\nparameters for a given pipeline is however rapidly cumbersome. In particular,\nwhile intuition can guide this decision for images, the design and choice of\naugmentation policies remains unclear for more complex types of data, such as\nneuroscience signals. Moreover, label independent strategies might not be\nsuitable for such structured data and class-dependent augmentations might be\nnecessary. This idea has been surprisingly unexplored in the literature, while\nit is quite intuitive: changing the color of a car image does not change the\nobject class to be predicted, but doing the same to the picture of an orange\ndoes. This paper aims to increase the generalization power added through\nclass-wise data augmentation. Yet, as seeking transformations depending on the\nclass largely increases the complexity of the task, using gradient-free\noptimization techniques as done by most existing automatic approaches becomes\nintractable for real-world datasets. For this reason we propose to use\ndifferentiable data augmentation amenable to gradient-based learning. EEG\nsignals are a perfect example of data for which good augmentation policies are\nmostly unknown. In this work, we demonstrate the relevance of our approach on\nthe clinically relevant sleep staging classification task, for which we also\npropose differentiable transformations.",

Although these\nmethods were shown to produce high-quality separations, they were mainly\napplied under offline settings, in which the model has access to the full input\nsignal while separating the signal. In this study, we convert a non-causal\nstate-of-the-art separation model into a causal and real-time model and\nevaluate its performance under both online and offline settings. We compare the\nperformance of the proposed model to several baseline methods under anechoic,\nnoisy, and noisy-reverberant recording conditions while exploring both monaural\nand binaural inputs and outputs. Our findings shed light on the relative\ndifference between causal and non-causal models when performing separation. Our\nstateful implementation for online separation leads to a minor drop in\nperformance compared to the offline model; 0.8dB for monaural inputs and 0.3dB\nfor binaural inputs while reaching a real-time factor of 0.65.

          "description": "Adversarial robustness has emerged as a desirable property for neural\nnetworks. Prior work shows that robust networks perform well in some\nout-of-distribution generalization tasks, such as transfer learning and outlier\ndetection. We uncover a different kind of out-of-distribution generalization\nproperty of such networks, and find that they also do well in a task that we\ncall nearest category generalization (NCG) - given an out-of-distribution\ninput, they tend to predict the same label as that of the closest training\nexample. We empirically show that this happens even when the\nout-of-distribution inputs lie outside the robustness radius of the training\ndata, which suggests that these networks may generalize better along unseen\ndirections on the natural image manifold than arbitrary unseen directions. We\nexamine how performance changes when we change the robustness regions during\ntraining. We then design experiments to investigate the connection between\nout-of-distribution detection and nearest category generalization. Taken\ntogether, our work provides evidence that robust neural networks may resemble\nnearest neighbor classifiers in their behavior on out-of-distribution data.

Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring\nquality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this\nwork, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe\nthat load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,\ncontrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely\nactivated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can\nsignificantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step\nforward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits\nexperts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This\nstrategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,\nand our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is\nmore effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$\ntrillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in\ncomparison with the recent SOTAs on $2048$ TPU cores.

          "description": "In this paper, we propose a transformer-based procedure for the efficient\nregistration of non-rigid 3D point clouds. The proposed approach is data-driven\nand adopts for the first time the transformer architecture in the registration\ntask. Our method is general and applies to different settings. Given a fixed\ntemplate with some desired properties (e.g. skinning weights or other animation\ncues), we can register raw acquired data to it, thereby transferring all the\ntemplate properties to the input geometry. Alternatively, given a pair of\nshapes, our method can register the first onto the second (or vice-versa),\nobtaining a high-quality dense correspondence between the two. In both\ncontexts, the quality of our results enables us to target real applications\nsuch as texture transfer and shape interpolation. Furthermore, we also show\nthat including an estimation of the underlying density of the surface eases the\nlearning process. By exploiting the potential of this architecture, we can\ntrain our model requiring only a sparse set of ground truth correspondences\n($10\\sim20\\%$ of the total points). The proposed model and the analysis that we\nperform pave the way for future exploration of transformer-based architectures\nfor registration and matching applications. Qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nfor deformable and unordered 3D data registration on different datasets and\nscenarios.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have amply demonstrated their prowess but estimating the\nreliability of their predictions remains challenging. Deep Ensembles are widely\nconsidered as being one of the best methods for generating uncertainty\nestimates but are very expensive to train and evaluate. MC-Dropout is another\npopular alternative, which is less expensive, but also less reliable. Our\ncentral intuition is that there is a continuous spectrum of ensemble-like\nmodels of which MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles are extreme examples. The first\nuses an effectively infinite number of highly correlated models while the\nsecond relies on a finite number of independent models.\n\nTo combine the benefits of both, we introduce Masksembles. Instead of\nrandomly dropping parts of the network as in MC-dropout, Masksemble relies on a\nfixed number of binary masks, which are parameterized in a way that allows to\nchange correlations between individual models. Namely, by controlling the\noverlap between the masks and their density one can choose the optimal\nconfiguration for the task at hand. This leads to a simple and easy to\nimplement method with performance on par with Ensembles at a fraction of the\ncost. We experimentally validate Masksembles on two widely used datasets,\nCIFAR10 and ImageNet.",

The main motivation behind is that the complexity of Maximum\nA-Posteriori (MAP) detection grows exponentially with system dimensions.\nInstead of using DNNs, essentially being a black-box, we take a slightly\ndifferent approach and introduce a probabilistic Continuous relaxation of\ndisCrete variables to MAP detection. Enabling close approximation and\ncontinuous optimization, we derive an iterative detection algorithm: Concrete\nMAP Detection (CMD). Furthermore, extending CMD by the idea of deep unfolding\ninto CMDNet, we allow for (online) optimization of a small number of parameters\nto different working points while limiting complexity. In contrast to recent\nDNN-based approaches, we select the optimization criterion and output of CMDNet\nbased on information theory and are thus able to learn approximate\nprobabilities of the individual optimal detector. This is crucial for soft\ndecoding in today's communication systems. Numerical simulation results in MIMO\nsystems reveal CMDNet to feature a promising accuracy complexity trade-off\ncompared to State of the Art.

          "description": "Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems learn generalised, interpretable\nrules in a data-efficient manner utilising existing background knowledge.\nHowever, current ILP systems require training examples to be specified in a\nstructured logical format. Neural networks learn from unstructured data,\nalthough their learned models may be difficult to interpret and are vulnerable\nto data perturbations at run-time. This paper introduces a hybrid\nneural-symbolic learning framework, called NSL, that learns interpretable rules\nfrom labelled unstructured data. NSL combines pre-trained neural networks for\nfeature extraction with FastLAS, a state-of-the-art ILP system for rule\nlearning under the answer set semantics. Features extracted by the neural\ncomponents define the structured context of labelled examples and the\nconfidence of the neural predictions determines the level of noise of the\nexamples. Using the scoring function of FastLAS, NSL searches for short,\ninterpretable rules that generalise over such noisy examples. We evaluate our\nframework on propositional and first-order classification tasks using the MNIST\ndataset as raw data. Specifically, we demonstrate that NSL is able to learn\nrobust rules from perturbed MNIST data and achieve comparable or superior\naccuracy when compared to neural network and random forest baselines whilst\nbeing more general and interpretable.",

          "description": "The exploration-exploitation trade-off is central to the description of\nadaptive behaviour in fields ranging from machine learning, to biology, to\neconomics. While many approaches have been taken, one approach to solving this\ntrade-off has been to equip or propose that agents possess an intrinsic\n'exploratory drive' which is often implemented in terms of maximizing the\nagents information gain about the world -- an approach which has been widely\nstudied in machine learning and cognitive science. In this paper we\nmathematically investigate the nature and meaning of such approaches and\ndemonstrate that this combination of utility maximizing and information-seeking\nbehaviour arises from the minimization of an entirely difference class of\nobjectives we call divergence objectives. We propose a dichotomy in the\nobjective functions underlying adaptive behaviour between \\emph{evidence}\nobjectives, which correspond to well-known reward or utility maximizing\nobjectives in the literature, and \\emph{divergence} objectives which instead\nseek to minimize the divergence between the agent's expected and desired\nfutures, and argue that this new class of divergence objectives could form the\nmathematical foundation for a much richer understanding of the exploratory\ncomponents of adaptive and intelligent action, beyond simply greedy utility\nmaximization.",

          "description": "Family history is a major risk factor for many types of cancer. Mendelian\nrisk prediction models translate family histories into cancer risk predictions\nbased on knowledge of cancer susceptibility genes. These models are widely used\nin clinical practice to help identify high-risk individuals. Mendelian models\nleverage the entire family history, but they rely on many assumptions about\ncancer susceptibility genes that are either unrealistic or challenging to\nvalidate due to low mutation prevalence. Training more flexible models, such as\nneural networks, on large databases of pedigrees can potentially lead to\naccuracy gains. In this paper, we develop a framework to apply neural networks\nto family history data and investigate their ability to learn inherited\nsusceptibility to cancer. While there is an extensive literature on neural\nnetworks and their state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, there is little\nwork applying them to family history data. We propose adaptations of\nfully-connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks to pedigrees.\nIn data simulated under Mendelian inheritance, we demonstrate that our proposed\nneural network models are able to achieve nearly optimal prediction\nperformance. Moreover, when the observed family history includes misreported\ncancer diagnoses, neural networks are able to outperform the Mendelian BRCAPRO\nmodel embedding the correct inheritance laws. Using a large dataset of over\n200,000 family histories, the Risk Service cohort, we train prediction models\nfor future risk of breast cancer. We validate the models using data from the\nCancer Genetics Network.",

          "description": "Slimmable neural networks provide a flexible trade-off front between\nprediction error and computational requirement (such as the number of\nfloating-point operations or FLOPs) with the same storage requirement as a\nsingle model. They are useful for reducing maintenance overhead for deploying\nmodels to devices with different memory constraints and are useful for\noptimizing the efficiency of a system with many CNNs. However, existing\nslimmable network approaches either do not optimize layer-wise widths or\noptimize the shared-weights and layer-wise widths independently, thereby\nleaving significant room for improvement by joint width and weight\noptimization. In this work, we propose a general framework to enable joint\noptimization for both width configurations and weights of slimmable networks.\nOur framework subsumes conventional and NAS-based slimmable methods as special\ncases and provides flexibility to improve over existing methods. From a\npractical standpoint, we propose Joslim, an algorithm that jointly optimizes\nboth the widths and weights for slimmable nets, which outperforms existing\nmethods for optimizing slimmable networks across various networks, datasets,\nand objectives. Quantitatively, improvements up to 1.7% and 8% in top-1\naccuracy on the ImageNet dataset can be attained for MobileNetV2 considering\nFLOPs and memory footprint, respectively.

          "description": "Graphs have been widely used in data mining and machine learning due to their\nunique representation of real-world objects and their interactions. As graphs\nare getting bigger and bigger nowadays, it is common to see their subgraphs\nseparately collected and stored in multiple local systems. Therefore, it is\nnatural to consider the subgraph federated learning setting, where each local\nsystem holding a small subgraph that may be biased from the distribution of the\nwhole graph. Hence, the subgraph federated learning aims to collaboratively\ntrain a powerful and generalizable graph mining model without directly sharing\ntheir graph data. In this work, towards the novel yet realistic setting of\nsubgraph federated learning, we propose two major techniques: (1) FedSage,\nwhich trains a GraphSage model based on FedAvg to integrate node features, link\nstructures, and task labels on multiple local subgraphs; (2) FedSage+, which\ntrains a missing neighbor generator along FedSage to deal with missing links\nacross local subgraphs. Empirical results on four real-world graph datasets\nwith synthesized subgraph federated learning settings demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our proposed techniques. At the same time,\nconsistent theoretical implications are made towards their generalization\nability on the global graphs.",

Two popular solutions are based on a linear estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol\nx}^{\\rm L}$ and a spectral estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol x}^{\\rm s}$. The former\nis a data-dependent linear combination of the columns of the measurement\nmatrix, and its analysis is quite simple.

In this paper, we show how to optimally combine\n$\\hat{\\boldsymbol x}^{\\rm L}$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol x}^{\\rm s}$. At the heart\nof our analysis is the exact characterization of the joint empirical\ndistribution of $(\\boldsymbol x, \\hat{\\boldsymbol x}^{\\rm L}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol\nx}^{\\rm s})$ in the high-dimensional limit. This allows us to compute the\nBayes-optimal combination of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol x}^{\\rm L}$ and\n$\\hat{\\boldsymbol x}^{\\rm s}$, given the limiting distribution of the signal\n$\\boldsymbol x$.

In this paper, we incorporate the\ngrouping effect into MF and propose a novel method called Robust Matrix\nFactorization with Grouping effect (GRMF). The grouping effect is a\ngeneralization of the sparsity effect, which conducts denoising by clustering\nsimilar values around multiple centers instead of just around 0. Compared with\nexisting algorithms, the proposed GRMF can automatically learn the grouping\nstructure and sparsity in MF without prior knowledge, by introducing a\nnaturally adjustable non-convex regularization to achieve simultaneous sparsity\nand grouping effect. Specifically, GRMF uses an efficient alternating\nminimization framework to perform MF, in which the original non-convex problem\nis first converted into a convex problem through Difference-of-Convex (DC)\nprogramming, and then solved by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM). In addition, GRMF can be easily extended to the Non-negative Matrix\nFactorization (NMF) settings. Extensive experiments have been conducted using\nreal-world data sets with outliers and contaminated noise, where the\nexperimental results show that GRMF has promoted performance and robustness,\ncompared to five benchmark algorithms.",

In\nparticular, DeepLoc leverages the ubiquitous cellular signals received from the\ndifferent cell towers heard by the mobile device as hints to localize it. To do\nthat, crowd-sensed geo-tagged received signal strength information coming from\ndifferent cell towers is used to train a deep model that is used to infer the\nuser's position. As part of DeepLoc design, we introduce modules to address a\nnumber of practical challenges including scaling the data collection to large\nareas, handling the inherent noise in the cellular signal and geo-tagged data,\nas well as providing enough data that is required for deep learning models with\nlow-overhead.\n\nWe implemented DeepLoc on different Android devices. Evaluation results in\nrealistic urban and rural environments show that DeepLoc can achieve a median\nlocalization accuracy within 18.8m in urban areas and within 15.7m in rural\nareas. This accuracy outperforms the state-of-the-art cellular-based systems by\nmore than 470% and comes with 330% savings in power compared to the GPS. This\nhighlights the promise of DeepLoc as a ubiquitous accurate and low-overhead\nlocalization system.",

          "description": "Recent contrastive representation learning methods rely on estimating mutual\ninformation (MI) between multiple views of an underlying context. E.g., we can\nderive multiple views of a given image by applying data augmentation, or we can\nsplit a sequence into views comprising the past and future of some step in the\nsequence. Contrastive lower bounds on MI are easy to optimize, but have a\nstrong underestimation bias when estimating large amounts of MI. We propose\ndecomposing the full MI estimation problem into a sum of smaller estimation\nproblems by splitting one of the views into progressively more informed\nsubviews and by applying the chain rule on MI between the decomposed views.\nThis expression contains a sum of unconditional and conditional MI terms, each\nmeasuring modest chunks of the total MI, which facilitates approximation via\ncontrastive bounds. To maximize the sum, we formulate a contrastive lower bound\non the conditional MI which can be approximated efficiently. We refer to our\ngeneral approach as Decomposed Estimation of Mutual Information (DEMI). We show\nthat DEMI can capture a larger amount of MI than standard non-decomposed\ncontrastive bounds in a synthetic setting, and learns better representations in\na vision domain and for dialogue generation.",

By applying deep-learning to\nextract high-level representations from graph structures, GNNs achieve\nextraordinary accuracy and great generalization ability in various tasks.\nHowever, with the ever-increasing graph sizes, more and more complicated GNN\nlayers, and higher feature dimensions, the computational complexity of GNNs\ngrows exponentially. How to inference GNNs in real time has become a\nchallenging problem, especially for some resource-limited edge-computing\nplatforms.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, we propose BlockGNN, a software-hardware co-design\napproach to realize efficient GNN acceleration. At the algorithm level, we\npropose to leverage block-circulant weight matrices to greatly reduce the\ncomplexity of various GNN models. At the hardware design level, we propose a\npipelined CirCore architecture, which supports efficient block-circulant\nmatrices computation.

          "description": "High-impedance faults (HIF) are difficult to detect because of their low\ncurrent amplitude and highly diverse characteristics. In recent years, machine\nlearning (ML) has been gaining popularity in HIF detection because ML\ntechniques learn patterns from data and successfully detect HIFs. However, as\nthese methods are based on supervised learning, they fail to reliably detect\nany scenario, fault or non-fault, not present in the training data.\nConsequently, this paper takes advantage of unsupervised learning and proposes\na convolutional autoencoder framework for HIF detection (CAE-HIFD). Contrary to\nthe conventional autoencoders that learn from normal behavior, the\nconvolutional autoencoder (CAE) in CAE-HIFD learns only from the HIF signals\neliminating the need for presence of diverse non-HIF scenarios in the CAE\ntraining. CAE distinguishes HIFs from non-HIF operating conditions by employing\ncross-correlation. To discriminate HIFs from transient disturbances such as\ncapacitor or load switching, CAE-HIFD uses kurtosis, a statistical measure of\nthe probability distribution shape. The performance evaluation studies\nconducted using the IEEE 13-node test feeder indicate that the CAE-HIFD\nreliably detects HIFs, outperforms the state-of-the-art HIF detection\ntechniques, and is robust against noise.",

          "description": "We investigate the large-scale clustering of the final spectroscopic sample\nof quasars from the recently completed extended Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). The sample contains $343708$ objects in the\nredshift range $0.8<z<2.2$ and $72667$ objects with redshifts $2.2<z<3.5$,\ncovering an effective area of $4699~{\\rm deg}^{2}$. We develop a neural\nnetwork-based approach to mitigate spurious fluctuations in the density field\ncaused by spatial variations in the quality of the imaging data used to select\ntargets for follow-up spectroscopy. Simulations are used with the same angular\nand radial distributions as the real data to estimate covariance matrices,\nperform error analyses, and assess residual systematic uncertainties. We\nmeasure the mean density contrast and cross-correlations of the eBOSS quasars\nagainst maps of potential sources of imaging systematics to address algorithm\neffectiveness, finding that the neural network-based approach outperforms\nstandard linear regression. Stellar density is one of the most important\nsources of spurious fluctuations, and a new template constructed using data\nfrom the Gaia spacecraft provides the best match to the observed quasar\nclustering. The end-product from this work is a new value-added quasar\ncatalogue with the improved weights to correct for nonlinear imaging systematic\neffects, which will be made public. Our quasar catalogue is used to measure the\nlocal-type primordial non-Gaussianity in our companion paper, Mueller et al. in\npreparation.",

          "description": "Although the optimization objectives for learning neural networks are highly\nnon-convex, gradient-based methods have been wildly successful at learning\nneural networks in practice. This juxtaposition has led to a number of recent\nstudies on provable guarantees for neural networks trained by gradient descent.\nUnfortunately, the techniques in these works are often highly specific to the\nproblem studied in each setting, relying on different assumptions on the\ndistribution, optimization parameters, and network architectures, making it\ndifficult to generalize across different settings. In this work, we propose a\nunified non-convex optimization framework for the analysis of neural network\ntraining. We introduce the notions of proxy convexity and proxy\nPolyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequalities, which are satisfied if the original\nobjective function induces a proxy objective function that is implicitly\nminimized when using gradient methods. We show that stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) on objectives satisfying proxy convexity or the proxy PL inequality leads\nto efficient guarantees for proxy objective functions. We further show that\nmany existing guarantees for neural networks trained by gradient descent can be\nunified through proxy convexity and proxy PL inequalities.",

          "description": "We address voice activity detection in acoustic environments of transients\nand stationary noises, which often occur in real life scenarios. We exploit\nunique spatial patterns of speech and non-speech audio frames by independently\nlearning their underlying geometric structure. This process is done through a\ndeep encoder-decoder based neural network architecture. This structure involves\nan encoder that maps spectral features with temporal information to their\nlow-dimensional representations, which are generated by applying the diffusion\nmaps method. The encoder feeds a decoder that maps the embedded data back into\nthe high-dimensional space. A deep neural network, which is trained to separate\nspeech from non-speech frames, is obtained by concatenating the decoder to the\nencoder, resembling the known Diffusion nets architecture. Experimental results\nshow enhanced performance compared to competing voice activity detection\nmethods. The improvement is achieved in both accuracy, robustness and\ngeneralization ability.

Traditional matrix decomposition\nmethods applied to such data fall short of exploiting structural regularities\nencoded in the underlying graph and also in the temporal patterns of the\nsignal. How can we take into account such structure to obtain a succinct and\ninterpretable representation of temporal graph signals?\n\nWe propose a general, dictionary-based framework for temporal graph signal\ndecomposition (TGSD).

We propose a highly\nscalable decomposition algorithm for both complete and incomplete data, and\ndemonstrate its advantage for matrix decomposition, imputation of missing\nvalues, temporal interpolation, clustering, period estimation, and rank\nestimation in synthetic and real-world data ranging from traffic patterns to\nsocial media activity. Our framework achieves 28% reduction in RMSE compared to\nbaselines for temporal interpolation when as many as 75% of the observations\nare missing.

          "description": "Regularization plays a vital role in machine learning optimization. One novel\nregularization method called flooding makes the training loss fluctuate around\nthe flooding level. It intends to make the model continue to random walk until\nit comes to a flat loss landscape to enhance generalization. However, the\nhyper-parameter flooding level of the flooding method fails to be selected\nproperly and uniformly. We propose a novel method called Jitter to improve it.\nJitter is essentially a kind of random loss function. Before training, we\nrandomly sample the Jitter Point from a specific probability distribution. The\nflooding level should be replaced by Jitter point to obtain a new target\nfunction and train the model accordingly. As Jitter point acting as a random\nfactor, we actually add some randomness to the loss function, which is\nconsistent with the fact that there exists innumerable random behaviors in the\nlearning process of the machine learning model and is supposed to make the\nmodel more robust. In addition, Jitter performs random walk randomly which\ndivides the loss curve into small intervals and then flipping them over,\nideally making the loss curve much flatter and enhancing generalization\nability. Moreover, Jitter can be a domain-, task-, and model-independent\nregularization method and train the model effectively after the training error\nreduces to zero. Our experimental results show that Jitter method can improve\nmodel performance more significantly than the previous flooding method and make\nthe test loss curve descend twice.",

          "description": "Accurate modeling of boundary conditions is crucial in computational physics.\nThe ever increasing use of neural networks as surrogates for physics-related\nproblems calls for an improved understanding of boundary condition treatment,\nand its influence on the network accuracy. In this paper, several strategies to\nimpose boundary conditions (namely padding, improved spatial context, and\nexplicit encoding of physical boundaries) are investigated in the context of\nfully convolutional networks applied to recurrent tasks. These strategies are\nevaluated on two spatio-temporal evolving problems modeled by partial\ndifferential equations: the 2D propagation of acoustic waves (hyperbolic PDE)\nand the heat equation (parabolic PDE). Results reveal a high sensitivity of\nboth accuracy and stability on the boundary implementation in such recurrent\ntasks. It is then demonstrated that the choice of the optimal padding strategy\nis directly linked to the data semantics. Furthermore, the inclusion of\nadditional input spatial context or explicit physics-based rules allows a\nbetter handling of boundaries in particular for large number of recurrences,\nresulting in more robust and stable neural networks, while facilitating the\ndesign and versatility of such networks.",

          "description": "Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide and Optical\nCoherence Tomography (OCT) is the quintessential imaging technique for its\ndetection. Unlike most of the state-of-the-art studies focused on glaucoma\ndetection, in this paper, we propose, for the first time, a novel framework for\nglaucoma grading using raw circumpapillary B-scans. In particular, we set out a\nnew OCT-based hybrid network which combines hand-driven and deep learning\nalgorithms. An OCT-specific descriptor is proposed to extract hand-crafted\nfeatures related to the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). In parallel, an\ninnovative CNN is developed using skip-connections to include tailored residual\nand attention modules to refine the automatic features of the latent space. The\nproposed architecture is used as a backbone to conduct a novel few-shot\nlearning based on static and dynamic prototypical networks. The k-shot paradigm\nis redefined giving rise to a supervised end-to-end system which provides\nsubstantial improvements discriminating between healthy, early and advanced\nglaucoma samples. The training and evaluation processes of the dynamic\nprototypical network are addressed from two fused databases acquired via\nHeidelberg Spectralis system. Validation and testing results reach a\ncategorical accuracy of 0.9459 and 0.8788 for glaucoma grading, respectively.\nBesides, the high performance reported by the proposed model for glaucoma\ndetection deserves a special mention. The findings from the class activation\nmaps are directly in line with the clinicians' opinion since the heatmaps\npointed out the RNFL as the most relevant structure for glaucoma diagnosis.",

          "description": "Deep learning based molecular graph generation and optimization has recently\nbeen attracting attention due to its great potential for de novo drug design.\nOn the one hand, recent models are able to efficiently learn a given graph\ndistribution, and many approaches have proven very effective to produce a\nmolecule that maximizes a given score. On the other hand, it was shown by\nprevious studies that generated optimized molecules are often unrealistic, even\nwith the inclusion of mechanics to enforce similarity to a dataset of real drug\nmolecules. In this work we use a hybrid approach, where the dataset\ndistribution is learned using an autoregressive model while the score\noptimization is done using the Metropolis algorithm, biased toward the learned\ndistribution. We show that the resulting method, that we call learned realism\nsampling (LRS), produces empirically more realistic molecules and outperforms\nall recent baselines in the task of molecule optimization with similarity\nconstraints.",

          "description": "While predictive policing has become increasingly common in assisting with\ndecisions in the criminal justice system, the use of these results is still\ncontroversial. Some software based on deep learning lacks accuracy (e.g., in\nF-1), and many decision processes are not transparent causing doubt about\ndecision bias, such as perceived racial, age, and gender disparities. This\npaper addresses bias issues with post-hoc explanations to provide a trustable\nprediction of whether a person will receive future criminal charges given one's\nprevious criminal records by learning temporal behavior patterns over twenty\nyears. Bi-LSTM relieves the vanishing gradient problem, and attentional\nmechanisms allows learning and interpretation of feature importance. Our\napproach shows consistent and reliable prediction precision and recall on a\nreal-life dataset. Our analysis of the importance of each input feature shows\nthe critical causal impact on decision-making, suggesting that criminal\nhistories are statistically significant factors, while identifiers, such as\nrace, gender, and age, are not. Finally, our algorithm indicates that a suspect\ntends to gradually rather than suddenly increase crime severity level over\ntime.",

While many deep neural networks\nhave shown impressive performance in terms of predictive accuracy, it has been\nshown that in many instances an imperceptible perturbation can falsely flip the\nnetwork's prediction. Most research has then focused on developing defenses\nagainst adversarial attacks or learning under a worst-case adversarial loss. In\nthis work, we take a step back and aim to provide a framework for determining\nwhether a model's label change under small perturbation is justified (and when\nit is not). We carefully argue that adversarial robustness should be defined as\na locally adaptive measure complying with the underlying distribution. We then\nsuggest a definition for an adaptive robust loss, derive an empirical version\nof it, and develop a resulting data-augmentation framework.

          "description": "Federated learning has emerged as an important paradigm for training machine\nlearning models in different domains. For graph-level tasks such as graph\nclassification, graphs can also be regarded as a special type of data samples,\nwhich can be collected and stored in separate local systems. Similar to other\ndomains, multiple local systems, each holding a small set of graphs, may\nbenefit from collaboratively training a powerful graph mining model, such as\nthe popular graph neural networks (GNNs). To provide more motivation towards\nsuch endeavors, we analyze real-world graphs from different domains to confirm\nthat they indeed share certain graph properties that are statistically\nsignificant compared with random graphs. However, we also find that different\nsets of graphs, even from the same domain or same dataset, are non-IID\nregarding both graph structures and node features. To handle this, we propose a\ngraph clustering federated learning (GCFL) framework that dynamically finds\nclusters of local systems based on the gradients of GNNs, and theoretically\njustify that such clusters can reduce the structure and feature heterogeneity\namong graphs owned by the local systems. Moreover, we observe the gradients of\nGNNs to be rather fluctuating in GCFL which impedes high-quality clustering,\nand design a gradient sequence-based clustering mechanism based on dynamic time\nwarping (GCFL+). Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of online classification under a privacy constraint.\nIn this setting a learner observes sequentially a stream of labelled examples\n$(x_t, y_t)$, for $1 \\leq t \\leq T$, and returns at each iteration $t$ a\nhypothesis $h_t$ which is used to predict the label of each new example $x_t$.\nThe learner's performance is measured by her regret against a known hypothesis\nclass $\\mathcal{H}$. We require that the algorithm satisfies the following\nprivacy constraint: the sequence $h_1, \\ldots, h_T$ of hypotheses output by the\nalgorithm needs to be an $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differentially private function\nof the whole input sequence $(x_1, y_1), \\ldots, (x_T, y_T)$. We provide the\nfirst non-trivial regret bound for the realizable setting. Specifically, we\nshow that if the class $\\mathcal{H}$ has constant Littlestone dimension then,\ngiven an oblivious sequence of labelled examples, there is a private learner\nthat makes in expectation at most $O(\\log T)$ mistakes -- comparable to the\noptimal mistake bound in the non-private case, up to a logarithmic factor.\nMoreover, for general values of the Littlestone dimension $d$, the same mistake\nbound holds but with a doubly-exponential in $d$ factor. A recent line of work\nhas demonstrated a strong connection between classes that are online learnable\nand those that are differentially-private learnable. Our results strengthen\nthis connection and show that an online learning algorithm can in fact be\ndirectly privatized (in the realizable setting). We also discuss an adaptive\nsetting and provide a sublinear regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{T})$.",

          "description": "The fundamental task of classification given a limited number of training\ndata samples is considered for physical systems with known parametric\nstatistical models. The standalone learning-based and statistical model-based\nclassifiers face major challenges towards the fulfillment of the classification\ntask using a small training set. Specifically, classifiers that solely rely on\nthe physics-based statistical models usually suffer from their inability to\nproperly tune the underlying unobservable parameters, which leads to a\nmismatched representation of the system's behaviors. Learning-based\nclassifiers, on the other hand, typically rely on a large number of training\ndata from the underlying physical process, which might not be feasible in most\npractical scenarios. In this paper, a hybrid classification method -- termed\nHyPhyLearn -- is proposed that exploits both the physics-based statistical\nmodels and the learning-based classifiers. The proposed solution is based on\nthe conjecture that HyPhyLearn would alleviate the challenges associated with\nthe individual approaches of learning-based and statistical model-based\nclassifiers by fusing their respective strengths. The proposed hybrid approach\nfirst estimates the unobservable model parameters using the available\n(suboptimal) statistical estimation procedures, and subsequently use the\nphysics-based statistical models to generate synthetic data. Then, the training\ndata samples are incorporated with the synthetic data in a learning-based\nclassifier that is based on domain-adversarial training of neural networks.\nSpecifically, in order to address the mismatch problem, the classifier learns a\nmapping from the training data and the synthetic data to a common feature\nspace. Simultaneously, the classifier is trained to find discriminative\nfeatures within this space in order to fulfill the classification task.",

However, most\npretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web.\nA prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by\nstarting from general-domain language models. In this paper, we challenge this\nassumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as\nbiomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial\ngains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To\nfacilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP\nbenchmark from publicly-available datasets.

Collecting data with multiple different robotic platforms with\npossibly different dynamics is a more scalable approach to large-scale data\ncollection. But how can deep reinforcement learning algorithms leverage such\nheterogeneous datasets? In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning\nalgorithm with hierarchically integrated models (HInt). At training time, HInt\nlearns separate perception and dynamics models, and at test time, HInt\nintegrates the two models in a hierarchical manner and plans actions with the\nintegrated model. This method of planning with hierarchically integrated models\nallows the algorithm to train on datasets gathered by a variety of different\nplatforms, while respecting the physical capabilities of the deployment robot\nat test time.

          "description": "Recently, transformers have shown great superiority in solving computer\nvision tasks by modeling images as a sequence of manually-split patches with\nself-attention mechanism. However, current architectures of vision transformers\n(ViTs) are simply inherited from natural language processing (NLP) tasks and\nhave not been sufficiently investigated and optimized. In this paper, we make a\nfurther step by examining the intrinsic structure of transformers for vision\ntasks and propose an architecture search method, dubbed ViTAS, to search for\nthe optimal architecture with similar hardware budgets. Concretely, we design a\nnew effective yet efficient weight sharing paradigm for ViTs, such that\narchitectures with different token embedding, sequence size, number of heads,\nwidth, and depth can be derived from a single super-transformer. Moreover, to\ncater for the variance of distinct architectures, we introduce \\textit{private}\nclass token and self-attention maps in the super-transformer. In addition, to\nadapt the searching for different budgets, we propose to search the sampling\nprobability of identity operation. Experimental results show that our ViTAS\nattains excellent results compared to existing pure transformer architectures.\nFor example, with $1.3$G FLOPs budget, our searched architecture achieves\n$74.7\\%$ top-$1$ accuracy on ImageNet and is $2.5\\%$ superior than the current\nbaseline ViT architecture.

In this study, we demonstrate the\nuse of agronomic knowledge of crop growth drivers in a Long Short-Term\nMemory-based, Domain-guided neural network (DgNN) for in-season crop progress\nestimation. The DgNN uses a branched structure and attention to separate\nindependent crop growth drivers and capture their varying importance throughout\nthe growing season. The DgNN is implemented for corn, using RS data in Iowa for\nthe period 2003-2019, with USDA crop progress reports used as ground truth.\nState-wide DgNN performance shows significant improvement over sequential and\ndense-only NN structures, and a widely-used Hidden Markov Model method. The\nDgNN had a 3.5% higher Nash-Sutfliffe efficiency over all growth stages and 33%\nmore weeks with highest cosine similarity than the other NNs during test years.\nThe DgNN and Sequential NN were more robust during periods of abnormal crop\nprogress, though estimating the Silking-Grainfill transition was difficult for\nall methods. Finally, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection\nvisualizations of layer activations showed how LSTM-based NNs separate crop\ngrowth time-series differently from a dense-only structure. Results from this\nstudy exhibit both the viability of NNs in crop growth stage estimation (CGSE)\nand the benefits of using domain knowledge.

          "description": "Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire has frequently been used for\nefficient depression preliminary screening. However, the uncontrollable\nself-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively\nanswering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered\nHamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically,\nfacial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered\nevaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered\nevaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to\nevidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding\nquestion-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the\nSDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical\nframework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on\nthe questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a\nhierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern\nexploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for\nquestion-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term\nFE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of\neach video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative\ninformation and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity.\nThen, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire\nscores for final depression detection. Our thorough evaluations also show the\nvalidity of fusing SDS evaluation and its video recording, and the superiority\nof our framework to the conventional state-of-the-art temporal modeling\nmethods.",

Decision-making systems that can perform\nthese types of reasoning have the potential to be more generalizable and\ninterpretable. Simulations have helped advance the state-of-the-art in this\ndomain, by providing the ability to systematically vary parameters (e.g.,\nconfounders) and generate examples of the outcomes in the case of\ncounterfactual scenarios. However, simulating complex temporal causal events in\nmulti-agent scenarios, such as those that exist in driving and vehicle\nnavigation, is challenging. To help address this, we present a high-fidelity\nsimulation environment that is designed for developing algorithms for causal\ndiscovery and counterfactual reasoning in the safety-critical context. A core\ncomponent of our work is to introduce \\textit{agency}, such that it is simple\nto define and create complex scenarios using high-level definitions. The\nvehicles then operate with agency to complete these objectives, meaning\nlow-level behaviors need only be controlled if necessary. We perform\nexperiments with three state-of-the-art methods to create baselines and\nhighlight the affordances of this environment.

We present a compact and two exponential size integer programs (IPs)\nfor k-BMF and show that the compact IP has a weak LP relaxation, while the\nexponential size LPs have a stronger equivalent LP relaxation. We introduce a\nnew objective function, which differs from the traditional squared Frobenius\nobjective in attributing a weight to zero entries of the input matrix that is\nproportional to the number of times the zero is erroneously covered in a rank-k\nfactorisation. For one of the exponential size IPs we describe a computational\napproach based on column generation.

          "description": "One-class learning is the classic problem of fitting a model to the data for\nwhich annotations are available only for a single class. In this paper, we\nexplore novel objectives for one-class learning, which we collectively refer to\nas Generalized One-class Discriminative Subspaces (GODS). Our key idea is to\nlearn a pair of complementary classifiers to flexibly bound the one-class data\ndistribution, where the data belongs to the positive half-space of one of the\nclassifiers in the complementary pair and to the negative half-space of the\nother. To avoid redundancy while allowing non-linearity in the classifier\ndecision surfaces, we propose to design each classifier as an orthonormal frame\nand seek to learn these frames via jointly optimizing for two conflicting\nobjectives, namely: i) to minimize the distance between the two frames, and ii)\nto maximize the margin between the frames and the data. The learned orthonormal\nframes will thus characterize a piecewise linear decision surface that allows\nfor efficient inference, while our objectives seek to bound the data within a\nminimal volume that maximizes the decision margin, thereby robustly capturing\nthe data distribution. We explore several variants of our formulation under\ndifferent constraints on the constituent classifiers, including kernelized\nfeature maps. We demonstrate the empirical benefits of our approach via\nexperiments on data from several applications in computer vision, such as\nanomaly detection in video sequences, human poses, and human activities. We\nalso explore the generality and effectiveness of GODS for non-vision tasks via\nexperiments on several UCI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.",

In fact, one can use null prompts,\nprompts that contain neither task-specific templates nor training examples, and\nachieve competitive accuracy to manually-tuned prompts across a wide range of\ntasks. While finetuning LMs does introduce new parameters for each downstream\ntask, we show that this memory overhead can be substantially reduced:\nfinetuning only the bias terms can achieve comparable or better accuracy than\nstandard finetuning while only updating 0.1% of the parameters.

We extend the powerful Kolmogorov-Smirnov two sample\ntest to a high dimensional form in a similar manner to Fasano (Fasano, 1987).\nWe call our result the d-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (ddKS) and provide\nthree novel contributions therewith: we develop an analytical equation for the\nsignificance of a given ddKS score, we provide an algorithm for computation of\nddKS on modern computing hardware that is of constant time complexity for small\nsample sizes and dimensions, and we provide two approximate calculations of\nddKS: one that reduces the time complexity to linear at larger sample sizes,\nand another that reduces the time complexity to linear with increasing\ndimension. We perform power analysis of ddKS and its approximations on a corpus\nof datasets and compare to other common high dimensional two sample tests and\ndistances: Hotelling's T^2 test and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our ddKS test\nperforms well for all datasets, dimensions, and sizes tested, whereas the other\ntests and distances fail to reject the null hypothesis on at least one dataset.\nWe therefore conclude that ddKS is a powerful multidimensional two sample test\nfor general use, and can be calculated in a fast and efficient manner using our\nparallel or approximate methods.

          "description": "Machine learning for building energy prediction has exploded in popularity in\nrecent years, yet understanding its limitations and potential for improvement\nare lacking. The ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) Kaggle competition\nwas the largest building energy meter machine learning competition ever held\nwith 4,370 participants who submitted 39,403 predictions. The test data set\nincluded two years of hourly electricity, hot water, chilled water, and steam\nreadings from 2,380 meters in 1,448 buildings at 16 locations. This paper\nanalyzes the various sources and types of residual model error from an\naggregation of the competition's top 50 solutions. This analysis reveals the\nlimitations for machine learning using the standard model inputs of historical\nmeter, weather, and basic building metadata. The types of error are classified\naccording to the amount of time errors occur in each instance, abrupt versus\ngradual behavior, the magnitude of error, and whether the error existed on\nsingle buildings or several buildings at once from a single location. The\nresults show machine learning models have errors within a range of\nacceptability on 79.1% of the test data. Lower magnitude model errors occur in\n16.1% of the test data. These discrepancies can likely be addressed through\nadditional training data sources or innovations in machine learning. Higher\nmagnitude errors occur in 4.8% of the test data and are unlikely to be\naccurately predicted regardless of innovation. There is a diversity of error\nbehavior depending on the energy meter type (electricity prediction models have\nunacceptable error in under 10% of test data, while hot water is over 60%) and\nbuilding use type (public service less than 14%, while technology/science is\njust over 46%).",

          "description": "Many modern time-series datasets contain large numbers of output response\nvariables sampled for prolonged periods of time. For example, in neuroscience,\nthe activities of 100s-1000's of neurons are recorded during behaviors and in\nresponse to sensory stimuli. Multi-output Gaussian process models leverage the\nnonparametric nature of Gaussian processes to capture structure across multiple\noutputs. However, this class of models typically assumes that the correlations\nbetween the output response variables are invariant in the input space.\nStochastic linear mixing models (SLMM) assume the mixture coefficients depend\non input, making them more flexible and effective to capture complex output\ndependence. However, currently, the inference for SLMMs is intractable for\nlarge datasets, making them inapplicable to several modern time-series\nproblems. In this paper, we propose a new regression framework, the orthogonal\nstochastic linear mixing model (OSLMM) that introduces an orthogonal constraint\namongst the mixing coefficients. This constraint reduces the computational\nburden of inference while retaining the capability to handle complex output\ndependence. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo inference procedures for both\nSLMM and OSLMM and demonstrate superior model scalability and reduced\nprediction error of OSLMM compared with state-of-the-art methods on several\nreal-world applications. In neurophysiology recordings, we use the inferred\nlatent functions for compact visualization of population responses to auditory\nstimuli, and demonstrate superior results compared to a competing method\n(GPFA). Together, these results demonstrate that OSLMM will be useful for the\nanalysis of diverse, large-scale time-series datasets.",

          "description": "Multifidelity simulation methodologies are often used in an attempt to\njudiciously combine low-fidelity and high-fidelity simulation results in an\naccuracy-increasing, cost-saving way. Candidates for this approach are\nsimulation methodologies for which there are fidelity differences connected\nwith significant computational cost differences. Physics-informed Neural\nNetworks (PINNs) are candidates for these types of approaches due to the\nsignificant difference in training times required when different fidelities\n(expressed in terms of architecture width and depth as well as optimization\ncriteria) are employed. In this paper, we propose a particular multifidelity\napproach applied to PINNs that exploits low-rank structure. We demonstrate that\nwidth, depth, and optimization criteria can be used as parameters related to\nmodel fidelity, and show numerical justification of cost differences in\ntraining due to fidelity parameter choices.

In this paper, we first analyze the noisy client statement,\nand then model noisy clients with different noise distributions (e.g.,\nBernoulli and truncated Gaussian distributions). To learn with noisy clients,\nwe propose a simple yet effective FL framework, named Federated Noisy Client\nLearning (Fed-NCL), which is a plug-and-play algorithm and contains two main\ncomponents: a data quality measurement (DQM) to dynamically quantify the data\nquality of each participating client, and a noise robust aggregation (NRA) to\nadaptively aggregate the local models of each client by jointly considering the\namount of local training data and the data quality of each client.

Our approach is based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) that\nproject the limited information available to a reduced-order manifold so as to\nnot only reconstruct the unknown information, but also to be capable of\nperforming fluid reasoning about future scenarios in real time. To obtain\nphysically consistent predictions, we train deep neural networks on the\nreduced-order manifold that, through the employ of inductive biases, ensure the\nfulfillment of the principles of thermodynamics. RNNs learn from history the\nrequired hidden information to correlate the limited information with the\nlatent space where the simulation occurs. Finally, a decoder returns data back\nto the high-dimensional manifold, so as to provide the user with insightful\ninformation in the form of augmented reality. This algorithm is connected to a\ncomputer vision system to test the performance of the proposed methodology with\nreal information, resulting in a system capable of understanding and predicting\nfuture states of the observed fluid in real-time.",

A representation vector is produced using the averaged\nembedding vectors of byte-level n-grams, with a pre-defined set of n. The\nhashing trick is used to reduce the number of embedding vectors.

          "description": "This paper raises a rarely reported practice in Artificial Intelligence (AI)\ncalled Post Selection Using Test Sets (PSUTS). Consequently, the popular\nerror-backprop methodology in deep learning lacks an acceptable generalization\npower. All AI methods fall into two broad schools, connectionist and symbolic.\nThe PSUTS fall into two kinds, machine PSUTS and human PSUTS. The connectionist\nschool received criticisms for its \"scruffiness\" due to a huge number of\nnetwork parameters and now the worse machine PSUTS; but the seemingly \"clean\"\nsymbolic school seems more brittle because of a weaker generalization power\nusing human PSUTS. This paper formally defines what PSUTS is, analyzes why\nerror-backprop methods with random initial weights suffer from severe local\nminima, why PSUTS violates well-established research ethics, and how every\npaper that used PSUTS should have at least transparently reported PSUTS. For\nimproved transparency in future publications, this paper proposes a new\nstandard for performance evaluation of AI, called developmental errors for all\nnetworks trained, along with Three Learning Conditions: (1) an incremental\nlearning architecture, (2) a training experience and (3) a limited amount of\ncomputational resources.

          "description": "Understanding the semantics of human movement -- the what, how and why of the\nmovement -- is an important problem that requires datasets of human actions\nwith semantic labels. Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale\nvideo datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D\nhuman motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body\nmotions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we\npresent BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions\nbeing performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about\n43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of\nabstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and\nframe labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame\nlabel is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the\nmocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence\nlabels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action\ncategories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action\nrecognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To\ndemonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of\nmodels on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting\nlearning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve\nas a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition.

          "description": "Singular value decomposition is central to many problems in engineering and\nscientific fields. Several quantum algorithms have been proposed to determine\nthe singular values and their associated singular vectors of a given matrix.\nAlthough these algorithms are promising, the required quantum subroutines and\nresources are too costly on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose\na variational quantum algorithm for singular value decomposition (VQSVD). By\nexploiting the variational principles for singular values and the Ky Fan\nTheorem, we design a novel loss function such that two quantum neural networks\n(or parameterized quantum circuits) could be trained to learn the singular\nvectors and output the corresponding singular values. Furthermore, we conduct\nnumerical simulations of VQSVD for random matrices as well as its applications\nin image compression of handwritten digits. Finally, we discuss the\napplications of our algorithm in recommendation systems and polar\ndecomposition. Our work explores new avenues for quantum information processing\nbeyond the conventional protocols that only works for Hermitian data, and\nreveals the capability of matrix decomposition on near-term quantum devices.",

The non-parametric Bayesian approach\nis important because it provides flexible Hawkes kernels and quantifies their\nuncertainty. Our method is based on the cluster representation of Hawkes\nprocesses. Utilizing the stationarity of the Hawkes process, we efficiently\nsample random branching structures and thus, we split the Hawkes process into\nclusters of Poisson processes. We derive two algorithms -- a block Gibbs\nsampler and a maximum a posteriori estimator based on expectation maximization\n-- and we show that our methods have a linear time complexity, both\ntheoretically and empirically. On synthetic data, we show our methods to be\nable to infer flexible Hawkes triggering kernels. On two large-scale Twitter\ndiffusion datasets, we show that our methods outperform the current\nstate-of-the-art in goodness-of-fit and that the time complexity is linear in\nthe size of the dataset.

          "description": "In recent years, implicit deep learning has emerged as a method to increase\nthe depth of deep neural networks. While their training is memory-efficient,\nthey are still significantly slower to train than their explicit counterparts.\nIn Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs), the training is performed as a bi-level\nproblem, and its computational complexity is partially driven by the iterative\ninversion of a huge Jacobian matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy\nto tackle this computational bottleneck from which many bi-level problems\nsuffer. The main idea is to use the quasi-Newton matrices from the forward pass\nto efficiently approximate the inverse Jacobian matrix in the direction needed\nfor the gradient computation. We provide a theorem that motivates using our\nmethod with the original forward algorithms. In addition, by modifying these\nforward algorithms, we further provide theoretical guarantees that our method\nasymptotically estimates the true implicit gradient. We empirically study this\napproach in many settings, ranging from hyperparameter optimization to large\nMultiscale DEQs applied to CIFAR and ImageNet. We show that it reduces the\ncomputational cost of the backward pass by up to two orders of magnitude. All\nthis is achieved while retaining the excellent performance of the original\nmodels in hyperparameter optimization and on CIFAR, and giving encouraging and\ncompetitive results on ImageNet.",

          "description": "This paper addresses the problem of combining Byzantine resilience with\nprivacy in machine learning (ML). Specifically, we study if a distributed\nimplementation of the renowned Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) learning\nalgorithm is feasible with both differential privacy (DP) and\n$(\\alpha,f)$-Byzantine resilience. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work to tackle this problem from a theoretical point of view. A key\nfinding of our analyses is that the classical approaches to these two\n(seemingly) orthogonal issues are incompatible. More precisely, we show that a\ndirect composition of these techniques makes the guarantees of the resulting\nSGD algorithm depend unfavourably upon the number of parameters of the ML\nmodel, making the training of large models practically infeasible. We validate\nour theoretical results through numerical experiments on publicly-available\ndatasets; showing that it is impractical to ensure DP and Byzantine resilience\nsimultaneously.",

In this paper, we\nadvance a novel model-agnostic, case-based technique -- Native Guide -- that\ngenerates counterfactual explanations for time series classifiers. Given a\nquery time series, $T_{q}$, for which a black-box classification system\npredicts class, $c$, a counterfactual time series explanation shows how $T_{q}$\ncould change, such that the system predicts an alternative class, $c'$. The\nproposed instance-based technique adapts existing counterfactual instances in\nthe case-base by highlighting and modifying discriminative areas of the time\nseries that underlie the classification.

          "description": "Likelihood is a standard estimate for outlier detection. The specific role of\nthe normalization constraint is to ensure that the out-of-distribution (OOD)\nregime has a small likelihood when samples are learned using maximum\nlikelihood. Because autoencoders do not possess such a process of\nnormalization, they often fail to recognize outliers even when they are\nobviously OOD. We propose the Normalized Autoencoder (NAE), a normalized\nprobabilistic model constructed from an autoencoder. The probability density of\nNAE is defined using the reconstruction error of an autoencoder, which is\ndifferently defined in the conventional energy-based model. In our model,\nnormalization is enforced by suppressing the reconstruction of negative\nsamples, significantly improving the outlier detection performance.

          "description": "Motivated by models for multiway comparison data, we consider the problem of\nestimating a coordinate-wise isotonic function on the domain $[0, 1]^d$ from\nnoisy observations collected on a uniform lattice, but where the design points\nhave been permuted along each dimension. While the univariate and bivariate\nversions of this problem have received significant attention, our focus is on\nthe multivariate case $d \\geq 3$. We study both the minimax risk of estimation\n(in empirical $L_2$ loss) and the fundamental limits of adaptation (quantified\nby the adaptivity index) to a family of piecewise constant functions. We\nprovide a computationally efficient Mirsky partition estimator that is minimax\noptimal while also achieving the smallest adaptivity index possible for\npolynomial time procedures. Thus, from a worst-case perspective and in sharp\ncontrast to the bivariate case, the latent permutations in the model do not\nintroduce significant computational difficulties over and above vanilla\nisotonic regression. On the other hand, the fundamental limits of adaptation\nare significantly different with and without unknown permutations: Assuming a\nhardness conjecture from average-case complexity theory, a\nstatistical-computational gap manifests in the former case. In a complementary\ndirection, we show that natural modifications of existing estimators fail to\nsatisfy at least one of the desiderata of optimal worst-case statistical\nperformance, computational efficiency, and fast adaptation. Along the way to\nshowing our results, we improve adaptation results in the special case $d = 2$\nand establish some properties of estimators for vanilla isotonic regression,\nboth of which may be of independent interest.",

An RBF component is a generalization\nof the outer product between a pair of vectors, where an RBF function replaces\nthe scalar multiplication between individual vector elements. Even though the\nRBF functions are positive definite, the summation across components is not\nrestricted to convex combinations and allows us to compute the decomposition\nfor any real matrix that is not necessarily symmetric or positive definite. We\nformulate the problem of seeking such a decomposition as an optimization\nproblem with a nonlinear and non-convex loss function. Several modern versions\nof the gradient descent method, including their scalable stochastic\ncounterparts, are used to solve this problem. We provide extensive empirical\nevidence of the effectiveness of the RBF decomposition and that of the\ngradient-based fitting algorithm. While being conceptually motivated by\nsingular value decomposition (SVD), our proposed nonlinear counterpart\noutperforms SVD by drastically reducing the memory required to approximate a\ndata matrix with the same L2 error for a wide range of matrix types. For\nexample, it leads to 2 to 6 times memory save for Gaussian noise, graph\nadjacency matrices, and kernel matrices.

          "description": "Federated learning is emerging as a machine learning technique that trains a\nmodel across multiple decentralized parties. It is renowned for preserving\nprivacy as the data never leaves the computational devices, and recent\napproaches further enhance its privacy by hiding messages transferred in\nencryption. However, we found that despite the efforts, federated learning\nremains privacy-threatening, due to its interactive nature across different\nparties. In this paper, we analyze the privacy threats in industrial-level\nfederated learning frameworks with secure computation, and reveal such threats\nwidely exist in typical machine learning models such as linear regression,\nlogistic regression and decision tree. For the linear and logistic regression,\nwe show through theoretical analysis that it is possible for the attacker to\ninvert the entire private input of the victim, given very few information. For\nthe decision tree model, we launch an attack to infer the range of victim's\nprivate inputs. All attacks are evaluated on popular federated learning\nframeworks and real-world datasets.",

          "description": "Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is believed to have higher sample\nefficiency compared with model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). However,\nMBRL is plagued by dynamics bottleneck dilemma. Dynamics bottleneck dilemma is\nthe phenomenon that the performance of the algorithm falls into the local\noptimum instead of increasing when the interaction step with the environment\nincreases, which means more data can not bring better performance. In this\npaper, we find that the trajectory reward estimation error is the main reason\nthat causes dynamics bottleneck dilemma through theoretical analysis. We give\nan upper bound of the trajectory reward estimation error and point out that\nincreasing the agent's exploration ability is the key to reduce trajectory\nreward estimation error, thereby alleviating dynamics bottleneck dilemma.\nMotivated by this, a model-based control method combined with exploration named\nMOdel-based Progressive Entropy-based Exploration (MOPE2) is proposed. We\nconduct experiments on several complex continuous control benchmark tasks. The\nresults verify that MOPE2 can effectively alleviate dynamics bottleneck dilemma\nand have higher sample efficiency than previous MBRL and MFRL algorithms.",

          "description": "A key challenge in mining social media data streams is to identify events\nwhich are actively discussed by a group of people in a specific local or global\narea. Such events are useful for early warning for accident, protest, election\nor breaking news. However, neither the list of events nor the resolution of\nboth event time and space is fixed or known beforehand. In this work, we\npropose an online spatio-temporal event detection system using social media\nthat is able to detect events at different time and space resolutions. First,\nto address the challenge related to the unknown spatial resolution of events, a\nquad-tree method is exploited in order to split the geographical space into\nmultiscale regions based on the density of social media data. Then, a\nstatistical unsupervised approach is performed that involves Poisson\ndistribution and a smoothing method for highlighting regions with unexpected\ndensity of social posts. Further, event duration is precisely estimated by\nmerging events happening in the same region at consecutive time intervals. A\npost processing stage is introduced to filter out events that are spam, fake or\nwrong. Finally, we incorporate simple semantics by using social media entities\nto assess the integrity, and accuracy of detected events. The proposed method\nis evaluated using different social media datasets: Twitter and Flickr for\ndifferent cities: Melbourne, London, Paris and New York. To verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, we compare our results with two baseline\nalgorithms based on fixed split of geographical space and clustering method.\nFor performance evaluation, we manually compute recall and precision. We also\npropose a new quality measure named strength index, which automatically\nmeasures how accurate the reported event is.",

          "description": "When reasoning about strategic behavior in a machine learning context it is\ntempting to combine standard microfoundations of rational agents with the\nstatistical decision theory underlying classification. In this work, we argue\nthat a direct combination of these standard ingredients leads to brittle\nsolution concepts of limited descriptive and prescriptive value. First, we show\nthat rational agents with perfect information produce discontinuities in the\naggregate response to a decision rule that we often do not observe empirically.\nSecond, when any positive fraction of agents is not perfectly strategic,\ndesirable stable points -- where the classifier is optimal for the data it\nentails -- cease to exist. Third, optimal decision rules under standard\nmicrofoundations maximize a measure of negative externality known as social\nburden within a broad class of possible assumptions about agent behavior.\n\nRecognizing these limitations we explore alternatives to standard\nmicrofoundations for binary classification. We start by describing a set of\ndesiderata that help navigate the space of possible assumptions about how\nagents respond to a decision rule. In particular, we analyze a natural\nconstraint on feature manipulations, and discuss properties that are sufficient\nto guarantee the robust existence of stable points. Building on these insights,\nwe then propose the noisy response model. Inspired by smoothed analysis and\nempirical observations, noisy response incorporates imperfection in the agent\nresponses, which we show mitigates the limitations of standard\nmicrofoundations. Our model retains analytical tractability, leads to more\nrobust insights about stable points, and imposes a lower social burden at\noptimality.",

We also experimented with several other\nmore sophisticated methods of such mapping including, several auto-encoder\nbased and custom loss-function based methods that learn embedding\nrepresentations through gradually learning to be close to the words of similar\nsemantics and distant to dissimilar semantics.

When used as feature representations for several different machine\nlearning methods, including deep learning models in a depressive Tweets\nidentification task, we show that our augmented word embedding representations\nachieve a significantly better F1 score than the others, specially when applied\nto a high quality dataset.

          "description": "We propose a reparametrization scheme to address the challenges of applying\ndifferentially private SGD on large neural networks, which are 1) the huge\nmemory cost of storing individual gradients, 2) the added noise suffering\nnotorious dimensional dependence. Specifically, we reparametrize each weight\nmatrix with two \\emph{gradient-carrier} matrices of small dimension and a\n\\emph{residual weight} matrix. We argue that such reparametrization keeps the\nforward/backward process unchanged while enabling us to compute the projected\ngradient without computing the gradient itself. To learn with differential\nprivacy, we design \\emph{reparametrized gradient perturbation (RGP)} that\nperturbs the gradients on gradient-carrier matrices and reconstructs an update\nfor the original weight from the noisy gradients. Importantly, we use\nhistorical updates to find the gradient-carrier matrices, whose optimality is\nrigorously justified under linear regression and empirically verified with deep\nlearning tasks. RGP significantly reduces the memory cost and improves the\nutility. For example, we are the first able to apply differential privacy on\nthe BERT model and achieve an average accuracy of $83.9\\%$ on four downstream\ntasks with $\\epsilon=8$, which is within $5\\%$ loss compared to the non-private\nbaseline but enjoys much lower privacy leakage risk.",

          "description": "Computational virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS) with density\nfunctional theory (DFT) and machine-learning (ML)-acceleration is essential in\nrapid materials discovery. By necessity, efficient DFT-based workflows are\ncarried out with a single density functional approximation (DFA). Nevertheless,\nproperties evaluated with different DFAs can be expected to disagree for the\ncases with challenging electronic structure (e.g., open shell transition metal\ncomplexes, TMCs) for which rapid screening is most needed and accurate\nbenchmarks are often unavailable. To quantify the effect of DFA bias, we\nintroduce an approach to rapidly obtain property predictions from 23\nrepresentative DFAs spanning multiple families and \"rungs\" (e.g., semi-local to\ndouble hybrid) and basis sets on over 2,000 TMCs. Although computed properties\n(e.g., spin-state ordering and frontier orbital gap) naturally differ by DFA,\nhigh linear correlations persist across all DFAs.

We devise a\nstrategy to train ML models informed by all 23 DFAs and use them to predict\nproperties (e.g., spin-splitting energy) of over 182k TMCs.

          "description": "We study the recent emerging personalized federated learning (PFL) that aims\nat dealing with the challenging problem of Non-I.I.D. data in the federated\nlearning (FL) setting. The key difference between PFL and conventional FL lies\nin the training target, of which the personalized models in PFL usually pursue\na trade-off between personalization (i.e., usually from local models) and\ngeneralization (i.e., usually from the global model) on trained models.\nConventional FL methods can hardly meet this target because of their both\nwell-developed global and local models. The prevalent PFL approaches usually\nmaintain a global model to guide the training process of local models and\ntransfer a proper degree of generalization to them. However, the sole global\nmodel can only provide one direction of generalization and may even transfer\nnegative effects to some local models when rich statistical diversity exists\nacross multiple local datasets. Based on our observation, most real or\nsynthetic data distributions usually tend to be clustered to some degree, of\nwhich we argue different directions of generalization can facilitate the PFL.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel concept called clustered generalization to\nhandle the challenge of statistical heterogeneity in FL. Specifically, we\nmaintain multiple global (generalized) models in the server to associate with\nthe corresponding amount of local model clusters in clients, and further\nformulate the PFL as a bi-level optimization problem that can be solved\nefficiently and robustly. We also conduct detailed theoretical analysis and\nprovide the convergence guarantee for the smooth non-convex objectives.\nExperimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that our approach\nsurpasses the state-of-the-art by a significant margin.",

          "description": "The ability to combine known skills to create new ones may be crucial in the\nsolution of complex reinforcement learning problems that unfold over extended\nperiods. We argue that a robust way of combining skills is to define and\nmanipulate them in the space of pseudo-rewards (or \"cumulants\"). Based on this\npremise, we propose a framework for combining skills using the formalism of\noptions. We show that every deterministic option can be unambiguously\nrepresented as a cumulant defined in an extended domain. Building on this\ninsight and on previous results on transfer learning, we show how to\napproximate options whose cumulants are linear combinations of the cumulants of\nknown options. This means that, once we have learned options associated with a\nset of cumulants, we can instantaneously synthesise options induced by any\nlinear combination of them, without any learning involved. We describe how this\nframework provides a hierarchical interface to the environment whose abstract\nactions correspond to combinations of basic skills.

          "description": "Understanding the 3D world from 2D projected natural images is a fundamental\nchallenge in computer vision and graphics. Recently, an unsupervised learning\napproach has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantages in data\ncollection. However, to mitigate training limitations, typical methods need to\nimpose assumptions for viewpoint distribution (e.g., a dataset containing\nvarious viewpoint images) or object shape (e.g., symmetric objects). These\nassumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to\nnon-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or\nbird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose\naperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip\naperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and\ndepth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the\nambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth\ntexture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs),\nwe develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real\nimage distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise\na center focus prior to guiding the learning direction. In the experiments, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of AR-GANs in various datasets, such as flower,\nbird, and face images, demonstrate their portability by incorporating them into\nother 3D representation learning GANs, and validate their applicability in\nshallow DoF rendering.",

Since the need for\nmixed data representation comes from practical necessity, the advantages of our\nimplementations are evaluated in the context of solving approximation and gap\nrecovery problems on synthetic data and real datasets.",

          "description": "We derive a novel asymptotic problem-dependent lower-bound for regret\nminimization in finite-horizon tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While,\nsimilar to prior work (e.g., for ergodic MDPs), the lower-bound is the solution\nto an optimization problem, our derivation reveals the need for an additional\nconstraint on the visitation distribution over state-action pairs that\nexplicitly accounts for the dynamics of the MDP. We provide a characterization\nof our lower-bound through a series of examples illustrating how different MDPs\nmay have significantly different complexity. 1) We first consider a \"difficult\"\nMDP instance, where the novel constraint based on the dynamics leads to a\nlarger lower-bound (i.e., a larger regret) compared to the classical analysis.\n2) We then show that our lower-bound recovers results previously derived for\nspecific MDP instances. 3) Finally, we show that, in certain \"simple\" MDPs, the\nlower bound is considerably smaller than in the general case and it does not\nscale with the minimum action gap at all. We show that this last result is\nattainable (up to $poly(H)$ terms, where $H$ is the horizon) by providing a\nregret upper-bound based on policy gaps for an optimistic algorithm.",

          "description": "Convolutional networks are ubiquitous in deep learning. They are particularly\nuseful for images, as they reduce the number of parameters, reduce training\ntime, and increase accuracy. However, as a model of the brain they are\nseriously problematic, since they require weight sharing - something real\nneurons simply cannot do. Consequently, while neurons in the brain can be\nlocally connected (one of the features of convolutional networks), they cannot\nbe convolutional. Locally connected but non-convolutional networks, however,\nsignificantly underperform convolutional ones. This is troublesome for studies\nthat use convolutional networks to explain activity in the visual system. Here\nwe study plausible alternatives to weight sharing that aim at the same\nregularization principle, which is to make each neuron within a pool react\nsimilarly to identical inputs. The most natural way to do that is by showing\nthe network multiple translations of the same image, akin to saccades in animal\nvision. However, this approach requires many translations, and doesn't remove\nthe performance gap. We propose instead to add lateral connectivity to a\nlocally connected network, and allow learning via Hebbian plasticity. This\nrequires the network to pause occasionally for a sleep-like phase of \"weight\nsharing\". This method enables locally connected networks to achieve nearly\nconvolutional performance on ImageNet, thus supporting convolutional networks\nas a model of the visual stream.",

          "description": "The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) has become universal during\nthe past decade, which has afforded in-depth data-based research. By learning\nfrom the large amount of healthcare data, various data-driven models have been\nbuilt to predict future events for different medical tasks, such as auto\ndiagnosis and heart-attack prediction. Although EHR is abundant, the population\nthat satisfies specific criteria for learning population-specific tasks is\nscarce, making it challenging to train data-hungry deep learning models. This\nstudy presents the Claim Pre-Training (Claim-PT) framework, a generic\npre-training model that first trains on the entire pediatric claims dataset,\nfollowed by a discriminative fine-tuning on each population-specific task. The\nsemantic meaning of medical events can be captured in the pre-training stage,\nand the effective knowledge transfer is completed through the task-aware\nfine-tuning stage. The fine-tuning process requires minimal parameter\nmodification without changing the model architecture, which mitigates the data\nscarcity issue and helps train the deep learning model adequately on small\npatient cohorts. We conducted experiments on a real-world claims dataset with\nmore than one million patient records. Experimental results on two downstream\ntasks demonstrated the effectiveness of our method: our general task-agnostic\npre-training framework outperformed tailored task-specific models, achieving\nmore than 10\\% higher in model performance as compared to baselines. In\naddition, our framework showed a great generalizability potential to transfer\nlearned knowledge from one institution to another, paving the way for future\nhealthcare model pre-training across institutions.",

          "description": "An agent that is capable of predicting what happens next can perform a\nvariety of tasks through planning with no additional training. Furthermore,\nsuch an agent can internally represent the complex dynamics of the real-world\nand therefore can acquire a representation useful for a variety of visual\nperception tasks. This makes predicting the future frames of a video,\nconditioned on the observed past and potentially future actions, an interesting\ntask which remains exceptionally challenging despite many recent advances.\nExisting video prediction models have shown promising results on simple narrow\nbenchmarks but they generate low quality predictions on real-life datasets with\nmore complicated dynamics or broader domain. There is a growing body of\nevidence that underfitting on the training data is one of the primary causes\nfor the low quality predictions. In this paper, we argue that the inefficient\nuse of parameters in the current video models is the main reason for\nunderfitting. Therefore, we introduce a new architecture, named FitVid, which\nis capable of severe overfitting on the common benchmarks while having similar\nparameter count as the current state-of-the-art models. We analyze the\nconsequences of overfitting, illustrating how it can produce unexpected\noutcomes such as generating high quality output by repeating the training data,\nand how it can be mitigated using existing image augmentation techniques.

These models come with a set of pre-trained weights typically\nobtained in unsupervised/self-supervised modality on a huge amount of data.\nAfter that, they are fine-tuned on a specific task. Applications then use these\nmodels for inference, and often some additional constraints apply, like low\npower-budget or low latency between input and output. The main avenue to meet\nthese additional requirements for the inference settings, is to use low\nprecision computation (e.g. INT8 rather than FP32), but this comes with a cost\nof deteriorating the functional performance (e.g. accuracy) of the model. Some\napproaches have been developed to tackle the problem and go beyond the\nlimitations of the PTO (Post-Training Quantization), more specifically the QAT\n(Quantization Aware Training, see [4]) is a procedure that interferes with the\ntraining process in order to make it affected (or simply disturbed) by the\nquantization phase during the training itself. Besides QAT, recently\nIntel-Habana Labs have proposed an additional and more direct way to make the\ntraining results more robust to subsequent quantization which uses a\nregularizer, therefore changing the loss function that drives the training\nprocedure. But their proposal does not work out-of-the-box for pre-trained\nmodels like Ernie, for example.

          "description": "Markov Population Models are a widespread formalism used to model the\ndynamics of complex systems, with applications in Systems Biology and many\nother fields. The associated Markov stochastic process in continuous time is\noften analyzed by simulation, which can be costly for large or stiff systems,\nparticularly when a massive number of simulations has to be performed (e.g. in\na multi-scale model). A strategy to reduce computational load is to abstract\nthe population model, replacing it with a simpler stochastic model, faster to\nsimulate. Here we pursue this idea, building on previous works and constructing\na generator capable of producing stochastic trajectories in continuous space\nand discrete time. This generator is learned automatically from simulations of\nthe original model in a Generative Adversarial setting. Compared to previous\nworks, which rely on deep neural networks and Dirichlet processes, we explore\nthe use of state of the art generative models, which are flexible enough to\nlearn a full trajectory rather than a single transition kernel.",

          "description": "In the first part of this dissertation research, we develop a modular\nframework that can serve as a recipe for constructing and analyzing iterative\nalgorithms for convex optimization. Specifically, our work casts optimization\nas iteratively playing a two-player zero-sum game. Many existing optimization\nalgorithms including Frank-Wolfe and Nesterov's acceleration methods can be\nrecovered from the game by pitting two online learners with appropriate\nstrategies against each other. Furthermore, the sum of the weighted average\nregrets of the players in the game implies the convergence rate. As a result,\nour approach provides simple alternative proofs to these algorithms. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that our approach of optimization as iteratively playing a game\nleads to three new fast Frank-Wolfe-like algorithms for some constraint sets,\nwhich further shows that our framework is indeed generic, modular, and\neasy-to-use.\n\nIn the second part, we develop a modular analysis of provable acceleration\nvia Polyak's momentum for certain problems, which include solving the classical\nstrongly quadratic convex problems, training a wide ReLU network under the\nneural tangent kernel regime, and training a deep linear network with an\northogonal initialization. We develop a meta theorem and show that when\napplying Polyak's momentum for these problems, the induced dynamics exhibit a\nform where we can directly apply our meta theorem.\n\nIn the last part of the dissertation, we show another advantage of the use of\nPolyak's momentum -- it facilitates fast saddle point escape in smooth\nnon-convex optimization. This result, together with those of the second part,\nsheds new light on Polyak's momentum in modern non-convex optimization and deep\nlearning.",

          "description": "The information bottleneck (IB) principle has been suggested as a way to\nanalyze deep neural networks. The learning dynamics are studied by inspecting\nthe mutual information (MI) between the hidden layers and the input and output.\nNotably, separate fitting and compression phases during training have been\nreported. This led to some controversy including claims that the observations\nare not reproducible and strongly dependent on the type of activation function\nused as well as on the way the MI is estimated. Our study confirms that\ndifferent ways of binning when computing the MI lead to qualitatively different\nresults, either supporting or refusing IB conjectures. To resolve the\ncontroversy, we study the IB principle in settings where MI is non-trivial and\ncan be computed exactly. We monitor the dynamics of quantized neural networks,\nthat is, we discretize the whole deep learning system so that no approximation\nis required when computing the MI. This allows us to quantify the information\nflow without measurement errors. In this setting, we observed a fitting phase\nfor all layers and a compression phase for the output layer in all experiments;\nthe compression in the hidden layers was dependent on the type of activation\nfunction. Our study shows that the initial IB results were not artifacts of\nbinning when computing the MI. However, the critical claim that the compression\nphase may not be observed for some networks also holds true.",

          "description": "Spatial-temporal forecasting has attracted tremendous attention in a wide\nrange of applications, and traffic flow prediction is a canonical and typical\nexample. The complex and long-range spatial-temporal correlations of traffic\nflow bring it to a most intractable challenge. Existing works typically utilize\nshallow graph convolution networks (GNNs) and temporal extracting modules to\nmodel spatial and temporal dependencies respectively. However, the\nrepresentation ability of such models is limited due to: (1) shallow GNNs are\nincapable to capture long-range spatial correlations, (2) only spatial\nconnections are considered and a mass of semantic connections are ignored,\nwhich are of great importance for a comprehensive understanding of traffic\nnetworks. To this end, we propose Spatial-Temporal Graph Ordinary Differential\nEquation Networks (STGODE). Specifically, we capture spatial-temporal dynamics\nthrough a tensor-based ordinary differential equation (ODE), as a result,\ndeeper networks can be constructed and spatial-temporal features are utilized\nsynchronously. To understand the network more comprehensively, semantical\nadjacency matrix is considered in our model, and a well-design temporal\ndialated convolution structure is used to capture long term temporal\ndependencies. We evaluate our model on multiple real-world traffic datasets and\nsuperior performance is achieved over state-of-the-art baselines.",

GNNs aggregate node features using the\ngraph structure as inductive biases resulting in flexible and powerful models.\nHowever, GNNs remain hard to interpret as the interplay between node features\nand graph structure is only implicitly learned. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method called Kedge for explicitly sparsifying the underlying graph by\nremoving unnecessary neighbors. Our key idea is based on a tractable method for\nsparsification using the Hard Kumaraswamy distribution that can be used in\nconjugation with any GNN model. Kedge learns edge masks in a modular fashion\ntrained with any GNN allowing for gradient based optimization in an end-to-end\nfashion. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our model Kedge can\nprune a large proportion of the edges with only a minor effect on the test\naccuracy. Specifically, in the PubMed dataset, Kedge learns to drop more than\n80% of the edges with an accuracy drop of merely 2% showing that graph\nstructure has only a small contribution in comparison to node features.\nFinally, we also show that Kedge effectively counters the over-smoothing\nphenomena in deep GNNs by maintaining good task performance with increasing GNN\nlayers.",

In previous work, a 3-step method was proposed to generate\nhigh-quality TTS while greatly reducing the amount of data required for\ntraining. However, we have observed a ceiling effect in the level of\nnaturalness achievable for highly expressive voices when using this approach.\nIn this paper, we present a method for building highly expressive TTS voices\nwith as little as 15 minutes of speech data from the target speaker. Compared\nto the current state-of-the-art approach, our proposed improvements close the\ngap to recordings by 23.3% for naturalness of speech and by 16.3% for speaker\nsimilarity. Further, we match the naturalness and speaker similarity of a\nTacotron2-based full-data (~10 hours) model using only 15 minutes of target\nspeaker data, whereas with 30 minutes or more, we significantly outperform it.\nThe following improvements are proposed: 1) changing from an autoregressive,\nattention-based TTS model to a non-autoregressive model replacing attention\nwith an external duration model and 2) an additional Conditional Generative\nAdversarial Network (cGAN) based fine-tuning step.",

          "description": "Modeling the joint distribution of high-dimensional data is a central task in\nunsupervised machine learning. In recent years, many interests have been\nattracted to developing learning models based on tensor networks, which have\nadvantages of theoretical understandings of the expressive power using\nentanglement properties, and as a bridge connecting the classical computation\nand the quantum computation. Despite the great potential, however, existing\ntensor-network-based unsupervised models only work as a proof of principle, as\ntheir performances are much worse than the standard models such as the\nrestricted Boltzmann machines and neural networks. In this work, we present the\nAutoregressive Matrix Product States (AMPS), a tensor-network-based model\ncombining the matrix product states from quantum many-body physics and the\nautoregressive models from machine learning. The model enjoys exact calculation\nof normalized probability and unbiased sampling, as well as a clear theoretical\nunderstanding of expressive power. We demonstrate the performance of our model\nusing two applications, the generative modeling on synthetic and real-world\ndata, and the reinforcement learning in statistical physics. Using extensive\nnumerical experiments, we show that the proposed model significantly\noutperforms the existing tensor-network-based models and the restricted\nBoltzmann machines, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art neural network\nmodels.",

However, existing methods partition the large label\nspace into mutually exclusive clusters, which is sub-optimal when labels have\nmulti-modality and rich semantics. For instance, the label \"Apple\" can be the\nfruit or the brand name, which leads to the following research question: can we\ndisentangle these multi-modal labels with non-exclusive clustering tailored for\ndownstream XMC tasks? In this paper, we show that the label assignment problem\nin partition-based XMC can be formulated as an optimization problem, with the\nobjective of maximizing precision rates. This leads to an efficient algorithm\nto form flexible and overlapped label clusters, and a method that can\nalternatively optimizes the cluster assignments and the model parameters for\npartition-based XMC.

Many tools for cluster analysis have been\ndeveloped from early on and the variety of different clustering algorithms is\nhuge.

Moreover, users are supported in selecting\nthe right validation concepts to make sense of the clustering results. Based on\na comprehensive literature review, this paper provides assessment criteria for\nclustering method evaluation and validation concept selection.

To bridge this gap, the Data Programming by\nDemonstration framework was proposed to facilitate the automatic creation of\nlabeling functions based on a few examples labeled by a domain expert. This\nframework has proven successful for generating high-accuracy labeling models\nfor document classification. In this work, we extend the DPBD framework to\nspan-level annotation tasks, arguably one of the most time-consuming NLP\nlabeling tasks. We built a novel tool, TagRuler, that makes it easy for\nannotators to build span-level labeling functions without programming and\nencourages them to explore trade-offs between different labeling models and\nactive learning strategies. We empirically demonstrated that an annotator could\nachieve a higher F1 score using the proposed tool compared to manual labeling\nfor different span-level annotation tasks.",

          "description": "In federated learning (FL), model training is distributed over clients and\nlocal models are aggregated by a central server. The performance of uploaded\nmodels in such situations can vary widely due to imbalanced data distributions,\npotential demands on privacy protections, and quality of transmissions. In this\npaper, we aim to minimize FL training delay over wireless channels, constrained\nby overall training performance as well as each client's differential privacy\n(DP) requirement. We solve this problem in the framework of multi-agent\nmulti-armed bandit (MAMAB) to deal with the situation where there are multiple\nclients confornting different unknown transmission environments, e.g., channel\nfading and interferences. Specifically, we first transform the long-term\nconstraints on both training performance and each client's DP into a virtual\nqueue based on the Lyapunov drift technique. Then, we convert the MAMAB to a\nmax-min bipartite matching problem at each communication round, by estimating\nrewards with the upper confidence bound (UCB) approach. More importantly, we\npropose two efficient solutions to this matching problem, i.e., modified\nHungarian algorithm and greedy matching with a better alternative (GMBA), in\nwhich the first one can achieve the optimal solution with a high complexity\nwhile the second one approaches a better trade-off by enabling a verified\nlow-complexity with little performance loss. In addition, we develop an upper\nbound on the expected regret of this MAMAB based FL framework, which shows a\nlinear growth over the logarithm of communication rounds, justifying its\ntheoretical feasibility. Extensive experimental results are conducted to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, and the impacts of\nvarious parameters on the FL performance over wireless edge networks are also\ndiscussed.",

Such behaviours will have\ndisastrous effects on real-world machine learning systems. In this field\ngraceful degradation refers to the optimisation of model performance as it\nencounters this out-of-distribution data. This work presents a definition and\ndiscussion of graceful degradation and where it can be applied in deployed\nvisual systems. Following this a survey of relevant areas is undertaken,\nnovelly splitting the graceful degradation problem into active and passive\napproaches. In passive approaches, graceful degradation is handled and achieved\nby the model in a self-contained manner, in active approaches the model is\nupdated upon encountering epistemic uncertainties. This work communicates the\nimportance of the problem and aims to prompt the development of machine\nlearning strategies that are aware of graceful degradation.",

The aim of the present study is to propose a\nrobust version of PLSR. To this end, the maximum correntropy criterion is\nadopted to structure a new robust variant of PLSR, namely Partial Maximum\nCorrentropy Regression (PMCR). Half-quadratic optimization technique is\nutilized to calculate the robust latent variables. We assess the proposed PMCR\non a synthetic example and the public Neurotycho dataset.

          "description": "In this paper, we aim to address the problem of solving a non-convex\noptimization problem over an intersection of multiple variable sets. This kind\nof problems is typically solved by using an alternating minimization (AM)\nstrategy which splits the overall problem into a set of sub-problems\ncorresponding to each variable, and then iteratively performs minimization over\neach sub-problem using a fixed updating rule. However, due to the intrinsic\nnon-convexity of the overall problem, the optimization can usually be trapped\ninto bad local minimum even when each sub-problem can be globally optimized at\neach iteration. To tackle this problem, we propose a meta-learning based Global\nScope Optimization (GSO) method. It adaptively generates optimizers for\nsub-problems via meta-learners and constantly updates these meta-learners with\nrespect to the global loss information of the overall problem. Therefore, the\nsub-problems are optimized with the objective of minimizing the global loss\nspecifically. We evaluate the proposed model on a number of simulations,\nincluding solving bi-linear inverse problems: matrix completion, and non-linear\nproblems: Gaussian mixture models. The experimental results show that our\nproposed approach outperforms AM-based methods in standard settings, and is\nable to achieve effective optimization in some challenging cases while other\nmethods would typically fail.",

We argue that it is easier to solve long-horizon tasks by\nplanning sequences of states rather than just actions, as the effects of\nactions greatly compound over time and are harder to optimize.

The\nresulting latent collocation method (LatCo) optimizes trajectories of latent\nstates, which improves over previously proposed shooting methods for visual\nmodel-based RL on tasks with sparse rewards and long-term goals.

          "description": "The astounding success made by artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare and\nother fields proves that AI can achieve human-like performance. However,\nsuccess always comes with challenges. Deep learning algorithms are\ndata-dependent and require large datasets for training. The lack of data in the\nmedical imaging field creates a bottleneck for the application of deep learning\nto medical image analysis. Medical image acquisition, annotation, and analysis\nare costly, and their usage is constrained by ethical restrictions. They also\nrequire many resources, such as human expertise and funding. That makes it\ndifficult for non-medical researchers to have access to useful and large\nmedical data. Thus, as comprehensive as possible, this paper provides a\ncollection of medical image datasets with their associated challenges for deep\nlearning research. We have collected information of around three hundred\ndatasets and challenges mainly reported between 2013 and 2020 and categorized\nthem into four categories: head & neck, chest & abdomen, pathology & blood, and\n``others''. Our paper has three purposes: 1) to provide a most up to date and\ncomplete list that can be used as a universal reference to easily find the\ndatasets for clinical image analysis, 2) to guide researchers on the\nmethodology to test and evaluate their methods' performance and robustness on\nrelevant datasets, 3) to provide a ``route'' to relevant algorithms for the\nrelevant medical topics, and challenge leaderboards.",

          "description": "Understanding and explaining the mistakes made by trained models is critical\nto many machine learning objectives, such as improving robustness, addressing\nconcept drift, and mitigating biases. However, this is often an ad hoc process\nthat involves manually looking at the model's mistakes on many test samples and\nguessing at the underlying reasons for those incorrect predictions. In this\npaper, we propose a systematic approach, conceptual explanation scores (CES),\nthat explains why a classifier makes a mistake on a particular test sample(s)\nin terms of human-understandable concepts (e.g. this zebra is misclassified as\na dog because of faint stripes). We base CES on two prior ideas: counterfactual\nexplanations and concept activation vectors, and validate our approach on\nwell-known pretrained models, showing that it explains the models' mistakes\nmeaningfully. We also train new models with intentional and known spurious\ncorrelations, which CES successfully identifies from a single misclassified\ntest sample. The code for CES is publicly available and can easily be applied\nto new models.",

          "description": "Accurate models of robot dynamics are critical for safe and stable control\nand generalization to novel operational conditions. Hand-designed models,\nhowever, may be insufficiently accurate, even after careful parameter tuning.\nThis motivates the use of machine learning techniques to approximate the robot\ndynamics over a training set of state-control trajectories. The dynamics of\nmany robots, including ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles, are described\nin terms of their SE(3) pose and generalized velocity, and satisfy conservation\nof energy principles. This paper proposes a Hamiltonian formulation over the\nSE(3) manifold of the structure of a neural ordinary differential equation\n(ODE) network to approximate the dynamics of a rigid body. In contrast to a\nblack-box ODE network, our formulation guarantees total energy conservation by\nconstruction. We develop energy shaping and damping injection control for the\nlearned, potentially under-actuated SE(3) Hamiltonian dynamics to enable a\nunified approach for stabilization and trajectory tracking with various\nplatforms, including pendulum, rigid-body, and quadrotor systems.",

          "description": "Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential of utilizing\nnear-term quantum machines to gain certain computational advantages over\nclassical methods. Nevertheless, modern VQAs suffer from cumbersome\ncomputational overhead, hampered by the tradition of employing a solitary\nquantum processor to handle large-volume data. As such, to better exert the\nsuperiority of VQAs, it is of great significance to improve their runtime\nefficiency. Here we devise an efficient distributed optimization scheme, called\nQUDIO, to address this issue. Specifically, in QUDIO, a classical central\nserver partitions the learning problem into multiple subproblems and allocate\nthem to multiple local nodes where each of them consists of a quantum processor\nand a classical optimizer. During the training procedure, all local nodes\nproceed parallel optimization and the classical server synchronizes\noptimization information among local nodes timely. In doing so, we prove a\nsublinear convergence rate of QUDIO in terms of the number of global iteration\nunder the ideal scenario, while the system imperfection may incur divergent\noptimization. Numerical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that QUDIO\ncan surprisingly achieve a superlinear runtime speedup with respect to the\nnumber of local nodes. Our proposal can be readily mixed with other advanced\nVQAs-based techniques to narrow the gap between the state of the art and\napplications with quantum advantage.",

          "description": "Successful quantitative investment usually relies on precise predictions of\nthe future movement of the stock price. Recently, machine learning based\nsolutions have shown their capacity to give more accurate stock prediction and\nbecome indispensable components in modern quantitative investment systems.\nHowever, the i.i.d. assumption behind existing methods is inconsistent with the\nexistence of diverse trading patterns in the stock market, which inevitably\nlimits their ability to achieve better stock prediction performance. In this\npaper, we propose a novel architecture, Temporal Routing Adaptor (TRA), to\nempower existing stock prediction models with the ability to model multiple\nstock trading patterns. Essentially, TRA is a lightweight module that consists\nof a set of independent predictors for learning multiple patterns as well as a\nrouter to dispatch samples to different predictors. Nevertheless, the lack of\nexplicit pattern identifiers makes it quite challenging to train an effective\nTRA-based model. To tackle this challenge, we further design a learning\nalgorithm based on Optimal Transport (OT) to obtain the optimal sample to\npredictor assignment and effectively optimize the router with such assignment\nthrough an auxiliary loss term. Experiments on the real-world stock ranking\ntask show that compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, e.g., Attention LSTM\nand Transformer, the proposed method can improve information coefficient (IC)\nfrom 0.053 to 0.059 and 0.051 to 0.056 respectively.

          "description": "In reacting flow systems, thermoacoustic instability characterized by high\namplitude pressure fluctuations, is driven by a positive coupling between the\nunsteady heat release rate and the acoustic field of the combustor. When the\nunderlying flow is turbulent, as a control parameter of the system is varied\nand the system approach thermoacoustic instability, the acoustic pressure\noscillations synchronize with heat release rate oscillations. Consequently,\nduring the onset of thermoacoustic instability in turbulent combustors, the\nsystem dynamics transition from chaotic oscillations to periodic oscillations\nvia a state of intermittency. Thermoacoustic systems are traditionally modeled\nby coupling the model for the unsteady heat source and the acoustic subsystem,\neach estimated independently. The response of the unsteady heat source, the\nflame, to acoustic fluctuations are characterized by introducing external\nunsteady forcing. This necessitates a powerful excitation module to obtain the\nnonlinear response of the flame to acoustic perturbations. Instead of\ncharacterizing individual subsystems, we introduce a neural ordinary\ndifferential equation (neural ODE) framework to model the thermoacoustic system\nas a whole. The neural ODE model for the thermoacoustic system uses time series\nof the heat release rate and the pressure fluctuations, measured simultaneously\nwithout introducing any external perturbations, to model their coupled\ninteraction. Further, we use the parameters of neural ODE to define an anomaly\nmeasure that represents the proximity of system dynamics to limit cycle\noscillations and thus provide an early warning signal for the onset of\nthermoacoustic instability.",

          "description": "Learning new tasks continuously without forgetting on a constantly changing\ndata distribution is essential for real-world problems but extremely\nchallenging for modern deep learning. In this work we propose HCL, a Hybrid\ngenerative-discriminative approach to Continual Learning for classification. We\nmodel the distribution of each task and each class with a normalizing flow. The\nflow is used to learn the data distribution, perform classification, identify\ntask changes, and avoid forgetting, all leveraging the invertibility and exact\nlikelihood which are uniquely enabled by the normalizing flow model. We use the\ngenerative capabilities of the flow to avoid catastrophic forgetting through\ngenerative replay and a novel functional regularization technique. For task\nidentification, we use state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques based on\nmeasuring the typicality of the model's statistics. We demonstrate the strong\nperformance of HCL on a range of continual learning benchmarks such as\nsplit-MNIST, split-CIFAR, and SVHN-MNIST.",

          "description": "Multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers have been proposed\nfor electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However,\nCNN models have been found vulnerable to universal adversarial perturbations\n(UAPs), which are small and example-independent, yet powerful enough to degrade\nthe performance of a CNN model, when added to a benign example. This paper\nproposes a novel total loss minimization (TLM) approach to generate UAPs for\nEEG-based BCIs. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of TLM on\nthree popular CNN classifiers for both target and non-target attacks. We also\nverified the transferability of UAPs in EEG-based BCI systems. To our\nknowledge, this is the first study on UAPs of CNN classifiers in EEG-based\nBCIs. UAPs are easy to construct, and can attack BCIs in real-time, exposing a\npotentially critical security concern of BCIs.",

          "description": "The rapid development of artificial intelligence and deep learning has\nprovided many opportunities to further enhance the safety, stability, and\naccuracy of industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). As indispensable\ncomponents to many mission-critical CPS assets and equipment, mechanical\nbearings need to be monitored to identify any trace of abnormal conditions.\nMost of the data-driven approaches applied to bearing fault diagnosis\nup-to-date are trained using a large amount of fault data collected a priori.\nIn many practical applications, however, it can be unsafe and time-consuming to\ncollect sufficient data samples for each fault category, making it challenging\nto train a robust classifier. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning\nframework for bearing fault diagnosis based on model-agnostic meta-learning\n(MAML), which targets for training an effective fault classifier using limited\ndata. In addition, it can leverage the training data and learn to identify new\nfault scenarios more efficiently. Case studies on the generalization to new\nartificial faults show that the proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy\nup to 25% higher than a Siamese network-based benchmark study. Finally, the\nrobustness and the generalization capability of the proposed framework are\nfurther validated by applying it to identify real bearing damages using data\nfrom artificial damages, which compares favorably against 6 state-of-the-art\nfew-shot learning algorithms using consistent test environments.",

This\ninfectious respiratory disease has spread rapidly across more than 3000\ncounties and 50 states in the U.S. and have exhibited evolutionary clustering\nand complex triggering patterns. It is essential to understand the complex\nspacetime intertwined propagation of this disease so that accurate prediction\nor smart external intervention can be carried out. In this paper, we model the\npropagation of the COVID-19 as spatio-temporal point processes and propose a\ngenerative and intensity-free model to track the spread of the disease. We\nfurther adopt a generative adversarial imitation learning framework to learn\nthe model parameters. In comparison with the traditional likelihood-based\nlearning methods, this imitation learning framework does not need to prespecify\nan intensity function, which alleviates the model-misspecification. Moreover,\nthe adversarial learning procedure bypasses the difficult-to-evaluate integral\ninvolved in the likelihood evaluation, which makes the model inference more\nscalable with the data and variables. We showcase the dynamic learning\nperformance on the COVID-19 confirmed cases in the U.S. and evaluate the social\ndistancing policy based on the learned generative model.",

          "description": "Self-supervised deep learning methods have leveraged stereo images for\ntraining monocular depth estimation. Although these methods show strong results\non outdoor datasets such as KITTI, they do not match performance of supervised\nmethods on indoor environments with camera rotation. Indoor, rotated scenes are\ncommon for less constrained applications and pose problems for two reasons:\nabundance of low texture regions and increased complexity of depth cues for\nimages under rotation. In an effort to extend self-supervised learning to more\ngeneralised environments we propose two additions. First, we propose a novel\nFilled Disparity Loss term that corrects for ambiguity of image reconstruction\nerror loss in textureless regions. Specifically, we interpolate disparity in\nuntextured regions, using the estimated disparity from surrounding textured\nareas, and use L1 loss to correct the original estimation. Our experiments show\nthat depth estimation is substantially improved on low-texture scenes, without\nany loss on textured scenes, when compared to Monodepth by Godard et al.\nSecondly, we show that training with an application's representative rotations,\nin both pitch and roll, is sufficient to significantly improve performance over\nthe entire range of expected rotation. We demonstrate that depth estimation is\nsuccessfully generalised as performance is not lost when evaluated on test sets\nwith no camera rotation.

          "description": "The conventional spatial convolution layers in the Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) are computationally expensive at the point where the training\ntime could take days unless the number of layers, the number of training images\nor the size of the training images are reduced. The image size of 256x256\npixels is commonly used for most of the applications of CNN, but this image\nsize is too small for applications like Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)\nclassification where the image details are important for accurate\nclassification. This research proposed Frequency Domain Convolution (FDC) and\nFrequency Domain Pooling (FDP) layers which were built with RFFT, kernel\ninitialization strategy, convolution artifact removal and Channel Independent\nConvolution (CIC) to replace the conventional convolution and pooling layers.\nThe FDC and FDP layers are used to build a Frequency Domain Convolutional\nNeural Network (FDCNN) to accelerate the training of large images for DR\nclassification. The Full FDC layer is an extension of the FDC layer to allow\ndirect use in conventional CNNs, it is also used to modify the VGG16\narchitecture. FDCNN is shown to be at least 54.21% faster and 70.74% more\nmemory efficient compared to an equivalent CNN architecture. The modified VGG16\narchitecture with Full FDC layer is reported to achieve a shorter training time\nand a higher accuracy at 95.63% compared to the original VGG16 architecture for\nDR classification.",

However, it is still challenging\nto detect the initial intrusion on IoT devices prior to massive attacks. Recent\nstudies have utilized power side-channel information to characterize this\nintrusion behavior on IoT devices but still lack real-time detection\napproaches. This study aimed to design an online intrusion detection system\ncalled DeepAuditor for IoT devices via power auditing. To realize the real-time\nsystem, we first proposed a lightweight power auditing device called Power\nAuditor. With the Power Auditor, we developed a Distributed CNN classifier for\nonline inference in our laboratory setting. In order to protect data leakage\nand reduce networking redundancy, we also proposed a privacy-preserved\ninference protocol via Packed Homomorphic Encryption and a sliding window\nprotocol in our system. The classification accuracy and processing time were\nmeasured in our laboratory settings. We also demonstrated that the distributed\nCNN design is secure against any distributed components.

In this work, we initiate the study of best-case lower\nbounds in online convex optimization, wherein we bound the largest improvement\nan algorithm can obtain relative to the single best action in hindsight. This\nproblem is motivated by the goal of better understanding the adaptivity of a\nlearning algorithm. Another motivation comes from fairness: it is known that\nbest-case lower bounds are instrumental in obtaining algorithms for\ndecision-theoretic online learning (DTOL) that satisfy a notion of group\nfairness. Our contributions are a general method to provide best-case lower\nbounds in Follow The Regularized Leader (FTRL) algorithms with time-varying\nregularizers, which we use to show that best-case lower bounds are of the same\norder as existing upper regret bounds: this includes situations with a fixed\nlearning rate, decreasing learning rates, timeless methods, and adaptive\ngradient methods.

Finally, in DTOL with two experts and\nbinary predictions, we fully characterize the best-case sequences, which\nprovides a finer understanding of the best-case lower bounds.",

This process not only requires a lot of instance-level\nannotations for sensitive attributes, it also does not guarantee that all\nfairness sensitive information has been removed from the encoder. To address\nthese limitations, we explore the following research question: Can we reduce\nthe discrimination of DNN models by only debiasing the classification head,\neven with biased representations as inputs? To this end, we propose a new\nmitigation technique, namely, Representation Neutralization for Fairness (RNF)\nthat achieves fairness by debiasing only the task-specific classification head\nof DNN models. To this end, we leverage samples with the same ground-truth\nlabel but different sensitive attributes, and use their neutralized\nrepresentations to train the classification head of the DNN model. The key idea\nof RNF is to discourage the classification head from capturing spurious\ncorrelation between fairness sensitive information in encoder representations\nwith specific class labels. To address low-resource settings with no access to\nsensitive attribute annotations, we leverage a bias-amplified model to generate\nproxy annotations for sensitive attributes. Experimental results over several\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate our RNF framework to effectively reduce\ndiscrimination of DNN models with minimal degradation in task-specific\nperformance.",

          "description": "The reliance of humans over machines has never been so high such that from\nobject classification in photographs to adding sound to silent movies\neverything can be performed with the help of deep learning and machine learning\nalgorithms. Likewise, Handwritten text recognition is one of the significant\nareas of research and development with a streaming number of possibilities that\ncould be attained. Handwriting recognition (HWR), also known as Handwritten\nText Recognition (HTR), is the ability of a computer to receive and interpret\nintelligible handwritten input from sources such as paper documents,\nphotographs, touch-screens and other devices [1]. Apparently, in this paper, we\nhave performed handwritten digit recognition with the help of MNIST datasets\nusing Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and\nConvolution Neural Network (CNN) models. Our main objective is to compare the\naccuracy of the models stated above along with their execution time to get the\nbest possible model for digit recognition.",

          "description": "Although neural networks are widely used, it remains challenging to formally\nverify the safety and robustness of neural networks in real-world applications.\nExisting methods are designed to verify the network before use, which is\nlimited to relatively simple specifications and fixed networks. These methods\nare not ready to be applied to real-world problems with complex and/or\ndynamically changing specifications and networks. To effectively handle\ndynamically changing specifications and networks, the verification needs to be\nperformed online when these changes take place. However, it is still\nchallenging to run existing verification algorithms online. Our key insight is\nthat we can leverage the temporal dependencies of these changes to accelerate\nthe verification process, e.g., by warm starting new online verification using\nprevious verified results. This paper establishes a novel framework for\nscalable online verification to solve real-world verification problems with\ndynamically changing specifications and/or networks, known as domain shift and\nweight shift respectively. We propose three types of techniques (branch\nmanagement, perturbation tolerance analysis, and incremental computation) to\naccelerate the online verification of deep neural networks. Experiment results\nshow that our online verification algorithm is up to two orders of magnitude\nfaster than existing verification algorithms, and thus can scale to real-world\napplications.",

Our networks are trained using\nsimulated data, including an estimate of the detector-noise characteristics\nnear the event. This encodes the signal and noise models within millions of\nneural-network parameters, and enables inference for any observed data\nconsistent with the training distribution, accounting for noise nonstationarity\nfrom event to event.

          "description": "In this paper, a novel and robust algorithm is proposed for adaptive\nbeamforming based on the idea of reconstructing the autocorrelation sequence\n(ACS) of a random process from a set of measured data. This is obtained from\nthe first column and the first row of the sample covariance matrix (SCM) after\naveraging along its diagonals. Then, the power spectrum of the correlation\nsequence is estimated using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The DFT\ncoefficients corresponding to the angles within the noise-plus-interference\nregion are used to reconstruct the noise-plus-interference covariance matrix\n(NPICM), while the desired signal covariance matrix (DSCM) is estimated by\nidentifying and removing the noise-plus-interference component from the SCM. In\nparticular, the spatial power spectrum of the estimated received signal is\nutilized to compute the correlation sequence corresponding to the\nnoise-plus-interference in which the dominant DFT coefficient of the\nnoise-plus-interference is captured. A key advantage of the proposed adaptive\nbeamforming is that only little prior information is required. Specifically, an\nimprecise knowledge of the array geometry and of the angular sectors in which\nthe interferences are located is needed. Simulation results demonstrate that\ncompared with previous reconstruction-based beamformers, the proposed approach\ncan achieve better overall performance in the case of multiple mismatches over\na very large range of input signal-to-noise ratios.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of semantic matching in product search: given a\ncustomer query, retrieve all semantically related products from a huge catalog\nof size 100 million, or more. Because of large catalog spaces and real-time\nlatency constraints, semantic matching algorithms not only desire high recall\nbut also need to have low latency. Conventional lexical matching approaches\n(e.g., Okapi-BM25) exploit inverted indices to achieve fast inference time, but\nfail to capture behavioral signals between queries and products. In contrast,\nembedding-based models learn semantic representations from customer behavior\ndata, but the performance is often limited by shallow neural encoders due to\nlatency constraints. Semantic product search can be viewed as an eXtreme\nMulti-label Classification (XMC) problem, where customer queries are input\ninstances and products are output labels. In this paper, we aim to improve\nsemantic product search by using tree-based XMC models where inference time\ncomplexity is logarithmic in the number of products. We consider hierarchical\nlinear models with n-gram features for fast real-time inference.\nQuantitatively, our method maintains a low latency of 1.25 milliseconds per\nquery and achieves a 65% improvement of Recall@100 (60.9% v.s. 36.8%) over a\ncompeting embedding-based DSSM model. Our model is robust to weight pruning\nwith varying thresholds, which can flexibly meet different system requirements\nfor online deployments. Qualitatively, our method can retrieve products that\nare complementary to existing product search system and add diversity to the\nmatch set.",

          "description": "The claims data, containing medical codes, services information, and incurred\nexpenditure, can be a good resource for estimating an individual's health\ncondition and medical risk level. In this study, we developed Transformer-based\nMultimodal AutoEncoder (TMAE), an unsupervised learning framework that can\nlearn efficient patient representation by encoding meaningful information from\nthe claims data. TMAE is motivated by the practical needs in healthcare to\nstratify patients into different risk levels for improving care delivery and\nmanagement. Compared to previous approaches, TMAE is able to 1) model\ninpatient, outpatient, and medication claims collectively, 2) handle irregular\ntime intervals between medical events, 3) alleviate the sparsity issue of the\nrare medical codes, and 4) incorporate medical expenditure information. We\ntrained TMAE using a real-world pediatric claims dataset containing more than\n600,000 patients and compared its performance with various approaches in two\nclustering tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TMAE has superior\nperformance compared to all baselines. Multiple downstream applications are\nalso conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. The promising\nresults confirm that the TMAE framework is scalable to large claims data and is\nable to generate efficient patient embeddings for risk stratification and\nanalysis.",

          "description": "Toward achieving robust and defensive neural networks, the robustness against\nthe weight parameters perturbations, i.e., sharpness, attracts attention in\nrecent years (Sun et al., 2020). However, sharpness is known to remain a\ncritical issue, \"scale-sensitivity.\" In this paper, we propose a novel\nsharpness measure, Minimum Sharpness. It is known that NNs have a specific\nscale transformation that constitutes equivalent classes where functional\nproperties are completely identical, and at the same time, their sharpness\ncould change unlimitedly. We define our sharpness through a minimization\nproblem over the equivalent NNs being invariant to the scale transformation. We\nalso develop an efficient and exact technique to make the sharpness tractable,\nwhich reduces the heavy computational costs involved with Hessian. In the\nexperiment, we observed that our sharpness has a valid correlation with the\ngeneralization of NNs and runs with less computational cost than existing\nsharpness measures.",

          "description": "State-of-the-art models in natural language processing rely on separate rigid\nsubword tokenization algorithms, which limit their generalization ability and\nadaptation to new settings. In this paper, we propose a new model inductive\nbias that learns a subword tokenization end-to-end as part of the model. To\nthis end, we introduce a soft gradient-based subword tokenization module (GBST)\nthat automatically learns latent subword representations from characters in a\ndata-driven fashion. Concretely, GBST enumerates candidate subword blocks and\nlearns to score them in a position-wise fashion using a block scoring network.\nWe additionally introduce Charformer, a deep Transformer model that integrates\nGBST and operates on the byte level. Via extensive experiments on English GLUE,\nmultilingual, and noisy text datasets, we show that Charformer outperforms a\nseries of competitive byte-level baselines while generally performing on par\nand sometimes outperforming subword-based models. Additionally, Charformer is\nfast, improving the speed of both vanilla byte-level and subword-level\nTransformers by 28%-100% while maintaining competitive quality. We believe this\nwork paves the way for highly performant token-free models that are trained\ncompletely end-to-end.",

          "description": "We consider the phenomenon of adversarial examples in ReLU networks with\nindependent gaussian parameters. For networks of constant depth and with a\nlarge range of widths (for instance, it suffices if the width of each layer is\npolynomial in that of any other layer), small perturbations of input vectors\nlead to large changes of outputs. This generalizes results of Daniely and\nSchacham (2020) for networks of rapidly decreasing width and of Bubeck et al\n(2021) for two-layer networks. The proof shows that adversarial examples arise\nin these networks because the functions that they compute are very close to\nlinear. Bottleneck layers in the network play a key role: the minimal width up\nto some point in the network determines scales and sensitivities of mappings\ncomputed up to that point. The main result is for networks with constant depth,\nbut we also show that some constraint on depth is necessary for a result of\nthis kind, because there are suitably deep networks that, with constant\nprobability, compute a function that is close to constant.",

          "description": "In modern ranking problems, different and disparate representations of the\nitems to be ranked are often available. It is sensible, then, to try to combine\nthese representations to improve ranking. Indeed, learning to rank via\ncombining representations is both principled and practical for learning a\nranking function for a particular query. In extremely data-scarce settings,\nhowever, the amount of labeled data available for a particular query can lead\nto a highly variable and ineffective ranking function. One way to mitigate the\neffect of the small amount of data is to leverage information from semantically\nsimilar queries. Indeed, as we demonstrate in simulation settings and real data\nexamples, when semantically similar queries are available it is possible to\ngainfully use them when ranking with respect to a particular query. We describe\nand explore this phenomenon in the context of the bias-variance trade off and\napply it to the data-scarce settings of a Bing navigational graph and the\nDrosophila larva connectome.",
