          "description": "Tables are widely used in various kinds of documents to present information\nconcisely. Understanding tables is a challenging problem that requires an\nunderstanding of language and table structure, along with numerical and logical\nreasoning. In this paper, we present our systems to solve Task 9 of\nSemEval-2021: Statement Verification and Evidence Finding with Tables\n(SEM-TAB-FACTS). The task consists of two subtasks: (A) Given a table and a\nstatement, predicting whether the table supports the statement and (B)\nPredicting which cells in the table provide evidence for/against the statement.\nWe fine-tune TAPAS (a model which extends BERT's architecture to capture\ntabular structure) for both the subtasks as it has shown state-of-the-art\nperformance in various table understanding tasks. In subtask A, we evaluate how\ntransfer learning and standardizing tables to have a single header row improves\nTAPAS' performance. In subtask B, we evaluate how different fine-tuning\nstrategies can improve TAPAS' performance. Our systems achieve an F1 score of\n67.34 in subtask A three-way classification, 72.89 in subtask A two-way\nclassification, and 62.95 in subtask B.",

          "description": "In this work, we focus on two crucial components in the cross-domain\ntext-to-SQL semantic parsing task: schema linking and value filling. To\nencourage the model to learn better encoding ability, we propose a column\nselection auxiliary task to empower the encoder with the relevance matching\ncapability by using explicit learning targets. Furthermore, we propose two\nvalue filling methods to build the bridge from the existing zero-shot semantic\nparsers to real-world applications, considering most of the existing parsers\nignore the values filling in the synthesized SQL.

          "description": "As the vocabulary size of modern word-based language models becomes ever\nlarger, many sampling-based training criteria are proposed and investigated.\nThe essence of these sampling methods is that the softmax-related traversal\nover the entire vocabulary can be simplified, giving speedups compared to the\nbaseline. A problem we notice about the current landscape of such sampling\nmethods is the lack of a systematic comparison and some myths about preferring\none over another. In this work, we consider Monte Carlo sampling, importance\nsampling, a novel method we call compensated partial summation, and noise\ncontrastive estimation. Linking back to the three traditional criteria, namely\nmean squared error, binary cross-entropy, and cross-entropy, we derive the\ntheoretical solutions to the training problems. Contrary to some common belief,\nwe show that all these sampling methods can perform equally well, as long as we\ncorrect for the intended class posterior probabilities. Experimental results in\nlanguage modeling and automatic speech recognition on Switchboard and\nLibriSpeech support our claim, with all sampling-based methods showing similar\nperplexities and word error rates while giving the expected speedups.",

          "description": "In this paper, we identify an interesting kind of error in the output of\nUnsupervised Neural Machine Translation (UNMT) systems like\n\\textit{Undreamt}(footnote). We refer to this error type as \\textit{Scrambled\nTranslation problem}. We observe that UNMT models which use \\textit{word\nshuffle} noise (as in case of Undreamt) can generate correct words, but fail to\nstitch them together to form phrases. As a result, words of the translated\nsentence look \\textit{scrambled}, resulting in decreased BLEU. We hypothesise\nthat the reason behind \\textit{scrambled translation problem} is 'shuffling\nnoise' which is introduced in every input sentence as a denoising strategy. To\ntest our hypothesis, we experiment by retraining UNMT models with a simple\n\\textit{retraining} strategy. We stop the training of the Denoising UNMT model\nafter a pre-decided number of iterations and resume the training for the\nremaining iterations -- which number is also pre-decided -- using original\nsentence as input without adding any noise. Our proposed solution achieves\nsignificant performance improvement UNMT models that train conventionally. We\ndemonstrate these performance gains on four language pairs, \\textit{viz.},\nEnglish-French, English-German, English-Spanish, Hindi-Punjabi. Our qualitative\nand quantitative analysis shows that the retraining strategy helps achieve\nbetter alignment as observed by attention heatmap and better phrasal\ntranslation, leading to statistically significant improvement in BLEU scores.",

          "description": "Reliable detection of the prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD)\nremains difficult even today because, unlike other neurocognitive impairments,\nthere is no definitive diagnosis of AD in vivo. In this context, existing\nresearch has shown that patients often develop language impairment even in mild\nAD conditions. We propose a multimodal deep learning method that utilizes\nspeech and the corresponding transcript simultaneously to detect AD. For audio\nsignals, the proposed audio-based network, a convolutional neural network (CNN)\nbased model, predicts the diagnosis for multiple speech segments, which are\ncombined for the final prediction. Similarly, we use contextual embedding\nextracted from BERT concatenated with a CNN-generated embedding for classifying\nthe transcript. The individual predictions of the two models are then combined\nto make the final classification. We also perform experiments to analyze the\nmodel performance when Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) system generated\ntranscripts are used instead of manual transcription in the text-based model.\nThe proposed method achieves 85.3% 10-fold cross-validation accuracy when\ntrained and evaluated on the Dementiabank Pitt corpus.",

          "description": "Emotion lexica are commonly used resources to combat data poverty in\nautomatic emotion detection. However, vocabulary coverage issues, differences\nin construction method and discrepancies in emotion framework and\nrepresentation result in a heterogeneous landscape of emotion detection\nresources, calling for a unified approach to utilising them. To combat this, we\npresent an extended emotion lexicon of 30,273 unique entries, which is a result\nof merging eight existing emotion lexica by means of a multi-view variational\nautoencoder (VAE). We showed that a VAE is a valid approach for combining\nlexica with different label spaces into a joint emotion label space with a\nchosen number of dimensions, and that these dimensions are still interpretable.\nWe tested the utility of the unified VAE lexicon by employing the lexicon\nvalues as features in an emotion detection model. We found that the VAE lexicon\noutperformed individual lexica, but contrary to our expectations, it did not\noutperform a naive concatenation of lexica, although it did contribute to the\nnaive concatenation when added as an extra lexicon. Furthermore, using lexicon\ninformation as additional features next to state-of-the-art language models\nusually resulted in a better performance than when no lexicon information was\nused.",

We\nachieve these goals by first collecting a large corpus of COVID-related\narticles during the onset of the pandemic. After, we apply unsupervised and\nsemi-supervised learning procedures to summarize articles, then cluster them\nbased on their similarities using the community detection methods. Next, we\nidentify the topic of each cluster of articles using the BART algorithm.\nFinally, we provide a detailed digital media analysis based on the NLP-pipeline\noutputs and show how the conversation surrounding COVID-19 evolved over time.",

Predicting missing links in these graphs can boost\nmany important applications, such as drug design and repurposing. Recent work\nhas shown that general-domain language models (LMs) can serve as \"soft\" KGs,\nand that they can be fine-tuned for the task of KG completion. In this work, we\nstudy scientific LMs for KG completion, exploring whether we can tap into their\nlatent knowledge to enhance biomedical link prediction. We evaluate several\ndomain-specific LMs, fine-tuning them on datasets centered on drugs and\ndiseases that we represent as KGs and enrich with textual entity descriptions.\nWe integrate the LM-based models with KG embedding models, using a router\nmethod that learns to assign each input example to either type of model and\nprovides a substantial boost in performance.

          "description": "Vaccines are an important public health measure, but vaccine hesitancy and\nrefusal can create clusters of low vaccine coverage and reduce the\neffectiveness of vaccination programs. Social media provides an opportunity to\nestimate emerging risks to vaccine acceptance by including geographical\nlocation and detailing vaccine-related concerns. Methods for classifying social\nmedia posts, such as vaccine-related tweets, use language models (LMs) trained\non general domain text. However, challenges to measuring vaccine sentiment at\nscale arise from the absence of tonal stress and gestural cues and may not\nalways have additional information about the user, e.g., past tweets or social\nconnections. Another challenge in LMs is the lack of commonsense knowledge that\nare apparent in users metadata, i.e., emoticons, positive and negative words\netc. In this study, to classify vaccine sentiment tweets with limited\ninformation, we present a novel end-to-end framework consisting of\ninterconnected components that use domain-specific LM trained on\nvaccine-related tweets and models commonsense knowledge into a bidirectional\ngated recurrent network (CK-BiGRU) with context-aware attention. We further\nleverage syntactical, user metadata and sentiment information to capture the\nsentiment of a tweet.

Current OpenRE models are commonly trained on the datasets\ngenerated from distant supervision, which often results in instability and\nmakes the model easily collapsed. In this paper, we revisit the procedure of\nOpenRE from a causal view. By formulating OpenRE using a structural causal\nmodel, we identify that the above-mentioned problems stem from the spurious\ncorrelations from entities and context to the relation type. To address this\nissue, we conduct \\emph{Element Intervention}, which intervenes on the context\nand entities respectively to obtain the underlying causal effects of them. We\nalso provide two specific implementations of the interventions based on entity\nranking and context contrasting.

          "description": "Multi-head attention plays a crucial role in the recent success of\nTransformer models, which leads to consistent performance improvements over\nconventional attention in various applications. The popular belief is that this\neffectiveness stems from the ability of jointly attending multiple positions.\nIn this paper, we first demonstrate that jointly attending multiple positions\nis not a unique feature of multi-head attention, as multi-layer single-head\nattention also attends multiple positions and is more effective. Then, we\nsuggest the main advantage of the multi-head attention is the training\nstability, since it has less number of layers than the single-head attention,\nwhen attending the same number of positions. For example, 24-layer 16-head\nTransformer (BERT-large) and 384-layer single-head Transformer has the same\ntotal attention head number and roughly the same model size, while the\nmulti-head one is significantly shallower. Meanwhile, we show that, with recent\nadvances in deep learning, we can successfully stabilize the training of the\n384-layer Transformer. As the training difficulty is no longer a bottleneck,\nsubstantially deeper single-head Transformer achieves consistent performance\nimprovements without tuning hyper-parameters.",

          "description": "The dominant paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale\npre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or\ndomains. As we pre-train larger models, conventional fine-tuning, which\nretrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an\nexample, deploying many independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with\n175B parameters, is extremely expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or\nLoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank\ndecomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly\nreducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. For GPT-3,\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\ncomputation hardware requirement by 3 times compared to full fine-tuning. LoRA\nperforms on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on both GPT-3 and\nGPT-2, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput,\nand no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation\ninto rank-deficiency in language model adaptations, which sheds light on the\nefficacy of LoRA.

          "description": "The ability of semantic reasoning over the sentence pair is essential for\nmany natural language understanding tasks, e.g., natural language inference and\nmachine reading comprehension. A recent significant improvement in these tasks\ncomes from BERT. As reported, the next sentence prediction (NSP) in BERT, which\nlearns the contextual relationship between two sentences, is of great\nsignificance for downstream problems with sentence-pair input. Despite the\neffectiveness of NSP, we suggest that NSP still lacks the essential signal to\ndistinguish between entailment and shallow correlation. To remedy this, we\npropose to augment the NSP task to a 3-class categorization task, which\nincludes a category for previous sentence prediction (PSP). The involvement of\nPSP encourages the model to focus on the informative semantics to determine the\nsentence order, thereby improves the ability of semantic understanding. This\nsimple modification yields remarkable improvement against vanilla BERT. To\nfurther incorporate the document-level information, the scope of NSP and PSP is\nexpanded into a broader range, i.e., NSP and PSP also include close but\nnonsuccessive sentences, the noise of which is mitigated by the label-smoothing\ntechnique. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method consistently improves the\nperformance on the NLI and MRC benchmarks, including the challenging HANS\ndataset \\cite{hans}, suggesting that the document-level task is still promising\nfor the pre-training.",

Our approach works in a pipelined manner with\nknowledge-seeking turn detection, knowledge selection, and response generation\nin sequence. We introduce novel data augmentation methods for the first two\nsteps and demonstrate that the use of information extracted from dialogue\ncontext improves the knowledge selection and end-to-end performances.

          "description": "To acquire a new skill, humans learn better and faster if a tutor, based on\ntheir current knowledge level, informs them of how much attention they should\npay to particular content or practice problems. Similarly, a machine learning\nmodel could potentially be trained better with a scorer that \"adapts\" to its\ncurrent learning state and estimates the importance of each training data\ninstance. Training such an adaptive scorer efficiently is a challenging\nproblem; in order to precisely quantify the effect of a data instance at a\ngiven time during the training, it is typically necessary to first complete the\nentire training process. To efficiently optimize data usage, we propose a\nreinforcement learning approach called Differentiable Data Selection (DDS). In\nDDS, we formulate a scorer network as a learnable function of the training\ndata, which can be efficiently updated along with the main model being trained.\nSpecifically, DDS updates the scorer with an intuitive reward signal: it should\nup-weigh the data that has a similar gradient with a dev set upon which we\nwould finally like to perform well. Without significant computing overhead, DDS\ndelivers strong and consistent improvements over several strong baselines on\ntwo very different tasks of machine translation and image classification.",

Earlier works on attribute\nnormalization focused on fuzzy string matching (also referred as syntactic\nmatching in this paper). In this work, we first perform an extensive study of\nnine syntactic matching algorithms and establish that 'cosine' similarity leads\nto best results, showing 2.7% improvement over commonly used Jaccard index.\nNext, we argue that string similarity alone is not sufficient for attribute\nnormalization as many surface forms require going beyond syntactic matching\n(e.g. \"720p\" and \"HD\" are synonyms). While semantic techniques like\nunsupervised embeddings (e.g. word2vec/fastText) have shown good results in\nword similarity tasks, we observed that they perform poorly to distinguish\nbetween close canonical forms, as these close forms often occur in similar\ncontexts. We propose to learn token embeddings using a twin network with\ntriplet loss. We propose an embedding learning task leveraging raw attribute\nvalues and product titles to learn these embeddings in a self-supervised\nfashion. We show that providing supervision using our proposed task improves\nover both syntactic and unsupervised embeddings based techniques for attribute\nnormalization.

There has been recent work on general\ninterpretable representation learning (Onoe and Durrett, 2020), but these\ndomain-agnostic representations do not readily transfer to the important domain\nof biomedicine. In this paper, we create a new entity type system and training\nset from a large corpus of biomedical texts by mapping entities to concepts in\na medical ontology, and from these to Wikipedia pages whose categories are our\ntypes. From this mapping we derive Biomedical Interpretable Entity\nRepresentations(BIERs), in which dimensions correspond to fine-grained entity\ntypes, and values are predicted probabilities that a given entity is of the\ncorresponding type. We propose a novel method that exploits BIER's final sparse\nand intermediate dense representations to facilitate model and entity type\ndebugging. We show that BIERs achieve strong performance in biomedical tasks\nincluding named entity disambiguation and entity label classification, and we\nprovide error analysis to highlight the utility of their interpretability,\nparticularly in low-supervision settings.

Based on the SCM, we\nlearn de-biased DS-NER via causal interventions. For intra-dictionary bias, we\nconduct backdoor adjustment to remove the spurious correlations introduced by\nthe dictionary confounder. For inter-dictionary bias, we propose a causal\ninvariance regularizer which will make DS-NER models more robust to the\nperturbation of dictionaries.

Recent work has\nshown that autoregressive generative models with cross-entropy objective\nfunctions exhibit smooth power-law relationships, or scaling laws, that predict\nmodel quality from model size, training set size, and the available compute\nbudget. These scaling laws allow one to choose nearly optimal hyper-parameters\ngiven constraints on available training data, model parameter count, or\ntraining computation budget. In this paper, we demonstrate that acoustic models\ntrained with an auto-predictive coding loss behave as if they are subject to\nsimilar scaling laws. We extend previous work to jointly predict loss due to\nmodel size, to training set size, and to the inherent \"irreducible loss\" of the\ntask.

          "description": "Denoising is the essential step for distant supervision based named entity\nrecognition. Previous denoising methods are mostly based on instance-level\nconfidence statistics, which ignore the variety of the underlying noise\ndistribution on different datasets and entity types. This makes them difficult\nto be adapted to high noise rate settings. In this paper, we propose\nHypergeometric Learning (HGL), a denoising algorithm for distantly supervised\nNER that takes both noise distribution and instance-level confidence into\nconsideration. Specifically, during neural network training, we naturally model\nthe noise samples in each batch following a hypergeometric distribution\nparameterized by the noise-rate. Then each instance in the batch is regarded as\neither correct or noisy one according to its label confidence derived from\nprevious training step, as well as the noise distribution in this sampled\nbatch. Experiments show that HGL can effectively denoise the weakly-labeled\ndata retrieved from distant supervision, and therefore results in significant\nimprovements on the trained models.",

          "description": "Scalability for handling unknown slot values is a important problem in\ndialogue state tracking (DST). As far as we know, previous scalable DST\napproaches generally rely on either the candidate generation from slot tagging\noutput or the span extraction in dialogue context. However, the candidate\ngeneration based DST often suffers from error propagation due to its pipelined\ntwo-stage process; meanwhile span extraction based DST has the risk of\ngenerating invalid spans in the lack of semantic constraints between start and\nend position pointers. To tackle the above drawbacks, in this paper, we propose\na novel scalable dialogue state tracking method based on slot tagging\nnavigation, which implements an end-to-end single-step pointer to locate and\nextract slot value quickly and accurately by the joint learning of slot tagging\nand slot value position prediction in the dialogue context, especially for\nunknown slot values.

This model was employed with a linear attention\nmechanism and highly paralleized training on 1D SMILES sequences of 1.1 billion\nunlabeled molecules from the PubChem and ZINC datasets. Experiments show that\nthe learned molecular representation performs competitively, when compared to\nexisting graph-based and fingerprint-based supervised learning baselines, on\nthe challenging tasks of predicting properties of QM8 and QM9 molecules.\nFurther task-specific fine-tuning of the MoLFormerr representation improves\nperformance on several of those property prediction benchmarks.

          "description": "Machine learning approaches applied to NLP are often evaluated by summarizing\ntheir performance in a single number, for example accuracy. Since most test\nsets are constructed as an i.i.d. sample from the overall data, this approach\noverly simplifies the complexity of language and encourages overfitting to the\nhead of the data distribution. As such, rare language phenomena or text about\nunderrepresented groups are not equally included in the evaluation. To\nencourage more in-depth model analyses, researchers have proposed the use of\nmultiple test sets, also called challenge sets, that assess specific\ncapabilities of a model. In this paper, we develop a framework based on this\nidea which is able to generate controlled perturbations and identify subsets in\ntext-to-scalar, text-to-text, or data-to-text settings. By applying this\nframework to the GEM generation benchmark, we propose an evaluation suite made\nof 80 challenge sets, demonstrate the kinds of analyses that it enables and\nshed light onto the limits of current generation models.",

We answer this question by\nadapting an encoder-decoder transfer learning method from computer vision to\ninvestigate the structure among 100 different feature spaces extracted from\nhidden representations of various networks trained on language tasks. This\nmethod reveals a low-dimensional structure where language models and\ntranslation models smoothly interpolate between word embeddings, syntactic and\nsemantic tasks, and future word embeddings. We call this low-dimensional\nstructure a language representation embedding because it encodes the\nrelationships between representations needed to process language for a variety\nof NLP tasks. We find that this representation embedding can predict how well\neach individual feature space maps to human brain responses to natural language\nstimuli recorded using fMRI. Additionally, we find that the principal dimension\nof this structure can be used to create a metric which highlights the brain's\nnatural language processing hierarchy.

In contrast, there is comparatively little\nwork in the area of speaking, particularly with respect to fully automated\napproaches to assessing L2 spontaneous speech. While the importance of a\nwell-performing ASR system is widely recognized, little research has been\nconducted to investigate the impact of its performance on subsequent automatic\ntext analysis. In this paper, we focus on this issue and examine the impact of\nusing a state-of-the-art ASR system for subsequent automatic analysis of\nlinguistic complexity in spontaneously produced L2 speech. A set of 30 selected\nmeasures were considered, falling into four categories: syntactic, lexical,\nn-gram frequency, and information-theoretic measures. The agreement between the\nscores for these measures obtained on the basis of ASR-generated vs. manual\ntranscriptions was determined through correlation analysis. A more differential\neffect of ASR performance on specific types of complexity measures when\ncontrolling for task type effects is also presented.",

          "description": "Pre-trained language models have been successful on text classification\ntasks, but are prone to learning spurious correlations from biased datasets,\nand are thus vulnerable when making inferences in a new domain. Prior works\nreveal such spurious patterns via post-hoc explanation algorithms which compute\nthe importance of input features. Further, the model is regularized to align\nthe importance scores with human knowledge, so that the unintended model\nbehaviors are eliminated. However, such a regularization technique lacks\nflexibility and coverage, since only importance scores towards a pre-defined\nlist of features are adjusted, while more complex human knowledge such as\nfeature interaction and pattern generalization can hardly be incorporated. In\nthis work, we propose to refine a learned language model for a target domain by\ncollecting human-provided compositional explanations regarding observed biases.\nBy parsing these explanations into executable logic rules, the human-specified\nrefinement advice from a small set of explanations can be generalized to more\ntraining examples. We additionally introduce a regularization term allowing\nadjustments for both importance and interaction of features to better rectify\nmodel behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on\ntwo text classification tasks by showing improved performance in target domain\nas well as improved model fairness after refinement.",

          "description": "Variational autoencoders have been widely applied for natural language\ngeneration, however, there are two long-standing problems: information\nunder-representation and posterior collapse. The former arises from the fact\nthat only the last hidden state from the encoder is transformed to the latent\nspace, which is insufficient to summarize data. The latter comes as a result of\nthe imbalanced scale between the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence in\nthe objective function. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose the\ndiscrete variational attention model with categorical distribution over the\nattention mechanism owing to the discrete nature in languages. Our approach is\ncombined with an auto-regressive prior to capture the sequential dependency\nfrom observations, which can enhance the latent space for language generation.\nMoreover, thanks to the property of discreteness, the training of our proposed\napproach does not suffer from posterior collapse. Furthermore, we carefully\nanalyze the superiority of discrete latent space over the continuous space with\nthe common Gaussian distribution.

          "description": "Annotation projection is an important area in NLP that can greatly contribute\nto creating language resources for low-resource languages. Word alignment plays\na key role in this setting. However, most of the existing word alignment\nmethods are designed for a high resource setting in machine translation where\nmillions of parallel sentences are available. This amount reduces to a few\nthousands of sentences when dealing with low-resource languages failing the\nexisting established IBM models. In this paper, we propose subword\nsampling-based alignment of text units. This method's hypothesis is that the\naggregation of different granularities of text for certain language pairs can\nhelp word-level alignment. For certain languages for which gold-standard\nalignments exist, we propose an iterative Bayesian optimization framework to\noptimize selecting possible subwords from the space of possible subword\nrepresentations of the source and target sentences. We show that the subword\nsampling method consistently outperforms word-level alignment on six language\npairs: English-German, English-French, English-Romanian, English-Persian,\nEnglish-Hindi, and English-Inuktitut. In addition, we show that the\nhyperparameters learned for certain language pairs can be applied to other\nlanguages at no supervision and consistently improve the alignment results. We\nobserve that using $5K$ parallel sentences together with our proposed subword\nsampling approach, we obtain similar F1 scores to the use of $100K$'s of\nparallel sentences in existing word-level fast-align/eflomal alignment methods.",

As a result, they\nare not immediately applicable to generation tasks that break the\nunidirectional assumption, such as paraphrasing or text-infilling,\nnecessitating task-specific supervision.\n\nIn this paper, we present Reflective Decoding, a novel unsupervised algorithm\nthat allows for direct application of unidirectional LMs to non-sequential\ntasks. Our 2-step approach requires no supervision or even parallel corpora,\nonly two off-the-shelf pretrained LMs in opposite directions: forward and\nbackward. First, in the contextualization step, we use LMs to generate\nensembles of past and future contexts which collectively capture the input\n(e.g. the source sentence for paraphrasing). Second, in the reflection step, we\ncondition on these \"context ensembles\", generating outputs that are compatible\nwith them. Comprehensive empirical results demonstrate that Reflective Decoding\noutperforms strong unsupervised baselines on both paraphrasing and abductive\ntext infilling, significantly narrowing the gap between unsupervised and\nsupervised methods.

In this paper, we\nshow that Deep Learning techniques can successfully address this problem.\nEssentially, we tackle a text classification task: an algorithm must learn to\ninfer whether an Italian enterprise performs e-commerce from the textual\ncontent of its website. To reach this goal, we developed a sophisticated\nprocessing pipeline and evaluated its performance through extensive\nexperiments. Our pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks and relies on Word\nEmbeddings to encode raw texts into grayscale images (i.e. normalized numeric\nmatrices). Web-scraped texts are huge and have very low signal to noise ratio:\nto overcome these issues, we adopted a framework known as False Positive\nReduction, which has seldom (if ever) been applied before to text\nclassification tasks.

          "description": "Recently developed large pre-trained language models, e.g., BERT, have\nachieved remarkable performance in many downstream natural language processing\napplications. These pre-trained language models often contain hundreds of\nmillions of parameters and suffer from high computation and latency in\nreal-world applications. It is desirable to reduce the computation overhead of\nthe models for fast training and inference while keeping the model performance\nin downstream applications. Several lines of work utilize knowledge\ndistillation to compress the teacher model to a smaller student model. However,\nthey usually discard the teacher's knowledge when in inference. Differently, in\nthis paper, we propose RefBERT to leverage the knowledge learned from the\nteacher, i.e., facilitating the pre-computed BERT representation on the\nreference sample and compressing BERT into a smaller student model. To\nguarantee our proposal, we provide theoretical justification on the loss\nfunction and the usage of reference samples. Significantly, the theoretical\nresult shows that including the pre-computed teacher's representations on the\nreference samples indeed increases the mutual information in learning the\nstudent model. Finally, we conduct the empirical evaluation and show that our\nRefBERT can beat the vanilla TinyBERT over 8.1\\% and achieves more than 94\\% of\nthe performance of $\\BERTBASE$ on the GLUE benchmark. Meanwhile, RefBERT is\n7.4x smaller and 9.5x faster on inference than BERT$_{\\rm BASE}$.",

We propose a fully\ndifferentiable, transformer-based, hierarchical system that can be pretrained\nat both the ASR and NLU levels.

This leads to an SLU system that achieves significant\nimprovements over baselines on a complex internal generalized VA dataset with a\n43% improvement in accuracy, while still meeting the 99% accuracy benchmark on\nthe popular Fluent Speech Commands dataset. We further evaluate our model on a\nhard test set, exclusively containing slot arguments unseen in training, and\ndemonstrate a nearly 20% improvement, showing the efficacy of our approach in\ntruly demanding VA scenarios.",

          "description": "Weak supervision has shown promising results in many natural language\nprocessing tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Existing work mainly\nfocuses on learning deep NER models only with weak supervision, i.e., without\nany human annotation, and shows that by merely using weakly labeled data, one\ncan achieve good performance, though still underperforms fully supervised NER\nwith manually/strongly labeled data. In this paper, we consider a more\npractical scenario, where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data\nand a large amount of weakly labeled data. Unfortunately, we observe that\nweakly labeled data does not necessarily improve, or even deteriorate the model\nperformance (due to the extensive noise in the weak labels) when we train deep\nNER models over a simple or weighted combination of the strongly labeled and\nweakly labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-stage\ncomputational framework -- NEEDLE with three essential ingredients: (1) weak\nlabel completion, (2) noise-aware loss function, and (3) final fine-tuning over\nthe strongly labeled data. Through experiments on E-commerce query NER and\nBiomedical NER, we demonstrate that NEEDLE can effectively suppress the noise\nof the weak labels and outperforms existing methods. In particular, we achieve\nnew SOTA F1-scores on 3 Biomedical NER datasets: BC5CDR-chem 93.74,\nBC5CDR-disease 90.69, NCBI-disease 92.28.",

          "description": "Language is an interface to the outside world. In order for embodied agents\nto use it, language must be grounded in other, sensorimotor modalities. While\nthere is an extended literature studying how machines can learn grounded\nlanguage, the topic of how to learn spatio-temporal linguistic concepts is\nstill largely uncharted. To make progress in this direction, we here introduce\na novel spatio-temporal language grounding task where the goal is to learn the\nmeaning of spatio-temporal descriptions of behavioral traces of an embodied\nagent. This is achieved by training a truth function that predicts if a\ndescription matches a given history of observations. The descriptions involve\ntime-extended predicates in past and present tense as well as spatio-temporal\nreferences to objects in the scene. To study the role of architectural biases\nin this task, we train several models including multimodal Transformer\narchitectures; the latter implement different attention computations between\nwords and objects across space and time. We test models on two classes of\ngeneralization: 1) generalization to randomly held-out sentences; 2)\ngeneralization to grammar primitives. We observe that maintaining object\nidentity in the attention computation of our Transformers is instrumental to\nachieving good performance on generalization overall, and that summarizing\nobject traces in a single token has little influence on performance. We then\ndiscuss how this opens new perspectives for language-guided autonomous embodied\nagents. We also release our code under open-source license as well as\npretrained models and datasets to encourage the wider community to build upon\nand extend our work in the future.",

A coreference phenomenon observed in\nmulti-turn conversations is not addressed by existing DST models, leading to\nsub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose Coreference Dialogue State\nTracker (CDST) that explicitly models the coreference feature. In particular,\nat each turn, the proposed model jointly predicts the coreferred domain-slot\npair and extracts the coreference values from the dialogue context.\nExperimental results on MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset show that the proposed model\nachieves the state-of-the-art joint goal accuracy of 56.47%.",

          "description": "Visually grounded speech models learn from images paired with spoken\ncaptions. By tagging images with soft text labels using a trained visual\nclassifier with a fixed vocabulary, previous work has shown that it is possible\nto train a model that can detect whether a particular text keyword occurs in\nspeech utterances or not. Here we investigate whether visually grounded speech\nmodels can also do keyword localisation: predicting where, within an utterance,\na given textual keyword occurs without any explicit text-based or alignment\nsupervision. We specifically consider whether incorporating attention into a\nconvolutional model is beneficial for localisation. Although absolute\nlocalisation performance with visually supervised models is still modest\n(compared to using unordered bag-of-word text labels for supervision), we show\nthat attention provides a large gain in performance over previous visually\ngrounded models. As in many other speech-image studies, we find that many of\nthe incorrect localisations are due to semantic confusions, e.g. locating the\nword 'backstroke' for the query keyword 'swimming'.",

As a case study, we improve expressive speech vocoding with\na revamped Parallel Wavenet (PW).

The\ngreater expressiveness of the improved PW leads to better-perceived signal\nquality and naturalness in the waveform reconstruction and text-to-speech (TTS)\ntasks. We evaluate the model across different speaking styles on a\nmulti-speaker, multi-lingual dataset. In the waveform reconstruction task, the\nproposed model closes the naturalness and signal quality gap from the original\nPW to recordings by $10\\%$, and from other state-of-the-art neural vocoding\nsystems by more than $60\\%$. We also demonstrate improvements in objective\nmetrics on the evaluation test set with L2 Spectral Distance and Cross-Entropy\nreduced by $3\\%$ and $6\\unicode{x2030}$ comparing to the affine PW.\nFurthermore, we extend the probability density distillation procedure proposed\nby the original PW paper, so that it works with any non-affine invertible and\ndifferentiable function.",

          "description": "Automated source code summarization is a popular software engineering\nresearch topic wherein machine translation models are employed to \"translate\"\ncode snippets into relevant natural language descriptions. Most evaluations of\nsuch models are conducted using automatic reference-based metrics. However,\ngiven the relatively large semantic gap between programming languages and\nnatural language, we argue that this line of research would benefit from a\nqualitative investigation into the various error modes of current\nstate-of-the-art models. Therefore, in this work, we perform both a\nquantitative and qualitative comparison of three recently proposed source code\nsummarization models. In our quantitative evaluation, we compare the models\nbased on the smoothed BLEU-4, METEOR, and ROUGE-L machine translation metrics,\nand in our qualitative evaluation, we perform a manual open-coding of the most\ncommon errors committed by the models when compared to ground truth captions.\nOur investigation reveals new insights into the relationship between\nmetric-based performance and model prediction errors grounded in an empirically\nderived error taxonomy that can be used to drive future research efforts",

In DocRE, a subset of the sentences\nin a document, called the evidence sentences, might be sufficient for\npredicting the relation between a specific entity pair. To make better use of\nthe evidence sentences, in this paper, we propose a three-stage\nevidence-enhanced DocRE framework consisting of joint relation and evidence\nextraction, evidence-centered relation extraction (RE), and fusion of\nextraction results. We first jointly train an RE model with a simple and\nmemory-efficient evidence extraction model. Then, we construct pseudo documents\nbased on the extracted evidence sentences and run the RE model again. Finally,\nwe fuse the extraction results of the first two stages using a blending layer\nand make a final prediction.

          "description": "Out-of-scope intent detection is of practical importance in task-oriented\ndialogue systems. Since the distribution of outlier utterances is arbitrary and\nunknown in the training stage, existing methods commonly rely on strong\nassumptions on data distribution such as mixture of Gaussians to make\ninference, resulting in either complex multi-step training procedures or\nhand-crafted rules such as confidence threshold selection for outlier\ndetection. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to train an\nout-of-scope intent classifier in a fully end-to-end manner by simulating the\ntest scenario in training, which requires no assumption on data distribution\nand no additional post-processing or threshold setting. Specifically, we\nconstruct a set of pseudo outliers in the training stage, by generating\nsynthetic outliers using inliner features via self-supervision and sampling\nout-of-scope sentences from easily available open-domain datasets. The pseudo\noutliers are used to train a discriminative classifier that can be directly\napplied to and generalize well on the test task. We evaluate our method\nextensively on four benchmark dialogue datasets and observe significant\nimprovements over state-of-the-art approaches.

In this paper, we\nask: does the distance in the acoustic embedding space correlate with\nphonological dissimilarity? To answer this question, we empirically investigate\nthe performance of supervised approaches for AWEs with different neural\narchitectures and learning objectives. We train AWE models in controlled\nsettings for two languages (German and Czech) and evaluate the embeddings on\ntwo tasks: word discrimination and phonological similarity. Our experiments\nshow that (1) the distance in the embedding space in the best cases only\nmoderately correlates with phonological distance, and (2) improving the\nperformance on the word discrimination task does not necessarily yield models\nthat better reflect word phonological similarity.

Specifically, we design a joint learning framework where the\nauxiliary self-supervised tasks can enable the pre-trained SCQA systems towards\nmore coherent and meaningful spoken dialogue learning. We also utilize the\nproposed self-supervised learning tasks to capture intra-sentence coherence.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed method provides more\ncoherent, meaningful, and appropriate responses, yielding superior performance\ngains compared to the original pre-trained language models.

          "description": "We present a novel interactive learning protocol that enables training\nrequest-fulfilling agents by verbally describing their activities. Unlike\nimitation learning (IL), our protocol allows the teaching agent to provide\nfeedback in a language that is most appropriate for them. Compared with reward\nin reinforcement learning (RL), the description feedback is richer and allows\nfor improved sample complexity. We develop a probabilistic framework and an\nalgorithm that practically implements our protocol. Empirical results in two\nchallenging request-fulfilling problems demonstrate the strengths of our\napproach: compared with RL baselines, it is more sample-efficient; compared\nwith IL baselines, it achieves competitive success rates without requiring the\nteaching agent to be able to demonstrate the desired behavior using the\nlearning agent's actions. Apart from empirical evaluation, we also provide\ntheoretical guarantees for our algorithm under certain assumptions about the\nteacher and the environment.",

In contrast to most of the works in speaker recognition that focus on\nspeaker-discriminative embeddings, this work focuses on speaker label inference\n(scoring). Given a pre-trained embedding extractor, graph-based learning allows\nus to integrate information about both labeled and unlabeled utterances.\nConsidering each utterance as a graph node, we represent pairwise utterance\nsimilarity scores as edge weights. Graphs are constructed per household, and\nspeaker identities are propagated to unlabeled nodes to optimize a global\nconsistency criterion. We show in experiments on the VoxCeleb dataset that this\napproach makes effective use of unlabeled data and improves speaker\nidentification accuracy compared to two state-of-the-art scoring methods as\nwell as their semi-supervised variants based on pseudo-labels.",

The state of the art for semantic representation and\ninference is deep learning, and particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and transformer Self-Attention models.\nThis thesis investigates the use of deep learning for novel semantic\nrepresentation and inference, and makes contributions in the following three\nareas: creating training data, improving semantic representations and extending\ninference learning. In terms of creating training data, we contribute the\nlargest publicly available dataset of real-life factual claims for the purpose\nof automatic claim verification (MultiFC), and we present a novel inference\nmodel composed of multi-scale CNNs with different kernel sizes that learn from\nexternal sources to infer fact checking labels. In terms of improving semantic\nrepresentations, we contribute a novel model that captures non-compositional\nsemantic indicators. By definition, the meaning of a non-compositional phrase\ncannot be inferred from the individual meanings of its composing words (e.g.,\nhot dog). Motivated by this, we operationalize the compositionality of a phrase\ncontextually by enriching the phrase representation with external word\nembeddings and knowledge graphs. Finally, in terms of inference learning, we\npropose a series of novel deep learning architectures that improve inference by\nusing syntactic dependencies, by ensembling role guided attention heads,\nincorporating gating layers, and concatenating multiple heads in novel and\neffective ways.

          "description": "As speech-enabled devices such as smartphones and smart speakers become\nincreasingly ubiquitous, there is growing interest in building automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) systems that can run directly on-device; end-to-end (E2E)\nspeech recognition models such as recurrent neural network transducers and\ntheir variants have recently emerged as prime candidates for this task. Apart\nfrom being accurate and compact, such systems need to decode speech with low\nuser-perceived latency (UPL), producing words as soon as they are spoken. This\nwork examines the impact of various techniques - model architectures, training\ncriteria, decoding hyperparameters, and endpointer parameters - on UPL. Our\nanalyses suggest that measures of model size (parameters, input chunk sizes),\nor measures of computation (e.g., FLOPS, RTF) that reflect the model's ability\nto process input frames are not always strongly correlated with observed UPL.\nThus, conventional algorithmic latency measurements might be inadequate in\naccurately capturing latency observed when models are deployed on embedded\ndevices. Instead, we find that factors affecting token emission latency, and\nendpointing behavior have a larger impact on UPL. We achieve the best trade-off\nbetween latency and word error rate when performing ASR jointly with\nendpointing, while utilizing the recently proposed alignment regularization\nmechanism.",

          "description": "In recent years, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has achieved notable\nresults in various translation tasks. However, the word-by-word generation\nmanner determined by the autoregressive mechanism leads to high translation\nlatency of the NMT and restricts its low-latency applications.\nNon-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation (NAT) removes the autoregressive\nmechanism and achieves significant decoding speedup through generating target\nwords independently and simultaneously. Nevertheless, NAT still takes the\nword-level cross-entropy loss as the training objective, which is not optimal\nbecause the output of NAT cannot be properly evaluated due to the multimodality\nproblem. In this paper, we propose using sequence-level training objectives to\ntrain NAT models, which evaluate the NAT outputs as a whole and correlates well\nwith the real translation quality. Firstly, we propose training NAT models to\noptimize sequence-level evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU) based on several novel\nreinforcement algorithms customized for NAT, which outperforms the conventional\nmethod by reducing the variance of gradient estimation. Secondly, we introduce\na novel training objective for NAT models, which aims to minimize the\nBag-of-Ngrams (BoN) difference between the model output and the reference\nsentence. The BoN training objective is differentiable and can be calculated\nefficiently without doing any approximations. Finally, we apply a three-stage\ntraining strategy to combine these two methods to train the NAT model. We\nvalidate our approach on four translation tasks (WMT14 En$\\leftrightarrow$De,\nWMT16 En$\\leftrightarrow$Ro), which shows that our approach largely outperforms\nNAT baselines and achieves remarkable performance on all translation tasks.",

Labeled code-switched data are rare, so monolingual data are\noften used to model code-switched speech. These monolingual data may be more\nclosely matched to one of the languages in the code-switch pair. We show that\nsuch asymmetry can bias prediction toward the better-matched language and\ndegrade overall model performance. To address this issue, we propose a\nsemi-supervised approach for code-switched ASR. We consider the case of\nEnglish-Mandarin code-switching, and the problem of using monolingual data to\nbuild bilingual \"transcription models'' for annotation of unlabeled\ncode-switched data. We first build multiple transcription models so that their\nindividual predictions are variously biased toward either English or Mandarin.\nWe then combine these biased transcriptions using confidence-based selection.\nThis strategy generates a superior transcript for semi-supervised training, and\nobtains a 19% relative improvement compared to a semi-supervised system that\nrelies on a transcription model built with only the best-matched monolingual\ndata.",

          "description": "In structured prediction, a major challenge for models is to represent the\ninterdependencies within their output structures. For the common case where\noutputs are structured as a sequence, linear-chain conditional random fields\n(CRFs) are a widely used model class which can learn local dependencies in\noutput sequences. However, the CRF's Markov assumption makes it impossible for\nthese models to capture nonlocal dependencies, and standard CRFs are unable to\nrespect nonlocal constraints of the data (such as global arity constraints on\noutput labels). We present a generalization of CRFs that can enforce a broad\nclass of constraints, including nonlocal ones, by specifying the space of\npossible output structures as a regular language $\\mathcal{L}$. The resulting\nregular-constrained CRF (RegCCRF) has the same formal properties as a standard\nCRF, but assigns zero probability to all label sequences not in $\\mathcal{L}$.\nNotably, RegCCRFs can incorporate their constraints during training, while\nrelated models only enforce constraints during decoding. We prove that\nconstrained training is never worse than constrained decoding, and show using\nsynthetic data that it can be substantially better in practice. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate a practical benefit on downstream tasks by incorporating a\nRegCCRF into a deep neural model for semantic role labeling, exceeding\nstate-of-the-art results on a standard dataset.",

          "description": "The amount of archaeological literature is growing rapidly. Until recently,\nthese data were only accessible through metadata search. We implemented a text\nretrieval engine for a large archaeological text collection ($\\sim 658$ Million\nwords). In archaeological IR, domain-specific entities such as locations, time\nperiods, and artefacts, play a central role. This motivated the development of\na named entity recognition (NER) model to annotate the full collection with\narchaeological named entities. In this paper, we present ArcheoBERTje, a BERT\nmodel pre-trained on Dutch archaeological texts. We compare the model's quality\nand output on a Named Entity Recognition task to a generic multilingual model\nand a generic Dutch model. We also investigate ensemble methods for combining\nmultiple BERT models, and combining the best BERT model with a domain thesaurus\nusing Conditional Random Fields (CRF). We find that ArcheoBERTje outperforms\nboth the multilingual and Dutch model significantly with a smaller standard\ndeviation between runs, reaching an average F1 score of 0.735. The model also\noutperforms ensemble methods combining the three models. Combining ArcheoBERTje\npredictions and explicit domain knowledge from the thesaurus did not increase\nthe F1 score. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyse the differences\nbetween the vocabulary and output of the BERT models on the full collection and\nprovide some valuable insights in the effect of fine-tuning for specific\ndomains. Our results indicate that for a highly specific text domain such as\narchaeology, further pre-training on domain-specific data increases the model's\nquality on NER by a much larger margin than shown for other domains in the\nliterature, and that domain-specific pre-training makes the addition of domain\nknowledge from a thesaurus unnecessary.",

          "description": "Encoder pre-training is promising in end-to-end Speech Translation (ST),\ngiven the fact that speech-to-translation data is scarce. But ST encoders are\nnot simple instances of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Machine\nTranslation (MT) encoders. For example, we find that ASR encoders lack the\nglobal context representation, which is necessary for translation, whereas MT\nencoders are not designed to deal with long but locally attentive acoustic\nsequences. In this work, we propose a Stacked Acoustic-and-Textual Encoding\n(SATE) method for speech translation. Our encoder begins with processing the\nacoustic sequence as usual, but later behaves more like an MT encoder for a\nglobal representation of the input sequence. In this way, it is straightforward\nto incorporate the pre-trained models into the system. Also, we develop an\nadaptor module to alleviate the representation inconsistency between the\npre-trained ASR encoder and MT encoder, and develop a multi-teacher knowledge\ndistillation method to preserve the pre-training knowledge. Experimental\nresults on the LibriSpeech En-Fr and MuST-C En-De ST tasks show that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art BLEU scores of 18.3 and 25.2. To our knowledge, we\nare the first to develop an end-to-end ST system that achieves comparable or\neven better BLEU performance than the cascaded ST counterpart when large-scale\nASR and MT data is available.",

          "description": "Beam search is a go-to strategy for decoding neural sequence models. The\nalgorithm can naturally be viewed as a subset optimization problem, albeit one\nwhere the corresponding set function does not reflect interactions between\ncandidates. Empirically, this leads to sets often exhibiting high overlap,\ne.g., strings may differ by only a single word. Yet in use-cases that call for\nmultiple solutions, a diverse or representative set is often desired. To\naddress this issue, we propose a reformulation of beam search, which we call\ndeterminantal beam search. Determinantal beam search has a natural relationship\nto determinantal point processes (DPPs), models over sets that inherently\nencode intra-set interactions. By posing iterations in beam search as a series\nof subdeterminant maximization problems, we can turn the algorithm into a\ndiverse subset selection process. In a case study, we use the string\nsubsequence kernel to explicitly encourage n-gram coverage in text generated\nfrom a sequence model. We observe that our algorithm offers competitive\nperformance against other diverse set generation strategies in the context of\nlanguage generation, while providing a more general approach to optimizing for\ndiversity.",

In\nincremental text-to-speech synthesis, where the synthesizer produces an output\nbefore it has access to the complete input, the full context is often unknown\nwhich can result in a loss of naturalness in the synthesized speech.

          "description": "One of the long-standing challenges in lexical semantics consists in learning\nrepresentations of words which reflect their semantic properties. The\nremarkable success of word embeddings for this purpose suggests that\nhigh-quality representations can be obtained by summarizing the sentence\ncontexts of word mentions. In this paper, we propose a method for learning word\nrepresentations that follows this basic strategy, but differs from standard\nword embeddings in two important ways. First, we take advantage of\ncontextualized language models (CLMs) rather than bags of word vectors to\nencode contexts. Second, rather than learning a word vector directly, we use a\ntopic model to partition the contexts in which words appear, and then learn\ndifferent topic-specific vectors for each word. Finally, we use a task-specific\nsupervision signal to make a soft selection of the resulting vectors. We show\nthat this simple strategy leads to high-quality word vectors, which are more\npredictive of semantic properties than word embeddings and existing CLM-based\nstrategies.",

However, the\nnature of these activations remains largely unknown and presumably conflate\ndistinct linguistic classes. Here, we propose a taxonomy to factorize the\nhigh-dimensional activations of language models into four combinatorial\nclasses: lexical, compositional, syntactic, and semantic representations. We\nthen introduce a statistical method to decompose, through the lens of GPT-2's\nactivations, the brain activity of 345 subjects recorded with functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the listening of ~4.6 hours of\nnarrated text. The results highlight two findings. First, compositional\nrepresentations recruit a more widespread cortical network than lexical ones,\nand encompass the bilateral temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices. Second,\ncontrary to previous claims, syntax and semantics are not associated with\nseparated modules, but, instead, appear to share a common and distributed\nneural substrate. Overall, this study introduces a versatile framework to\nisolate, in the brain activity, the distributed representations of linguistic\nconstructs.",

We propose a method that represents the latent\ntopical confounds and a model which \"unlearns\" confounding features by\npredicting both the label of the input text and the confound; but we train the\ntwo predictors adversarially in an alternating fashion to learn a text\nrepresentation that predicts the correct label but is less prone to using\ninformation about the confound.

On the other hand, due to the uncertainty of the\nsituation, human experts' supervision would always be required to double check\nthe decision making of these models highlighting the importance of\ninterpretability. In the light of these challenges, this study proposes an\ninterpretable self-supervised multi-task learning model to jointly and\neffectively tackle the tasks of information retrieval (IR) and extraction (IE)\nduring the current emergency health crisis situation. Our results show that our\nmodel effectively leverage the multi-task and self-supervised learning to\nimprove generalization, data efficiency and robustness to the ongoing dataset\nshift problem. Our model outperforms baselines in IE and IR tasks, respectively\nby micro-f score of 0.08 (LCA-F score of 0.05), and MAP of 0.05 on average. In\nIE the zero- and few-shot learning performances are on average 0.32 and 0.19\nmicro-f score higher than those of the baselines.",

          "description": "Transformer models have demonstrated superior performance in natural language\nprocessing. The dot product self-attention in Transformer allows us to model\ninteractions between words. However, this modeling comes with significant\ncomputational overhead. In this work, we revisit the memory-compute trade-off\nassociated with Transformer, particularly multi-head attention, and show a\nmemory-heavy but significantly more compute-efficient alternative to\nTransformer. Our proposal, denoted as PairConnect, a multilayer perceptron\n(MLP), models the pairwise interaction between words by explicit pairwise word\nembeddings. As a result, PairConnect substitutes self dot product with a simple\nembedding lookup. We show mathematically that despite being an MLP, our\ncompute-efficient PairConnect is strictly more expressive than Transformer. Our\nexperiment on language modeling tasks suggests that PairConnect could achieve\ncomparable results with Transformer while reducing the computational cost\nassociated with inference significantly.",

We\nexperimentally demonstrate that directly transferring the stable feature\nextractor learned on the source task may not eliminate these biases for the\ntarget task. However, we hypothesize that the unstable features in the source\ntask and those in the target task are directly related. By explicitly informing\nthe target classifier of the source task's unstable features, we can regularize\nthe biases in the target task. Specifically, we derive a representation that\nencodes the unstable features by contrasting different data environments in the\nsource task. On the target task, we cluster data from this representation, and\nachieve robustness by minimizing the worst-case risk across all clusters. We\nevaluate our method on both text and image classifications. Empirical results\ndemonstrate that our algorithm is able to maintain robustness on the target\ntask, outperforming the best baseline by 22.9% in absolute accuracy across 12\ntransfer settings.

          "description": "Computational approaches for assessing the quality of conversation-based\npsychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Motivational\nInterviewing (MI), have been developed recently to support quality assurance\nand clinical training. However, due to the long session lengths and limited\nmodeling resources, computational methods largely rely on frequency-based\nlexical features or distribution of dialogue acts. In this work, we propose a\nhierarchical framework to automatically evaluate the quality of a CBT\ninteraction. We divide each psychotherapy session into conversation segments\nand input those into a BERT-based model to produce segment embeddings. We first\nfine-tune BERT for predicting segment-level (local) quality scores and then use\nsegment embeddings as lower-level input to a Bidirectional LSTM-based neural\nnetwork to predict session-level (global) quality estimates. In particular, the\nsegment-level quality scores are initialized with the session-level scores and\nwe model the global quality as a function of the local quality scores to\nachieve the accurate segment-level quality estimates. These estimated\nsegment-level scores benefit theBERT fine-tuning and in learning better segment\nembeddings. We evaluate the proposed framework on data drawn from real-world\nCBT clinical session recordings to predict multiple session-level behavior\ncodes. The results indicate that our approach leads to improved evaluation\naccuracy for most codes in both regression and classification tasks.",

          "description": "If two sentences have the same meaning, it should follow that they are\nequivalent in their inferential properties, i.e., each sentence should\ntextually entail the other. However, many paraphrase datasets currently in\nwidespread use rely on a sense of paraphrase based on word overlap and syntax.\nCan we teach them instead to identify paraphrases in a way that draws on the\ninferential properties of the sentences, and is not over-reliant on lexical and\nsyntactic similarities of a sentence pair? We apply the adversarial paradigm to\nthis question, and introduce a new adversarial method of dataset creation for\nparaphrase identification: the Adversarial Paraphrasing Task (APT), which asks\nparticipants to generate semantically equivalent (in the sense of mutually\nimplicative) but lexically and syntactically disparate paraphrases. These\nsentence pairs can then be used both to test paraphrase identification models\n(which get barely random accuracy) and then improve their performance. To\naccelerate dataset generation, we explore automation of APT using T5, and show\nthat the resulting dataset also improves accuracy.

This rich\ninformation is suppressed when combined with the lower entropy decoder outputs\nto produce the joint network logits. Consequently, we introduce an auxiliary\nloss to distill the encoder logits from a teacher transducer's encoder, and\nexplore training strategies where this encoder distillation works effectively.\nWe find that tandem training of teacher and student encoders with an inplace\nencoder distillation outperforms the use of a pre-trained and static teacher\ntransducer. We also report an interesting phenomenon we refer to as implicit\ndistillation, that occurs when the teacher and student encoders share the same\ndecoder.

Current researches in this field mainly focus on\ngenerating responses consistent with the robot's pre-assigned persona, while\nignoring the user's persona.

Therefore, we propose a\nbilateral personalized dialogue generation (BPDG) method with dynamic\npersona-aware fusion via multi-task transfer learning to generate responses\nconsistent with both personas. The proposed method aims to accomplish three\nlearning tasks: 1) an encoder is trained with dialogue utterances added with\ncorresponded personalized attributes and relative position (language model\ntask), 2) a dynamic persona-aware fusion module predicts the persona presence\nto adaptively fuse the contextual and bilateral personas encodings (persona\nprediction task) and 3) a decoder generates natural, fluent and personalized\nresponses (dialogue generation task). To make the generated responses more\npersonalized and bilateral persona-consistent, the Conditional Mutual\nInformation Maximum (CMIM) criterion is adopted to select the final response\nfrom the generated candidates.

To address this, we introduce a targeted\ndata acquisition framework where we guide the exploration of a reinforcement\nlearning agent using annotations from an expert oracle. The guided exploration\nincentivizes the learning agent to go beyond its static dataset and develop new\nnegotiation strategies. We show that this enables our agents to obtain\nhigher-reward and more Pareto-optimal solutions when negotiating with both\nsimulated and human partners compared to standard supervised learning and\nreinforcement learning methods.

This paradigm relies on direct supervision examples,\nwhich is not applicable to many applications, such as generating adversarial\nattacks or generating prompts to control language models.

In this paper, we introduce a new RL formulation for text generation\nfrom the soft Q-learning perspective. It further enables us to draw from the\nlatest RL advances, such as path consistency learning, to combine the best of\non-/off-policy updates, and learn effectively from sparse reward. We apply the\napproach to a wide range of tasks, including learning from noisy/negative\nexamples, adversarial attacks, and prompt generation.

          "description": "Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are competitive with hybrid models for\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks when large amounts of training data\nare available. However, data sparsity and domain adaptation are more\nproblematic for seq2seq models than their hybrid counterparts. We examine\ncorpora of five languages from the IARPA MATERIAL program where the transcribed\ndata is conversational telephone speech (CTS) and evaluation data is broadcast\nnews (BN). We show that there is a sizable initial gap in such a data condition\nbetween hybrid and seq2seq models, and the hybrid model is able to further\nimprove through the use of additional language model (LM) data. We use an\nadditional set of untranscribed data primarily in the BN domain for\nsemisupervised training. In semisupervised training, a seed model trained on\ntranscribed data generates hypothesized transcripts for unlabeled\ndomain-matched data for further training. By using a hybrid model with an\nexpanded language model for pseudotranscription, we are able to improve our\nseq2seq model from an average word error rate (WER) of 66.7% across all five\nlanguages to 29.0% WER. While this puts the seq2seq model at a competitive\noperating point, hybrid models are still able to use additional LM data to\nmaintain an advantage.",

          "description": "Contrastive learning has been applied successfully to learn vector\nrepresentations of text. Previous research demonstrated that learning\nhigh-quality representations benefits from batch-wise contrastive loss with a\nlarge number of negatives. In practice, the technique of in-batch negative is\nused, where for each example in a batch, other batch examples' positives will\nbe taken as its negatives, avoiding encoding extra negatives. This, however,\nstill conditions each example's loss on all batch examples and requires fitting\nthe entire large batch into GPU memory. This paper introduces a gradient\ncaching technique that decouples backpropagation between contrastive loss and\nthe encoder, removing encoder backward pass data dependency along the batch\ndimension. As a result, gradients can be computed for one subset of the batch\nat a time, leading to almost constant memory usage.",

To assist humans with\nwriting, lexical substitution systems can suggest words that humans cannot\neasily think of.

To this end, we use a context-free thesaurus to produce candidates\nand rely on human judgement to determine contextual appropriateness.

Inspired by this, we propose a novel self-supervised learning\nmethod, named Text-enhanced Visual Deep InfoMax (TVDIM), to learn better visual\nrepresentations by fully utilizing the naturally-existing multimodal data. Our\ncore idea of self-supervised learning is to maximize the mutual information\nbetween features extracted from multiple views of a shared context to a\nrational degree. Different from previous methods which only consider multiple\nviews from a single modality, our work produces multiple views from different\nmodalities, and jointly optimizes the mutual information for features pairs of\nintra-modality and inter-modality. Considering the information gap between\ninter-modality features pairs from data noise, we adopt a \\emph{ranking-based}\ncontrastive learning to optimize the mutual information. During evaluation, we\ndirectly use the pre-trained visual representations to complete various image\nclassification tasks.

We show that common training method which\nupsamples low resources can not robustly optimize population loss with risks of\neither underfitting high resource languages or overfitting low resource ones.\nDrawing on recent findings on the geometry of loss landscape and its effect on\ngeneralization, we propose a principled optimization algorithm, Curvature Aware\nTask Scaling (CATS), which adaptively rescales gradients from different tasks\nwith a meta objective of guiding multilingual training to low-curvature\nneighborhoods with uniformly low loss for all languages.

          "description": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can achieve promising results with outrageous\nlarge amount of parameters but constant computation cost, and thus it has\nbecome a trend in model scaling. Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring\nquality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this\nwork, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe\nthat load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,\ncontrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely\nactivated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can\nsignificantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step\nforward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits\nexperts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This\nstrategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,\nand our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is\nmore effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$\ntrillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in\ncomparison with the recent SOTAs on $2048$ TPU cores. The proposed giant model\nachieves substantial speedup in convergence over the same-size baseline.",

          "description": "Despite transformers' impressive accuracy, their computational cost is often\nprohibitive to use with limited computational resources. Most previous\napproaches to improve inference efficiency require a separate model for each\npossible computational budget. In this paper, we extend PoWER-BERT (Goyal et\nal., 2020) and propose Length-Adaptive Transformer that can be used for various\ninference scenarios after one-shot training. We train a transformer with\nLengthDrop, a structural variant of dropout, which stochastically determines a\nsequence length at each layer. We then conduct a multi-objective evolutionary\nsearch to find a length configuration that maximizes the accuracy and minimizes\nthe efficiency metric under any given computational budget. Additionally, we\nsignificantly extend the applicability of PoWER-BERT beyond sequence-level\nclassification into token-level classification with Drop-and-Restore process\nthat drops word-vectors temporarily in intermediate layers and restores at the\nlast layer if necessary. We empirically verify the utility of the proposed\napproach by demonstrating the superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off under\nvarious setups, including span-based question answering and text\nclassification.

          "description": "Both performance and efficiency are crucial factors for sequence labeling\ntasks in many real-world scenarios. Although the pre-trained models (PTMs) have\nsignificantly improved the performance of various sequence labeling tasks,\ntheir computational cost is expensive. To alleviate this problem, we extend the\nrecent successful early-exit mechanism to accelerate the inference of PTMs for\nsequence labeling tasks. However, existing early-exit mechanisms are\nspecifically designed for sequence-level tasks, rather than sequence labeling.\nIn this paper, we first propose a simple extension of sentence-level early-exit\nfor sequence labeling tasks. To further reduce the computational cost, we also\npropose a token-level early-exit mechanism that allows partial tokens to exit\nearly at different layers. Considering the local dependency inherent in\nsequence labeling, we employed a window-based criterion to decide for a token\nwhether or not to exit. The token-level early-exit brings the gap between\ntraining and inference, so we introduce an extra self-sampling fine-tuning\nstage to alleviate it. The extensive experiments on three popular sequence\nlabeling tasks show that our approach can save up to 66%-75% inference cost\nwith minimal performance degradation. Compared with competitive compressed\nmodels such as DistilBERT, our approach can achieve better performance under\nthe same speed-up ratios of 2X, 3X, and 4X.",

          "description": "Parallel cross-lingual summarization data is scarce, requiring models to\nbetter use the limited available cross-lingual resources. Existing methods to\ndo so often adopt sequence-to-sequence networks with multi-task frameworks.\nSuch approaches apply multiple decoders, each of which is utilized for a\nspecific task. However, these independent decoders share no parameters, hence\nfail to capture the relationships between the discrete phrases of summaries in\ndifferent languages, breaking the connections in order to transfer the\nknowledge of the high-resource languages to low-resource languages. To bridge\nthese connections, we propose a novel Multi-Task framework for Cross-Lingual\nAbstractive Summarization (MCLAS) in a low-resource setting. Employing one\nunified decoder to generate the sequential concatenation of monolingual and\ncross-lingual summaries, MCLAS makes the monolingual summarization task a\nprerequisite of the cross-lingual summarization (CLS) task. In this way, the\nshared decoder learns interactions involving alignments and summary patterns\nacross languages, which encourages attaining knowledge transfer. Experiments on\ntwo CLS datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms three\nbaseline models in both low-resource and full-dataset scenarios. Moreover,\nin-depth analysis on the generated summaries and attention heads verifies that\ninteractions are learned well using MCLAS, which benefits the CLS task under\nlimited parallel resources.",

          "description": "Recently, chest X-ray report generation, which aims to automatically generate\ndescriptions of given chest X-ray images, has received growing research\ninterests. The key challenge of chest X-ray report generation is to accurately\ncapture and describe the abnormal regions. In most cases, the normal regions\ndominate the entire chest X-ray image, and the corresponding descriptions of\nthese normal regions dominate the final report. Due to such data bias,\nlearning-based models may fail to attend to abnormal regions. In this work, to\neffectively capture and describe abnormal regions, we propose the Contrastive\nAttention (CA) model. Instead of solely focusing on the current input image,\nthe CA model compares the current input image with normal images to distill the\ncontrastive information. The acquired contrastive information can better\nrepresent the visual features of abnormal regions. According to the experiments\non the public IU-X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, incorporating our CA into\nseveral existing models can boost their performance across most metrics. In\naddition, according to the analysis, the CA model can help existing models\nbetter attend to the abnormal regions and provide more accurate descriptions\nwhich are crucial for an interpretable diagnosis.

          "description": "Leaderboards have eased model development for many NLP datasets by\nstandardizing their evaluation and delegating it to an independent external\nrepository. Their adoption, however, is so far limited to tasks that can be\nreliably evaluated in an automatic manner. This work introduces GENIE, an\nextensible human evaluation leaderboard, which brings the ease of leaderboards\nto text generation tasks. GENIE automatically posts leaderboard submissions to\ncrowdsourcing platforms asking human annotators to evaluate them on various\naxes (e.g., correctness, conciseness, fluency) and compares their answers to\nvarious automatic metrics. We introduce several datasets in English to GENIE,\nrepresenting four core challenges in text generation: machine translation,\nsummarization, commonsense reasoning, and machine comprehension. We provide\nformal granular evaluation metrics and identify areas for future research. We\nmake GENIE publicly available and hope that it will spur progress in language\ngeneration models as well as their automatic and manual evaluation.",

          "description": "Although teacher forcing has become the main training paradigm for neural\nmachine translation, it usually makes predictions only conditioned on past\ninformation, and hence lacks global planning for the future. To address this\nproblem, we introduce another decoder, called seer decoder, into the\nencoder-decoder framework during training, which involves future information in\ntarget predictions. Meanwhile, we force the conventional decoder to simulate\nthe behaviors of the seer decoder via knowledge distillation. In this way, at\ntest the conventional decoder can perform like the seer decoder without the\nattendance of it. Experiment results on the Chinese-English, English-German and\nEnglish-Romanian translation tasks show our method can outperform competitive\nbaselines significantly and achieves greater improvements on the bigger data\nsets. Besides, the experiments also prove knowledge distillation the best way\nto transfer knowledge from the seer decoder to the conventional decoder\ncompared to adversarial learning and L2 regularization.",

EMMA achieves successful\nzero-shot generalization to unseen games with new dynamics, obtaining a 40%\nhigher win rate compared to multiple baselines.

          "description": "Pre-trained models (PTMs) have been widely used in various downstream tasks.\nThe parameters of PTMs are distributed on the Internet and may suffer backdoor\nattacks. In this work, we demonstrate the universal vulnerability of PTMs,\nwhere fine-tuned PTMs can be easily controlled by backdoor attacks in arbitrary\ndownstream tasks. Specifically, attackers can add a simple pre-training task,\nwhich restricts the output representations of trigger instances to pre-defined\nvectors, namely neuron-level backdoor attack (NeuBA). If the backdoor\nfunctionality is not eliminated during fine-tuning, the triggers can make the\nfine-tuned model predict fixed labels by pre-defined vectors. In the\nexperiments of both natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV),\nwe show that NeuBA absolutely controls the predictions for trigger instances\nwithout any knowledge of downstream tasks. Finally, we apply several defense\nmethods to NeuBA and find that model pruning is a promising direction to resist\nNeuBA by excluding backdoored neurons.

Thus, the PPKED includes three modules:\nPosterior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE), Prior Knowledge Explorer (PrKE) and\nMulti-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD). In detail, PoKE explores the posterior\nknowledge, which provides explicit abnormal visual regions to alleviate visual\ndata bias; PrKE explores the prior knowledge from the prior medical knowledge\ngraph (medical knowledge) and prior radiology reports (working experience) to\nalleviate textual data bias.

In this paper we aim to change\nthat, proposing a computational model for the transformer-encoder in the form\nof a programming language. We map the basic components of a transformer-encoder\n-- attention and feed-forward computation -- into simple primitives, around\nwhich we form a programming language: the Restricted Access Sequence Processing\nLanguage (RASP). We show how RASP can be used to program solutions to tasks\nthat could conceivably be learned by a Transformer, and how a Transformer can\nbe trained to mimic a RASP solution. In particular, we provide RASP programs\nfor histograms, sorting, and Dyck-languages. We further use our model to relate\ntheir difficulty in terms of the number of required layers and attention heads:\nanalyzing a RASP program implies a maximum number of heads and layers necessary\nto encode a task in a transformer.

They\nconsist in incrementally encoding a speech input (in a source language) and\ndecoding the corresponding text (in a target language) with the best possible\ntrade-off between latency and translation quality. This paper investigates two\nkey aspects of end-to-end simultaneous speech translation: (a) how to encode\nefficiently the continuous speech flow, and (b) how to segment the speech flow\nin order to alternate optimally between reading (R: encoding input) and writing\n(W: decoding output) operations. We extend our previously proposed end-to-end\nonline decoding strategy and show that while replacing BLSTM by ULSTM encoding\ndegrades performance in offline mode, it actually improves both efficiency and\nperformance in online mode. We also measure the impact of different methods to\nsegment the speech signal (using fixed interval boundaries, oracle word\nboundaries or randomly set boundaries) and show that our best end-to-end online\ndecoding strategy is surprisingly the one that alternates R/W operations on\nfixed size blocks on our English-German speech translation setup.",

          "description": "A major focus of recent research in spoken language understanding (SLU) has\nbeen on the end-to-end approach where a single model can predict intents\ndirectly from speech inputs without intermediate transcripts. However, this\napproach presents some challenges. First, since speech can be considered as\npersonally identifiable information, in some cases only automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) transcripts are accessible. Second, intent-labeled speech\ndata is scarce. To address the first challenge, we propose a novel system that\ncan predict intents from flexible types of inputs: speech, ASR transcripts, or\nboth. We demonstrate strong performance for either modality separately, and\nwhen both speech and ASR transcripts are available, through system combination,\nwe achieve better results than using a single input modality. To address the\nsecond challenge, we leverage a semantically robust pre-trained BERT model and\nadopt a cross-modal system that co-trains text embeddings and acoustic\nembeddings in a shared latent space. We further enhance this system by\nutilizing an acoustic module pre-trained on LibriSpeech and domain-adapting the\ntext module on our target datasets. Our experiments show significant advantages\nfor these pre-training and fine-tuning strategies, resulting in a system that\nachieves competitive intent-classification performance on Snips SLU and Fluent\nSpeech Commands datasets.",

For practical\napplicability, a TTS model should generate high-quality speech with only a few\naudio samples from the given speaker, that are also short in length. However,\nexisting methods either require to fine-tune the model or achieve low\nadaptation quality without fine-tuning. In this work, we propose StyleSpeech, a\nnew TTS model which not only synthesizes high-quality speech but also\neffectively adapts to new speakers. Specifically, we propose Style-Adaptive\nLayer Normalization (SALN) which aligns gain and bias of the text input\naccording to the style extracted from a reference speech audio. With SALN, our\nmodel effectively synthesizes speech in the style of the target speaker even\nfrom single speech audio. Furthermore, to enhance StyleSpeech's adaptation to\nspeech from new speakers, we extend it to Meta-StyleSpeech by introducing two\ndiscriminators trained with style prototypes, and performing episodic training.\nThe experimental results show that our models generate high-quality speech\nwhich accurately follows the speaker's voice with single short-duration (1-3\nsec) speech audio, significantly outperforming baselines.",

The F1 score of\nSASICMg, whose pretrained model is GloVe, is as high as 64.37%, which is 3.97%\nhigher than that of BERT based model, 12.7% higher than that of traditional\nmethods on average, including support vector machine, logistic regression\nclassifier, maximum entropy classifier, naive bayes classifier and decision\ntree and 2.39% higher than that of the state-of-the-art, including MARIN and\nBTM. The F1 score of SASICMBERT, whose pretrained model is BERT, is 65.12%,\nwhich is 0.75% higher than that of SASICMg. The accuracy rates of SASICMg and\nSASICMBERT are 71.16% and 70.76%, respectively, which can compete with those of\nother methods which are mentioned before.",

Building such\ndialogue systems is a challenging problem, involving various reasoning types on\nboth visual and language inputs. Existing benchmarks do not have enough\nannotations to thoroughly analyze dialogue systems and understand their\ncapabilities and limitations in isolation. These benchmarks are also not\nexplicitly designed to minimise biases that models can exploit without actual\nreasoning. To address these limitations, in this paper, we present DVD, a\nDiagnostic Dataset for Video-grounded Dialogues. The dataset is designed to\ncontain minimal biases and has detailed annotations for the different types of\nreasoning over the spatio-temporal space of video. Dialogues are synthesized\nover multiple question turns, each of which is injected with a set of\ncross-turn semantic relationships. We use DVD to analyze existing approaches,\nproviding interesting insights into their abilities and limitations. In total,\nDVD is built from $11k$ CATER synthetic videos and contains $10$ instances of\n$10$-round dialogues for each video, resulting in more than $100k$ dialogues\nand $1M$ question-answer pairs.

Second, in\npractice, we only have access to noisy proxies for the linguistic properties of\ninterest -- e.g., predictions from classifiers and lexicons.

Based on these results, we introduce TextCause, an\nalgorithm for estimating causal effects of linguistic properties.

          "description": "E-commerce companies have to face abnormal sellers who sell potentially-risky\nproducts. Typically, the risk can be identified by jointly considering product\ncontent (e.g., title and image) and seller behavior. This work focuses on\nbehavior feature extraction as behavior sequences can provide valuable clues\nfor the risk discovery by reflecting the sellers' operation habits. Traditional\nfeature extraction techniques heavily depend on domain experts and adapt poorly\nto new tasks. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method InfoBehavior\nto automatically extract meaningful representations from ultra-long raw\nbehavior sequences instead of the costly feature selection procedure.\nInfoBehavior utilizes Bidirectional Transformer as feature encoder due to its\nexcellent capability in modeling long-term dependency. However, it is\nintractable for commodity GPUs because the time and memory required by\nTransformer grow quadratically with the increase of sequence length. Thus, we\npropose a hierarchical grouping strategy to aggregate ultra-long raw behavior\nsequences to length-processable high-level embedding sequences. Moreover, we\nintroduce two types of pretext tasks. Sequence-related pretext task defines a\ncontrastive-based training objective to correctly select the masked-out\ncoarse-grained/fine-grained behavior sequences against other \"distractor\"\nbehavior sequences; Domain-related pretext task designs a classification\ntraining objective to correctly predict the domain-specific statistical results\nof anomalous behavior. We show that behavior representations from the\npre-trained InfoBehavior can be directly used or integrated with features from\nother side information to support a wide range of downstream tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that InfoBehavior significantly improves the\nperformance of Product Risk Management and Intellectual Property Protection.",

However, robust and specialized xAI\n(Explainable Artificial Intelligence) solutions tailored to deep\nnatural-language models are still missing.

Given a deep NLP model and the textual input data, T-EBAnO provides an\nobjective, human-readable, domain-specific assessment of the reasons behind the\nautomatic decision-making process. Specifically, the framework extracts sets of\ninterpretable features mining the inner knowledge of the model. Then, it\nquantifies the influence of each feature during the prediction process by\nexploiting the novel normalized Perturbation Influence Relation index at the\nlocal level and the novel Global Absolute Influence and Global Relative\nInfluence indexes at the global level. The effectiveness and the quality of the\nlocal and global explanations obtained with T-EBAnO are proved on (i) a\nsentiment analysis task performed by a fine-tuned BERT model, and (ii) a toxic\ncomment classification task performed by an LSTM model.",

          "description": "Japan is a unique country with a distinct cultural heritage, which is\nreflected in billions of historical documents that have been preserved.\nHowever, the change in Japanese writing system in 1900 made these documents\ninaccessible for the general public. A major research project has been to make\nthese historical documents accessible and understandable. An increasing amount\nof research has focused on the character recognition task and the location of\ncharacters on image, yet less research has focused on how to predict the\nsequential ordering of the characters. This is because sequence in classical\nJapanese is very different from modern Japanese. Ordering characters into a\nsequence is important for making the document text easily readable and\nsearchable. Additionally, it is a necessary step for any kind of natural\nlanguage processing on the data (e.g. machine translation, language modeling,\nand word embeddings). We explore a few approaches to the task of predicting the\nsequential ordering of the characters: one using simple hand-crafted rules,\nanother using hand-crafted rules with adaptive thresholds, and another using a\ndeep recurrent sequence model trained with teacher forcing. We provide a\nquantitative and qualitative comparison of these techniques as well as their\ndistinct trade-offs. Our best-performing system has an accuracy of 98.65\\% and\nhas a perfect accuracy on 49\\% of the books in our dataset, suggesting that the\ntechnique is able to predict the order of the characters well enough for many\ntasks.",

Around 40,000 hours of transcribed\naudio is first collected from audiobooks, podcasts and YouTube, covering both\nread and spontaneous speaking styles, and a variety of topics, such as arts,\nscience, sports, etc. A new forced alignment and segmentation pipeline is\nproposed to create sentence segments suitable for speech recognition training,\nand to filter out segments with low-quality transcription. For system training,\nGigaSpeech provides five subsets of different sizes, 10h, 250h, 1000h, 2500h,\nand 10000h. For our 10,000-hour XL training subset, we cap the word error rate\nat 4% during the filtering/validation stage, and for all our other smaller\ntraining subsets, we cap it at 0%. The DEV and TEST evaluation sets, on the\nother hand, are re-processed by professional human transcribers to ensure high\ntranscription quality.

          "description": "In this paper, we explore the use of pre-trained language models to learn\nsentiment information of written texts for speech sentiment analysis. First, we\ninvestigate how useful a pre-trained language model would be in a 2-step\npipeline approach employing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and\ntranscripts-based sentiment analysis separately. Second, we propose a pseudo\nlabel-based semi-supervised training strategy using a language model on an\nend-to-end speech sentiment approach to take advantage of a large, but\nunlabeled speech dataset for training. Although spoken and written texts have\ndifferent linguistic characteristics, they can complement each other in\nunderstanding sentiment. Therefore, the proposed system can not only model\nacoustic characteristics to bear sentiment-specific information in speech\nsignals, but learn latent information to carry sentiments in the text\nrepresentation. In these experiments, we demonstrate the proposed approaches\nimprove F1 scores consistently compared to systems without a language model.\nMoreover, we also show that the proposed framework can reduce 65% of human\nsupervision by leveraging a large amount of data without human sentiment\nannotation and boost performance in a low-resource condition where the human\nsentiment annotation is not available enough.",

          "description": "We consider repair tasks: given a critic (e.g., compiler) that assesses the\nquality of an input, the goal is to train a fixer that converts a bad example\n(e.g., code with syntax errors) into a good one (e.g., code with no errors).\nExisting works create training data consisting of (bad, good) pairs by\ncorrupting good examples using heuristics (e.g., dropping tokens). However,\nfixers trained on this synthetically-generated data do not extrapolate well to\nthe real distribution of bad inputs. To bridge this gap, we propose a new\ntraining approach, Break-It-Fix-It (BIFI), which has two key ideas: (i) we use\nthe critic to check a fixer's output on real bad inputs and add good (fixed)\noutputs to the training data, and (ii) we train a breaker to generate realistic\nbad code from good code. Based on these ideas, we iteratively update the\nbreaker and the fixer while using them in conjunction to generate more paired\ndata. We evaluate BIFI on two code repair datasets: GitHub-Python, a new\ndataset we introduce where the goal is to repair Python code with AST parse\nerrors; and DeepFix, where the goal is to repair C code with compiler errors.\nBIFI outperforms existing methods, obtaining 90.5% repair accuracy on\nGitHub-Python (+28.5%) and 71.7% on DeepFix (+5.6%).

          "description": "An important research direction in automatic speech recognition (ASR) has\ncentered around the development of effective methods to rerank the output\nhypotheses of an ASR system with more sophisticated language models (LMs) for\nfurther gains. A current mainstream school of thoughts for ASR N-best\nhypothesis reranking is to employ a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based LM or\nits variants, with performance superiority over the conventional n-gram LMs\nacross a range of ASR tasks. In real scenarios such as a long conversation, a\nsequence of consecutive sentences may jointly contain ample cues of\nconversation-level information such as topical coherence, lexical entrainment\nand adjacency pairs, which however remains to be underexplored. In view of\nthis, we first formulate ASR N-best reranking as a prediction problem, putting\nforward an effective cross-sentence neural LM approach that reranks the ASR\nN-best hypotheses of an upcoming sentence by taking into consideration the word\nusage in its precedent sentences. Furthermore, we also explore to extract\ntask-specific global topical information of the cross-sentence history in an\nunsupervised manner for better ASR performance. Extensive experiments conducted\non the AMI conversational benchmark corpus indicate the effectiveness and\nfeasibility of our methods in comparison to several state-of-the-art reranking\nmethods.",

Here, we present a data collection strategy\nfor MT which, in contrast, is cheap and simple, as it does not require\nbilingual speakers. Based on the insight that humans pay specific attention to\nmovements, we use graphics interchange formats (GIFs) as a pivot to collect\nparallel sentences from monolingual annotators. We use our strategy to collect\ndata in Hindi, Tamil and English. As a baseline, we also collect data using\nimages as a pivot.

These approaches provide only a partial view of the data:\naspect-based sentiment summaries lack sufficient explanation or justification\nfor the aspect rating, while textual summaries do not quantify the significance\nof each element, and are not well-suited for representing conflicting views.\nRecently, Key Point Analysis (KPA) has been proposed as a summarization\nframework that provides both textual and quantitative summary of the main\npoints in the data. We adapt KPA to review data by introducing Collective Key\nPoint Mining for better key point extraction; integrating sentiment analysis\ninto KPA; identifying good key point candidates for review summaries; and\nleveraging the massive amount of available reviews and their metadata. We show\nempirically that these novel extensions of KPA substantially improve its\nperformance.

          "description": "Automatic International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding is defined as\na kind of text multi-label classification problem, which is difficult because\nthe number of labels is very large and the distribution of labels is\nunbalanced. The label-wise attention mechanism is widely used in automatic ICD\ncoding because it can assign weights to every word in full Electronic Medical\nRecords (EMR) for different ICD codes. However, the label-wise attention\nmechanism is computational redundant and costly. In this paper, we propose a\npseudo label-wise attention mechanism to tackle the problem. Instead of\ncomputing different attention modes for different ICD codes, the pseudo\nlabel-wise attention mechanism automatically merges similar ICD codes and\ncomputes only one attention mode for the similar ICD codes, which greatly\ncompresses the number of attention modes and improves the predicted accuracy.\nIn addition, we apply a more convenient and effective way to obtain the ICD\nvectors, and thus our model can predict new ICD codes by calculating the\nsimilarities between EMR vectors and ICD vectors. Extensive experiments show\nthe superior performance of our model. On the public MIMIC-III dataset and\nprivate Xiangya dataset, our model achieves micro f1 of 0.575 and 0.796,\nrespectively, which outperforms other competing models. Furthermore, we verify\nthe ability of our model in predicting new ICD codes. The case study shows how\npseudo label-wise attention works, and demonstrates the effectiveness of pseudo\nlabel-wise attention mechanism.",

          "description": "Training deep learning models with limited labelled data is an attractive\nscenario for many NLP tasks, including document classification. While with the\nrecent emergence of BERT, deep learning language models can achieve reasonably\ngood performance in document classification with few labelled instances, there\nis a lack of evidence in the utility of applying BERT-like models on long\ndocument classification. This work introduces a long-text-specific model -- the\nHierarchical BERT Model (HBM) -- that learns sentence-level features of the\ntext and works well in scenarios with limited labelled data. Various evaluation\nexperiments have demonstrated that HBM can achieve higher performance in\ndocument classification than the previous state-of-the-art methods with only 50\nto 200 labelled instances, especially when documents are long. Also, as an\nextra benefit of HBM, the salient sentences identified by learned HBM are\nuseful as explanations for labelling documents based on a user study.",

          "description": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online\nadvertising and recommender systems. In practice, the training of CTR models\ndepends on click data which is intrinsically biased towards higher positions\nsince higher position has higher CTR by nature. Existing methods such as actual\nposition training with fixed position inference and inverse propensity weighted\ntraining with no position inference alleviate the bias problem to some extend.\nHowever, the different treatment of position information between training and\ninference will inevitably lead to inconsistency and sub-optimal online\nperformance. Meanwhile, the basic assumption of these methods, i.e., the click\nprobability is the product of examination probability and relevance\nprobability, is oversimplified and insufficient to model the rich interaction\nbetween position and other information. In this paper, we propose a Deep\nPosition-wise Interaction Network (DPIN) to efficiently combine all candidate\nitems and positions for estimating CTR at each position, achieving consistency\nbetween offline and online as well as modeling the deep non-linear interaction\namong position, user, context and item under the limit of serving performance.\nFollowing our new treatment to the position bias in CTR prediction, we propose\na new evaluation metrics named PAUC (position-wise AUC) that is suitable for\nmeasuring the ranking quality at a given position. Through extensive\nexperiments on a real world dataset, we show empirically that our method is\nboth effective and efficient in solving position bias problem. We have also\ndeployed our method in production and observed statistically significant\nimprovement over a highly optimized baseline in a rigorous A/B test.",

However, most previous works neglect the evolving trend of\npreferences and can be easily disturbed by the effect of preference drifting.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Preference Evolution Networks for\nsession-based Recommendation (PEN4Rec) to model preference evolving process by\na two-stage retrieval from historical contexts. Specifically, the first-stage\nprocess integrates relevant behaviors according to recent items. Then, the\nsecond-stage process models the preference evolving trajectory over time\ndynamically and infer rich preferences. The process can strengthen the effect\nof relevant sequential behaviors during the preference evolution and weaken the\ndisturbance from preference drifting.

          "description": "Analysis of short text, such as social media posts, is extremely difficult\nbecause it relies on observing many document-level word co-occurrence pairs.\nBeyond topic distributions, a common downstream task of the modeling is\ngrouping the authors of these documents for subsequent analyses. Traditional\nmodels estimate the document groupings and identify user clusters with an\nindependent procedure. We propose a novel model that expands on the Latent\nDirichlet Allocation by modeling strong dependence among the words in the same\ndocument, with user-level topic distributions. We also simultaneously cluster\nusers, removing the need for post-hoc cluster estimation and improving topic\nestimation by shrinking noisy user-level topic distributions towards typical\nvalues. Our method performs as well as -- or better -- than traditional\napproaches to problems arising in short text, and we demonstrate its usefulness\non a dataset of tweets from United States Senators, recovering both meaningful\ntopics and clusters that reflect partisan ideology.",

          "description": "Deep learning-based sequential recommender systems have recently attracted\nincreasing attention from both academia and industry. Most of industrial\nEmbedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) system for recommendation share the similar\nideas with sequential recommenders. Among them, how to comprehensively capture\nsequential user interest is a fundamental problem. However, most existing\nsequential recommendation models take as input clicked or purchased behavior\nsequences from user-item interactions. This leads to incomprehensive user\nrepresentation and sub-optimal model performance, since they ignore the\ncomplete user behavior exposure data, i.e., items impressed yet unclicked by\nusers. In this work, we attempt to incorporate and model those unclicked item\nsequences using a new learning approach in order to explore better sequential\nrecommendation technique. An efficient triplet metric learning algorithm is\nproposed to appropriately learn the representation of unclicked items. Our\nmethod can be simply integrated with existing sequential recommendation models\nby a confidence fusion network and further gain better user representation. The\noffline experimental results based on real-world E-commerce data demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and verify the importance of unclicked items in sequential\nrecommendation. Moreover we deploy our new model (named XDM) into EBR of\nrecommender system at Taobao, outperforming the deployed previous generation\nSDM.",

          "description": "Nowadays, the product search service of e-commerce platforms has become a\nvital shopping channel in people's life. The retrieval phase of products\ndetermines the search system's quality and gradually attracts researchers'\nattention. Retrieving the most relevant products from a large-scale corpus\nwhile preserving personalized user characteristics remains an open question.\nRecent approaches in this domain have mainly focused on embedding-based\nretrieval (EBR) systems. However, after a long period of practice on Taobao, we\nfind that the performance of the EBR system is dramatically degraded due to\nits: (1) low relevance with a given query and (2) discrepancy between the\ntraining and inference phases. Therefore, we propose a novel and practical\nembedding-based product retrieval model, named Multi-Grained Deep Semantic\nProduct Retrieval (MGDSPR). Specifically, we first identify the inconsistency\nbetween the training and inference stages, and then use the softmax\ncross-entropy loss as the training objective, which achieves better performance\nand faster convergence. Two efficient methods are further proposed to improve\nretrieval relevance, including smoothing noisy training data and generating\nrelevance-improving hard negative samples without requiring extra knowledge and\ntraining procedures. We evaluate MGDSPR on Taobao Product Search with\nsignificant metrics gains observed in offline experiments and online A/B tests.\nMGDSPR has been successfully deployed to the existing multi-channel retrieval\nsystem in Taobao Search. We also introduce the online deployment scheme and\nshare practical lessons of our retrieval system to contribute to the community.",

Finally, we address\nthe measurement system design for linear and nonlinear measurements of sparse\nsignals. Moreover, we discuss the linear mixing matrix design based on\ncoherence minimization.

Previous researchers found that by using\nthe information extracted from these reviews, we can better profile the users'\nexplicit preferences as well as the item features, leading to the improvement\nof recommendation performance. However, most of the previous algorithms were\nonly utilizing the review information for explicit-feedback problem i.e. rating\nprediction, and when it comes to implicit-feedback ranking problem such as\ntop-N recommendation, the usage of review information has not been fully\nexplored. Seeing this gap, in this work, we investigate the effectiveness of\ntextual review information for top-N recommendation under E-commerce settings.\nWe adapt several SOTA review-based rating prediction models for top-N\nrecommendation tasks and compare them to existing top-N recommendation models\nfrom both performance and efficiency. We find that models utilizing only review\ninformation can not achieve better performances than vanilla implicit-feedback\nmatrix factorization method.

In this work, we aim to theoretically understand the\nrelationship between these two approaches, which are the cornerstones of\nmodel-based recommendations. Through the derivation and analysis of the\nclosed-form solutions for two basic regression and matrix factorization\napproaches, we found these two approaches are indeed inherently related but\nalso diverge in how they \"scale-down\" the singular values of the original\nuser-item interaction matrix. This analysis also helps resolve the questions\nrelated to the regularization parameter range and model complexities.

The experimental results demonstrate that the basic models\nand their closed-form solutions are indeed quite competitive against the\nstate-of-the-art models, thus, confirming the validity of studying the basic\nmodels.

          "description": "Tables are widely used with various structures to organize and present data.\nRecent attempts on table understanding mainly focus on relational tables, yet\noverlook to other common table structures. In this paper, we propose TUTA, a\nunified pre-training architecture for understanding generally structured\ntables. Noticing that understanding a table requires spatial, hierarchical, and\nsemantic information, we enhance transformers with three novel structure-aware\nmechanisms. First, we devise a unified tree-based structure, called a\nbi-dimensional coordinate tree, to describe both the spatial and hierarchical\ninformation of generally structured tables. Upon this, we propose tree-based\nattention and position embedding to better capture the spatial and hierarchical\ninformation. Moreover, we devise three progressive pre-training objectives to\nenable representations at the token, cell, and table levels. We pre-train TUTA\non a wide range of unlabeled web and spreadsheet tables and fine-tune it on two\ncritical tasks in the field of table structure understanding: cell type\nclassification and table type classification. Experiments show that TUTA is\nhighly effective, achieving state-of-the-art on five widely-studied datasets.",

          "description": "Recommender Systems (RS) have employed knowledge distillation which is a\nmodel compression technique training a compact student model with the knowledge\ntransferred from a pre-trained large teacher model. Recent work has shown that\ntransferring knowledge from the teacher's intermediate layer significantly\nimproves the recommendation quality of the student. However, they transfer the\nknowledge of individual representation point-wise and thus have a limitation in\nthat primary information of RS lies in the relations in the representation\nspace. This paper proposes a new topology distillation approach that guides the\nstudent by transferring the topological structure built upon the relations in\nthe teacher space. We first observe that simply making the student learn the\nwhole topological structure is not always effective and even degrades the\nstudent's performance. We demonstrate that because the capacity of the student\nis highly limited compared to that of the teacher, learning the whole\ntopological structure is daunting for the student. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel method named Hierarchical Topology Distillation (HTD) which\ndistills the topology hierarchically to cope with the large capacity gap. Our\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors. We also provide\nin-depth analyses to ascertain the benefit of distilling the topology for RS.",

          "description": "With the emerging needs of creating fairness-aware solutions for search and\nrecommendation systems, a daunting challenge exists of evaluating such\nsolutions. While many of the traditional information retrieval (IR) metrics can\ncapture the relevance, diversity and novelty for the utility with respect to\nusers, they are not suitable for inferring whether the presented results are\nfair from the perspective of responsible information exposure. On the other\nhand, various fairness metrics have been proposed but they do not account for\nthe user utility or do not measure it adequately. To address this problem, we\npropose a new metric called Fairness-Aware IR (FAIR). By unifying standard IR\nmetrics and fairness measures into an integrated metric, this metric offers a\nnew perspective for evaluating fairness-aware ranking results. Based on this\nmetric, we developed an effective ranking algorithm that jointly optimized user\nutility and fairness. The experimental results showed that our FAIR metric\ncould highlight results with good user utility and fair information exposure.\nWe showed how FAIR related to existing metrics and demonstrated the\neffectiveness of our FAIR-based algorithm.

In this work, we\nprovide an in-depth evaluation of such models not only unveiling the reasons\nbehind their success but also their limitations.

Pipelines are\nconceptually simple, but errors propagate from one component to the next,\nwithout later components being able to revise earlier decisions. We present an\narchitecture for joint document and snippet ranking, the two middle stages,\nwhich leverages the intuition that relevant documents have good snippets and\ngood snippets come from relevant documents. The architecture is general and can\nbe used with any neural text relevance ranker. We experiment with two main\ninstantiations of the architecture, based on POSIT-DRMM (PDRMM) and a\nBERT-based ranker. Experiments on biomedical data from BIOASQ show that our\njoint models vastly outperform the pipelines in snippet retrieval, the main\ngoal for QA, with fewer trainable parameters, also remaining competitive in\ndocument retrieval. Furthermore, our joint PDRMM-based model is competitive\nwith BERT-based models, despite using orders of magnitude fewer parameters.\nThese claims are also supported by human evaluation on two test batches of\nBIOASQ. To test our key findings on another dataset, we modified the Natural\nQuestions dataset so that it can also be used for document and snippet\nretrieval. Our joint PDRMM-based model again outperforms the corresponding\npipeline in snippet retrieval on the modified Natural Questions dataset, even\nthough it performs worse than the pipeline in document retrieval.

Field-Aware\nFactorization Machine (FFM) and Field-weighted Factorization Machine (FwFM) are\nstate-of-the-art among the shallow models for CTR prediction. Recently, many\ndeep learning-based models have also been proposed. Among deeper models,\nDeepFM, xDeepFM, AutoInt+, and FiBiNet are state-of-the-art models. The deeper\nmodels combine a core architectural component, which learns explicit feature\ninteractions, with a deep neural network (DNN) component. We propose a novel\nshallow Field-Embedded Factorization Machine (FEFM) and its deep counterpart\nDeep Field-Embedded Factorization Machine (DeepFEFM). FEFM learns symmetric\nmatrix embeddings for each field pair along with the usual single vector\nembeddings for each feature. FEFM has significantly lower model complexity than\nFFM and roughly the same complexity as FwFM. FEFM also has insightful\nmathematical properties about important fields and field interactions. DeepFEFM\ncombines the FEFM interaction vectors learned by the FEFM component with a DNN\nand is thus able to learn higher order interactions. We conducted comprehensive\nexperiments over a wide range of hyperparameters on two large publicly\navailable real-world datasets. When comparing test AUC and log loss, the\nresults show that FEFM and DeepFEFM outperform the existing state-of-the-art\nshallow and deep models for CTR prediction tasks.

          "description": "Recently, neural networks have been successfully employed to improve upon\nstate-of-the-art performance in ad-hoc retrieval tasks via machine-learned\nranking functions. While neural retrieval models grow in complexity and impact,\nlittle is understood about their correspondence with well-studied IR\nprinciples. Recent work on interpretability in machine learning has provided\ntools and techniques to understand neural models in general, yet there has been\nlittle progress towards explaining ranking models.\n\nWe investigate whether one can explain the behavior of neural ranking models\nin terms of their congruence with well understood principles of document\nranking by using established theories from axiomatic IR. Axiomatic analysis of\ninformation retrieval models has formalized a set of constraints on ranking\ndecisions that reasonable retrieval models should fulfill. We operationalize\nthis axiomatic thinking to reproduce rankings based on combinations of\nelementary constraints. This allows us to investigate to what extent the\nranking decisions of neural rankers can be explained in terms of retrieval\naxioms, and which axioms apply in which situations. Our experimental study\nconsiders a comprehensive set of axioms over several representative neural\nrankers. While the existing axioms can already explain the particularly\nconfident ranking decisions rather well, future work should extend the axiom\nset to also cover the other still \"unexplainable\" neural IR rank decisions.",

          "description": "Making accurate recommendations for cold-start users has been a longstanding\nand critical challenge for recommender systems (RS). Cross-domain\nrecommendations (CDR) offer a solution to tackle such a cold-start problem when\nthere is no sufficient data for the users who have rarely used the system. An\neffective approach in CDR is to leverage the knowledge (e.g., user\nrepresentations) learned from a related but different domain and transfer it to\nthe target domain. Fine-tuning works as an effective transfer learning\ntechnique for this objective, which adapts the parameters of a pre-trained\nmodel from the source domain to the target domain. However, current methods are\nmainly based on the global fine-tuning strategy: the decision of which layers\nof the pre-trained model to freeze or fine-tune is taken for all users in the\ntarget domain. In this paper, we argue that users in RS are personalized and\nshould have their own fine-tuning policies for better preference transfer\nlearning. As such, we propose a novel User-specific Adaptive Fine-tuning method\n(UAF), selecting which layers of the pre-trained network to fine-tune, on a\nper-user basis. Specifically, we devise a policy network with three alternative\nstrategies to automatically decide which layers to be fine-tuned and which\nlayers to have their parameters frozen for each user. Extensive experiments\nshow that the proposed UAF exhibits significantly better and more robust\nperformance for user cold-start recommendation.",

          "description": "The amount of archaeological literature is growing rapidly. Until recently,\nthese data were only accessible through metadata search. We implemented a text\nretrieval engine for a large archaeological text collection ($\\sim 658$ Million\nwords). In archaeological IR, domain-specific entities such as locations, time\nperiods, and artefacts, play a central role. This motivated the development of\na named entity recognition (NER) model to annotate the full collection with\narchaeological named entities. In this paper, we present ArcheoBERTje, a BERT\nmodel pre-trained on Dutch archaeological texts. We compare the model's quality\nand output on a Named Entity Recognition task to a generic multilingual model\nand a generic Dutch model. We also investigate ensemble methods for combining\nmultiple BERT models, and combining the best BERT model with a domain thesaurus\nusing Conditional Random Fields (CRF). We find that ArcheoBERTje outperforms\nboth the multilingual and Dutch model significantly with a smaller standard\ndeviation between runs, reaching an average F1 score of 0.735. The model also\noutperforms ensemble methods combining the three models. Combining ArcheoBERTje\npredictions and explicit domain knowledge from the thesaurus did not increase\nthe F1 score. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyse the differences\nbetween the vocabulary and output of the BERT models on the full collection and\nprovide some valuable insights in the effect of fine-tuning for specific\ndomains. Our results indicate that for a highly specific text domain such as\narchaeology, further pre-training on domain-specific data increases the model's\nquality on NER by a much larger margin than shown for other domains in the\nliterature, and that domain-specific pre-training makes the addition of domain\nknowledge from a thesaurus unnecessary.",

This, however,\nstill conditions each example's loss on all batch examples and requires fitting\nthe entire large batch into GPU memory. This paper introduces a gradient\ncaching technique that decouples backpropagation between contrastive loss and\nthe encoder, removing encoder backward pass data dependency along the batch\ndimension.

          "description": "With the popularity of Machine Learning (ML) solutions, algorithms and data\nhave been released faster than the capacity of processing them. In this\ncontext, the problem of Algorithm Recommendation (AR) is receiving a\nsignificant deal of attention recently. This problem has been addressed in the\nliterature as a learning task, often as a Meta-Learning problem where the aim\nis to recommend the best alternative for a specific dataset. For such, datasets\nencoded by meta-features are explored by ML algorithms that try to learn the\nmapping between meta-representations and the best technique to be used. One of\nthe challenges for the successful use of ML is to define which features are the\nmost valuable for a specific dataset since several meta-features can be used,\nwhich increases the meta-feature dimension. This paper presents an empirical\nanalysis of Feature Selection and Feature Extraction in the meta-level for the\nAR problem. The present study was focused on three criteria: predictive\nperformance, dimensionality reduction, and pipeline runtime. As we verified,\napplying Dimensionality Reduction (DR) methods did not improve predictive\nperformances in general. However, DR solutions reduced about 80% of the\nmeta-features, obtaining pretty much the same performance as the original setup\nbut with lower runtimes. The only exception was PCA, which presented about the\nsame runtime as the original meta-features. Experimental results also showed\nthat various datasets have many non-informative meta-features and that it is\npossible to obtain high predictive performance using around 20% of the original\nmeta-features. Therefore, due to their natural trend for high dimensionality,\nDR methods should be used for Meta-Feature Selection and Meta-Feature\nExtraction.",

          "description": "Self-supervised learning (SSL), which can automatically generate ground-truth\nsamples from raw data, holds vast potential to improve recommender systems.\nMost existing SSL-based methods perturb the raw data graph with uniform\nnode/edge dropout to generate new data views and then conduct the\nself-discrimination based contrastive learning over different views to learn\ngeneralizable representations. Under this scheme, only a bijective mapping is\nbuilt between nodes in two different views, which means that the\nself-supervision signals from other nodes are being neglected. Due to the\nwidely observed homophily in recommender systems, we argue that the supervisory\nsignals from other nodes are also highly likely to benefit the representation\nlearning for recommendation. To capture these signals, a general socially-aware\nSSL framework that integrates tri-training is proposed in this paper.\nTechnically, our framework first augments the user data views with the user\nsocial information. And then under the regime of tri-training for multi-view\nencoding, the framework builds three graph encoders (one for recommendation)\nupon the augmented views and iteratively improves each encoder with\nself-supervision signals from other users, generated by the other two encoders.\nSince the tri-training operates on the augmented views of the same data sources\nfor self-supervision signals, we name it self-supervised tri-training.\nExtensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets consistently validate the\neffectiveness of the self-supervised tri-training framework for improving\nrecommendation.

During this lockdown period, social media plat-forms\nhave played an important role to spread information about this pandemic across\nthe world, as people used to express their feelings through the social\nnetworks. Considering this catastrophic situation, we developed an experimental\napproach to analyze the reactions of people on Twitter taking into ac-count the\npopular words either directly or indirectly based on this pandemic. This paper\nrepresents the sentiment analysis on collected large number of tweets on\nCoronavirus or Covid-19. At first, we analyze the trend of public sentiment on\nthe topics related to Covid-19 epidemic using an evolutionary classification\nfollowed by the n-gram analysis. Then we calculated the sentiment ratings on\ncollected tweet based on their class. Finally, we trained the long-short term\nnetwork using two types of rated tweets to predict sentiment on Covid-19 data\nand obtained an overall accuracy of 84.46%.",

          "description": "Due to the flexibility in modelling data heterogeneity, heterogeneous\ninformation network (HIN) has been adopted to characterize complex and\nheterogeneous auxiliary data in top-$N$ recommender systems, called\n\\emph{HIN-based recommendation}. HIN characterizes complex, heterogeneous data\nrelations, containing a variety of information that may not be related to the\nrecommendation task. Therefore, it is challenging to effectively leverage\nuseful information from HINs for improving the recommendation performance.

Then we capture the rich\nsemantics (\\eg graph structure and path semantics) within the subgraph via a\nheterogeneous subgraph Transformer, where we encode the subgraph with\nmulti-slot sequence representations. Besides, we design a curriculum\npre-training strategy to provide an elementary-to-advanced learning process, by\nwhich we smoothly transfer basic semantics in HIN for modeling user-item\ninteraction relation.\n\nExtensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed method over a number of competitive baselines,\nespecially when only limited training data is available.",

          "description": "Designing an effective loss function plays a crucial role in training deep\nrecommender systems. Most existing works often leverage a predefined and fixed\nloss function that could lead to suboptimal recommendation quality and training\nefficiency. Some recent efforts rely on exhaustively or manually searched\nweights to fuse a group of candidate loss functions, which is exceptionally\ncostly in computation and time. They also neglect the various convergence\nbehaviors of different data examples. In this work, we propose an AutoLoss\nframework that can automatically and adaptively search for the appropriate loss\nfunction from a set of candidates. To be specific, we develop a novel\ncontroller network, which can dynamically adjust the loss probabilities in a\ndifferentiable manner. Unlike existing algorithms, the proposed controller can\nadaptively generate the loss probabilities for different data examples\naccording to their varied convergence behaviors. Such design improves the\nmodel's generalizability and transferability between deep recommender systems\nand datasets. We evaluate the proposed framework on two benchmark datasets. The\nresults show that AutoLoss outperforms representative baselines. Further\nexperiments have been conducted to deepen our understandings of AutoLoss,\nincluding its transferability, components and training efficiency.",

          "description": "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in neural speech synthesis.\nWhile the deep neural network achieves the state-of-the-art result in\ntext-to-speech (TTS) tasks, how to generate a more emotional and more\nexpressive speech is becoming a new challenge to researchers due to the\nscarcity of high-quality emotion speech dataset and the lack of advanced\nemotional TTS model. In this paper, we first briefly introduce and publicly\nrelease a Mandarin emotion speech dataset including 9,724 samples with audio\nfiles and its emotion human-labeled annotation. After that, we propose a simple\nbut efficient architecture for emotional speech synthesis called EMSpeech.\nUnlike those models which need additional reference audio as input, our model\ncould predict emotion labels just from the input text and generate more\nexpressive speech conditioned on the emotion embedding. In the experiment\nphase, we first validate the effectiveness of our dataset by an emotion\nclassification task. Then we train our model on the proposed dataset and\nconduct a series of subjective evaluations. Finally, by showing a comparable\nperformance in the emotional speech synthesis task, we successfully demonstrate\nthe ability of the proposed model.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved remarkable performance in various\nfields. However, training a DNN model from scratch requires a lot of computing\nresources and training data. It is difficult for most individual users to\nobtain such computing resources and training data. Model copyright infringement\nis an emerging problem in recent years. For instance, pre-trained models may be\nstolen or abuse by illegal users without the authorization of the model owner.\nRecently, many works on protecting the intellectual property of DNN models have\nbeen proposed. In these works, embedding watermarks into DNN based on backdoor\nis one of the widely used methods. However, when the DNN model is stolen, the\nbackdoor-based watermark may face the risk of being detected and removed by an\nadversary. In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect and remove watermark in\ndeep neural networks via generative adversarial networks (GAN). We demonstrate\nthat the backdoor-based DNN watermarks are vulnerable to the proposed GAN-based\nwatermark removal attack. The proposed attack method includes two phases. In\nthe first phase, we use the GAN and few clean images to detect and reverse the\nwatermark in the DNN model. In the second phase, we fine-tune the watermarked\nDNN based on the reversed backdoor images. Experimental evaluations on the\nMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method can\neffectively remove about 98% of the watermark in DNN models, as the watermark\nretention rate reduces from 100% to less than 2% after applying the proposed\nattack. In the meantime, the proposed attack hardly affects the model's\nperformance. The test accuracy of the watermarked DNN on the MNIST and the\nCIFAR10 datasets drops by less than 1% and 3%, respectively.",

          "description": "Legacy black-and-white photos are riddled with people's nostalgia and\nglorious memories of the past. To better relive the elapsed frozen moments, in\nthis paper, we present a deep exemplar-based image colorization approach named\nColor2Style to resurrect these grayscale image media by filling them with\nvibrant colors. Generally, for exemplar-based colorization, unsupervised and\nunpaired training are usually adopted, due to the difficulty of obtaining input\nand ground truth image pairs. To train an exemplar-based colorization model,\ncurrent algorithms usually strive to achieve two procedures: i) retrieving a\nlarge number of reference images with high similarity in advance, which is\ninevitably time-consuming and tedious; ii) designing complicated modules to\ntransfer the colors of the reference image to the grayscale image, by\ncalculating and leveraging the deep semantic correspondence between them (e.g.,\nnon-local operation). Contrary to the previous methods, we solve and simplify\nthe above two steps in one end-to-end learning procedure. First, we adopt a\nself-augmented self-reference training scheme, where the reference image is\ngenerated by graphical transformations from the original colorful one whereby\nthe training can be formulated in a paired manner. Second, instead of computing\ncomplex and inexplicable correspondence maps, our method exploits a simple yet\neffective deep feature modulation (DFM) module, which injects the color\nembeddings extracted from the reference image into the deep representations of\nthe input grayscale image. Such design is much more lightweight and\nintelligible, achieving appealing performance with real-time processing speed.\nMoreover, our model does not require multifarious loss functions and\nregularization terms like existing methods, but only two widely used loss\nfunctions.

          "description": "Deep-learning\\textendash{centric} reversible steganography has emerged as a\npromising research paradigm. A direct way of applying deep learning to\nreversible steganography is to construct a pair of encoder and decoder, whose\nparameters are trained jointly, thereby learning the steganographic system as a\nwhole. This end-to-end framework, however, falls short of the reversibility\nrequirement because it is difficult for this kind of monolithic system, as a\nblack box, to create or duplicate intricate reversible mechanisms. In response\nto this issue, a recent approach is to carve up the steganographic system and\nwork on modules independently. In particular, neural networks are deployed in\nan analytics module to learn the data distribution, while an established\nmechanism is called upon to handle the remaining tasks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the modular framework and deploy deep neural networks in a\nreversible steganographic scheme referred to as prediction-error modulation, in\nwhich an analytics module serves the purpose of pixel intensity prediction. The\nprimary focus of this study is on deep-learning\\textendash{based} context-aware\npixel intensity prediction. We address the unsolved issues reported in related\nliterature, including the impact of pixel initialisation on prediction accuracy\nand the influence of uncertainty propagation in dual-layer embedding.\nFurthermore, we establish a connection between context-aware pixel intensity\nprediction and low-level computer vision and analyse the performance of several\nadvanced neural networks.",

          "description": "Lattices have been conceived as a powerful tool for data hiding. While\nconventional studies and applications focus on achieving the optimal robustness\nversus distortion tradeoff, in some applications such as data hiding in\nmedical/physiological signals, the primary concern is to achieve a minimum\namount of distortion to the cover signal. In this paper, we revisit the\ncelebrated quantization index modulation (QIM) scheme and propose a\nminimum-distortion version of it, referred to as MD-QIM. The crux of MD-QIM is\nto move the data point to only the boundary of the Voronoi region of the\nlattice point indexed by a message, which suffices for subsequent correct\ndecoding. At any fixed code rate, the scheme achieves the minimum amount of\ndistortion by sacrificing the robustness to the additive white Gaussian noise\n(AWGN) attacks. Simulation results confirm that our scheme significantly\noutperforms QIM in terms of mean square error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio\n(PSNR) and percentage residual difference (PRD).",

          "description": "Robust multi-agent trajectory prediction is essential for the safe control of\nrobots and vehicles that interact with humans. Many existing methods treat\nsocial and temporal information separately and therefore fall short of\nmodelling the joint future trajectories of all agents in a socially consistent\nway. To address this, we propose a new class of Latent Variable Sequential Set\nTransformers which autoregressively model multi-agent trajectories. We refer to\nthese architectures as \"AutoBots\". AutoBots model the contents of sets (e.g.\nrepresenting the properties of agents in a scene) over time and employ\nmulti-head self-attention blocks over these sequences of sets to encode the\nsociotemporal relationships between the different actors of a scene. This\nproduces either the trajectory of one ego-agent or a distribution over the\nfuture trajectories for all agents under consideration. Our approach works for\ngeneral sequences of sets and we provide illustrative experiments modelling the\nsequential structure of the multiple strokes that make up symbols in the\nOmniglot data. For the single-agent prediction case, we validate our model on\nthe NuScenes motion prediction task and achieve competitive results on the\nglobal leaderboard. In the multi-agent forecasting setting, we validate our\nmodel on TrajNet. We find that our method outperforms physical extrapolation\nand recurrent network baselines and generates scene-consistent trajectories.",

          "description": "This paper investigates how to step up local image descriptor matching by\nexploiting matching context information. Two main contexts are identified,\noriginated respectively from the descriptor space and from the keypoint space.\nThe former is generally used to design the actual matching strategy while the\nlatter to filter matches according to the local spatial consistency. On this\nbasis, a new matching strategy and a novel local spatial filter, named\nrespectively blob matching and Delaunay Triangulation Matching (DTM) are\ndevised. Blob matching provides a general matching framework by merging\ntogether several strategies, including pre-filtering as well as many-to-many\nand symmetric matching, enabling to achieve a global improvement upon each\nindividual strategy. DTM alternates between Delaunay triangulation contractions\nand expansions to figure out and adjust keypoint neighborhood consistency.\nExperimental evaluation shows that DTM is comparable or better than the\nstate-of-the-art in terms of matching accuracy and robustness, especially for\nnon-planar scenes. Evaluation is carried out according to a new benchmark\ndevised for analyzing the matching pipeline in terms of correct correspondences\non both planar and non-planar scenes, including state-of-the-art methods as\nwell as the common SIFT matching approach for reference.

          "description": "Multiple views of data, both naturally acquired (e.g., image and audio) and\nartificially produced (e.g., via adding different noise to data samples), have\nproven useful in enhancing representation learning. Natural views are often\nhandled by multiview analysis tools, e.g., (deep) canonical correlation\nanalysis [(D)CCA], while the artificial ones are frequently used in\nself-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, e.g., SimCLR and Barlow Twins. Both\ntypes of approaches often involve learning neural feature extractors such that\nthe embeddings of data exhibit high cross-view correlations. Although\nintuitive, the effectiveness of correlation-based neural embedding is only\nempirically validated. This work puts forth a theory-backed framework for\nunsupervised multiview learning. Our development starts with proposing a\nmultiview model, where each view is a nonlinear mixture of shared and private\ncomponents. Consequently, the learning problem boils down to shared/private\ncomponent identification and disentanglement. Under this model, latent\ncorrelation maximization is shown to guarantee the extraction of the shared\ncomponents across views (up to certain ambiguities). In addition, the private\ninformation in each view can be provably disentangled from the shared using\nproper regularization design. The method is tested on a series of tasks, e.g.,\ndownstream clustering, which all show promising performance. Our development\nalso provides a unifying perspective for understanding various DCCA and SSL\nschemes.",

          "description": "Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to classify images under low-data regimes, where\nthe conventional pooled global representation is likely to lose useful local\ncharacteristics. Recent work has achieved promising performances by using deep\ndescriptors. They generally take all deep descriptors from neural networks into\nconsideration while ignoring that some of them are useless in classification\ndue to their limited receptive field, e.g., task-irrelevant descriptors could\nbe misleading and multiple aggregative descriptors from background clutter\ncould even overwhelm the object's presence. In this paper, we argue that a\nMutual Nearest Neighbor (MNN) relation should be established to explicitly\nselect the query descriptors that are most relevant to each task and discard\nless relevant ones from aggregative clutters in FSL. Specifically, we propose\nDiscriminative Mutual Nearest Neighbor Neural Network (DMN4) for FSL.

To improve the transferability of\nadversarial examples for the black-box setting, several methods have been\nproposed, e.g., input diversity, translation-invariant attack, and\nmomentum-based attack.

          "description": "We investigate the reasoning ability of pretrained vision and language (V&L)\nmodels in two tasks that require multimodal integration: (1) discriminating a\ncorrect image-sentence pair from an incorrect one, and (2) counting entities in\nan image. We evaluate three pretrained V&L models on these tasks: ViLBERT,\nViLBERT 12-in-1 and LXMERT, in zero-shot and finetuned settings. Our results\nshow that models solve task (1) very well, as expected, since all models are\npretrained on task (1). However, none of the pretrained V&L models is able to\nadequately solve task (2), our counting probe, and they cannot generalise to\nout-of-distribution quantities. We propose a number of explanations for these\nfindings: LXMERT (and to some extent ViLBERT 12-in-1) show some evidence of\ncatastrophic forgetting on task (1). Concerning our results on the counting\nprobe, we find evidence that all models are impacted by dataset bias, and also\nfail to individuate entities in the visual input. While a selling point of\npretrained V&L models is their ability to solve complex tasks, our findings\nsuggest that understanding their reasoning and grounding capabilities requires\nmore targeted investigations on specific phenomena.",

          "description": "Sensory input from multiple sources is crucial for robust and coherent human\nperception. Different sources contribute complementary explanatory factors.\nSimilarly, research studies often collect multimodal imaging data, each of\nwhich can provide shared and unique information. This observation motivated the\ndesign of powerful multimodal self-supervised representation-learning\nalgorithms. In this paper, we unify recent work on multimodal self-supervised\nlearning under a single framework. Observing that most self-supervised methods\noptimize similarity metrics between a set of model components, we propose a\ntaxonomy of all reasonable ways to organize this process. We first evaluate\nmodels on toy multimodal MNIST datasets and then apply them to a multimodal\nneuroimaging dataset with Alzheimer's disease patients. We find that (1)\nmultimodal contrastive learning has significant benefits over its unimodal\ncounterpart, (2) the specific composition of multiple contrastive objectives is\ncritical to performance on a downstream task, (3) maximization of the\nsimilarity between representations has a regularizing effect on a neural\nnetwork, which can sometimes lead to reduced downstream performance but still\nreveal multimodal relations. Results show that the proposed approach\noutperforms previous self-supervised encoder-decoder methods based on canonical\ncorrelation analysis (CCA) or the mixture-of-experts multimodal variational\nautoEncoder (MMVAE) on various datasets with a linear evaluation protocol.\nImportantly, we find a promising solution to uncover connections between\nmodalities through a jointly shared subspace that can help advance work in our\nsearch for neuroimaging biomarkers.",

Then, based on the user annotations, a segmentation algorithm\nrefines the masks. The previous interactive VOS paradigm selects the frame with\nsome worst evaluation metric, and the ground truth is required for calculating\nthe evaluation metric, which is impractical in the testing phase. In contrast,\nin this paper, we advocate that the frame with the worst evaluation metric may\nnot be exactly the most valuable frame that leads to the most performance\nimprovement across the video. Thus, we formulate the frame selection problem in\nthe interactive VOS as a Markov Decision Process, where an agent is learned to\nrecommend the frame under a deep reinforcement learning framework. The learned\nagent can automatically determine the most valuable frame, making the\ninteractive setting more practical in the wild.

Based\non these insights, we propose a novel ALPR approach, termed VSNet.\nSpecifically, VSNet includes two CNNs, i.e., VertexNet for license plate\ndetection and SCR-Net for license plate recognition, integrated in a\nresampling-based cascaded manner. In VertexNet, we propose an efficient\nintegration block to extract the spatial features of license plates. With\nvertex supervisory information, we propose a vertex-estimation branch in\nVertexNet such that license plates can be rectified as the input images of\nSCR-Net. In SCR-Net, we introduce a horizontal encoding technique for\nleft-to-right feature extraction and propose a weight-sharing classifier for\ncharacter recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed VSNet\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by more than 50% relative improvement on\nerror rate, achieving > 99% recognition accuracy on CCPD and AOLP datasets with\n149 FPS inference speed.

Applications range from\nrepresentation learning, image translation and generative modeling, to the\nestimation of spatial deformations. Such maps relate feature vectors, or map\nbetween feature spaces. Well-behaved maps should be regular, which can be\nimposed explicitly or may emanate from the data itself. We explore what induces\nregularity for spatial transformations, e.g., when computing image\nregistrations. Classical optimization-based models compute maps between pairs\nof samples and rely on an appropriate regularizer for well-posedness. Recent\ndeep learning approaches have attempted to avoid using such regularizers\naltogether by relying on the sample population instead. We explore if it is\npossible to obtain spatial regularity using an inverse consistency loss only\nand elucidate what explains map regularity in such a context. We find that deep\nnetworks combined with an inverse consistency loss and randomized off-grid\ninterpolation yield well behaved, approximately diffeomorphic, spatial\ntransformations.

They also offer an\neffective solution in healthcare for bi-directional protection against\nair-borne diseases. Wearing and positioning the mask correctly is essential for\nits function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution\nfor face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and\npositioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such algorithms\ncan be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and\nother indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These application\nscenarios impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The\ninference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing\nsufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably\nlow latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain\non the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address\nthese challenges, we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for\ncorrect facial-mask wear and positioning. The classification task is\nimplemented on an embedded FPGA, performing high-throughput binary operations.\nClassification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling\nmulti-camera, speed-gate settings or statistics collection in crowd settings.\nWhen deployed on a single entrance or gate, the idle power consumption is\nreduced to 1.6W, improving the battery-life of the device. We achieve an\naccuracy of up to 98% for four wearing positions of the MaskedFace-Net dataset.\nTo maintain equivalent classification accuracy for all face structures,\nskin-tones, hair types, and mask types, the algorithms are tested for their\nability to generalize the relevant features over all subjects using the\nGrad-CAM approach.",

          "description": "Following their success in natural language processing, transformers have\nrecently shown much promise for computer vision. The self-attention operation\nunderlying transformers yields global interactions between all tokens ,i.e.\nwords or image patches, and enables flexible modelling of image data beyond the\nlocal interactions of convolutions. This flexibility, however, comes with a\nquadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering application to long\nsequences and high-resolution images. We propose a \"transposed\" version of\nself-attention that operates across feature channels rather than tokens, where\nthe interactions are based on the cross-covariance matrix between keys and\nqueries. The resulting cross-covariance attention (XCA) has linear complexity\nin the number of tokens, and allows efficient processing of high-resolution\nimages. Our cross-covariance image transformer (XCiT) is built upon XCA. It\ncombines the accuracy of conventional transformers with the scalability of\nconvolutional architectures.

First, a novel noise\nand outlier filtering method is designed to facilitate subsequent high-level\ntasks. For effective understanding purpose, we propose a deep convolutional\nneural network leveraging correlated feature mining and deformable convolution\nbased geometric-aware modelling, in which the local feature relationships and\ngeometric patterns can be fully exploited. For the efficiency issue, we put\nforward an inverse density sampling operation and a feature pyramid based\nresidual learning strategy to save the computational cost and memory\nconsumption respectively. Extensive experiments on real-world challenging\ndatasets demonstrated that our approaches outperform state-of-the-art\napproaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Medical image analysis (MedIA) systems have recently\nbeen argued to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to strong financial\nincentives and the associated technological infrastructure.\n\nIn this paper, we study previously unexplored factors affecting adversarial\nattack vulnerability of deep learning MedIA systems in three medical domains:\nophthalmology, radiology, and pathology. We focus on adversarial black-box\nsettings, in which the attacker does not have full access to the target model\nand usually uses another model, commonly referred to as surrogate model, to\ncraft adversarial examples. We consider this to be the most realistic scenario\nfor MedIA systems.\n\nFirstly, we study the effect of weight initialization (ImageNet vs. random)\non the transferability of adversarial attacks from the surrogate model to the\ntarget model. Secondly, we study the influence of differences in development\ndata between target and surrogate models. We further study the interaction of\nweight initialization and data differences with differences in model\narchitecture. All experiments were done with a perturbation degree tuned to\nensure maximal transferability at minimal visual perceptibility of the attacks.\n\nOur experiments show that pre-training may dramatically increase the\ntransferability of adversarial examples, even when the target and surrogate's\narchitectures are different: the larger the performance gain using\npre-training, the larger the transferability. Differences in the development\ndata between target and surrogate models considerably decrease the performance\nof the attack; this decrease is further amplified by difference in the model\narchitecture. We believe these factors should be considered when developing\nsecurity-critical MedIA systems planned to be deployed in clinical practice.",

          "description": "Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is widely used\nto complement ultrasound examinations and x-ray mammography during the early\ndetection and diagnosis of breast cancer. However, images generated by various\nMRI scanners (e.g. GE Healthcare vs Siemens) differ both in intensity and noise\ndistribution, preventing algorithms trained on MRIs from one scanner to\ngeneralize to data from other scanners successfully. We propose a method for\nimage normalization to solve this problem. MRI normalization is challenging\nbecause it requires both normalizing intensity values and mapping between the\nnoise distributions of different scanners. We utilize a cycle-consistent\ngenerative adversarial network to learn a bidirectional mapping between MRIs\nproduced by GE Healthcare and Siemens scanners. This allows us learning the\nmapping between two different scanner types without matched data, which is not\ncommonly available. To ensure the preservation of breast shape and structures\nwithin the breast, we propose two technical innovations. First, we incorporate\na mutual information loss with the CycleGAN architecture to ensure that the\nstructure of the breast is maintained. Second, we propose a modified\ndiscriminator architecture which utilizes a smaller field-of-view to ensure the\npreservation of finer details in the breast tissue. Quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations show that the second proposed method was able to\nconsistently preserve a high level of detail in the breast structure while also\nperforming the proper intensity normalization and noise mapping. Our results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model can successfully learn a bidirectional\nmapping between MRIs produced by different vendors, potentially enabling\nimproved accuracy of downstream computational algorithms for diagnosis and\ndetection of breast cancer.

How\nto query zero-streaming cameras efficiently? Our response is a camera/cloud\nruntime system called DIVA. It addresses two key challenges: to best use\nlimited camera resource during video capture; to rapidly explore massive videos\nduring query execution. DIVA contributes two unconventional techniques. (1)\nWhen capturing videos, a camera builds sparse yet accurate landmark frames,\nfrom which it learns reliable knowledge for accelerating future queries. (2)\nWhen executing a query, a camera processes frames in multiple passes with\nincreasingly more expensive operators. As such, DIVA presents and keeps\nrefining inexact query results throughout the query's execution. On diverse\nqueries over 15 videos lasting 720 hours in total, DIVA runs at more than 100x\nvideo realtime and outperforms competitive alternative designs.

We find that non-negative concept activation vectors (NCAVs) from\nnon-negative matrix factorization provide superior performance in\ninterpretability and fidelity based on computational and human subject\nexperiments. Our framework provides both local and global concept-level\nexplanations for pre-trained CNN models.",

Our method successively learns an agnostic\nforeground segmentation followed by a distinction between manipulator and\nobject solely by observing the motion between consecutive RGB frames. In\ncontrast to previous approaches, we propose a single, end-to-end trainable\narchitecture which jointly incorporates motion cues and semantic knowledge.\nFurthermore, while the motion of the manipulator and the object are substantial\ncues for our algorithm, we present means to robustly deal with distraction\nobjects moving in the background, as well as with completely static scenes. Our\nmethod neither depends on any visual registration of a kinematic robot or 3D\nobject models, nor on precise hand-eye calibration or any additional sensor\ndata. By extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate the superiority of\nour framework and provide detailed insights on its capability of dealing with\nthe aforementioned extreme cases of motion. We also show that training a\nsemantic segmentation network with the automatically labeled data achieves\nresults on par with manually annotated training data.

          "description": "Understanding the semantics of human movement -- the what, how and why of the\nmovement -- is an important problem that requires datasets of human actions\nwith semantic labels. Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale\nvideo datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D\nhuman motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body\nmotions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we\npresent BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions\nbeing performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about\n43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of\nabstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and\nframe labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame\nlabel is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the\nmocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence\nlabels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action\ncategories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action\nrecognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To\ndemonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of\nmodels on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting\nlearning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve\nas a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition. The dataset,\nbaseline method, and evaluation code is made available, and supported for\nacademic research purposes at https://babel.is.tue.mpg.de/.",

          "description": "Predicting all applicable labels for a given image is known as multi-label\nclassification. Compared to the standard multi-class case (where each image has\nonly one label), it is considerably more challenging to annotate training data\nfor multi-label classification. When the number of potential labels is large,\nhuman annotators find it difficult to mention all applicable labels for each\ntraining image. Furthermore, in some settings detection is intrinsically\ndifficult e.g. finding small object instances in high resolution images. As a\nresult, multi-label training data is often plagued by false negatives. We\nconsider the hardest version of this problem, where annotators provide only one\nrelevant label for each image. As a result, training sets will have only one\npositive label per image and no confirmed negatives. We explore this special\ncase of learning from missing labels across four different multi-label image\nclassification datasets for both linear classifiers and end-to-end fine-tuned\ndeep networks. We extend existing multi-label losses to this setting and\npropose novel variants that constrain the number of expected positive labels\nduring training.

          "description": "Over the past several years, we have witnessed impressive progress in the\nfield of learned image compression. Recent learned image codecs are commonly\nbased on autoencoders, that first encode an image into low-dimensional latent\nrepresentations and then decode them for reconstruction purposes. To capture\nspatial dependencies in the latent space, prior works exploit hyperprior and\nspatial context model to build an entropy model, which estimates the bit-rate\nfor end-to-end rate-distortion optimization. However, such an entropy model is\nsuboptimal from two aspects: (1) It fails to capture spatially global\ncorrelations among the latents. (2) Cross-channel relationships of the latents\nare still underexplored. In this paper, we propose the concept of separate\nentropy coding to leverage a serial decoding process for causal contextual\nentropy prediction in the latent space. A causal context model is proposed that\nseparates the latents across channels and makes use of cross-channel\nrelationships to generate highly informative contexts. Furthermore, we propose\na causal global prediction model, which is able to find global reference points\nfor accurate predictions of unknown points. Both these two models facilitate\nentropy estimation without the transmission of overhead. In addition, we\nfurther adopt a new separate attention module to build more powerful transform\nnetworks. Experimental results demonstrate that our full image compression\nmodel outperforms standard VVC/H.266 codec on Kodak dataset in terms of both\nPSNR and MS-SSIM, yielding the state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance.",

          "description": "Dexterous robotic hands are appealing for their agility and human-like\nmorphology, yet their high degree of freedom makes learning to manipulate\nchallenging. We introduce an approach for learning dexterous grasping. Our key\nidea is to embed an object-centric visual affordance model within a deep\nreinforcement learning loop to learn grasping policies that favor the same\nobject regions favored by people. Unlike traditional approaches that learn from\nhuman demonstration trajectories (e.g., hand joint sequences captured with a\nglove), the proposed prior is object-centric and image-based, allowing the\nagent to anticipate useful affordance regions for objects unseen during policy\nlearning. We demonstrate our idea with a 30-DoF five-fingered robotic hand\nsimulator on 40 objects from two datasets, where it successfully and\nefficiently learns policies for stable functional grasps. Our affordance-guided\npolicies are significantly more effective, generalize better to novel objects,\ntrain 3 X faster than the baselines, and are more robust to noisy sensor\nreadings and actuation. Our work offers a step towards manipulation agents that\nlearn by watching how people use objects, without requiring state and action\ninformation about the human body.

This inspires us to use a sparse\nset of LF captures to render high-quality novel views globally. However, fusion\nof LF captures from multiple angles is challenging due to the scale\ninconsistency caused by various capture settings. To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose a novel scale-consistent volume rescaling algorithm that robustly\naligns the disparity probability volumes (DPV) among different captures for\nscale-consistent global geometry fusion. Based on the fused DPV projected to\nthe target camera frustum, novel learning-based modules have been proposed\n(i.e., the attention-guided multi-scale residual fusion module, and the\ndisparity field guided deep re-regularization module) which comprehensively\nregularize noisy observations from heterogeneous captures for high-quality\nrendering of novel LFIs. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments over the\nStanford Lytro Multi-view LF dataset show that the proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods significantly under different experiment settings for\ndisparity inference and LF synthesis.",

Fast and accurate segmentation\non the organ in these images is crucial to planning and fusion with other\nmodalities such as magnetic resonance images (MRIs) .

          "description": "Instance segmentation has witnessed a remarkable progress on class-balanced\nbenchmarks. However, they fail to perform as accurately in real-world\nscenarios, where the category distribution of objects naturally comes with a\nlong tail. Instances of head classes dominate a long-tailed dataset and they\nserve as negative samples of tail categories. The overwhelming gradients of\nnegative samples on tail classes lead to a biased learning process for\nclassifiers. Consequently, objects of tail categories are more likely to be\nmisclassified as backgrounds or head categories. To tackle this problem, we\npropose Seesaw Loss to dynamically re-balance gradients of positive and\nnegative samples for each category, with two complementary factors, i.e.,\nmitigation factor and compensation factor. The mitigation factor reduces\npunishments to tail categories w.r.t. the ratio of cumulative training\ninstances between different categories. Meanwhile, the compensation factor\nincreases the penalty of misclassified instances to avoid false positives of\ntail categories. We conduct extensive experiments on Seesaw Loss with\nmainstream frameworks and different data sampling strategies. With a simple\nend-to-end training pipeline, Seesaw Loss obtains significant gains over\nCross-Entropy Loss, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on LVIS dataset\nwithout bells and whistles.

          "description": "Classical machine learning frameworks assume access to a possibly large\ndataset in order to train a predictive model. In many practical applications\nhowever, data does not arrive all at once, but in batches over time. This\ncreates a natural trade-off between accuracy of a model and time to obtain such\na model. A greedy predictor could produce non-trivial predictions by\nimmediately training on batches as soon as these become available but, it may\nalso make sub-optimal use of future data. On the other hand, a tardy predictor\ncould wait for a long time to aggregate several batches into a larger dataset,\nbut ultimately deliver a much better performance. In this work, we consider\nsuch a streaming learning setting, which we dub {\\em anytime learning at\nmacroscale} (ALMA). It is an instance of anytime learning applied not at the\nlevel of a single chunk of data, but at the level of the entire sequence of\nlarge batches. We first formalize this learning setting, we then introduce\nmetrics to assess how well learners perform on the given task for a given\nmemory and compute budget, and finally we test several baseline approaches on\nstandard benchmarks repurposed for anytime learning at macroscale. The general\nfinding is that bigger models always generalize better. In particular, it is\nimportant to grow model capacity over time if the initial model is relatively\nsmall. Moreover, updating the model at an intermediate rate strikes the best\ntrade off between accuracy and time to obtain a useful predictor.",

          "description": "Adversarial training is the de facto most promising defense against\nadversarial examples. Yet, its passive nature inevitably prevents it from being\nimmune to unknown attackers. To achieve a proactive defense, we need a more\nfundamental understanding of adversarial examples, beyond the popular bounded\nthreat model. In this paper, we provide a causal viewpoint of adversarial\nvulnerability: the cause is the confounder ubiquitously existing in learning,\nwhere attackers are precisely exploiting the confounding effect. Therefore, a\nfundamental solution for adversarial robustness is causal intervention. As the\nconfounder is unobserved in general, we propose to use the instrumental\nvariable that achieves intervention without the need for confounder\nobservation. We term our robust training method as Causal intervention by\ninstrumental Variable (CiiV). It has a differentiable retinotopic sampling\nlayer and a consistency loss, which is stable and guaranteed not to suffer from\ngradient obfuscation. Extensive experiments on a wide spectrum of attackers and\nsettings applied in MNIST, CIFAR-10, and mini-ImageNet datasets empirically\ndemonstrate that CiiV is robust to adaptive attacks.",

          "description": "3D face reconstruction from a single image is challenging due to its\nill-posed nature. Model-based face autoencoders address this issue effectively\nby fitting a face model to the target image in a weakly supervised manner.\nHowever, in unconstrained environments occlusions distort the face\nreconstruction because the model often erroneously tries to adapt to occluded\nface regions. Supervised occlusion segmentation is a viable solution to avoid\nthe fitting of occluded face regions, but it requires a large amount of\nannotated training data. In this work, we enable model-based face autoencoders\nto segment occluders accurately without requiring any additional supervision\nduring training, and this separates regions where the model will be fitted from\nthose where it will not be fitted. To achieve this, we extend face autoencoders\nwith a segmentation network. The segmentation network decides which regions the\nmodel should adapt to by reaching balances in a trade-off between including\npixels and adapting the model to them, and excluding pixels so that the model\nfitting is not negatively affected and reaches higher overall reconstruction\naccuracy on pixels showing the face. This leads to a synergistic effect, in\nwhich the occlusion segmentation guides the training of the face autoencoder to\nconstrain the fitting in the non-occluded regions, while the improved fitting\nenables the segmentation model to better predict the occluded face regions.\nQualitative and quantitative experiments on the CelebA-HQ database and the AR\ndatabase verify the effectiveness of our model in improving 3D face\nreconstruction under occlusions and in enabling accurate occlusion segmentation\nfrom weak supervision only.

          "description": "Deep networks have been progressively adapted to new sensor modalities,\nnamely to 3D LiDAR, which led to unprecedented achievements in autonomous\nvehicle-related applications such as place recognition. One of the main\nchallenges of deep models in place recognition is to extract efficient and\ndescriptive feature representations that relate places based on their\nsimilarity. To address the problem of place recognition using LiDAR data, this\npaper proposes a novel 3D LiDAR-based deep learning network (named AttDLNet)\nthat comprises an encoder network and exploits an attention mechanism to\nselectively focus on long-range context and interfeature relationships. The\nproposed network is trained and validated on the KITTI dataset, using the\ncosine loss for training and a retrieval-based place recognition pipeline for\nvalidation. Additionally, an ablation study is presented to assess the best\nnetwork configuration. Results show that the encoder network features are\nalready very descriptive, but adding attention to the network further improves\nperformance. From the ablation study, results indicate that the middle encoder\nlayers have the highest mean performance, while deeper layers are more robust\nto orientation change.

Inevitably, an independent stream is introduced to extract features\nfrom depth images, leading to extra computation and parameters. This\nmethodology which sacrifices the model size to improve the detection accuracy\nmay impede the practical application of SOD problems.

          "description": "The joint use of multiple imaging modalities for medical image segmentation\nhas been widely studied in recent years. The fusion of information from\ndifferent modalities has demonstrated to improve the segmentation accuracy,\nwith respect to mono-modal segmentations, in several applications. However,\nacquiring multiple modalities is usually not possible in a clinical setting due\nto a limited number of physicians and scanners, and to limit costs and scan\ntime. Most of the time, only one modality is acquired. In this paper, we\npropose KD-Net, a framework to transfer knowledge from a trained multi-modal\nnetwork (teacher) to a mono-modal one (student). The proposed method is an\nadaptation of the generalized distillation framework where the student network\nis trained on a subset (1 modality) of the teacher's inputs (n modalities). We\nillustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in brain tumor\nsegmentation with the BraTS 2018 dataset. Using different architectures, we\nshow that the student network effectively learns from the teacher and always\noutperforms the baseline mono-modal network in terms of segmentation accuracy.",

          "description": "The task of unsupervised motion retargeting in videos has seen substantial\nadvancements through the use of deep neural networks. While early works\nconcentrated on specific object priors such as a human face or body, recent\nwork considered the unsupervised case. When the source and target videos,\nhowever, are of different shapes, current methods fail. To alleviate this\nproblem, we introduce JOKR - a JOint Keypoint Representation that captures the\nmotion common to both the source and target videos, without requiring any\nobject prior or data collection. By employing a domain confusion term, we\nenforce the unsupervised keypoint representations of both videos to be\nindistinguishable. This encourages disentanglement between the parts of the\nmotion that are common to the two domains, and their distinctive appearance and\nmotion, enabling the generation of videos that capture the motion of the one\nwhile depicting the style of the other. To enable cases where the objects are\nof different proportions or orientations, we apply a learned affine\ntransformation between the JOKRs. This augments the representation to be affine\ninvariant, and in practice broadens the variety of possible retargeting pairs.\nThis geometry-driven representation enables further intuitive control, such as\ntemporal coherence and manual editing. Through comprehensive experimentation,\nwe demonstrate the applicability of our method to different challenging\ncross-domain video pairs. We evaluate our method both qualitatively and\nquantitatively, and demonstrate that our method handles various cross-domain\nscenarios, such as different animals, different flowers, and humans. We also\ndemonstrate superior temporal coherency and visual quality compared to\nstate-of-the-art alternatives, through statistical metrics and a user study.\nSource code and videos can be found at https://rmokady.github.io/JOKR/ .",

          "description": "Age estimation is an essential challenge in computer vision. With the\nadvances of convolutional neural networks, the performance of age estimation\nhas been dramatically improved. Existing approaches usually treat age\nestimation as a classification problem. However, the age labels are ambiguous,\nthus make the classification task difficult. In this paper, we propose a simple\nyet effective approach for age estimation, which improves the performance\ncompared to classification-based methods. The method combines four\nclassification losses and one regression loss representing different class\ngranularities together, and we name it as Age-Granularity-Net. We validate the\nAge-Granularity-Net framework on the CVPR Chalearn 2016 dataset, and extensive\nexperiments show that the proposed approach can reduce the prediction error\ncompared to any individual loss.

          "description": "Modern neural networks are highly uncalibrated. It poses a significant\nchallenge for safety-critical systems to utilise deep neural networks (DNNs),\nreliably. Many recently proposed approaches have demonstrated substantial\nprogress in improving DNN calibration. However, they hardly touch upon\nrefinement, which historically has been an essential aspect of calibration.\nRefinement indicates separability of a network's correct and incorrect\npredictions. This paper presents a theoretically and empirically supported\nexposition for reviewing a model's calibration and refinement. Firstly, we show\nthe breakdown of expected calibration error (ECE), into predicted confidence\nand refinement. Connecting with this result, we highlight that regularisation\nbased calibration only focuses on naively reducing a model's confidence. This\nlogically has a severe downside to a model's refinement. We support our claims\nthrough rigorous empirical evaluations of many state of the art calibration\napproaches on standard datasets. We find that many calibration approaches with\nthe likes of label smoothing, mixup etc. lower the utility of a DNN by\ndegrading its refinement. Even under natural data shift, this\ncalibration-refinement trade-off holds for the majority of calibration methods.\nThese findings call for an urgent retrospective into some popular pathways\ntaken for modern DNN calibration.",

          "description": "For a target task where labeled data is unavailable, domain adaptation can\ntransfer a learner from a different source domain. Previous deep domain\nadaptation methods mainly learn a global domain shift, i.e., align the global\nsource and target distributions without considering the relationships between\ntwo subdomains within the same category of different domains, leading to\nunsatisfying transfer learning performance without capturing the fine-grained\ninformation. Recently, more and more researchers pay attention to Subdomain\nAdaptation which focuses on accurately aligning the distributions of the\nrelevant subdomains. However, most of them are adversarial methods which\ncontain several loss functions and converge slowly. Based on this, we present\nDeep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) which learns a transfer network by\naligning the relevant subdomain distributions of domain-specific layer\nactivations across different domains based on a local maximum mean discrepancy\n(LMMD). Our DSAN is very simple but effective which does not need adversarial\ntraining and converges fast. The adaptation can be achieved easily with most\nfeed-forward network models by extending them with LMMD loss, which can be\ntrained efficiently via back-propagation. Experiments demonstrate that DSAN can\nachieve remarkable results on both object recognition tasks and digit\nclassification tasks.

However, most of these attacks fail to encompass a large spectrum of\nadversarial perturbations that are imperceptible to humans. In this paper, we\npresent localized uncertainty attacks, a novel class of threat models against\ndeterministic and stochastic classifiers. Under this threat model, we create\nadversarial examples by perturbing only regions in the inputs where a\nclassifier is uncertain. To find such regions, we utilize the predictive\nuncertainty of the classifier when the classifier is stochastic or, we learn a\nsurrogate model to amortize the uncertainty when it is deterministic. Unlike\n$\\ell_p$ ball or functional attacks which perturb inputs indiscriminately, our\ntargeted changes can be less perceptible.

          "description": "The success of deep learning heavily depends on the availability of large\nlabeled training sets. However, it is hard to get large labeled datasets in\nmedical image domain because of the strict privacy concern and costly labeling\nefforts. Contrastive learning, an unsupervised learning technique, has been\nproved powerful in learning image-level representations from unlabeled data.\nThe learned encoder can then be transferred or fine-tuned to improve the\nperformance of downstream tasks with limited labels. A critical step in\ncontrastive learning is the generation of contrastive data pairs, which is\nrelatively simple for natural image classification but quite challenging for\nmedical image segmentation due to the existence of the same tissue or organ\nacross the dataset. As a result, when applied to medical image segmentation,\nmost state-of-the-art contrastive learning frameworks inevitably introduce a\nlot of false-negative pairs and result in degraded segmentation quality. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel positional contrastive learning (PCL)\nframework to generate contrastive data pairs by leveraging the position\ninformation in volumetric medical images. Experimental results on CT and MRI\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed PCL method can substantially improve the\nsegmentation performance compared to existing methods in both semi-supervised\nsetting and transfer learning setting.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have enormous representational power which leads them to\noverfit on most datasets. Thus, regularizing them is important in order to\nreduce overfitting and enhance their generalization capabilities. Recently,\nchannel shuffle operation has been introduced for mixing channels in group\nconvolutions in resource efficient networks in order to reduce memory and\ncomputations. This paper studies the operation of channel shuffle as a\nregularization technique in deep convolutional networks. We show that while\nrandom shuffling of channels during training drastically reduce their\nperformance, however, randomly shuffling small patches between channels\nsignificantly improves their performance. The patches to be shuffled are picked\nfrom the same spatial locations in the feature maps such that a patch, when\ntransferred from one channel to another, acts as structured noise for the later\nchannel. We call this method \"ShuffleBlock\". The proposed ShuffleBlock module\nis easy to implement and improves the performance of several baseline networks\non the task of image classification on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. It also\nachieves comparable and in many cases better performance than many other\nregularization methods. We provide several ablation studies on selecting\nvarious hyperparameters of the ShuffleBlock module and propose a new scheduling\nmethod that further enhances its performance.",

In the\nfield of stereoscopic vision, the information is fairly distributed between the\nleft and right views as well as the binocular phenomenon. In this work, we\npropose to integrate these characteristics to estimate the quality of\nstereoscopic images without reference through a convolutional neural network.\nOur method is based on two main tasks: the first task predicts naturalness\nanalysis based features adapted to stereo images, while the second task\npredicts the quality of such images. The former, so-called auxiliary task, aims\nto find more robust and relevant features to improve the quality prediction. To\ndo this, we compute naturalness-based features using a Natural Scene Statistics\n(NSS) model in the complex wavelet domain. It allows to capture the statistical\ndependency between pairs of the stereoscopic images. Experiments are conducted\non the well known LIVE PHASE I and LIVE PHASE II databases.

To\nmitigate these problems, in this project, we present a framework that is\ncapable of controllable, confidence-based noise removal. The framework is based\non the fusion between two different denoised images, both derived from the same\nnoisy input. One of the two is denoised using generic algorithms (e.g.\nGaussian), which make few assumptions on the input images, therefore,\ngeneralize in all scenarios. The other is denoised using deep learning,\nperforming well on seen datasets. We introduce a set of techniques to fuse the\ntwo components smoothly in the frequency domain. Beyond that, we estimate the\nconfidence of a deep learning denoiser to allow users to interpret the output,\nand provide a fusion strategy that safeguards them against out-of-distribution\ninputs.

While modern devices exhibit a high level of parallelism,\nreal-time latency is still highly dependent on networks' depth. Although recent\nworks show that below a certain depth, the width of shallower networks must\ngrow exponentially, we presume that neural networks typically exceed this\nminimal depth to accelerate convergence and incrementally increase accuracy.\nThis motivates us to transform pre-trained deep networks that already exploit\nsuch advantages into shallower forms. We propose a method that learns whether\nnon-linear activations can be removed, allowing to fold consecutive linear\nlayers into one. We apply our method to networks pre-trained on CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100 and find that they can all be transformed into shallower forms that\nshare a similar depth. Finally, we use our method to provide more efficient\nalternatives to MobileNetV2 and EfficientNet-Lite architectures on the ImageNet\nclassification task.",

          "description": "In Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, perception is both security and safety\ncritical. Despite various prior studies on its security issues, all of them\nonly consider attacks on camera- or LiDAR-based AD perception alone. However,\nproduction AD systems today predominantly adopt a Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF)\nbased design, which in principle can be more robust against these attacks under\nthe assumption that not all fusion sources are (or can be) attacked at the same\ntime. In this paper, we present the first study of security issues of MSF-based\nperception in AD systems. We directly challenge the basic MSF design assumption\nabove by exploring the possibility of attacking all fusion sources\nsimultaneously. This allows us for the first time to understand how much\nsecurity guarantee MSF can fundamentally provide as a general defense strategy\nfor AD perception.\n\nWe formulate the attack as an optimization problem to generate a\nphysically-realizable, adversarial 3D-printed object that misleads an AD system\nto fail in detecting it and thus crash into it. We propose a novel attack\npipeline that addresses two main design challenges: (1) non-differentiable\ntarget camera and LiDAR sensing systems, and (2) non-differentiable cell-level\naggregated features popularly used in LiDAR-based AD perception. We evaluate\nour attack on MSF included in representative open-source industry-grade AD\nsystems in real-world driving scenarios. Our results show that the attack\nachieves over 90% success rate across different object types and MSF. Our\nattack is also found stealthy, robust to victim positions, transferable across\nMSF algorithms, and physical-world realizable after being 3D-printed and\ncaptured by LiDAR and camera devices. To concretely assess the end-to-end\nsafety impact, we further perform simulation evaluation and show that it can\ncause a 100% vehicle collision rate for an industry-grade AD system.",

High-quality DVF\ntraining data is created by employing hyper-parameter optimization on the\nsubset of the training data with DICE coefficient and mutual information\nmetric. We validated our model on two radiotherapy datasets: a publicly\navailable head-and-neck dataset (28 patients with manually contoured pre-,\nmid-, and post-treatment CTs), and an internal non-small cell lung cancer\ndataset (63 patients with manually contoured planning CT and 6 weekly CBCTs).\nResults: The use of DVF representation and skip connections overcomes the\nblurring issue of ConvLSTM prediction with the traditional image\nrepresentation.

Whether based on recurrent or feed-forward neural networks,\nexisting learning based methods fail to model the observation that human motion\ntends to repeat itself, even for complex sports actions and cooking activities.\nHere, we introduce an attention based feed-forward network that explicitly\nleverages this observation. In particular, instead of modeling frame-wise\nattention via pose similarity, we propose to extract motion attention to\ncapture the similarity between the current motion context and the historical\nmotion sub-sequences. In this context, we study the use of different types of\nattention, computed at joint, body part, and full pose levels. Aggregating the\nrelevant past motions and processing the result with a graph convolutional\nnetwork allows us to effectively exploit motion patterns from the long-term\nhistory to predict the future poses. Our experiments on Human3.6M, AMASS and\n3DPW validate the benefits of our approach for both periodical and\nnon-periodical actions. Thanks to our attention model, it yields\nstate-of-the-art results on all three datasets. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/wei-mao-2019/HisRepItself.",

          "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that influences\nthe communication and social behavior of a person in a way that those in the\nspectrum have difficulty in perceiving other people's facial expressions, as\nwell as presenting and communicating emotions and affect via their own faces\nand bodies. Some efforts have been made to predict and improve children with\nASD's affect states in play therapy, a common method to improve children's\nsocial skills via play and games. However, many previous works only used\npre-trained models on benchmark emotion datasets and failed to consider the\ndistinction in emotion between typically developing children and children with\nautism. In this paper, we present an open-source two-stage multi-modal approach\nleveraging acoustic and visual cues to predict three main affect states of\nchildren with ASD's affect states (positive, negative, and neutral) in\nreal-world play therapy scenarios, and achieved an overall accuracy of 72:40%.\nThis work presents a novel way to combine human expertise and machine\nintelligence for ASD affect recognition by proposing a two-stage schema.",

          "description": "Unsupervised image-to-image translation methods such as CycleGAN learn to\nconvert images from one domain to another using unpaired training data sets\nfrom different domains. Unfortunately, these approaches still require centrally\ncollected unpaired records, potentially violating privacy and security issues.\nAlthough the recent federated learning (FL) allows a neural network to be\ntrained without data exchange, the basic assumption of the FL is that all\nclients have their own training data from a similar domain, which is different\nfrom our image-to-image translation scenario in which each client has images\nfrom its unique domain and the goal is to learn image translation between\ndifferent domains without accessing the target domain data. To address this,\nhere we propose a novel federated CycleGAN architecture that can learn image\ntranslation in an unsupervised manner while maintaining the data privacy.\nSpecifically, our approach arises from a novel observation that CycleGAN loss\ncan be decomposed into the sum of client specific local objectives that can be\nevaluated using only their data. This local objective decomposition allows\nmultiple clients to participate in federated CycleGAN training without\nsacrificing performance. Furthermore, our method employs novel switchable\ngenerator and discriminator architecture using Adaptive Instance Normalization\n(AdaIN) that significantly reduces the band-width requirement of the federated\nlearning.

The\ncommon pipeline for segmentation comprises regions of interest detection stage\nand segmentation stage, which are independent of each other and typically\nperformed using separate deep learning networks. The performance of the\nsegmentation stage highly relies on the extracted set of spatial features and\nthe receptive fields. In this work, we propose an end-to-end network, called\nTrilateral Attention Network (TaNet), for real-time detection and segmentation\nin medical images. TaNet has a module for region localization, and three\nsegmentation pathways: 1) handcrafted pathway with hand-designed convolutional\nkernels, 2) detail pathway with regular convolutional kernels, and 3) a global\npathway to enlarge the receptive field. The first two pathways encode rich\nhandcrafted and low-level features extracted by hand-designed and regular\nkernels while the global pathway encodes high-level context information. By\njointly training the network for localization and segmentation using different\nsets of features, TaNet achieved superior performance, in terms of accuracy and\nspeed, when evaluated on an echocardiography dataset for cardiac segmentation.\nThe code and models will be made publicly available in TaNet Github page.",

          "description": "Enforcing orthogonality in neural networks is an antidote for gradient\nvanishing/exploding problems, sensitivity by adversarial perturbation, and\nbounding generalization errors. However, many previous approaches are\nheuristic, and the orthogonality of convolutional layers is not systematically\nstudied: some of these designs are not exactly orthogonal, while others only\nconsider standard convolutional layers and propose specific classes of their\nrealizations. To address this problem, we propose a theoretical framework for\northogonal convolutional layers, which establishes the equivalence between\nvarious orthogonal convolutional layers in the spatial domain and the\nparaunitary systems in the spectral domain. Since there exists a complete\nspectral factorization of paraunitary systems, any orthogonal convolution layer\ncan be parameterized as convolutions of spatial filters. Our framework endows\nhigh expressive power to various convolutional layers while maintaining their\nexact orthogonality. Furthermore, our layers are memory and computationally\nefficient for deep networks compared to previous designs. Our versatile\nframework, for the first time, enables the study of architecture designs for\ndeep orthogonal networks, such as choices of skip connection, initialization,\nstride, and dilation. Consequently, we scale up orthogonal networks to deep\narchitectures, including ResNet, WideResNet, and ShuffleNet, substantially\nincreasing the performance over the traditional shallow orthogonal networks.",

          "description": "Video transformers have recently emerged as a competitive alternative to 3D\nCNNs for video understanding. However, due to their large number of parameters\nand reduced inductive biases, these models require supervised pretraining on\nlarge-scale image datasets to achieve top performance. In this paper, we\nempirically demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining of video transformers\non video-only datasets can lead to action recognition results that are on par\nor better than those obtained with supervised pretraining on large-scale image\ndatasets, even massive ones such as ImageNet-21K. Since transformer-based\nmodels are effective at capturing dependencies over extended temporal spans, we\npropose a simple learning procedure that forces the model to match a long-term\nview to a short-term view of the same video. Our approach, named Long-Short\nTemporal Contrastive Learning (LSTCL), enables video transformers to learn an\neffective clip-level representation by predicting temporal context captured\nfrom a longer temporal extent. To demonstrate the generality of our findings,\nwe implement and validate our approach under three different self-supervised\ncontrastive learning frameworks (MoCo v3, BYOL, SimSiam) using two distinct\nvideo-transformer architectures, including an improved variant of the Swin\nTransformer augmented with space-time attention.

          "description": "Fetoscopy laser photocoagulation is a widely used procedure for the treatment\nof Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS), that occur in mono-chorionic\nmultiple pregnancies due to placental vascular anastomoses. This procedure is\nparticularly challenging due to limited field of view, poor manoeuvrability of\nthe fetoscope, poor visibility due to fluid turbidity, variability in light\nsource, and unusual position of the placenta. This may lead to increased\nprocedural time and incomplete ablation, resulting in persistent TTTS.\nComputer-assisted intervention may help overcome these challenges by expanding\nthe fetoscopic field of view through video mosaicking and providing better\nvisualization of the vessel network. However, the research and development in\nthis domain remain limited due to unavailability of high-quality data to encode\nthe intra- and inter-procedure variability. Through the \\textit{Fetoscopic\nPlacental Vessel Segmentation and Registration (FetReg)} challenge, we present\na large-scale multi-centre dataset for the development of generalized and\nrobust semantic segmentation and video mosaicking algorithms for the fetal\nenvironment with a focus on creating drift-free mosaics from long duration\nfetoscopy videos. In this paper, we provide an overview of the FetReg dataset,\nchallenge tasks, evaluation metrics and baseline methods for both segmentation\nand registration. Baseline methods results on the FetReg dataset shows that our\ndataset poses interesting challenges, offering large opportunity for the\ncreation of novel methods and models through a community effort initiative\nguided by the FetReg challenge.",

In this paper, we define a new problem, Network Space Search\n(NSS), as searching for favorable network spaces instead of a single\narchitecture. We propose an NSS method to directly search for efficient-aware\nnetwork spaces automatically, reducing the manual effort and immense cost in\ndiscovering satisfactory ones. The resultant network spaces, named Elite\nSpaces, are discovered from Expanded Search Space with minimal human expertise\nimposed. The Pareto-efficient Elite Spaces are aligned with the Pareto front\nunder various complexity constraints and can be further served as NAS search\nspaces, benefiting differentiable NAS approaches (e.g. In CIFAR-100, an\naveragely 2.3% lower error rate and 3.7% closer to target constraint than the\nbaseline with around 90% fewer samples required to find satisfactory networks).\nMoreover, our NSS approach is capable of searching for superior spaces in\nfuture unexplored spaces, revealing great potential in searching for network\nspaces automatically.

We present an\nunsupervised GAN-based model to recover 3D human pose from 2D joint locations\nextracted from a single image. Our model uses a GAN to learn the mapping of\ndistribution from 2D poses to 3D poses, not the simple 2D-3D correspondence.\nConsidering the reprojection constraint, our model can estimate the camera so\nthat we can reproject the estimated 3D pose to the original 2D pose. Based on\nthis reprojection method, we can rotate and reproject the generated pose to get\nour \"new\" 2D pose and then use a weight sharing generator to estimate the \"new\"\n3D pose and a \"new\" camera. Through the above estimation process, we can define\nthe single-view-multi-angle consistency loss during training to simulate\nmulti-view consistency, which means the 3D poses and cameras estimated from two\nangles of a single view should be able to be mixed to generate rich 2D\nreprojections, and the 2D reprojections reprojected from the same 3D pose\nshould be consistent. The experimental results on Human3.6M show that our\nmethod outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods, and results on\nMPI-INF-3DHP show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art by approximately\n15.0%.",

A persistent challenge has been to\ngenerate diverse versions of output images from the same input image, due to\nthe problem of mode collapse: because only one ground truth output image is\ngiven per input image, only one mode of the conditional distribution is\nmodelled. In this paper, we focus on this problem of multimodal conditional\nimage synthesis and build on the recently proposed technique of Implicit\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE). Prior IMLE-based methods required\ndifferent architectures for different tasks, which limit their applicability,\nand were lacking in fine details in the generated images. We propose CAM-Net, a\nunified architecture that can be applied to a broad range of tasks.\nAdditionally, it is capable of generating convincing high frequency details,\nachieving a reduction of the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by up to 45.3%\ncompared to the baseline.",

Our analyses and results show that the\noccurrence and values of facial AU1 and AU4, and Arousal are heightened when\nparticipants fail to use explanations effectively.

Morphed images have\nexposed face recognition systems' susceptibility to false acceptance, resulting\nin dire consequences, especially for national security applications. To detect\nmorphing attacks, we propose a method which is based on a discriminative 2D\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform (2D-DWT). A discriminative wavelet sub-band can\nhighlight inconsistencies between a real and a morphed image. We observe that\nthere is a salient discrepancy between the entropy of a given sub-band in a\nbona fide image, and the same sub-band's entropy in a morphed sample.\nConsidering this dissimilarity between these two entropy values, we find the\nKullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions, namely the entropy\nof the bona fide and the corresponding morphed images. The most discriminative\nwavelet sub-bands are those with the highest corresponding KL-divergence\nvalues. Accordingly, 22 sub-bands are selected as the most discriminative ones\nin terms of morph detection. We show that a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained\non the 22 discriminative sub-bands can detect morphed samples precisely. Most\nimportantly, the effectiveness of our algorithm is validated through\nexperiments on three datasets: VISAPP17, LMA, and MorGAN. We also performed an\nablation study on the sub-band selection.",

Theoretically, we first demonstrate that\nMTL shares the same optimization formulation with a class of gradient-based\nmeta-learning (GBML) algorithms. We then prove that for over-parameterized\nneural networks with sufficient depth, the learned predictive functions of MTL\nand GBML are close. In particular, this result implies that the predictions\ngiven by these two models are similar over the same unseen task. Empirically,\nwe corroborate our theoretical findings by showing that, with proper\nimplementation, MTL is competitive against state-of-the-art GBML algorithms on\na set of few-shot image classification benchmarks. Since existing GBML\nalgorithms often involve costly second-order bi-level optimization, our\nfirst-order MTL method is an order of magnitude faster on large-scale datasets\nsuch as mini-ImageNet. We believe this work could help bridge the gap between\nthese two learning paradigms, and provide a computationally efficient\nalternative to GBML that also supports fast task adaptation.",

The resulting\nfeature detector is tightly coupled with the feature descriptor, in contrast to\nclassical approaches (SIFT, etc.), where the detection phase precedes and\ndiffers from computing the descriptor. Our approach utilizes two CNN\nsubnetworks, the first being a Siamese CNN and the second, consisting of dual\nnon-weight-sharing CNNs. This allows simultaneous processing and fusion of the\njoint and disjoint cues in the multimodal image patches. The proposed approach\nis experimentally shown to outperform contemporary state-of-the-art schemes\nwhen applied to multiple datasets of multimodal images.

Generally, most methods\ndirectly use neural networks and ignore certain constraints (e.g., reprojection\nconstraints and joint angle and bone length constraints). This paper proposes a\nweakly supervised GAN-based model for 3D human pose estimation that considers\n3D information along with 2D information simultaneously, in which a\nreprojection network is employed to learn the mapping of the distribution from\n3D poses to 2D poses. In particular, we train the reprojection network and the\ngenerative adversarial network synchronously. Furthermore, inspired by the\ntypical kinematic chain space (KCS) matrix, we propose a weighted KCS matrix,\nwhich is added into the discriminator's input to impose joint angle and bone\nlength constraints.

          "description": "Although the adoption rate of deep neural networks (DNNs) has tremendously\nincreased in recent years, a solution for their vulnerability against\nadversarial examples has not yet been found. As a result, substantial research\nefforts are dedicated to fix this weakness, with many studies typically using a\nsubset of source images to generate adversarial examples, treating every image\nin this subset as equal. We demonstrate that, in fact, not every source image\nis equally suited for this kind of assessment. To do so, we devise a\nlarge-scale model-to-model transferability scenario for which we meticulously\nanalyze the properties of adversarial examples, generated from every suitable\nsource image in ImageNet by making use of two of the most frequently deployed\nattacks. In this transferability scenario, which involves seven distinct DNN\nmodels, including the recently proposed vision transformers, we reveal that it\nis possible to have a difference of up to $12.5\\%$ in model-to-model\ntransferability success, $1.01$ in average $L_2$ perturbation, and $0.03$\n($8/225$) in average $L_{\\infty}$ perturbation when $1,000$ source images are\nsampled randomly among all suitable candidates. We then take one of the first\nsteps in evaluating the robustness of images used to create adversarial\nexamples, proposing a number of simple but effective methods to identify\nunsuitable source images, thus making it possible to mitigate extreme cases in\nexperimentation and support high-quality benchmarking.",

However,\nstate-of-the-art models frequently show abrupt changes in the image appearance\nduring interpolation, and usually perform poorly in interpolations across\ndomains. In this paper, we propose a new training protocol based on three\nspecific losses which help a translation network to learn a smooth and\ndisentangled latent style space in which: 1) Both intra- and inter-domain\ninterpolations correspond to gradual changes in the generated images and 2) The\ncontent of the source image is better preserved during the translation.\nMoreover, we propose a novel evaluation metric to properly measure the\nsmoothness of latent style space of I2I translation models.

          "description": "Purpose: In current clinical practice, noisy and artifact-ridden weekly\ncone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images are only used for patient setup\nduring radiotherapy. Treatment planning is done once at the beginning of the\ntreatment using high-quality planning CT (pCT) images and manual contours for\norgans-at-risk (OARs) structures. If the quality of the weekly CBCT images can\nbe improved while simultaneously segmenting OAR structures, this can provide\ncritical information for adapting radiotherapy mid-treatment as well as for\nderiving biomarkers for treatment response. Methods: Using a novel\nphysics-based data augmentation strategy, we synthesize a large dataset of\nperfectly/inherently registered planning CT and synthetic-CBCT pairs for\nlocally advanced lung cancer patient cohort, which are then used in a multitask\n3D deep learning framework to simultaneously segment and translate real weekly\nCBCT images to high-quality planning CT-like images. Results: We compared the\nsynthetic CT and OAR segmentations generated by the model to real planning CT\nand manual OAR segmentations and showed promising results. The real week 1\n(baseline) CBCT images which had an average MAE of 162.77 HU compared to pCT\nimages are translated to synthetic CT images that exhibit a drastically\nimproved average MAE of 29.31 HU and average structural similarity of 92% with\nthe pCT images. The average DICE scores of the 3D organs-at-risk segmentations\nare: lungs 0.96, heart 0.88, spinal cord 0.83 and esophagus 0.66. Conclusions:\nWe demonstrate an approach to translate artifact-ridden CBCT images to high\nquality synthetic CT images while simultaneously generating good quality\nsegmentation masks for different organs-at-risk. This approach could allow\nclinicians to adjust treatment plans using only the routine low-quality CBCT\nimages, potentially improving patient outcomes.",

While the widespread use of surrogate\nexplainers is a welcome addition to inspect and understand black-box models,\nassessing the robustness and reliability of the explanations is key for their\nsuccess. Additionally, whilst existing work in the explainability field\nproposes various strategies to address this problem, the challenges of working\nwith data in the wild is often overlooked. For instance, in image\nclassification, distortions to images can not only affect the predictions\nassigned by the model, but also the explanation. Given a clean and a distorted\nversion of an image, even if the prediction probabilities are similar, the\nexplanation may still be different. In this paper we propose a methodology to\nevaluate the effect of distortions in explanations by embedding perceptual\ndistances that tailor the neighbourhoods used to training surrogate explainers.\nWe also show that by operating in this way, we can make the explanations more\nrobust to distortions. We generate explanations for images in the Imagenet-C\ndataset and demonstrate how using a perceptual distances in the surrogate\nexplainer creates more coherent explanations for the distorted and reference\nimages.",

While practitioners celebrate synthetic data\ngeneration using GANs as an economical way to augment data for training\ndata-hungry machine learning models, it is unclear whether they recognize the\nperils of such techniques when applied to real world datasets biased along\nlatent dimensions. Specifically, we show that (1) traditional GANs further skew\nthe distribution of a dataset consisting of engineering faculty headshots,\ngenerating minority modes less often and of worse quality and (2)\nimage-to-image translation (conditional) GANs also exacerbate biases by\nlightening skin color of non-white faces and transforming female facial\nfeatures to be masculine when generating faces of engineering professors.

However, as in\nmany machine learning settings, social biases can influence image captioning in\nundesirable ways. In this work, we study bias propagation pathways within image\ncaptioning, focusing specifically on the COCO dataset. Prior work has analyzed\ngender bias in captions using automatically-derived gender labels; here we\nexamine racial and intersectional biases using manual annotations. Our first\ncontribution is in annotating the perceived gender and skin color of 28,315 of\nthe depicted people after obtaining IRB approval. Using these annotations, we\ncompare racial biases present in both manual and automatically-generated image\ncaptions. We demonstrate differences in caption performance, sentiment, and\nword choice between images of lighter versus darker-skinned people. Further, we\nfind the magnitude of these differences to be greater in modern captioning\nsystems compared to older ones, thus leading to concerns that without proper\nconsideration and mitigation these differences will only become increasingly\nprevalent.

These affinity fields,\nalong with the binary masks, can then be used to cluster lane pixels\nhorizontally and vertically into corresponding lane instances in a\npost-processing step. This clustering is achieved through a simple row-by-row\ndecoding process with little overhead; such an approach allows LaneAF to detect\na variable number of lanes without assuming a fixed or maximum number of lanes.\nMoreover, this form of clustering is more interpretable in comparison to\nprevious visual clustering approaches, and can be analyzed to identify and\ncorrect sources of error. Qualitative and quantitative results obtained on\npopular lane detection datasets demonstrate the model's ability to detect and\ncluster lanes effectively and robustly.

          "description": "Previous studies have verified that the functionality of black-box models can\nbe stolen with full probability outputs. However, under the more practical\nhard-label setting, we observe that existing methods suffer from catastrophic\nperformance degradation. We argue this is due to the lack of rich information\nin the probability prediction and the overfitting caused by hard labels. To\nthis end, we propose a novel hard-label model stealing method termed\n\\emph{black-box dissector}, which consists of two erasing-based modules. One is\na CAM-driven erasing strategy that is designed to increase the information\ncapacity hidden in hard labels from the victim model. The other is a\nrandom-erasing-based self-knowledge distillation module that utilizes soft\nlabels from the substitute model to mitigate overfitting. Extensive experiments\non four widely-used datasets consistently demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, with an improvement of at most $8.27\\%$.\nWe also validate the effectiveness and practical potential of our method on\nreal-world APIs and defense methods.

          "description": "A driver's gaze is critical for determining their attention, state,\nsituational awareness, and readiness to take over control from partially\nautomated vehicles. Estimating the gaze direction is the most obvious way to\ngauge a driver's state under ideal conditions when limited to using\nnon-intrusive imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the vehicular environment\nintroduces a variety of challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh\nillumination, nighttime conditions, and reflective eyeglasses. Relying on head\npose alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable and erroneous. In\nthis study, we offer solutions to address these problems encountered in the\nreal world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate that using an\ninfrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization suffices. To\nhandle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we adopt image-to-image\ntranslation using generative adversarial networks to pre-process images prior\nto gaze estimation. Our proposed Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN) is\ntrained to preserve the driver's gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from\nface images. GPCycleGAN is based on the well-known CycleGAN approach - with the\naddition of a gaze classifier and a gaze consistency loss for additional\nsupervision.

Traditional\ntechniques address this challenge either by synthesizing frontal faces or by\npose invariant learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method with Lie\nalgebra theory to explore how face rotation in the 3D space affects the deep\nfeature generation process of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We prove\nthat face rotation in the image space is equivalent to an additive residual\ncomponent in the feature space of CNNs, which is determined solely by the\nrotation. Based on this theoretical finding, we further design a Lie Algebraic\nResidual Network (LARNet) for tackling pose robust face recognition. Our LARNet\nconsists of a residual subnet for decoding rotation information from input face\nimages, and a gating subnet to learn rotation magnitude for controlling the\nstrength of the residual component contributing to the feature learning\nprocess. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on both frontal-profile face\ndatasets and general face recognition datasets convincingly demonstrate that\nour method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.",

          "description": "Recent studies reveal that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose a threat to security-sensitive\napplications. Many adversarial defense methods improve robustness at the cost\nof accuracy, raising the contradiction between standard and adversarial\naccuracies. In this paper, we observe an interesting phenomenon that feature\nstatistics change monotonically and smoothly w.r.t the rising of attacking\nstrength. Based on this observation, we propose the adaptive feature alignment\n(AFA) to generate features of arbitrary attacking strengths. Our method is\ntrained to automatically align features of arbitrary attacking strength. This\nis done by predicting a fusing weight in a dual-BN architecture. Unlike\nprevious works that need to either retrain the model or manually tune a\nhyper-parameters for different attacking strengths, our method can deal with\narbitrary attacking strengths with a single model without introducing any\nhyper-parameter.

The World\nHealth Organization (WHO) has provided guidelines on how to reduce the spread\nof the virus and one of the most important measures is social distancing.\nMaintaining a minimum of one meter distance from other people is strongly\nsuggested to reduce the risk of infection. This has created a strong interest\nin monitoring the social distances either as a safety measure or to study how\nthe measures have affected human behavior and country-wise differences in this.\nThe need for automatic social distance estimation algorithms is evident, but\nthere is no suitable test benchmark for such algorithms. Collecting images with\nmeasured ground-truth pair-wise distances between all the people using\ndifferent camera settings is cumbersome. Furthermore, performance evaluation\nfor social distance estimation algorithms is not straightforward and there is\nno widely accepted evaluation protocol. In this paper, we provide a dataset of\nvarying images with measured pair-wise social distances under different camera\npositionings and focal length values. We suggest a performance evaluation\nprotocol and provide a benchmark to easily evaluate social distance estimation\nalgorithms. We also propose a method for automatic social distance estimation.\nOur method takes advantage of object detection and human pose estimation. It\ncan be applied on any single image as long as focal length and sensor size\ninformation are known. The results on our benchmark are encouraging with 92%\nhuman detection rate and only 28.9% average error in distance estimation among\nthe detected people.",

Many deep learning based methods have been developed\nin the past few years. However, since there are no intended HR MS images as\nreferences for learning, almost all of the existing methods down-sample the MS\nand PAN images and regard the original MS images as targets to form a\nsupervised setting for training. These methods may perform well on the\ndown-scaled images, however, they generalize poorly to the full-resolution\nimages. To conquer this problem, we design an unsupervised framework that is\nable to learn directly from the full-resolution images without any\npreprocessing. The model is built based on a novel generative multi-adversarial\nnetwork. We use a two-stream generator to extract the modality-specific\nfeatures from the PAN and MS images, respectively, and develop a\ndual-discriminator to preserve the spectral and spatial information of the\ninputs when performing fusion.

          "description": "Panoptic segmentation (PS) is a complex scene understanding task that\nrequires providing high-quality segmentation for both thing objects and stuff\nregions. Previous methods handle these two classes with semantic and instance\nsegmentation modules separately, following with heuristic fusion or additional\nmodules to resolve the conflicts between the two outputs. This work simplifies\nthis pipeline of PS by consistently modeling the two classes with a novel PS\nframework, which extends a detection model with an extra module to predict\ncategory- and instance-aware pixel embedding (CIAE). CIAE is a novel pixel-wise\nembedding feature that encodes both semantic-classification and\ninstance-distinction information. At the inference process, PS results are\nsimply derived by assigning each pixel to a detected instance or a stuff class\naccording to the learned embedding. Our method not only demonstrates fast\ninference speed but also the first one-stage method to achieve comparable\nperformance to two-stage methods on the challenging COCO benchmark.",

Nevertheless, due to\nvarious special challenges in UAV tracking, \\textit{e.g.}, severe occlusion,\nand fast motion, most existing Siamese-based trackers hardly combine superior\nperformance with high efficiency. To this concern, in this paper, a novel\nattentional Siamese tracker (SiamAPN++) is proposed for real-time UAV tracking.\nBy virtue of the attention mechanism, the attentional aggregation network (AAN)\nis conducted with self-AAN and cross-AAN, raising the expression ability of\nfeatures eventually. The former AAN aggregates and models the self-semantic\ninterdependencies of the single feature map via spatial and channel dimensions.\nThe latter aims to aggregate the cross-interdependencies of different semantic\nfeatures including the location information of anchors. In addition, the dual\nfeatures version of the anchor proposal network is proposed to raise the\nrobustness of proposing anchors, increasing the perception ability to objects\nwith various scales. Experiments on two well-known authoritative benchmarks are\nconducted, where SiamAPN++ outperforms its baseline SiamAPN and other SOTA\ntrackers.

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation is useful in medical image segmentation.\nParticularly, when ground truths of the target images are not available, domain\nadaptation can train a target-specific model by utilizing the existing labeled\nimages from other modalities. Most of the reported works mapped images of both\nthe source and target domains into a common latent feature space, and then\nreduced their discrepancy either implicitly with adversarial training or\nexplicitly by directly minimizing a discrepancy metric. In this work, we\npropose a new framework, where the latent features of both domains are driven\ntowards a common and parameterized variational form, whose conditional\ndistribution given the image is Gaussian. This is achieved by two networks\nbased on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and a regularization for this\nvariational approximation. Both of the VAEs, each for one domain, contain a\nsegmentation module, where the source segmentation is trained in a supervised\nmanner, while the target one is trained unsupervisedly. We validated the\nproposed domain adaptation method using two cardiac segmentation tasks, i.e.,\nthe cross-modality (CT and MR) whole heart segmentation and the cross-sequence\ncardiac MR segmentation. Results show that the proposed method achieved better\naccuracies compared to two state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrated good\npotential for cardiac segmentation. Furthermore, the proposed explicit\nregularization was shown to be effective and efficient in narrowing down the\ndistribution gap between domains, which is useful for unsupervised domain\nadaptation.

          "description": "This paper presents an end-to-end semi-supervised object detection approach,\nin contrast to previous more complex multi-stage methods. The end-to-end\ntraining gradually improves pseudo label qualities during the curriculum, and\nthe more and more accurate pseudo labels in turn benefit object detection\ntraining. We also propose two simple yet effective techniques within this\nframework: a soft teacher mechanism where the classification loss of each\nunlabeled bounding box is weighed by the classification score produced by the\nteacher network; a box jittering approach to select reliable pseudo boxes for\nthe learning of box regression. On COCO benchmark, the proposed approach\noutperforms previous methods by a large margin under various labeling ratios,\ni.e. 1\\%, 5\\% and 10\\%. Moreover, our approach proves to perform also well when\nthe amount of labeled data is relatively large. For example, it can improve a\n40.9 mAP baseline detector trained using the full COCO training set by +3.6\nmAP, reaching 44.5 mAP, by leveraging the 123K unlabeled images of COCO. On the\nstate-of-the-art Swin Transformer-based object detector (58.9 mAP on test-dev),\nit can still significantly improve the detection accuracy by +1.5 mAP, reaching\n60.4 mAP, and improve the instance segmentation accuracy by +1.2 mAP, reaching\n52.4 mAP, pushing the new state-of-the-art.",

However, automatic LA segmentation from LGE MRI is\nstill challenging, due to the poor image quality, high variability in LA\nshapes, and unclear LA boundary. Though deep learning-based methods can provide\npromising LA segmentation results, they often generalize poorly to unseen\ndomains, such as data from different scanners and/or sites. In this work, we\ncollect 210 LGE MRIs from different centers with different levels of image\nquality. To evaluate the domain generalization ability of models on the LA\nsegmentation task, we employ four commonly used semantic segmentation networks\nfor the LA segmentation from multi-center LGE MRIs.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach of\nCompositional Counterfactual Contrastive Learning ($C^3$) to develop\ncontrastive training between factual and counterfactual samples in\nvideo-grounded dialogues.

Different from prior approaches, we focus on contrastive hidden state\nrepresentations among compositional output tokens to optimize the\nrepresentation space in a generation setting.

Incorrect clouds forecasts can lead to\nmajor uncertainty in the overall accuracy of weather forecasts due to their\nintrinsic role in the Earth's climate system. Few studies have tackled this\nchallenging problem from a machine learning point-of-view due to a shortage of\nhigh-resolution datasets with many historical observations globally. In this\npaper, we present a novel satellite-based dataset called ``CloudCast''. It\nconsists of 70,080 images with 10 different cloud types for multiple layers of\nthe atmosphere annotated on a pixel level. The spatial resolution of the\ndataset is 928 x 1530 pixels (3x3 km per pixel) with 15-min intervals between\nframes for the period 2017-01-01 to 2018-12-31. All frames are centered and\nprojected over Europe. To supplement the dataset, we conduct an evaluation\nstudy with current state-of-the-art video prediction methods such as\nconvolutional long short-term memory networks, generative adversarial networks,\nand optical flow-based extrapolation methods. As the evaluation of video\nprediction is difficult in practice, we aim for a thorough evaluation in the\nspatial and temporal domain.

While a plethora of generative models\nfor predicting the future frame pixel values given the past few frames exist,\nthe quantitative evaluation of the predicted frames has been found to be\nextremely challenging. In this context, we introduce the problem of naturalness\nevaluation, which refers to how natural or realistic a predicted video looks.\nWe create the Indian Institute of Science VIdeo Naturalness Evaluation (IISc\nVINE) Database consisting of 300 videos, obtained by applying different\nprediction models on different datasets, and accompanying human opinion scores.\nWe collected subjective ratings of naturalness from 50 human participants for\nthese videos. Our subjective study reveals that human observers were highly\nconsistent in their judgments of naturalness. We benchmark several popularly\nused measures for evaluating video prediction and show that they do not\nadequately correlate with these subjective scores. We introduce two new\nfeatures to effectively capture naturalness, motion-compensated cosine\nsimilarities of deep features of predicted frames with past frames, and deep\nfeatures extracted from rescaled frame differences. We show that our feature\ndesign leads to state of the art naturalness prediction in accordance with\nhuman judgments on our IISc VINE Database.

          "description": "Modern feedforward convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can now solve some\ncomputer vision tasks at super-human levels. However, these networks only\nroughly mimic human visual perception. One difference from human vision is that\nthey do not appear to perceive illusory contours (e.g. Kanizsa squares) in the\nsame way humans do. Physiological evidence from visual cortex suggests that the\nperception of illusory contours could involve feedback connections. Would\nrecurrent feedback neural networks perceive illusory contours like humans? In\nthis work we equip a deep feedforward convolutional network with brain-inspired\nrecurrent dynamics. The network was first pretrained with an unsupervised\nreconstruction objective on a natural image dataset, to expose it to natural\nobject contour statistics. Then, a classification decision layer was added and\nthe model was finetuned on a form discrimination task: squares vs. randomly\noriented inducer shapes (no illusory contour). Finally, the model was tested\nwith the unfamiliar ''illusory contour'' configuration: inducer shapes oriented\nto form an illusory square. Compared with feedforward baselines, the iterative\n''predictive coding'' feedback resulted in more illusory contours being\nclassified as physical squares. The perception of the illusory contour was\nmeasurable in the luminance profile of the image reconstructions produced by\nthe model, demonstrating that the model really ''sees'' the illusion. Ablation\nstudies revealed that natural image pretraining and feedback error correction\nare both critical to the perception of the illusion. Finally we validated our\nconclusions in a deeper network (VGG): adding the same predictive coding\nfeedback dynamics again leads to the perception of illusory contours.",

          "description": "Adversarial training, especially projected gradient descent (PGD), has been a\nsuccessful approach for improving robustness against adversarial attacks. After\nadversarial training, gradients of models with respect to their inputs have a\npreferential direction. However, the direction of alignment is not\nmathematically well established, making it difficult to evaluate\nquantitatively. We propose a novel definition of this direction as the\ndirection of the vector pointing toward the closest point of the support of the\nclosest inaccurate class in decision space. To evaluate the alignment with this\ndirection after adversarial training, we apply a metric that uses generative\nadversarial networks to produce the smallest residual needed to change the\nclass present in the image. We show that PGD-trained models have a higher\nalignment than the baseline according to our definition, that our metric\npresents higher alignment values than a competing metric formulation, and that\nenforcing this alignment increases the robustness of models.",

          "description": "Traditional supervised learning with deep neural networks requires a\ntremendous amount of labelled data to converge to a good solution. For 3D\nmedical images, it is often impractical to build a large homogeneous annotated\ndataset for a specific pathology. Self-supervised methods offer a new way to\nlearn a representation of the images in an unsupervised manner with a neural\nnetwork. In particular, contrastive learning has shown great promises by\n(almost) matching the performance of fully-supervised CNN on vision tasks.\nNonetheless, this method does not take advantage of available meta-data, such\nas participant's age, viewed as prior knowledge. Here, we propose to leverage\ncontinuous proxy metadata, in the contrastive learning framework, by\nintroducing a new loss called y-Aware InfoNCE loss. Specifically, we improve\nthe positive sampling during pre-training by adding more positive examples with\nsimilar proxy meta-data with the anchor, assuming they share similar\ndiscriminative semantic features.With our method, a 3D CNN model pre-trained on\n$10^4$ multi-site healthy brain MRI scans can extract relevant features for\nthree classification tasks: schizophrenia, bipolar diagnosis and Alzheimer's\ndetection. When fine-tuned, it also outperforms 3D CNN trained from scratch on\nthese tasks, as well as state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Our code is\nmade publicly available here.",

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a wide class of connectionist models for\ngraph processing. They perform an iterative message passing operation on each\nnode and its neighbors, to solve classification/ clustering tasks --- on some\nnodes or on the whole graph --- collecting all such messages, regardless of\ntheir order. Despite the differences among the various models belonging to this\nclass, most of them adopt the same computation scheme, based on a local\naggregation mechanism and, intuitively, the local computation framework is\nmainly responsible for the expressive power of GNNs. In this paper, we prove\nthat the Weisfeiler--Lehman test induces an equivalence relationship on the\ngraph nodes that exactly corresponds to the unfolding equivalence, defined on\nthe original GNN model. Therefore, the results on the expressive power of the\noriginal GNNs can be extended to general GNNs which, under mild conditions, can\nbe proved capable of approximating, in probability and up to any precision, any\nfunction on graphs that respects the unfolding equivalence.",

          "description": "User data confidentiality protection is becoming a rising challenge in the\npresent deep learning research. Without access to data, conventional\ndata-driven model compression faces a higher risk of performance degradation.\nRecently, some works propose to generate images from a specific pretrained\nmodel to serve as training data. However, the inversion process only utilizes\nbiased feature statistics stored in one model and is from low-dimension to\nhigh-dimension. As a consequence, it inevitably encounters the difficulties of\ngeneralizability and inexact inversion, which leads to unsatisfactory\nperformance. To address these problems, we propose MixMix based on two simple\nyet effective techniques: (1) Feature Mixing: utilizes various models to\nconstruct a universal feature space for generalized inversion; (2) Data Mixing:\nmixes the synthesized images and labels to generate exact label information. We\nprove the effectiveness of MixMix from both theoretical and empirical\nperspectives. Extensive experiments show that MixMix outperforms existing\nmethods on the mainstream compression tasks, including quantization, knowledge\ndistillation, and pruning.

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks for visual recognition require large amounts of\ntraining samples and usually benefit from data augmentation. This paper\nproposes PatchMix, a data augmentation method that creates new samples by\ncomposing patches from pairs of images in a grid-like pattern. These new\nsamples' ground truth labels are set as proportional to the number of patches\nfrom each image. We then add a set of additional losses at the patch-level to\nregularize and to encourage good representations at both the patch and image\nlevels. A ResNet-50 model trained on ImageNet using PatchMix exhibits superior\ntransfer learning capabilities across a wide array of benchmarks. Although\nPatchMix can rely on random pairings and random grid-like patterns for mixing,\nwe explore evolutionary search as a guiding strategy to discover optimal\ngrid-like patterns and image pairing jointly. For this purpose, we conceive a\nfitness function that bypasses the need to re-train a model to evaluate each\nchoice. In this way, PatchMix outperforms a base model on CIFAR-10 (+1.91),\nCIFAR-100 (+5.31), Tiny Imagenet (+3.52), and ImageNet (+1.16) by significant\nmargins, also outperforming previous state-of-the-art pairwise augmentation\nstrategies.",

Here, we prove rigorously that, indeed,\nthe Bayes-optimal prediction and inference of randomly but continuously\ntransforming environments, a common natural setting, relies on short-term\nspike-timing-dependent plasticity, a hallmark of biological synapses. Further,\nthis dynamic Bayesian inference through plasticity enables circuits of the\ncerebral cortex in simulations to recognize previously unseen, highly distorted\ndynamic stimuli. Strikingly, this also introduces a biologically-modelled AI,\nthe first to overcome multiple limitations of deep learning and outperform\nartificial neural networks in a visual task. The cortical-like network is\nspiking and event-based, trained only with unsupervised and local plasticity,\non a small, narrow, and static training dataset, but achieves recognition of\nunseen, transformed, and dynamic data better than deep neural networks with\ncontinuous activations, trained with supervised backpropagation on the\ntransforming data. These results link short-term plasticity to high-level\ncortical function, suggest optimality of natural intelligence for natural\nenvironments, and repurpose neuromorphic AI from mere efficiency to\ncomputational supremacy altogether.",

          "description": "Adversarial training has been the topic of dozens of studies and a leading\nmethod for defending against adversarial attacks. Yet, it remains largely\nunknown (a) how adversarially-robust ImageNet classifiers (R classifiers)\ngeneralize to out-of-distribution examples; and (b) how their generalization\ncapability relates to their hidden representations. In this paper, we perform a\nthorough, systematic study to answer these two questions across AlexNet,\nGoogLeNet, and ResNet-50 architectures. We found that while standard ImageNet\nclassifiers have a strong texture bias, their R counterparts rely heavily on\nshapes. Remarkably, adversarial training induces three simplicity biases into\nhidden neurons in the process of 'robustifying' the network. That is, each\nconvolutional neuron in R networks often changes to detecting (1) pixel-wise\nsmoother patterns i.e. a mechanism that blocks high-frequency noise from\npassing through the network; (2) more lower-level features i.e. textures and\ncolors (instead of objects); and (3) fewer types of inputs. Our findings reveal\nthe interesting mechanisms that made networks more adversarially robust and\nalso explain some recent findings. Our findings reveal the interesting\nmechanisms that made networks more adversarially robust and also explain some\nrecent findings e.g. why R networks benefit from much larger capacity (Xie and\nYuille, 2020) and can act as a strong image prior in image synthesis (Santurkar\net al., 2019).",

          "description": "Training sparse networks to converge to the same performance as dense neural\narchitectures has proven to be elusive. Recent work suggests that\ninitialization is the key. However, while this direction of research has had\nsome success, focusing on initialization alone appears to be inadequate. In\nthis paper, we take a broader view of training sparse networks and consider the\nrole of regularization, optimization, and architecture choices on sparse\nmodels. We propose a simple experimental framework, Same Capacity Sparse vs\nDense Comparison (SC-SDC), that allows for a fair comparison of sparse and\ndense networks. Furthermore, we propose a new measure of gradient flow,\nEffective Gradient Flow (EGF), that better correlates to performance in sparse\nnetworks. Using top-line metrics, SC-SDC and EGF, we show that default choices\nof optimizers, activation functions and regularizers used for dense networks\ncan disadvantage sparse networks. Based upon these findings, we show that\ngradient flow in sparse networks can be improved by reconsidering aspects of\nthe architecture design and the training regime. Our work suggests that\ninitialization is only one piece of the puzzle and taking a wider view of\ntailoring optimization to sparse networks yields promising results.",

          "description": "Using generative models to synthesize visual features from semantic\ndistribution is one of the most popular solutions to ZSL image classification\nin recent years. The triplet loss (TL) is popularly used to generate realistic\nvisual distributions from semantics by automatically searching discriminative\nrepresentations. However, the traditional TL cannot search reliable unseen\ndisentangled representations due to the unavailability of unseen classes in\nZSL. To alleviate this drawback, we propose in this work a multi-modal triplet\nloss (MMTL) which utilizes multimodal information to search a disentangled\nrepresentation space. As such, all classes can interplay which can benefit\nlearning disentangled class representations in the searched space. Furthermore,\nwe develop a novel model called Disentangling Class Representation Generative\nAdversarial Network (DCR-GAN) focusing on exploiting the disentangled\nrepresentations in training, feature synthesis, and final recognition stages.\nBenefiting from the disentangled representations, DCR-GAN could fit a more\nrealistic distribution over both seen and unseen features.

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged with increasing popularity to collaborate\ndistributed medical institutions for training deep networks. However, despite\nexisting FL algorithms only allow the supervised training setting, most\nhospitals in realistic usually cannot afford the intricate data labeling due to\nabsence of budget or expertise. This paper studies a practical yet challenging\nFL problem, named \\textit{Federated Semi-supervised Learning} (FSSL), which\naims to learn a federated model by jointly utilizing the data from both labeled\nand unlabeled clients (i.e., hospitals). We present a novel approach for this\nproblem, which improves over traditional consistency regularization mechanism\nwith a new inter-client relation matching scheme. The proposed learning scheme\nexplicitly connects the learning across labeled and unlabeled clients by\naligning their extracted disease relationships, thereby mitigating the\ndeficiency of task knowledge at unlabeled clients and promoting discriminative\ninformation from unlabeled samples. We validate our method on two large-scale\nmedical image classification datasets. The effectiveness of our method has been\ndemonstrated with the clear improvements over state-of-the-arts as well as the\nthorough ablation analysis on both tasks\\footnote{Code will be made available\nat \\url{https://github.com/liuquande/FedIRM}}.",

          "description": "Anomaly detection has attracted considerable search attention. However,\nexisting anomaly detection databases encounter two major problems. Firstly,\nthey are limited in scale. Secondly, training sets contain only video-level\nlabels indicating the existence of an abnormal event during the full video\nwhile lacking annotations of precise time durations. To tackle these problems,\nwe contribute a new Large-scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) database as the\nbenchmark for anomaly detection in video sequences, which is featured in two\naspects. 1) It contains 2000 video sequences including normal and abnormal\nvideo clips with 14 anomaly categories including crash, fire, violence, etc.\nwith large scene varieties, making it the largest anomaly analysis database to\ndate. 2) It provides the annotation data, including video-level labels\n(abnormal/normal video, anomaly type) and frame-level labels (abnormal/normal\nvideo frame) to facilitate anomaly detection. Leveraging the above benefits\nfrom the LAD database, we further formulate anomaly detection as a\nfully-supervised learning problem and propose a multi-task deep neural network\nto solve it. We first obtain the local spatiotemporal contextual feature by\nusing an Inflated 3D convolutional (I3D) network. Then we construct a recurrent\nconvolutional neural network fed the local spatiotemporal contextual feature to\nextract the spatiotemporal contextual feature. With the global spatiotemporal\ncontextual feature, the anomaly type and score can be computed simultaneously\nby a multi-task neural network. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods on our\ndatabase and other public databases of anomaly detection.

One\nnotable application of GANs is developing fake human faces, also known as \"deep\nfakes,\" due to the deep learning algorithms at the core of the GAN framework.\nMeasuring the quality of the generated images is inherently subjective but\nattempts to objectify quality using standardized metrics have been made. One\nexample of objective metrics is the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), which\nmeasures the difference between distributions of feature vectors for two\nseparate datasets of images. There are situations that images with low\nperceptual qualities are not assigned appropriate FID scores. We propose to\nimprove the robustness of the evaluation process by integrating lower-level\nfeatures to cover a wider array of visual defects.

          "description": "We demonstrate that frequently appearing objects can be discovered by\ntraining randomly sampled patches from a small number of images (100 to 200) by\nself-supervision. Key to this approach is the pattern space, a latent space of\npatterns that represents all possible sub-images of the given image data. The\ndistance structure in the pattern space captures the co-occurrence of patterns\ndue to the frequent objects. The pattern space embedding is learned by\nminimizing the contrastive loss between randomly generated adjacent patches. To\nprevent the embedding from learning the background, we modulate the contrastive\nloss by color-based object saliency and background dissimilarity. The learned\ndistance structure serves as object memory, and the frequent objects are simply\ndiscovered by clustering the pattern vectors from the random patches sampled\nfor inference. Our image representation based on image patches naturally\nhandles the position and scale invariance property that is crucial to\nmulti-object discovery.

          "description": "Deep learning-based multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MUDA) has\nbeen actively studied in recent years. Compared with single-source unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (SUDA), domain shift in MUDA exists not only between the\nsource and target domains but also among multiple source domains. Most existing\nMUDA algorithms focus on extracting domain-invariant representations among all\ndomains whereas the task-specific decision boundaries among classes are largely\nneglected. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable network that\nexploits domain Consistency Regularization for unsupervised Multi-source domain\nAdaptive classification (CRMA). CRMA aligns not only the distributions of each\npair of source and target domains but also that of all domains. For each pair\nof source and target domains, we employ an intra-domain consistency to\nregularize a pair of domain-specific classifiers to achieve intra-domain\nalignment. In addition, we design an inter-domain consistency that targets\njoint inter-domain alignment among all domains. To address different\nsimilarities between multiple source domains and the target domain, we design\nan authorization strategy that assigns different authorities to domain-specific\nclassifiers adaptively for optimal pseudo label prediction and self-training.\nExtensive experiments show that CRMA tackles unsupervised domain adaptation\neffectively under a multi-source setup and achieves superior adaptation\nconsistently across multiple MUDA datasets.",

          "description": "Visual analytics have played an increasingly critical role in the Internet of\nThings, where massive visual signals have to be compressed and fed into\nmachines. But facing such big data and constrained bandwidth capacity, existing\nimage/video compression methods lead to very low-quality representations, while\nexisting feature compression techniques fail to support diversified visual\nanalytics applications/tasks with low-bit-rate representations. In this paper,\nwe raise and study the novel problem of supporting multiple machine vision\nanalytics tasks with the compressed visual representation, namely, the\ninformation compression problem in analytics taxonomy. By utilizing the\nintrinsic transferability among different tasks, our framework successfully\nconstructs compact and expressive representations at low bit-rates to support a\ndiversified set of machine vision tasks, including both high-level\nsemantic-related tasks and mid-level geometry analytic tasks. In order to\nimpose compactness in the representations, we propose a codebook-based\nhyperprior, which helps map the representation into a low-dimensional manifold.\nAs it well fits the signal structure of the deep visual feature, it facilitates\nmore accurate entropy estimation, and results in higher compression efficiency.\nWith the proposed framework and the codebook-based hyperprior, we further\ninvestigate the relationship of different task features owning different levels\nof abstraction granularity. Experimental results demonstrate that with the\nproposed scheme, a set of diversified tasks can be supported at a significantly\nlower bit-rate, compared with existing compression schemes.",

          "description": "The integrated positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging\n(PET/MRI) scanner facilitates the simultaneous acquisition of metabolic\ninformation via PET and morphological information with high soft-tissue\ncontrast using MRI. Although PET/MRI facilitates the capture of high-accuracy\nfusion images, its major drawback can be attributed to the difficulty\nencountered when performing attenuation correction, which is necessary for\nquantitative PET evaluation. The combined PET/MRI scanning requires the\ngeneration of attenuation-correction maps from MRI owing to no direct\nrelationship between the gamma-ray attenuation information and MRIs. While\nMRI-based bone-tissue segmentation can be readily performed for the head and\npelvis regions, the realization of accurate bone segmentation via chest CT\ngeneration remains a challenging task. This can be attributed to the\nrespiratory and cardiac motions occurring in the chest as well as its\nanatomically complicated structure and relatively thin bone cortex. This paper\npresents a means to minimise the anatomical structural changes without human\nannotation by adding structural constraints using a modality-independent\nneighbourhood descriptor (MIND) to a generative adversarial network (GAN) that\ncan transform unpaired images. The results obtained in this study revealed the\nproposed U-GAT-IT + MIND approach to outperform all other competing approaches.\nThe findings of this study hint towards possibility of synthesising clinically\nacceptable CT images from chest MRI without human annotation, thereby\nminimising the changes in the anatomical structure.",

Furthermore, the\nquality of learned representations is known to be heavily influenced by the\nsize and taxonomy of the curated datasets used for self-supervised training.\nThis begs the question of whether we are celebrating too early on catching up\nwith supervised learning when our self-supervised efforts still rely almost\nexclusively on curated data. In this paper, we study the efficacy of learning\nfrom Movies and TV Shows as forms of uncurated data for audio-visual\nself-supervised learning. We demonstrate that a simple model based on\ncontrastive learning, trained on a collection of movies and TV shows, not only\ndramatically outperforms more complex methods which are trained on orders of\nmagnitude larger uncurated datasets, but also performs very competitively with\nthe state-of-the-art that learns from large-scale curated data. We identify\nthat audiovisual patterns like the appearance of the main character or\nprominent scenes and mise-en-sc\\`ene which frequently occur through the whole\nduration of a movie, lead to an overabundance of easy negative instances in the\ncontrastive learning formulation.

          "description": "Learning-based stereo matching and depth estimation networks currently excel\non public benchmarks with impressive results. However, state-of-the-art\nnetworks often fail to generalize from synthetic imagery to more challenging\nreal data domains. This paper is an attempt to uncover hidden secrets of\nachieving domain robustness and in particular, discovering the important\ningredients of generalization success of stereo matching networks by analyzing\nthe effect of synthetic image learning on real data performance. We provide\nevidence that demonstrates that learning of features in the synthetic domain by\na stereo matching network is heavily influenced by two \"shortcuts\" presented in\nthe synthetic data: (1) identical local statistics (RGB colour features)\nbetween matching pixels in the synthetic stereo images and (2) lack of realism\nin synthetic textures on 3D objects simulated in game engines. We will show\nthat by removing such shortcuts, we can achieve domain robustness in the\nstate-of-the-art stereo matching frameworks and produce a remarkable\nperformance on multiple realistic datasets, despite the fact that the networks\nwere trained on synthetic data, only. Our experimental results point to the\nfact that eliminating shortcuts from the synthetic data is key to achieve\ndomain-invariant generalization between synthetic and real data domains.",

          "description": "In this work, we seek new insights into the underlying challenges of the\nScene Graph Generation (SGG) task. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the\nVisual Genome dataset implies -- 1) Ambiguity: even if inter-object\nrelationship contains the same object (or predicate), they may not be visually\nor semantically similar, 2) Asymmetry: despite the nature of the relationship\nthat embodied the direction, it was not well addressed in previous studies, and\n3) Higher-order contexts: leveraging the identities of certain graph elements\ncan help to generate accurate scene graphs. Motivated by the analysis, we\ndesign a novel SGG framework, Local-to-Global Interaction Networks (LOGIN).\nLocally, interactions extract the essence between three instances - subject,\nobject, and background - while baking direction awareness into the network by\nconstraining the input order. Globally, interactions encode the contexts\nbetween every graph components -- nodes and edges. Also we introduce Attract &\nRepel loss which finely adjusts predicate embeddings. Our framework enables\npredicting the scene graph in a local-to-global manner by design, leveraging\nthe possible complementariness. To quantify how much LOGIN is aware of\nrelational direction, we propose a new diagnostic task called Bidirectional\nRelationship Classification (BRC).

Then, we squeeze\nthe instance-level graph to generate the class-level graph, which can help\nobtain the class-level visual knowledge and facilitate modeling the relations\nof different classes. Next, the calibration module is adopted to characterize\nthe relations of the classes explicitly to obtain the more discriminative\nclass-level knowledge representations. Finally, we combine the class-level\nknowledge with the instance-level sample representations to guide the inference\nof the query samples.

          "description": "Predicting the future motion of multiple agents is necessary for planning in\ndynamic environments. This task is challenging for autonomous driving since\nagents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) and their associated behaviors may be\ndiverse and influence each other. Most prior work has focused on first\npredicting independent futures for each agent based on all past motion, and\nthen planning against these independent predictions. However, planning against\nfixed predictions can suffer from the inability to represent the future\ninteraction possibilities between different agents, leading to sub-optimal\nplanning. In this work, we formulate a model for predicting the behavior of all\nagents jointly in real-world driving environments in a unified manner. Inspired\nby recent language modeling approaches, we use a masking strategy as the query\nto our model, enabling one to invoke a single model to predict agent behavior\nin many ways, such as potentially conditioned on the goal or full future\ntrajectory of the autonomous vehicle or the behavior of other agents in the\nenvironment. Our model architecture fuses heterogeneous world state in a\nunified Transformer architecture by employing attention across road elements,\nagent interactions and time steps. We evaluate our approach on autonomous\ndriving datasets for behavior prediction, and achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance. Our work demonstrates that formulating the problem of behavior\nprediction in a unified architecture with a masking strategy may allow us to\nhave a single model that can perform multiple motion prediction and planning\nrelated tasks effectively.",

For this reason,\nit is necessary to quantify the discrepancy between simulation and reality in\norder to determine whether a certain fidelity is sufficient for a desired\nintended use.

A lot of work has been done to improve the performance of the\nnetwork, although almost always it results in increased computational\ncomplexity.

Our attention module can easily be integrated with other\nconvolutional neural networks because of its lightweight nature. The proposed\nnetwork named Dual Multi Scale Attention Network (DMSANet) is comprised of two\nparts: the first part is used to extract features at various scales and\naggregate them, the second part uses spatial and channel attention modules in\nparallel to adaptively integrate local features with their global dependencies.\nWe benchmark our network performance for Image Classification on ImageNet\ndataset, Object Detection and Instance Segmentation both on MS COCO dataset.",

          "description": "Generation of stroke-based non-photorealistic imagery, is an important\nproblem in the computer vision community. As an endeavor in this direction,\nsubstantial recent research efforts have been focused on teaching machines \"how\nto paint\", in a manner similar to a human painter. However, the applicability\nof previous methods has been limited to datasets with little variation in\nposition, scale and saliency of the foreground object. As a consequence, we\nfind that these methods struggle to cover the granularity and diversity\npossessed by real world images. To this end, we propose a Semantic Guidance\npipeline with 1) a bi-level painting procedure for learning the distinction\nbetween foreground and background brush strokes at training time. 2) We also\nintroduce invariance to the position and scale of the foreground object through\na neural alignment model, which combines object localization and spatial\ntransformer networks in an end to end manner, to zoom into a particular\nsemantic instance. 3) The distinguishing features of the in-focus object are\nthen amplified by maximizing a novel guided backpropagation based focus reward.\nThe proposed agent does not require any supervision on human stroke-data and\nsuccessfully handles variations in foreground object attributes, thus,\nproducing much higher quality canvases for the CUB-200 Birds and Stanford\nCars-196 datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the further efficacy of our method\non complex datasets with multiple foreground object instances by evaluating an\nextension of our method on the challenging Virtual-KITTI dataset.

MRI is the prevalent medical imaging practice to find\nabnormalities in soft tissues. Traditionally they are analyzed by a radiologist\nto detect abnormalities in soft tissues, especially the brain. The process of\ninterpreting a massive volume of patient's MRI is laborious. Hence, the use of\nMachine Learning methodologies can aid in detecting abnormalities in soft\ntissues with considerable accuracy. In this research, we have curated a novel\ndataset and developed a framework that uses Deep Transfer Learning to perform a\nmulti-classification of tumors in the brain MRI images. In this paper, we\nadopted the Deep Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet50) architecture\nfor the experiments along with discriminative learning techniques to train the\nmodel. Using the novel dataset and two publicly available MRI brain datasets,\nthis proposed approach attained a classification accuracy of 86.40% on the\ncurated dataset, 93.80% on the Harvard Whole Brain Atlas dataset, and 97.05%\naccuracy on the School of Biomedical Engineering dataset.

To combat\nsuch misalignment, we propose a novel multi-part loss function inspired by the\nknowledge-distillation literature. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across different compression\nalgorithms, architectures, tasks as well as datasets. In particular, we obtain\nup to $4.1\\times$ reduction in the number of prediction mismatches between the\ncompressed and reference models, and up to $5.7\\times$ in cases where the\nreference model makes the correct prediction; all while making no changes to\nthe compression algorithm, and minor modifications to the loss function.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate how inducing simple alignment between the\npredictions of the models naturally improves the alignment on other metrics\nincluding fairness and attributions.

Despite recent interest in machine agents that reason\nabout other agents, it is not clear if such agents learn or hold the core\npsychology principles that drive human reasoning. Inspired by cognitive\ndevelopment studies on intuitive psychology, we present a benchmark consisting\nof a large dataset of procedurally generated 3D animations, AGENT (Action,\nGoal, Efficiency, coNstraint, uTility), structured around four scenarios (goal\npreferences, action efficiency, unobserved constraints, and cost-reward\ntrade-offs) that probe key concepts of core intuitive psychology. We validate\nAGENT with human-ratings, propose an evaluation protocol emphasizing\ngeneralization, and compare two strong baselines built on Bayesian inverse\nplanning and a Theory of Mind neural network.

However, such a pruning\npolicy often leads to excessive reduction of that dimension, thus inducing a\nhuge accuracy loss. To alleviate this issue, we argue that pruning should be\nconducted along three dimensions comprehensively. For this purpose, our pruning\nframework formulates pruning as an optimization problem. Specifically, it first\ncasts the relationships between a certain model's accuracy and\ndepth/width/resolution into a polynomial regression and then maximizes the\npolynomial to acquire the optimal values for the three dimensions. Finally, the\nmodel is pruned along the three optimal dimensions accordingly. In this\nframework, since collecting too much data for training the regression is very\ntime-costly, we propose two approaches to lower the cost: 1) specializing the\npolynomial to ensure an accurate regression even with less training data; 2)\nemploying iterative pruning and fine-tuning to collect the data faster.\nExtensive experiments show that our proposed algorithm surpasses\nstate-of-the-art pruning algorithms and even neural architecture search-based\nalgorithms.",

          "description": "Though network sparsity emerges as a promising direction to overcome the\ndrastically increasing size of neural networks, it remains an open problem to\nconcurrently maintain model accuracy as well as achieve significant speedups on\ngeneral CPUs. In this paper, we propose one novel concept of $1\\times N$ block\nsparsity pattern (block pruning) to break this limitation. In particular,\nconsecutive $N$ output kernels with the same input channel index are grouped\ninto one block, which serves as a basic pruning granularity of our pruning\npattern. Our $1 \\times N$ sparsity pattern prunes these blocks considered\nunimportant. We also provide a workflow of filter rearrangement that first\nrearranges the weight matrix in the output channel dimension to derive more\ninfluential blocks for accuracy improvements, and then applies similar\nrearrangement to the next-layer weights in the input channel dimension to\nensure correct convolutional operations. Moreover, the output computation after\nour $1 \\times N$ block sparsity can be realized via a parallelized block-wise\nvectorized operation, leading to significant speedups on general CPUs-based\nplatforms. The efficacy of our pruning pattern is proved with experiments on\nILSVRC-2012. For example, in the case of 50% sparsity and $N=4$, our pattern\nobtains about 3.0% improvements over filter pruning in the top-1 accuracy of\nMobileNet-V2. Meanwhile, it obtains 56.04ms inference savings on Cortex-A7 CPU\nover weight pruning. Code is available at https://github.com/lmbxmu/1xN.",

          "description": "In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on training deep neural\nnetworks capable of state-of-the-art performance without the need for the\nexpensive over-parameterization by proposing the concept of In-Time\nOver-Parameterization (ITOP) in sparse training. By starting from a random\nsparse network and continuously exploring sparse connectivities during\ntraining, we can perform an Over-Parameterization in the space-time manifold,\nclosing the gap in the expressibility between sparse training and dense\ntraining. We further use ITOP to understand the underlying mechanism of Dynamic\nSparse Training (DST) and indicate that the benefits of DST come from its\nability to consider across time all possible parameters when searching for the\noptimal sparse connectivity. As long as there are sufficient parameters that\nhave been reliably explored during training, DST can outperform the dense\nneural network by a large margin. We present a series of experiments to support\nour conjecture and achieve the state-of-the-art sparse training performance\nwith ResNet-50 on ImageNet. More impressively, our method achieves dominant\nperformance over the overparameterization-based sparse methods at extreme\nsparsity levels.

          "description": "In the last few years, deep learning classifiers have shown promising results\nin image-based medical diagnosis. However, interpreting the outputs of these\nmodels remains a challenge. In cancer diagnosis, interpretability can be\nachieved by localizing the region of the input image responsible for the\noutput, i.e. the location of a lesion. Alternatively, segmentation or detection\nmodels can be trained with pixel-wise annotations indicating the locations of\nmalignant lesions. Unfortunately, acquiring such labels is labor-intensive and\nrequires medical expertise. To overcome this difficulty, weakly-supervised\nlocalization can be utilized. These methods allow neural network classifiers to\noutput saliency maps highlighting the regions of the input most relevant to the\nclassification task (e.g. malignant lesions in mammograms) using only\nimage-level labels (e.g. whether the patient has cancer or not) during\ntraining. When applied to high-resolution images, existing methods produce\nlow-resolution saliency maps. This is problematic in applications in which\nsuspicious lesions are small in relation to the image size. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel neural network architecture to perform weakly-supervised\nsegmentation of high-resolution images. The proposed model selects regions of\ninterest via coarse-level localization, and then performs fine-grained\nsegmentation of those regions. We apply this model to breast cancer diagnosis\nwith screening mammography, and validate it on a large clinically-realistic\ndataset. Measured by Dice similarity score, our approach outperforms existing\nmethods by a large margin in terms of localization performance of benign and\nmalignant lesions, relatively improving the performance by 39.6% and 20.0%,\nrespectively.

Pruning can be categorized as static if it is\nperformed offline or dynamic if it is performed at run-time. We compare pruning\ntechniques and describe criteria used to remove redundant computations. We\ndiscuss trade-offs in element-wise, channel-wise, shape-wise, filter-wise,\nlayer-wise and even network-wise pruning. Quantization reduces computations by\nreducing the precision of the datatype. Weights, biases, and activations may be\nquantized typically to 8-bit integers although lower bit width implementations\nare also discussed including binary neural networks. Both pruning and\nquantization can be used independently or combined. We compare current\ntechniques, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, present compressed network\naccuracy results on a number of frameworks, and provide practical guidance for\ncompressing networks.",

          "description": "Adversarial examples contain carefully crafted perturbations that can fool\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) into making wrong predictions. Enhancing the\nadversarial robustness of DNNs has gained considerable interest in recent\nyears. Although image transformation-based defenses were widely considered at\nan earlier time, most of them have been defeated by adaptive attacks. In this\npaper, we propose a new image transformation defense based on error diffusion\nhalftoning, and combine it with adversarial training to defend against\nadversarial examples. Error diffusion halftoning projects an image into a 1-bit\nspace and diffuses quantization error to neighboring pixels. This process can\nremove adversarial perturbations from a given image while maintaining\nacceptable image quality in the meantime in favor of recognition. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method is able to improve adversarial\nrobustness even under advanced adaptive attacks, while most of the other image\ntransformation-based defenses do not. We show that a proper image\ntransformation can still be an effective defense approach. Code:\nhttps://github.com/shaoyuanlo/Halftoning-Defense",

          "description": "To address the problem of data inconsistencies among different facial\nexpression recognition (FER) datasets, many cross-domain FER methods (CD-FERs)\nhave been extensively devised in recent years. Although each declares to\nachieve superior performance, fair comparisons are lacking due to the\ninconsistent choices of the source/target datasets and feature extractors. In\nthis work, we first analyze the performance effect caused by these inconsistent\nchoices, and then re-implement some well-performing CD-FER and recently\npublished domain adaptation algorithms. We ensure that all these algorithms\nadopt the same source datasets and feature extractors for fair CD-FER\nevaluations. We find that most of the current leading algorithms use\nadversarial learning to learn holistic domain-invariant features to mitigate\ndomain shifts. However, these algorithms ignore local features, which are more\ntransferable across different datasets and carry more detailed content for\nfine-grained adaptation. To address these issues, we integrate graph\nrepresentation propagation with adversarial learning for cross-domain\nholistic-local feature co-adaptation by developing a novel adversarial graph\nrepresentation adaptation (AGRA) framework. Specifically, it first builds two\ngraphs to correlate holistic and local regions within each domain and across\ndifferent domains, respectively. Then, it extracts holistic-local features from\nthe input image and uses learnable per-class statistical distributions to\ninitialize the corresponding graph nodes. Finally, two stacked graph\nconvolution networks (GCNs) are adopted to propagate holistic-local features\nwithin each domain to explore their interaction and across different domains\nfor holistic-local feature co-adaptation. We conduct extensive and fair\nevaluations on several popular benchmarks and show that the proposed AGRA\nframework outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.",

In this white\npaper, we introduce state-of-the-art algorithms for mitigating the impact of\nquantization noise on the network's performance while maintaining low-bit\nweights and activations. We start with a hardware motivated introduction to\nquantization and then consider two main classes of algorithms: Post-Training\nQuantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware-Training (QAT). PTQ requires no\nre-training or labelled data and is thus a lightweight push-button approach to\nquantization. In most cases, PTQ is sufficient for achieving 8-bit quantization\nwith close to floating-point accuracy. QAT requires fine-tuning and access to\nlabeled training data but enables lower bit quantization with competitive\nresults.

To better relive the elapsed frozen moments, in\nthis paper, we present a deep exemplar-based image colorization approach named\nColor2Style to resurrect these grayscale image media by filling them with\nvibrant colors. Generally, for exemplar-based colorization, unsupervised and\nunpaired training are usually adopted, due to the difficulty of obtaining input\nand ground truth image pairs. To train an exemplar-based colorization model,\ncurrent algorithms usually strive to achieve two procedures: i) retrieving a\nlarge number of reference images with high similarity in advance, which is\ninevitably time-consuming and tedious; ii) designing complicated modules to\ntransfer the colors of the reference image to the grayscale image, by\ncalculating and leveraging the deep semantic correspondence between them (e.g.,\nnon-local operation). Contrary to the previous methods, we solve and simplify\nthe above two steps in one end-to-end learning procedure. First, we adopt a\nself-augmented self-reference training scheme, where the reference image is\ngenerated by graphical transformations from the original colorful one whereby\nthe training can be formulated in a paired manner. Second, instead of computing\ncomplex and inexplicable correspondence maps, our method exploits a simple yet\neffective deep feature modulation (DFM) module, which injects the color\nembeddings extracted from the reference image into the deep representations of\nthe input grayscale image. Such design is much more lightweight and\nintelligible, achieving appealing performance with real-time processing speed.\nMoreover, our model does not require multifarious loss functions and\nregularization terms like existing methods, but only two widely used loss\nfunctions.

          "description": "In recent years the ubiquitous deployment of AI has posed great concerns in\nregards to algorithmic bias, discrimination, and fairness. Compared to\ntraditional forms of bias or discrimination caused by humans, algorithmic bias\ngenerated by AI is more abstract and unintuitive therefore more difficult to\nexplain and mitigate. A clear gap exists in the current literature on\nevaluating and mitigating bias in pruned neural networks. In this work, we\nstrive to tackle the challenging issues of evaluating, mitigating, and\nexplaining induced bias in pruned neural networks. Our paper makes three\ncontributions. First, we propose two simple yet effective metrics, Combined\nError Variance (CEV) and Symmetric Distance Error (SDE), to quantitatively\nevaluate the induced bias prevention quality of pruned models. Second, we\ndemonstrate that knowledge distillation can mitigate induced bias in pruned\nneural networks, even with unbalanced datasets. Third, we reveal that model\nsimilarity has strong correlations with pruning induced bias, which provides a\npowerful method to explain why bias occurs in pruned neural networks.

          "description": "Nowadays, subsurface salt body localization and delineation, also called\nsemantic segmentation of salt bodies, are among the most challenging\ngeophysicist tasks. Thus, identifying large salt bodies is notoriously tricky\nand is crucial for identifying hydrocarbon reservoirs and drill path planning.\nThis work proposes a Data Augmentation method based on training two generative\nmodels to augment the number of samples in a seismic image dataset for the\nsemantic segmentation of salt bodies. Our method uses deep learning models to\ngenerate pairs of seismic image patches and their respective salt masks for the\nData Augmentation. The first model is a Variational Autoencoder and is\nresponsible for generating patches of salt body masks. The second is a\nConditional Normalizing Flow model, which receives the generated masks as\ninputs and generates the associated seismic image patches. We evaluate the\nproposed method by comparing the performance of ten distinct state-of-the-art\nmodels for semantic segmentation, trained with and without the generated\naugmentations, in a dataset from two synthetic seismic images. The proposed\nmethodology yields an average improvement of 8.57% in the IoU metric across all\ncompared models. The best result is achieved by a DeeplabV3+ model variant,\nwhich presents an IoU score of 95.17% when trained with our augmentations.\nAdditionally, our proposal outperformed six selected data augmentation methods,\nand the most significant improvement in the comparison, of 9.77%, is achieved\nby composing our DA with augmentations from an elastic transformation. At last,\nwe show that the proposed method is adaptable for a larger context size by\nachieving results comparable to the obtained on the smaller context size.",

As a\nsolution, we propose OLVA, a novel and lightweight unsupervised domain\nadaptation method based on a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and Optimal\nTransport (OT) theory. Thanks to the VAE, our model learns a shared\ncross-domain latent space that follows a normal distribution, which reduces the\ndomain shift. To guarantee valid segmentations, our shared latent space is\ndesigned to model the shape rather than the intensity variations. We further\nrely on an OT loss to match and align the remaining discrepancy between the two\ndomains in the latent space. We demonstrate OLVA's effectiveness for the\nsegmentation of multiple cardiac structures on the public Multi-Modality Whole\nHeart Segmentation (MM-WHS) dataset, where the source domain consists of\nannotated 3D MR images and the unlabelled target domain of 3D CTs.

          "description": "Compressing Deep Neural Network (DNN) models to alleviate the storage and\ncomputation requirements is essential for practical applications, especially\nfor resource limited devices. Although capable of reducing a reasonable amount\nof model parameters, previous unstructured or structured weight pruning methods\ncan hardly truly accelerate inference, either due to the poor hardware\ncompatibility of the unstructured sparsity or due to the low sparse rate of the\nstructurally pruned network. Aiming at reducing both storage and computation,\nas well as preserving the original task performance, we propose a generalized\nweight unification framework at a hardware compatible micro-structured level to\nachieve high amount of compression and acceleration. Weight coefficients of a\nselected micro-structured block are unified to reduce the storage and\ncomputation of the block without changing the neuron connections, which turns\nto a micro-structured pruning special case when all unified coefficients are\nset to zero, where neuron connections (hence storage and computation) are\ncompletely removed. In addition, we developed an effective training framework\nbased on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which converts\nour complex constrained optimization into separately solvable subproblems.\nThrough iteratively optimizing the subproblems, the desired micro-structure can\nbe ensured with high compression ratio and low performance degradation.

Providing a method to generate thermal faces from visible\nimages would be highly valuable for the telemedicine community in order to show\nthis medical information. To the best of our knowledge, there are limited works\non visible-to-thermal (VT) face translation, and many current works go the\nopposite direction to generate visible faces from thermal surveillance images\n(TV) for law enforcement applications. As a result, we introduce favtGAN, a VT\nGAN which uses the pix2pix image translation model with an auxiliary sensor\nlabel prediction network for generating thermal faces from visible images.\nSince most TV methods are trained on only one data source drawn from one\nthermal sensor, we combine datasets from faces and cityscapes. These combined\ndata are captured from similar sensors in order to bootstrap the training and\ntransfer learning task, especially valuable because visible-thermal face\ndatasets are limited.

          "description": "Many meta-learning methods are proposed for few-shot detection. However,\nprevious most methods have two main problems, poor detection APs, and strong\nbias because of imbalance and insufficient datasets. Previous works mainly\nalleviate these issues by additional datasets, multi-relation attention\nmechanisms and sub-modules. However, they require more cost. In this work, for\nmeta-learning, we find that the main challenges focus on related or irrelevant\nsemantic features between categories. Therefore, based on semantic features, we\npropose a Top-C classification loss (i.e., TCL-C) for classification task and a\ncategory-based grouping mechanism for category-based meta-features obtained by\nthe meta-model. The TCL-C exploits the true-label prediction and the most\nlikely C-1 false classification predictions to improve detection performance on\nfew-shot classes. According to similar appearance (i.e., visual appearance,\nshape, and limbs etc.) and environment in which objects often appear, the\ncategory-based grouping mechanism splits categories into disjoint groups to\nmake similar semantic features more compact between categories within a group\nand obtain more significant difference between groups, alleviating the strong\nbias problem and further improving detection APs. The whole training consists\nof the base model and the fine-tuning phases. According to grouping mechanism,\nwe group the meta-features vectors obtained by meta-model, so that the\ndistribution difference between groups is obvious, and the one within each\ngroup is less. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC dataset demonstrate that\nours which combines the TCL-C with category-based grouping significantly\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for few-shot detection. Compared\nwith previous competitive baseline, ours improves detection APs by almost 4%\nfor few-shot detection.",

          "description": "In order to apply Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to historical printings\nof Latin script fully automatically, we report on our efforts to construct a\nwidely-applicable polyfont recognition model yielding text with a Character\nError Rate (CER) around 2% when applied out-of-the-box. Moreover, we show how\nthis model can be further finetuned to specific classes of printings with\nlittle manual and computational effort. The mixed or polyfont model is trained\non a wide variety of materials, in terms of age (from the 15th to the 19th\ncentury), typography (various types of Fraktur and Antiqua), and languages\n(among others, German, Latin, and French). To optimize the results we combined\nestablished techniques of OCR training like pretraining, data augmentation, and\nvoting. In addition, we used various preprocessing methods to enrich the\ntraining data and obtain more robust models. We also implemented a two-stage\napproach which first trains on all available, considerably unbalanced data and\nthen refines the output by training on a selected more balanced subset.\nEvaluations on 29 previously unseen books resulted in a CER of 1.73%,\noutperforming a widely used standard model with a CER of 2.84% by almost 40%.\nTraining a more specialized model for some unseen Early Modern Latin books\nstarting from our mixed model led to a CER of 1.47%, an improvement of up to\n50% compared to training from scratch and up to 30% compared to training from\nthe aforementioned standard model.

          "description": "We present a new method, called MEsh TRansfOrmer (METRO), to reconstruct 3D\nhuman pose and mesh vertices from a single image. Our method uses a transformer\nencoder to jointly model vertex-vertex and vertex-joint interactions, and\noutputs 3D joint coordinates and mesh vertices simultaneously. Compared to\nexisting techniques that regress pose and shape parameters, METRO does not rely\non any parametric mesh models like SMPL, thus it can be easily extended to\nother objects such as hands. We further relax the mesh topology and allow the\ntransformer self-attention mechanism to freely attend between any two vertices,\nmaking it possible to learn non-local relationships among mesh vertices and\njoints. With the proposed masked vertex modeling, our method is more robust and\neffective in handling challenging situations like partial occlusions. METRO\ngenerates new state-of-the-art results for human mesh reconstruction on the\npublic Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets.

          "description": "Adversarial robustness of deep neural networks is an extensively studied\nproblem in the literature and various methods have been proposed to defend\nagainst adversarial images. However, only a handful of defense methods have\nbeen developed for defending against attacked videos. In this paper, we propose\na novel Over-and-Under complete restoration network for Defending against\nadversarial videos (OUDefend). Most restoration networks adopt an\nencoder-decoder architecture that first shrinks spatial dimension then expands\nit back. This approach learns undercomplete representations, which have large\nreceptive fields to collect global information but overlooks local details. On\nthe other hand, overcomplete representations have opposite properties. Hence,\nOUDefend is designed to balance local and global features by learning those two\nrepresentations. We attach OUDefend to target video recognition models as a\nfeature restoration block and train the entire network end-to-end. Experimental\nresults show that the defenses focusing on images may be ineffective to videos,\nwhile OUDefend enhances robustness against different types of adversarial\nvideos, ranging from additive attacks, multiplicative attacks to physically\nrealizable attacks.

          "description": "Traditional deep learning algorithms often fail to generalize when they are\ntested outside of the domain of training data. Because data distributions can\nchange dynamically in real-life applications once a learned model is deployed,\nin this paper we are interested in single-source domain generalization (SDG)\nwhich aims to develop deep learning algorithms able to generalize from a single\ntraining domain where no information about the test domain is available at\ntraining time. Firstly, we design two simple MNISTbased SDG benchmarks, namely\nMNIST Color SDG-MP and MNIST Color SDG-UP, which highlight the two different\nfundamental SDG issues of increasing difficulties: 1) a class-correlated\npattern in the training domain is missing (SDG-MP), or 2) uncorrelated with the\nclass (SDG-UP), in the testing data domain. This is in sharp contrast with the\ncurrent domain generalization (DG) benchmarks which mix up different\ncorrelation and variation factors and thereby make hard to disentangle success\nor failure factors when benchmarking DG algorithms. We further evaluate several\nstate-of-the-art SDG algorithms through our simple benchmark, namely MNIST\nColor SDG-MP, and show that the issue SDG-MP is largely unsolved despite of a\ndecade of efforts in developing DG algorithms. Finally, we also propose a\npartially reversed contrastive loss to encourage intra-class diversity and find\nless strongly correlated patterns, to deal with SDG-MP and show that the\nproposed approach is very effective on our MNIST Color SDG-MP benchmark.",

          "description": "Modern optical satellite sensors enable high-resolution stereo reconstruction\nfrom space. But the challenging imaging conditions when observing the Earth\nfrom space push stereo matching to its limits. In practice, the resulting\ndigital surface models (DSMs) are fairly noisy and often do not attain the\naccuracy needed for high-resolution applications such as 3D city modeling.\nArguably, stereo correspondence based on low-level image similarity is\ninsufficient and should be complemented with a-priori knowledge about the\nexpected surface geometry beyond basic local smoothness. To that end, we\nintroduce ResDepth, a convolutional neural network that learns such an\nexpressive geometric prior from example data. ResDepth refines an initial, raw\nstereo DSM while conditioning the refinement on the images. I.e., it acts as a\nsmart, learned post-processing filter and can seamlessly complement any stereo\nmatching pipeline. In a series of experiments, we find that the proposed method\nconsistently improves stereo DSMs both quantitatively and qualitatively. We\nshow that the prior encoded in the network weights captures meaningful\ngeometric characteristics of urban design, which also generalize across\ndifferent districts and even from one city to another. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat, by training on a variety of stereo pairs, ResDepth can acquire a\nsufficient degree of invariance against variations in imaging conditions and\nacquisition geometry.",

RBFF stacks features extracted from the batch\nnormalization layer of a few selected blocks of MobileNetV2, where the\ncandidate blocks are selected based on the characteristics of the ReLU\nactivation layers present in those blocks. The feature vector is then\ncompressed into a low-dimensional feature space using dimension reduction\nalgorithms on which we train a low-cost SVM classifier for the classification\nof the aerial images. We validate our choice of selected features based on the\nsignificance of the extracted features with respect to our classification\npipeline. RBFF remarkably does not involve any training of the base CNN model\nexcept for a few parameters for the classifier, which makes the technique very\ncost-effective for practical deployments.

          "description": "We introduce a self-supervised vision representation model BEiT, which stands\nfor Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers. Following\nBERT developed in the natural language processing area, we propose a masked\nimage modeling task to pretrain vision Transformers. Specifically, each image\nhas two views in our pre-training, i.e, image patches (such as 16x16 pixels),\nand visual tokens (i.e., discrete tokens). We first \"tokenize\" the original\nimage into visual tokens. Then we randomly mask some image patches and fed them\ninto the backbone Transformer. The pre-training objective is to recover the\noriginal visual tokens based on the corrupted image patches. After pre-training\nBEiT, we directly fine-tune the model parameters on downstream tasks by\nappending task layers upon the pretrained encoder. Experimental results on\nimage classification and semantic segmentation show that our model achieves\ncompetitive results with previous pre-training methods. For example, base-size\nBEiT achieves 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, significantly outperforming\nfrom-scratch DeiT training (81.8%) with the same setup. Moreover, large-size\nBEiT obtains 86.3% only using ImageNet-1K, even outperforming ViT-L with\nsupervised pre-training on ImageNet-22K (85.2%).

At the same time, many machine learning systems, such as search,\nmatching, and recommendation systems, heavily rely on embeddings.\nUnfortunately, due to misalignment of features of independently trained models,\nembeddings, cannot be improved with a naive deep ensemble like approach. In\nthis work, we look at the ensembling of representations and propose mean\nembeddings with test-time augmentation (MeTTA) simple yet well-performing\nrecipe for ensembling representations. Empirically we demonstrate that MeTTA\nsignificantly boosts the quality of linear evaluation on ImageNet for both\nsupervised and self-supervised models. Even more exciting, we draw connections\nbetween MeTTA, image retrieval, and transformation invariant models. We believe\nthat spreading the success of ensembles to inference higher-quality\nrepresentations is the important step that will open many new applications of\nensembling.",

          "description": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important task in machine learning\nsystems for ensuring their reliability and safety. Deep probabilistic\ngenerative models facilitate OOD detection by estimating the likelihood of a\ndata sample. However, such models frequently assign a suspiciously high\nlikelihood to a specific outlier. Several recent works have addressed this\nissue by training a neural network with auxiliary outliers, which are generated\nby perturbing the input data. In this paper, we discover that these approaches\nfail for certain OOD datasets. Thus, we suggest a new detection metric that\noperates without outlier exposure. We observe that our metric is robust to\ndiverse variations of an image compared to the previous outlier-exposing\nmethods. Furthermore, our proposed score requires neither auxiliary models nor\nadditional training. Instead, this paper utilizes the likelihood ratio\nstatistic in a new perspective to extract genuine properties from the given\nsingle deep probabilistic generative model. We also apply a novel numerical\napproximation to enable fast implementation. Finally, we demonstrate\ncomprehensive experiments on various probabilistic generative models and show\nthat our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

          "description": "The growing demand for head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations,\nalong with a global shortage of radiologists, has led to an increase in the\ntime taken to report head MRI scans around the world. For many neurological\nconditions, this delay can result in increased morbidity and mortality. An\nautomated triaging tool could reduce reporting times for abnormal examinations\nby identifying abnormalities at the time of imaging and prioritizing the\nreporting of these scans. In this work, we present a convolutional neural\nnetwork for detecting clinically-relevant abnormalities in\n$\\text{T}_2$-weighted head MRI scans. Using a validated neuroradiology report\nclassifier, we generated a labelled dataset of 43,754 scans from two large UK\nhospitals for model training, and demonstrate accurate classification (area\nunder the receiver operating curve (AUC) = 0.943) on a test set of 800 scans\nlabelled by a team of neuroradiologists. Importantly, when trained on scans\nfrom only a single hospital the model generalized to scans from the other\nhospital ($\\Delta$AUC $\\leq$ 0.02). A simulation study demonstrated that our\nmodel would reduce the mean reporting time for abnormal examinations from 28\ndays to 14 days and from 9 days to 5 days at the two hospitals, demonstrating\nfeasibility for use in a clinical triage environment.",

In contrast, relatively little work has focused on generating\nhigh-fidelity face textures. Compared with the prosperity of photo-realistic 2D\nface image generation, high-fidelity 3D face texture generation has yet to be\nstudied. In this paper, we proposed a novel UV map generation model that\npredicts the UV map from a single face image. The model consists of a UV\nsampler and a UV generator. By selectively sampling the input face image's\npixels and adjusting their relative locations, the UV sampler generates an\nincomplete UV map that could faithfully reconstruct the original face. Missing\ntextures in the incomplete UV map are further full-filled by the UV generator.\nThe training is based on pseudo ground truth blended by the 3DMM texture and\nthe input face texture, thus weakly supervised. To deal with the artifacts in\nthe imperfect pseudo UV map, multiple partial UV map discriminators are\nleveraged.",

          "description": "Timely, accurate and reliable assessment of fetal brain development is\nessential to reduce short and long-term risks to fetus and mother. Fetal MRI is\nincreasingly used for fetal brain assessment. Three key biometric linear\nmeasurements important for fetal brain evaluation are Cerebral Biparietal\nDiameter (CBD), Bone Biparietal Diameter (BBD), and Trans-Cerebellum Diameter\n(TCD), obtained manually by expert radiologists on reference slices, which is\ntime consuming and prone to human error. The aim of this study was to develop a\nfully automatic method computing the CBD, BBD and TCD measurements from fetal\nbrain MRI. The input is fetal brain MRI volumes which may include the fetal\nbody and the mother's abdomen. The outputs are the measurement values and\nreference slices on which the measurements were computed. The method, which\nfollows the manual measurements principle, consists of five stages: 1)\ncomputation of a Region Of Interest that includes the fetal brain with an\nanisotropic 3D U-Net classifier; 2) reference slice selection with a\nConvolutional Neural Network; 3) slice-wise fetal brain structures segmentation\nwith a multiclass U-Net classifier; 4) computation of the fetal brain\nmidsagittal line and fetal brain orientation, and; 5) computation of the\nmeasurements. Experimental results on 214 volumes for CBD, BBD and TCD\nmeasurements yielded a mean $L_1$ difference of 1.55mm, 1.45mm and 1.23mm\nrespectively, and a Bland-Altman 95% confidence interval ($CI_{95}$) of 3.92mm,\n3.98mm and 2.25mm respectively. These results are similar to the manual\ninter-observer variability. The proposed automatic method for computing\nbiometric linear measurements of the fetal brain from MR imaging achieves human\nlevel performance. It has the potential of being a useful method for the\nassessment of fetal brain biometry in normal and pathological cases, and of\nimproving routine clinical practice.",

          "description": "Bi-level optimization model is able to capture a wide range of complex\nlearning tasks with practical interest. Due to the witnessed efficiency in\nsolving bi-level programs, gradient-based methods have gained popularity in the\nmachine learning community. In this work, we propose a new gradient-based\nsolution scheme, namely, the Bi-level Value-Function-based Interior-point\nMethod (BVFIM). Following the main idea of the log-barrier interior-point\nscheme, we penalize the regularized value function of the lower level problem\ninto the upper level objective. By further solving a sequence of differentiable\nunconstrained approximation problems, we consequently derive a sequential\nprogramming scheme. The numerical advantage of our scheme relies on the fact\nthat, when gradient methods are applied to solve the approximation problem, we\nsuccessfully avoid computing any expensive Hessian-vector or Jacobian-vector\nproduct. We prove the convergence without requiring any convexity assumption on\neither the upper level or the lower level objective. Experiments demonstrate\nthe efficiency of the proposed BVFIM on non-convex bi-level problems.",

          "description": "Underwater images, in general, suffer from low contrast and high color\ndistortions due to the non-uniform attenuation of the light as it propagates\nthrough the water. In addition, the degree of attenuation varies with the\nwavelength resulting in the asymmetric traversing of colors. Despite the\nprolific works for underwater image restoration (UIR) using deep learning, the\nabove asymmetricity has not been addressed in the respective network\nengineering. As the first novelty, this paper shows that attributing the right\nreceptive field size (context) based on the traversing range of the color\nchannel may lead to a substantial performance gain for the task of UIR.\nFurther, it is important to suppress the irrelevant multi-contextual features\nand increase the representational power of the model. Therefore, as a second\nnovelty, we have incorporated an attentive skip mechanism to adaptively refine\nthe learned multi-contextual features. The proposed framework, called Deep\nWaveNet, is optimized using the traditional pixel-wise and feature-based cost\nfunctions. An extensive set of experiments have been carried out to show the\nefficacy of the proposed scheme over existing best-published literature on\nbenchmark datasets. More importantly, we have demonstrated a comprehensive\nvalidation of enhanced images across various high-level vision tasks, e.g.,\nunderwater image semantic segmentation, and diver's 2D pose estimation.

          "description": "Adaptive gradient methods have shown excellent performance for solving many\nmachine learning problems. Although multiple adaptive methods were recently\nstudied, they mainly focus on either empirical or theoretical aspects and also\nonly work for specific problems by using specific adaptive learning rates. It\nis desired to design a universal framework for practical algorithms of adaptive\ngradients with theoretical guarantee to solve general problems. To fill this\ngap, we propose a faster and universal framework of adaptive gradients (i.e.,\nSUPER-ADAM) by introducing a universal adaptive matrix that includes most\nexisting adaptive gradient forms. Moreover, our framework can flexibly\nintegrates the momentum and variance reduced techniques. In particular, our\nnovel framework provides the convergence analysis support for adaptive gradient\nmethods under the nonconvex setting. In theoretical analysis, we prove that our\nnew algorithm can achieve the best known complexity of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\\epsilon$-stationary point of\nnonconvex optimization, which matches the lower bound for stochastic smooth\nnonconvex optimization. In numerical experiments, we employ various deep\nlearning tasks to validate that our algorithm consistently outperforms the\nexisting adaptive algorithms.",

Recent work has\ndemonstrated serious LiDAR spoofing attacks with alarming consequences. In\nparticular, model-level LiDAR spoofing attacks aim to inject fake depth\nmeasurements to elicit ghost objects that are erroneously detected by 3D Object\nDetectors, resulting in hazardous driving decisions. In this work, we explore\nthe use of motion as a physical invariant of genuine objects for detecting such\nattacks.

          "description": "Computational Colour Constancy (CCC) consists of estimating the colour of one\nor more illuminants in a scene and using them to remove unwanted chromatic\ndistortions. Much research has focused on illuminant estimation for CCC on\nsingle images, with few attempts of leveraging the temporal information\nintrinsic in sequences of correlated images (e.g., the frames in a video), a\ntask known as Temporal Colour Constancy (TCC). The state-of-the-art for TCC is\nTCCNet, a deep-learning architecture that uses a ConvLSTM for aggregating the\nencodings produced by CNN submodules for each image in a sequence. We extend\nthis architecture with different models obtained by (i) substituting the TCCNet\nsubmodules with C4, the state-of-the-art method for CCC targeting images; (ii)\nadding a cascading strategy to perform an iterative improvement of the estimate\nof the illuminant. We tested our models on the recently released TCC benchmark\nand achieved results that surpass the state-of-the-art. Analyzing the impact of\nthe number of frames involved in illuminant estimation on performance, we show\nthat it is possible to reduce inference time by training the models on few\nselected frames from the sequences while retaining comparable accuracy.",

          "description": "Most existing works in few-shot learning rely on meta-learning the network on\na large base dataset which is typically from the same domain as the target\ndataset. We tackle the problem of cross-domain few-shot learning where there is\na large shift between the base and target domain. The problem of cross-domain\nfew-shot recognition with unlabeled target data is largely unaddressed in the\nliterature. STARTUP was the first method that tackles this problem using\nself-training. However, it uses a fixed teacher pretrained on a labeled base\ndataset to create soft labels for the unlabeled target samples. As the base\ndataset and unlabeled dataset are from different domains, projecting the target\nimages in the class-domain of the base dataset with a fixed pretrained model\nmight be sub-optimal. We propose a simple dynamic distillation-based approach\nto facilitate unlabeled images from the novel/base dataset. We impose\nconsistency regularization by calculating predictions from the weakly-augmented\nversions of the unlabeled images from a teacher network and matching it with\nthe strongly augmented versions of the same images from a student network. The\nparameters of the teacher network are updated as exponential moving average of\nthe parameters of the student network. We show that the proposed network learns\nrepresentation that can be easily adapted to the target domain even though it\nhas not been trained with target-specific classes during the pretraining phase.\nOur model outperforms the current state-of-the art method by 4.4% for 1-shot\nand 3.6% for 5-shot classification in the BSCD-FSL benchmark, and also shows\ncompetitive performance on traditional in-domain few-shot learning task.

          "description": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based visual tracking has been confronted with\nnumerous challenges, e.g., object motion and occlusion. These challenges\ngenerally introduce unexpected mutations of target appearance and result in\ntracking failure. However, prevalent discriminative correlation filter (DCF)\nbased trackers are insensitive to target mutations due to a predefined label,\nwhich concentrates on merely the centre of the training region. Meanwhile,\nappearance mutations caused by occlusion or similar objects usually lead to the\ninevitable learning of wrong information. To cope with appearance mutations,\nthis paper proposes a novel DCF-based method to enhance the sensitivity and\nresistance to mutations with an adaptive hybrid label, i.e., MSCF. The ideal\nlabel is optimized jointly with the correlation filter and remains temporal\nconsistency. Besides, a novel measurement of mutations called mutation threat\nfactor (MTF) is applied to correct the label dynamically. Considerable\nexperiments are conducted on widely used UAV benchmarks. The results indicate\nthat the performance of MSCF tracker surpasses other 26 state-of-the-art\nDCF-based and deep-based trackers.

          "description": "Plant species identification is time consuming, costly, and requires lots of\nefforts, and expertise knowledge. In recent, many researchers use deep learning\nmethods to classify plants directly using plant images. While deep learning\nmodels have achieved a great success, the lack of interpretability limit their\nwidespread application. To overcome this, we explore the use of interpretable,\nmeasurable and computer-aided features extracted from plant leaf images. Image\nprocessing is one of the most challenging, and crucial steps in\nfeature-extraction. The purpose of image processing is to improve the leaf\nimage by removing undesired distortion. The main image processing steps of our\nalgorithm involves: i) Convert original image to RGB (Red-Green-Blue) image,\nii) Gray scaling, iii) Gaussian smoothing, iv) Binary thresholding, v) Remove\nstalk, vi) Closing holes, and vii) Resize image. The next step after image\nprocessing is to extract features from plant leaf images. We introduced 52\ncomputationally efficient features to classify plant species. These features\nare mainly classified into four groups as: i) shape-based features, ii)\ncolor-based features, iii) texture-based features, and iv) scagnostic features.\nLength, width, area, texture correlation, monotonicity and scagnostics are to\nname few of them. We explore the ability of features to discriminate the\nclasses of interest under supervised learning and unsupervised learning\nsettings. For that, supervised dimensionality reduction technique, Linear\nDiscriminant Analysis (LDA), and unsupervised dimensionality reduction\ntechnique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used to convert and visualize\nthe images from digital-image space to feature space. The results show that the\nfeatures are sufficient to discriminate the classes of interest under both\nsupervised and unsupervised learning settings.",

          "description": "With the emergence of low-cost robotic systems, such as unmanned aerial\nvehicle, the importance of embedded high-performance image processing has\nincreased. For a long time, FPGAs were the only processing hardware that were\ncapable of high-performance computing, while at the same time preserving a low\npower consumption, essential for embedded systems. However, the recently\nincreasing availability of embedded GPU-based systems, such as the NVIDIA\nJetson series, comprised of an ARM CPU and a NVIDIA Tegra GPU, allows for\nmassively parallel embedded computing on graphics hardware. With this in mind,\nwe propose an approach for real-time embedded stereo processing on ARM and\nCUDA-enabled devices, which is based on the popular and widely used Semi-Global\nMatching algorithm. In this, we propose an optimization of the algorithm for\nembedded CUDA GPUs, by using massively parallel computing, as well as using the\nNEON intrinsics to optimize the algorithm for vectorized SIMD processing on\nembedded ARM CPUs. We have evaluated our approach with different configurations\non two public stereo benchmark datasets to demonstrate that they can reach an\nerror rate as low as 3.3%. Furthermore, our experiments show that the fastest\nconfiguration of our approach reaches up to 46 FPS on VGA image resolution.\nFinally, in a use-case specific qualitative evaluation, we have evaluated the\npower consumption of our approach and deployed it on the DJI Manifold 2-G\nattached to a DJI Matrix 210v2 RTK unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), demonstrating\nits suitability for real-time stereo processing onboard a UAV.",

Its simplicity and effectiveness\nhave led to wide applications in the explanation of visual predictions and\nweakly-supervised localization tasks. However, CAM has its own shortcomings.\nThe computation of attribution maps relies on ad-hoc calibration steps that are\nnot part of the training computational graph, making it difficult for us to\nunderstand the real meaning of the attribution values. In this paper, we\nimprove CAM by explicitly incorporating a latent variable encoding the location\nof the cue for recognition in the formulation, thereby subsuming the\nattribution map into the training computational graph. The resulting model,\nclass activation latent mapping, or CALM, is trained with the\nexpectation-maximization algorithm. Our experiments show that CALM identifies\ndiscriminative attributes for image classifiers more accurately than CAM and\nother visual attribution baselines. CALM also shows performance improvements\nover prior arts on the weakly-supervised object localization benchmarks. Our\ncode is available at https://github.com/naver-ai/calm.",

          "description": "Vision-language Navigation (VLN) tasks require an agent to navigate\nstep-by-step while perceiving the visual observations and comprehending a\nnatural language instruction. Large data bias, which is caused by the disparity\nratio between the small data scale and large navigation space, makes the VLN\ntask challenging. Previous works have proposed various data augmentation\nmethods to reduce data bias. However, these works do not explicitly reduce the\ndata bias across different house scenes. Therefore, the agent would overfit to\nthe seen scenes and achieve poor navigation performance in the unseen scenes.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose the Random Environmental Mixup (REM) method,\nwhich generates cross-connected house scenes as augmented data via mixuping\nenvironment. Specifically, we first select key viewpoints according to the room\nconnection graph for each scene. Then, we cross-connect the key views of\ndifferent scenes to construct augmented scenes. Finally, we generate augmented\ninstruction-path pairs in the cross-connected scenes. The experimental results\non benchmark datasets demonstrate that our augmentation data via REM help the\nagent reduce its performance gap between the seen and unseen environment and\nimprove the overall performance, making our model the best existing approach on\nthe standard VLN benchmark.",

          "description": "Benefit from large-scale training data, recent advances in Siamese-based\nobject tracking have achieved compelling results on the normal sequences.\nWhilst Siamese-based trackers assume training and test data follow an identical\ndistribution. Suppose there is a set of foggy or rainy test sequences, it\ncannot be guaranteed that the trackers trained on the normal images perform\nwell on the data belonging to other domains. The problem of domain shift among\ntraining and test data has already been discussed in object detection and\nsemantic segmentation areas, which, however, has not been investigated for\nvisual tracking. To this end, based on SiamRPN++, we introduce a Domain\nAdaptive SiamRPN++, namely DASiamRPN++, to improve the cross-domain\ntransferability and robustness of a tracker. Inspired by A-distance theory, we\npresent two domain adaptive modules, Pixel Domain Adaptation (PDA) and Semantic\nDomain Adaptation (SDA). The PDA module aligns the feature maps of template and\nsearch region images to eliminate the pixel-level domain shift caused by\nweather, illumination, etc. The SDA module aligns the feature representations\nof the tracking target's appearance to eliminate the semantic-level domain\nshift. PDA and SDA modules reduce the domain disparity by learning domain\nclassifiers in an adversarial training manner. The domain classifiers enforce\nthe network to learn domain-invariant feature representations. Extensive\nexperiments are performed on the standard datasets of two different domains,\nincluding synthetic foggy and TIR sequences, which demonstrate the\ntransferability and domain adaptability of the proposed tracker.",

          "description": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of adult death in the\nUnited States and worldwide, and for which the coronary angiography procedure\nis the primary gateway for diagnosis and clinical management decisions. The\nstandard-of-care for interpretation of coronary angiograms depends upon ad-hoc\nvisual assessment by the physician operator. However, ad-hoc visual\ninterpretation of angiograms is poorly reproducible, highly variable and bias\nprone. Here we show for the first time that fully-automated angiogram\ninterpretation to estimate coronary artery stenosis is possible using a\nsequence of deep neural network algorithms. The algorithmic pipeline we\ndeveloped--called CathAI--achieves state-of-the art performance across the\nsequence of tasks required to accomplish automated interpretation of\nunselected, real-world angiograms. CathAI (Algorithms 1-2) demonstrated\npositive predictive value, sensitivity and F1 score of >=90% to identify the\nprojection angle overall and >=93% for left or right coronary artery angiogram\ndetection, the primary anatomic structures of interest. To predict obstructive\ncoronary artery stenosis (>=70% stenosis), CathAI (Algorithm 4) exhibited an\narea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.862 (95% CI:\n0.843-0.880). When externally validated in a healthcare system in another\ncountry, CathAI AUC was 0.869 (95% CI: 0.830-0.907) to predict obstructive\ncoronary artery stenosis. Our results demonstrate that multiple purpose-built\nneural networks can function in sequence to accomplish the complex series of\ntasks required for automated analysis of real-world angiograms. Deployment of\nCathAI may serve to increase standardization and reproducibility in coronary\nstenosis assessment, while providing a robust foundation to accomplish future\ntasks for algorithmic angiographic interpretation.",

Existing methods\nmainly focus on global-level modality alignment, whereas neglect sample-level\nmodality divergence to some extent, leading to performance degradation. This\npaper attempts to find RGB-IR ReID solutions from tackling sample-level\nmodality difference, and presents a Geometry-Guided Dual-Alignment learning\nframework (G$^2$DA), which jointly enhances modality-invariance and reinforces\ndiscriminability with human topological structure in features to boost the\noverall matching performance.

          "description": "State-of-the-art (SOTA) Generative Models (GMs) can synthesize\nphoto-realistic images that are hard for humans to distinguish from genuine\nphotos. We propose to perform reverse engineering of GMs to infer the model\nhyperparameters from the images generated by these models. We define a novel\nproblem, \"model parsing\", as estimating GM network architectures and training\nloss functions by examining their generated images -- a task seemingly\nimpossible for human beings. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework\nwith two components: a Fingerprint Estimation Network (FEN), which estimates a\nGM fingerprint from a generated image by training with four constraints to\nencourage the fingerprint to have desired properties, and a Parsing Network\n(PN), which predicts network architecture and loss functions from the estimated\nfingerprints. To evaluate our approach, we collect a fake image dataset with\n$100$K images generated by $100$ GMs. Extensive experiments show encouraging\nresults in parsing the hyperparameters of the unseen models. Finally, our\nfingerprint estimation can be leveraged for deepfake detection and image\nattribution, as we show by reporting SOTA results on both the recent Celeb-DF\nand image attribution benchmarks.",

          "description": "Human motion retargeting aims to transfer the motion of one person in a\n\"driving\" video or set of images to another person. Existing efforts leverage a\nlong training video from each target person to train a subject-specific motion\ntransfer model. However, the scalability of such methods is limited, as each\nmodel can only generate videos for the given target subject, and such training\nvideos are labor-intensive to acquire and process. Few-shot motion transfer\ntechniques, which only require one or a few images from a target, have recently\ndrawn considerable attention. Methods addressing this task generally use either\n2D or explicit 3D representations to transfer motion, and in doing so,\nsacrifice either accurate geometric modeling or the flexibility of an\nend-to-end learned representation. Inspired by the Transformable Bottleneck\nNetwork, which renders novel views and manipulations of rigid objects, we\npropose an approach based on an implicit volumetric representation of the image\ncontent, which can then be spatially manipulated using volumetric flow fields.\nWe address the challenging question of how to aggregate information across\ndifferent body poses, learning flow fields that allow for combining content\nfrom the appropriate regions of input images of highly non-rigid human subjects\nperforming complex motions into a single implicit volumetric representation.\nThis allows us to learn our 3D representation solely from videos of moving\npeople. Armed with both 3D object understanding and end-to-end learned\nrendering, this categorically novel representation delivers state-of-the-art\nimage generation quality, as shown by our quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations.",

The visual\nenvironment surrounding a human speaker reveals important cues about the room\ngeometry, materials, and speaker location, all of which influence the precise\nreverberation effects in the audio stream. We introduce Visually-Informed\nDereverberation of Audio (VIDA), an end-to-end approach that learns to remove\nreverberation based on both the observed sounds and visual scene. In support of\nthis new task, we develop a large-scale dataset that uses realistic acoustic\nrenderings of speech in real-world 3D scans of homes offering a variety of room\nacoustics.

          "description": "Machine learning is revolutionizing image-based diagnostics in pathology and\nradiology. ML models have shown promising results in research settings, but\ntheir lack of interoperability has been a major barrier for clinical\nintegration and evaluation. The DICOM a standard specifies Information Object\nDefinitions and Services for the representation and communication of digital\nimages and related information, including image-derived annotations and\nanalysis results. However, the complexity of the standard represents an\nobstacle for its adoption in the ML community and creates a need for software\nlibraries and tools that simplify working with data sets in DICOM format. Here\nwe present the highdicom library, which provides a high-level application\nprogramming interface for the Python programming language that abstracts\nlow-level details of the standard and enables encoding and decoding of\nimage-derived information in DICOM format in a few lines of Python code. The\nhighdicom library ties into the extensive Python ecosystem for image processing\nand machine learning. Simultaneously, by simplifying creation and parsing of\nDICOM-compliant files, highdicom achieves interoperability with the medical\nimaging systems that hold the data used to train and run ML models, and\nultimately communicate and store model outputs for clinical use. We demonstrate\nthrough experiments with slide microscopy and computed tomography imaging,\nthat, by bridging these two ecosystems, highdicom enables developers to train\nand evaluate state-of-the-art ML models in pathology and radiology while\nremaining compliant with the DICOM standard and interoperable with clinical\nsystems at all stages.

In this work, we propose a\ncross-subject deep adaptation model with spatial attention (CS-DASA) to\ngeneralize the workload classifications across subjects. First, we transform\ntime-series EEG data into multi-frame EEG images incorporating more\nspatio-temporal information. First, the subject-shared module in CS-DASA\nreceives multi-frame EEG image data from both source and target subjects and\nlearns the common feature representations. Then, in subject-specific module,\nthe maximum mean discrepancy is implemented to measure the domain distribution\ndivergence in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which can add an effective\npenalty loss for domain adaptation. Additionally, the subject-to-subject\nspatial attention mechanism is employed to focus on the most discriminative\nspatial feature in EEG image data.

          "description": "Although deep convolution neural networks (DCNN) have achieved excellent\nperformance in human pose estimation, these networks often have a large number\nof parameters and computations, leading to the slow inference speed. For this\nissue, an effective solution is knowledge distillation, which transfers\nknowledge from a large pre-trained network (teacher) to a small network\n(student). However, there are some defects in the existing approaches: (I) Only\na single teacher is adopted, neglecting the potential that a student can learn\nfrom multiple teachers. (II) The human segmentation mask can be regarded as\nadditional prior information to restrict the location of keypoints, which is\nnever utilized. (III) A student with a small number of parameters cannot fully\nimitate heatmaps provided by datasets and teachers. (IV) There exists noise in\nheatmaps generated by teachers, which causes model degradation. To overcome\nthese defects, we propose an orderly dual-teacher knowledge distillation (ODKD)\nframework, which consists of two teachers with different capabilities.\nSpecifically, the weaker one (primary teacher, PT) is used to teach keypoints\ninformation, the stronger one (senior teacher, ST) is utilized to transfer\nsegmentation and keypoints information by adding the human segmentation mask.\nTaking dual-teacher together, an orderly learning strategy is proposed to\npromote knowledge absorbability. Moreover, we employ a binarization operation\nwhich further improves the learning ability of the student and reduces noise in\nheatmaps. Experimental results on COCO and OCHuman keypoints datasets show that\nour proposed ODKD can improve the performance of different lightweight models\nby a large margin, and HRNet-W16 equipped with ODKD achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance for lightweight human pose estimation.",

          "description": "Adversarial robustness has attracted extensive studies recently by revealing\nthe vulnerability and intrinsic characteristics of deep networks. However,\nexisting works on adversarial robustness mainly focus on balanced datasets,\nwhile real-world data usually exhibits a long-tailed distribution. To push\nadversarial robustness towards more realistic scenarios, in this work we\ninvestigate the adversarial vulnerability as well as defense under long-tailed\ndistributions. In particular, we first reveal the negative impacts induced by\nimbalanced data on both recognition performance and adversarial robustness,\nuncovering the intrinsic challenges of this problem. We then perform a\nsystematic study on existing long-tailed recognition methods in conjunction\nwith the adversarial training framework. Several valuable observations are\nobtained: 1) natural accuracy is relatively easy to improve, 2) fake gain of\nrobust accuracy exists under unreliable evaluation, and 3) boundary error\nlimits the promotion of robustness. Inspired by these observations, we propose\na clean yet effective framework, RoBal, which consists of two dedicated\nmodules, a scale-invariant classifier and data re-balancing via both margin\nengineering at training stage and boundary adjustment during inference.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other\nstate-of-the-art defense methods.

Many\nfew-shot learning methods address this challenge by learning an instance\nembedding function from seen classes and apply the function to instances from\nunseen classes with limited labels.

In this work, we demonstrate the universal vulnerability of PTMs,\nwhere fine-tuned PTMs can be easily controlled by backdoor attacks in arbitrary\ndownstream tasks. Specifically, attackers can add a simple pre-training task,\nwhich restricts the output representations of trigger instances to pre-defined\nvectors, namely neuron-level backdoor attack (NeuBA). If the backdoor\nfunctionality is not eliminated during fine-tuning, the triggers can make the\nfine-tuned model predict fixed labels by pre-defined vectors.

From an application perspective, as federated\nlearning involves multiple energy-constrained devices, there is a huge scope to\nleverage energy efficiency provided by SNNs.

In this paper, we bring SNNs to a more realistic federated\nlearning scenario. Specifically, we propose a federated learning framework for\ndecentralized and privacy-preserving training of SNNs. To validate the proposed\nfederated learning framework, we experimentally evaluate the advantages of SNNs\non various aspects of federated learning with CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 benchmarks.\nWe observe that SNNs outperform ANNs in terms of overall accuracy by over 15%\nwhen the data is distributed across a large number of clients in the federation\nwhile providing up to5.3x energy efficiency. In addition to efficiency, we also\nanalyze the sensitivity of the proposed federated SNN framework to data\ndistribution among the clients, stragglers, and gradient noise and perform a\ncomprehensive comparison with ANNs.",

Recently, Transformer has been gaining popularity due to\nits parallel computing ability for sequence-to-sequence modeling. Thus, it\nseems to be straightforward to apply the vision Transformer to solve VSR.\nHowever, the typical block design of Transformer with a fully connected\nself-attention layer and a token-wise feed-forward layer does not fit well for\nVSR due to the following two reasons. First, the fully connected self-attention\nlayer neglects to exploit the data locality because this layer relies on linear\nlayers to compute attention maps. Second, the token-wise feed-forward layer\nlacks the feature alignment which is important for VSR since this layer\nindependently processes each of the input token embeddings without any\ninteraction among them. In this paper, we make the first attempt to adapt\nTransformer for VSR. Specifically, to tackle the first issue, we present a\nspatial-temporal convolutional self-attention layer with a theoretical\nunderstanding to exploit the locality information. For the second issue, we\ndesign a bidirectional optical flow-based feed-forward layer to discover the\ncorrelations across different video frames and also align features. Extensive\nexperiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed method. The code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/caojiezhang/VSR-Transformer.",

          "description": "Humans are good at compositional zero-shot reasoning; someone who has never\nseen a zebra before could nevertheless recognize one when we tell them it looks\nlike a horse with black and white stripes. Machine learning systems, on the\nother hand, usually leverage spurious correlations in the training data, and\nwhile such correlations can help recognize objects in context, they hurt\ngeneralization. To be able to deal with underspecified datasets while still\nleveraging contextual clues during classification, we propose ProtoProp, a\nnovel prototype propagation graph method. First we learn prototypical\nrepresentations of objects (e.g., zebra) that are conditionally independent\nw.r.t. their attribute labels (e.g., stripes) and vice versa. Next we propagate\nthe independent prototypes through a compositional graph, to learn\ncompositional prototypes of novel attribute-object combinations that reflect\nthe dependencies of the target distribution. The method does not rely on any\nexternal data, such as class hierarchy graphs or pretrained word embeddings. We\nevaluate our approach on AO-Clever, a synthetic and strongly visual dataset\nwith clean labels, and UT-Zappos, a noisy real-world dataset of fine-grained\nshoe types. We show that in the generalized compositional zero-shot setting we\noutperform state-of-the-art results, and through ablations we show the\nimportance of each part of the method and their contribution to the final\nresults.",

          "description": "Co-registering the Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical data of European\nSpace Agency (ESA) is of great importance for many remote sensing applications.\nHowever, we find that there are evident misregistration shifts between the\nSentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images that are directly downloaded from\nthe official website. To address that, this paper presents a fast and effective\nregistration method for the two types of images. In the proposed method, a\nblock-based scheme is first designed to extract evenly distributed interest\npoints. Then the correspondences are detected by using the similarity of\nstructural features between the SAR and optical images, where the three\ndimension (3D) phase correlation (PC) is used as the similarity measure for\naccelerating image matching. Finally, the obtained correspondences are employed\nto measure the misregistration shifts between the images. Moreover, to\neliminate the misregistration, we use some representative geometric\ntransformation models such as polynomial models, projective models, and\nrational function models for the co-registration of the two types of images,\nand compare and analyze their registration accuracy under different numbers of\ncontrol points and different terrains. Six pairs of the Sentinel-1 SAR L1 and\nSentinel-2 optical L1C images covering three different terrains are tested in\nour experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve\nprecise correspondences between the images, and the 3rd. Order polynomial\nachieves the most satisfactory registration results. Its registration accuracy\nof the flat areas is less than 1.0 10m pixels, and that of the hilly areas is\nabout 1.5 10m pixels, and that of the mountainous areas is between 1.7 and 2.3\n10m pixels, which significantly improves the co-registration accuracy of the\nSentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images.",

How polyubiquitylated substrate interactions regulate\nproteasome activity is not understood. Here we introduce a deep manifold\nlearning framework, named AlphaCryo4D, which enables atomic-level cryogenic\nelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions of nonequilibrium conformational\ncontinuum and reconstitutes hidden dynamics of proteasome autoregulation in the\nact of substrate degradation. AlphaCryo4D integrates 3D deep residual learning\nwith manifold embedding of free-energy landscapes, which directs 3D clustering\nvia an energy-based particle-voting algorithm. In blind assessments using\nsimulated heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets, AlphaCryo4D achieved 3D\nclassification accuracy three times that of conventional method and\nreconstructed continuous conformational changes of a 130-kDa protein at\nsub-3-angstrom resolution. By using AlphaCryo4D to analyze a single\nexperimental cryo-EM dataset, we identified 64 conformers of the\nsubstrate-bound human 26S proteasome, revealing conformational entanglement of\ntwo regulatory particles in the doubly capped holoenzymes and their energetic\ndifferences with singly capped ones. Novel ubiquitin-binding sites are\ndiscovered on the RPN2, RPN10 and Alpha5 subunits to remodel polyubiquitin\nchains for deubiquitylation and recycle. Importantly, AlphaCryo4D choreographs\nsingle-nucleotide-exchange dynamics of proteasomal AAA-ATPase motor during\ntranslocation initiation, which upregulates proteolytic activity by\nallosterically promoting nucleophilic attack.

A widely used strategy is to generate a complete point\ncloud from the incomplete one. However, the unordered nature of point clouds\nwill degrade the generation of high-quality 3D shapes, as the detailed topology\nand structure of discrete points are hard to be captured by the generative\nprocess only using a latent code. In this paper, we address the above problem\nby reconsidering the completion task from a new perspective, where we formulate\nthe prediction as a point cloud deformation process. Specifically, we design a\nnovel neural network, named PMP-Net, to mimic the behavior of an earth mover.\nIt moves each point of the incomplete input to complete the point cloud, where\nthe total distance of point moving paths (PMP) should be shortest. Therefore,\nPMP-Net predicts a unique point moving path for each point according to the\nconstraint of total point moving distances. As a result, the network learns a\nstrict and unique correspondence on point-level, which can capture the detailed\ntopology and structure relationships between the incomplete shape and the\ncomplete target, and thus improves the quality of the predicted complete shape.\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments on Completion3D and PCN datasets, which\ndemonstrate our advantages over the state-of-the-art point cloud completion\nmethods.",

          "description": "As a research community, we are still lacking a systematic understanding of\nthe progress on adversarial robustness, which often makes it hard to identify\nthe most promising ideas in training robust models. A key challenge in\nbenchmarking robustness is that its evaluation is often error-prone, leading to\noverestimation of the true robustness of models. While adaptive attacks\ndesigned for a particular defense are a potential solution, they have to be\nhighly customized for particular models, which makes it difficult to compare\ndifferent methods. Our goal is to instead establish a standardized benchmark of\nadversarial robustness, which as accurately as possible reflects the robustness\nof the considered models within a reasonable computational budget. To evaluate\nthe robustness of models for our benchmark, we consider AutoAttack, an ensemble\nof white- and black-box attacks which was recently shown in a large-scale study\nto improve almost all robustness evaluations compared to the original\npublications. We also impose some restrictions on the admitted models to rule\nout defenses that only make gradient-based attacks ineffective without\nimproving actual robustness. Our leaderboard, hosted at\nhttps://robustbench.github.io/, contains evaluations of 90+ models and aims at\nreflecting the current state of the art on a set of well-defined tasks in\n$\\ell_\\infty$- and $\\ell_2$-threat models and on common corruptions, with\npossible extensions in the future. Additionally, we open-source the library\nhttps://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench that provides unified access to 60+\nrobust models to facilitate their downstream applications. Finally, based on\nthe collected models, we analyze the impact of robustness on the performance on\ndistribution shifts, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, fairness,\nprivacy leakage, smoothness, and transferability.",

          "description": "The core problem of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the trade off between\nacceleration and image quality. Image reconstruction and super-resolution are\ntwo crucial techniques in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Current methods are\ndesigned to perform these tasks separately, ignoring the correlations between\nthem. In this work, we propose an end-to-end task transformer network\n(T$^2$Net) for joint MRI reconstruction and super-resolution, which allows\nrepresentations and feature transmission to be shared between multiple task to\nachieve higher-quality, super-resolved and motion-artifacts-free images from\nhighly undersampled and degenerated MRI data. Our framework combines both\nreconstruction and super-resolution, divided into two sub-branches, whose\nfeatures are expressed as queries and keys. Specifically, we encourage joint\nfeature learning between the two tasks, thereby transferring accurate task\ninformation. We first use two separate CNN branches to extract task-specific\nfeatures. Then, a task transformer module is designed to embed and synthesize\nthe relevance between the two tasks. Experimental results show that our\nmulti-task model significantly outperforms advanced sequential methods, both\nquantitatively and qualitatively.",

          "description": "A generalist robot equipped with learned skills must be able to perform many\ntasks in many different environments. However, zero-shot generalization to new\nsettings is not always possible. When the robot encounters a new environment or\nobject, it may need to finetune some of its previously learned skills to\naccommodate this change. But crucially, previously learned behaviors and models\nshould still be suitable to accelerate this relearning. In this paper, we aim\nto study how generative models of possible outcomes can allow a robot to learn\nvisual representations of affordances, so that the robot can sample potentially\npossible outcomes in new situations, and then further train its policy to\nachieve those outcomes. In effect, prior data is used to learn what kinds of\noutcomes may be possible, such that when the robot encounters an unfamiliar\nsetting, it can sample potential outcomes from its model, attempt to reach\nthem, and thereby update both its skills and its outcome model. This approach,\nvisuomotor affordance learning (VAL), can be used to train goal-conditioned\npolicies that operate on raw image inputs, and can rapidly learn to manipulate\nnew objects via our proposed affordance-directed exploration scheme. We show\nthat VAL can utilize prior data to solve real-world tasks such drawer opening,\ngrasping, and placing objects in new scenes with only five minutes of online\nexperience in the new scene.",

BigEarthNet is made up of 590,326\nimage patches annotated with multi-labels provided by the CORINE Land Cover\n(CLC) map of 2018 based on its most thematic detailed Level-3 class\nnomenclature. Initial research demonstrates that some CLC classes are\nchallenging to be accurately described by considering only Sentinel-2 images.\nTo increase the effectiveness of BigEarthNet, in this paper we introduce an\nalternative class-nomenclature to allow DL models for better learning and\ndescribing the complex spatial and spectral information content of the\nSentinel-2 images. This is achieved by interpreting and arranging the CLC\nLevel-3 nomenclature based on the properties of Sentinel-2 images in a new\nnomenclature of 19 classes. Then, the new class-nomenclature of BigEarthNet is\nused within state-of-the-art DL models in the context of multi-label\nclassification. Results show that the models trained from scratch on\nBigEarthNet outperform those pre-trained on ImageNet, especially in relation to\nsome complex classes including agriculture, other vegetated and natural\nenvironments.

          "description": "Being complex-valued and low in signal-to-noise ratios, magnitude-based\ndiffusion MRI is confounded by the noise-floor that falsely elevates signal\nmagnitude and incurs bias to the commonly used diffusion indices, such as\nfractional anisotropy (FA). To avoid noise-floor, most existing phase\ncorrection methods explore improving filters to estimate the noise-free\nbackground phase. In this work, after diving into the phase correction\nprocedures, we argue that even a perfect filter is insufficient for phase\ncorrection because the correction procedures are incapable of distinguishing\nsign-symbols of noise, resulting in artifacts (\\textit{i.e.}, arbitrary signal\nloss). With this insight, we generalize the definition of noise-floor to a\ncomplex polar coordinate system and propose a calibration procedure that could\nconveniently distinguish noise sign symbols.

In\nparticular, we investigate their use in reconstructing two-dimensional damaged\nsnapshots extracted from a large database of numerical configurations of 3d\nturbulence in the presence of rotation, a case with multi-scale random features\nwhere both large-scale organised structures and small-scale highly intermittent\nand non-Gaussian fluctuations are present. Second, following a reverse\nengineering approach, we aim to rank the input flow properties (features) in\nterms of their qualitative and quantitative importance to obtain a better set\nof reconstructed fields. We present two approaches both based on Context\nEncoders. The first one infers the missing data via a minimization of the L2\npixel-wise reconstruction loss, plus a small adversarial penalisation. The\nsecond searches for the closest encoding of the corrupted flow configuration\nfrom a previously trained generator. Finally, we present a comparison with a\ndifferent data assimilation tool, based on Nudging, an equation-informed\nunbiased protocol, well known in the numerical weather prediction community.\nThe TURB-Rot database, this http URL, of roughly 300K 2d\nturbulent images is released and details on how to download it are given.",

In this\nwork, a novel approach is presented to extract acoustic propagation-based\nfeatures to automatically highlight the region below pleura, which is an\nimportant landmark in lung ultrasound (LUS). Subsequently, a multichannel input\nformed by using the acoustic physics-based feature maps is fused to train a\nneural network, referred to as LUSNet, to classify the LUS images into five\nclasses of varying severity of lung infection to track the progression of\nCOVID-19. In order to ensure that the proposed approach is agnostic to the type\nof acquisition, the LUSNet, which consists of a U-net architecture is trained\nin an unsupervised manner with the acoustic feature maps to ensure that the\nencoder-decoder architecture is learning features in the pleural region of\ninterest. A novel combination of the U-net output and the U-net encoder output\nis employed for the classification of severity of infection in the lung. A\ndetailed analysis of the proposed approach on LUS images over the infection to\nfull recovery period of ten confirmed COVID-19 subjects shows an average\nfive-fold cross-validation accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 97%, 93%,\nand 98% respectively over 5000 frames of COVID-19 videos.

In this work, we propose a multi-stage integration\nnetwork (i.e., MINet) for multi-contrast MRI SR, which explicitly models the\ndependencies between multi-contrast images at different stages to guide image\nSR.

Extensive experiments on fastMRI and real-world\nclinical datasets demonstrate that 1) our MINet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmulti-contrast SR methods in terms of various metrics and 2) our multi-stage\nintegration module is able to excavate complex interactions among\nmulti-contrast features at different stages, leading to improved target-image\nquality.",

          "description": "In this paper, we present a novel unpaired point cloud completion network,\nnamed Cycle4Completion, to infer the complete geometries from a partial 3D\nobject. Previous unpaired completion methods merely focus on the learning of\ngeometric correspondence from incomplete shapes to complete shapes, and ignore\nthe learning in the reverse direction, which makes them suffer from low\ncompletion accuracy due to the limited 3D shape understanding ability. To\naddress this problem, we propose two simultaneous cycle transformations between\nthe latent spaces of complete shapes and incomplete ones. The insight of cycle\ntransformation is to promote networks to understand 3D shapes by learning to\ngenerate complete or incomplete shapes from their complementary ones.\nSpecifically, the first cycle transforms shapes from incomplete domain to\ncomplete domain, and then projects them back to the incomplete domain. This\nprocess learns the geometric characteristic of complete shapes, and maintains\nthe shape consistency between the complete prediction and the incomplete input.\nSimilarly, the inverse cycle transformation starts from complete domain to\nincomplete domain, and goes back to complete domain to learn the characteristic\nof incomplete shapes. We provide a comprehensive evaluation in experiments,\nwhich shows that our model with the learned bidirectional geometry\ncorrespondence outperforms state-of-the-art unpaired completion methods.",

          "description": "Often in medical imaging, it is prohibitively challenging to produce enough\nboundary annotations to train deep neural networks for accurate tumor\nsegmentation. We propose the use of weak labels about whether an image presents\ntumor or whether it is absent to extend training over images that lack these\nannotations. Specifically, we propose a semi-supervised framework that employs\nunpaired image-to-image translation between two domains, presence vs. absence\nof cancer, as the unsupervised objective. We conjecture that translation helps\nsegmentation -- both require the target to be separated from the background. We\nencode images into two codes: one that is common to both domains and one that\nis unique to the presence domain. Decoding from the common code yields healthy\nimages; decoding with the addition of the unique code produces a residual\nchange to this image that adds cancer. Translation proceeds from presence to\nabsence and vice versa. In the first case, the tumor is re-added to the image\nand we successfully exploit the residual decoder to also perform segmentation.\nIn the second case, unique codes are sampled, producing a distribution of\npossible tumors. To validate the method, we created challenging synthetic tasks\nand tumor segmentation datasets from public BRATS (brain, MRI) and LitS (liver,\nCT) datasets. We show a clear improvement (0.83 Dice on brain, 0.74 on liver)\nover baseline semi-supervised training with autoencoding (0.73, 0.66) and a\nmean teacher approach (0.75, 0.69), demonstrating the ability to generalize\nfrom smaller distributions of annotated samples.",

          "description": "While contrastive approaches of self-supervised learning (SSL) learn\nrepresentations by minimizing the distance between two augmented views of the\nsame data point (positive pairs) and maximizing views from different data\npoints (negative pairs), recent \\emph{non-contrastive} SSL (e.g., BYOL and\nSimSiam) show remarkable performance {\\it without} negative pairs, with an\nextra learnable predictor and a stop-gradient operation. A fundamental question\narises: why do these methods not collapse into trivial representations? We\nanswer this question via a simple theoretical study and propose a novel\napproach, DirectPred, that \\emph{directly} sets the linear predictor based on\nthe statistics of its inputs, without gradient training. On ImageNet, it\nperforms comparably with more complex two-layer non-linear predictors that\nemploy BatchNorm and outperforms a linear predictor by $2.5\\%$ in 300-epoch\ntraining (and $5\\%$ in 60-epoch). DirectPred is motivated by our theoretical\nstudy of the nonlinear learning dynamics of non-contrastive SSL in simple\nlinear networks. Our study yields conceptual insights into how non-contrastive\nSSL methods learn, how they avoid representational collapse, and how multiple\nfactors, like predictor networks, stop-gradients, exponential moving averages,\nand weight decay all come into play.

          "description": "Automatic medical image segmentation has made great progress benefit from the\ndevelopment of deep learning. However, most existing methods are based on\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), which fail to build long-range\ndependencies and global context connections due to the limitation of receptive\nfield in convolution operation. Inspired by the success of Transformer in\nmodeling the long-range contextual information, some researchers have expended\nconsiderable efforts in designing the robust variants of Transformer-based\nU-Net. Moreover, the patch division used in vision transformers usually ignores\nthe pixel-level intrinsic structural features inside each patch. To alleviate\nthese problems, we propose a novel deep medical image segmentation framework\ncalled Dual Swin Transformer U-Net (DS-TransUNet), which might be the first\nattempt to concurrently incorporate the advantages of hierarchical Swin\nTransformer into both encoder and decoder of the standard U-shaped architecture\nto enhance the semantic segmentation quality of varying medical images. Unlike\nmany prior Transformer-based solutions, the proposed DS-TransUNet first adopts\ndual-scale encoder subnetworks based on Swin Transformer to extract the coarse\nand fine-grained feature representations of different semantic scales. As the\ncore component for our DS-TransUNet, a well-designed Transformer Interactive\nFusion (TIF) module is proposed to effectively establish global dependencies\nbetween features of different scales through the self-attention mechanism.\nFurthermore, we also introduce the Swin Transformer block into decoder to\nfurther explore the long-range contextual information during the up-sampling\nprocess. Extensive experiments across four typical tasks for medical image\nsegmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of DS-TransUNet, and show that our\napproach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

A direct way of applying deep learning to\nreversible steganography is to construct a pair of encoder and decoder, whose\nparameters are trained jointly, thereby learning the steganographic system as a\nwhole. This end-to-end framework, however, falls short of the reversibility\nrequirement because it is difficult for this kind of monolithic system, as a\nblack box, to create or duplicate intricate reversible mechanisms. In response\nto this issue, a recent approach is to carve up the steganographic system and\nwork on modules independently. In particular, neural networks are deployed in\nan analytics module to learn the data distribution, while an established\nmechanism is called upon to handle the remaining tasks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the modular framework and deploy deep neural networks in a\nreversible steganographic scheme referred to as prediction-error modulation, in\nwhich an analytics module serves the purpose of pixel intensity prediction.

In this paper, we introduce a novel concept\ntermed multi-path fully connected pattern (MPFC) to rethink the\ninterdependencies of topology pattern, accuracy and efficiency for ConvNets.\nInspired by MPFC, we further propose a dual-branch module named dynamic clone\ntransformer (DCT) where one branch generates multiple replicas from inputs and\nanother branch reforms those clones through a series of difference vectors\nconditional on inputs itself to produce more variants.

          "description": "The recent explosive interest on transformers has suggested their potential\nto become powerful ``universal\" models for computer vision tasks, such as\nclassification, detection, and segmentation. While those attempts mainly study\nthe discriminative models, we explore transformers on some more notoriously\ndifficult vision tasks, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our goal\nis to conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN completely free of\nconvolutions, using only pure transformer-based architectures. Our vanilla GAN\narchitecture, dubbed TransGAN, consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based\ngenerator that progressively increases feature resolution, and correspondingly\na multi-scale discriminator to capture simultaneously semantic contexts and\nlow-level textures. On top of them, we introduce the new module of grid\nself-attention for alleviating the memory bottleneck further, in order to scale\nup TransGAN to high-resolution generation. We also develop a unique training\nrecipe including a series of techniques that can mitigate the training\ninstability issues of TransGAN, such as data augmentation, modified\nnormalization, and relative position encoding. Our best architecture achieves\nhighly competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art GANs using\nconvolutional backbones. Specifically, TransGAN sets new state-of-the-art\ninception score of 10.43 and FID of 18.28 on STL-10, outperforming StyleGAN-V2.\nWhen it comes to higher-resolution (e.g. 256 x 256) generation tasks, such as\non CelebA-HQ and LSUN-Church, TransGAN continues to produce diverse visual\nexamples with high fidelity and impressive texture details. In addition, we\ndive deep into the transformer-based generation models to understand how their\nbehaviors differ from convolutional ones, by visualizing training dynamics.

          "description": "Retinex model has been applied to low-light image enhancement in many\nexisting methods. More appropriate decomposition of a low-light image can help\nachieve better image enhancement. In this paper, we propose a new pixel-level\nnon-local Haar transform based illumination and reflectance decomposition\nmethod (NLHD). The unique low-frequency coefficient of Haar transform on each\nsimilar pixel group is used to reconstruct the illumination component, and the\nrest of all high-frequency coefficients are employed to reconstruct the\nreflectance component. The complete similarity of pixels in a matched similar\npixel group and the simple separable Haar transform help to obtain more\nappropriate image decomposition; thus, the image is hardly sharpened in the\nimage brightness enhancement procedure. The exponential transform and\nlogarithmic transform are respectively implemented on the illumination\ncomponent. Then a minimum fusion strategy on the results of these two\ntransforms is utilized to achieve more natural illumination component\nenhancement. It can alleviate the mosaic artifacts produced in the darker\nregions by the exponential transform with a gamma value less than 1 and reduce\ninformation loss caused by excessive enhancement of the brighter regions due to\nthe logarithmic transform. Finally, the Retinex model is applied to the\nenhanced illumination and reflectance to achieve image enhancement. We also\ndevelop a local noise level estimation based noise suppression method and a\nnon-local saturation reduction based color deviation correction method. These\ntwo methods can respectively attenuate noise or color deviation usually\npresented in the enhanced results of the extremely dark low-light images.\nExperiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method can achieve\nbetter low-light image enhancement results on subjective and objective\nevaluations than most existing methods.",

          "description": "Event cameras, inspired by biological vision systems, provide a natural and\ndata efficient representation of visual information. Visual information is\nacquired in the form of events that are triggered by local brightness changes.\nEach pixel location of the camera's sensor records events asynchronously and\nindependently with very high temporal resolution. However, because most\nbrightness changes are triggered by relative motion of the camera and the\nscene, the events recorded at a single sensor location seldom correspond to the\nsame world point. To extract meaningful information from event cameras, it is\nhelpful to register events that were triggered by the same underlying world\npoint. In this work we propose a new model of event data that captures its\nnatural spatio-temporal structure. We start by developing a model for aligned\nevent data. That is, we develop a model for the data as though it has been\nperfectly registered already. In particular, we model the aligned data as a\nspatio-temporal Poisson point process. Based on this model, we develop a\nmaximum likelihood approach to registering events that are not yet aligned.\nThat is, we find transformations of the observed events that make them as\nlikely as possible under our model. In particular we extract the camera\nrotation that leads to the best event alignment. We show new state of the art\naccuracy for rotational velocity estimation on the DAVIS 240C dataset. In\naddition, our method is also faster and has lower computational complexity than\nseveral competing methods.",

          "description": "In recent years, the availability of digitized Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has\nenabled the use of deep learning-based computer vision techniques for automated\ndisease diagnosis. However, WSIs present unique computational and algorithmic\nchallenges. WSIs are gigapixel-sized ($\\sim$100K pixels), making them\ninfeasible to be used directly for training deep neural networks. Also, often\nonly slide-level labels are available for training as detailed annotations are\ntedious and can be time-consuming for experts. Approaches using\nmultiple-instance learning (MIL) frameworks have been shown to overcome these\nchallenges. Current state-of-the-art approaches divide the learning framework\ninto two decoupled parts: a convolutional neural network (CNN) for encoding the\npatches followed by an independent aggregation approach for slide-level\nprediction. In this approach, the aggregation step has no bearing on the\nrepresentations learned by the CNN encoder. We have proposed an end-to-end\nframework that clusters the patches from a WSI into ${k}$-groups, samples\n${k}'$ patches from each group for training, and uses an adaptive attention\nmechanism for slide level prediction; Cluster-to-Conquer (C2C). We have\ndemonstrated that dividing a WSI into clusters can improve the model training\nby exposing it to diverse discriminative features extracted from the patches.\nWe regularized the clustering mechanism by introducing a KL-divergence loss\nbetween the attention weights of patches in a cluster and the uniform\ndistribution. The framework is optimized end-to-end on slide-level\ncross-entropy, patch-level cross-entropy, and KL-divergence loss\n(Implementation: https://github.com/YashSharma/C2C).",

          "description": "Portrait matting is an important research problem with a wide range of\napplications, such as video conference app, image/video editing, and\npost-production. The goal is to predict an alpha matte that identifies the\neffect of each pixel on the foreground subject. Traditional approaches and most\nof the existing works utilized an additional input, e.g., trimap, background\nimage, to predict alpha matte. However, providing additional input is not\nalways practical. Besides, models are too sensitive to these additional inputs.\nIn this paper, we introduce an additional input-free approach to perform\nportrait matting using Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs). We divide the main\ntask into two subtasks. For this, we propose a segmentation network for the\nperson segmentation and the alpha generation network for alpha matte\nprediction. While the segmentation network takes an input image and produces a\ncoarse segmentation map, the alpha generation network utilizes the same input\nimage as well as a coarse segmentation map that is produced by the segmentation\nnetwork to predict the alpha matte. Besides, we present a segmentation encoding\nblock to downsample the coarse segmentation map and provide feature\nrepresentation to the residual block. Furthermore, we propose border loss to\npenalize only the borders of the subject separately which is more likely to be\nchallenging and we also adapt perceptual loss for portrait matting. To train\nthe proposed system, we combine two different popular training datasets to\nimprove the amount of data as well as diversity to address domain shift\nproblems in the inference time. We tested our model on three different\nbenchmark datasets, namely Adobe Image Matting dataset, Portrait Matting\ndataset, and Distinctions dataset. The proposed method outperformed the MODNet\nmethod that also takes a single input.",

          "description": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is rapidly closing the gap with supervised\nmethods on large computer vision benchmarks. A successful approach to SSL is to\nlearn embeddings which are invariant to distortions of the input sample.\nHowever, a recurring issue with this approach is the existence of trivial\nconstant solutions. Most current methods avoid such solutions by careful\nimplementation details. We propose an objective function that naturally avoids\ncollapse by measuring the cross-correlation matrix between the outputs of two\nidentical networks fed with distorted versions of a sample, and making it as\nclose to the identity matrix as possible. This causes the embedding vectors of\ndistorted versions of a sample to be similar, while minimizing the redundancy\nbetween the components of these vectors. The method is called Barlow Twins,\nowing to neuroscientist H. Barlow's redundancy-reduction principle applied to a\npair of identical networks. Barlow Twins does not require large batches nor\nasymmetry between the network twins such as a predictor network, gradient\nstopping, or a moving average on the weight updates. Intriguingly it benefits\nfrom very high-dimensional output vectors. Barlow Twins outperforms previous\nmethods on ImageNet for semi-supervised classification in the low-data regime,\nand is on par with current state of the art for ImageNet classification with a\nlinear classifier head, and for transfer tasks of classification and object\ndetection.",

          "description": "Cross-modal retrieval methods build a common representation space for samples\nfrom multiple modalities, typically from the vision and the language domains.\nFor images and their captions, the multiplicity of the correspondences makes\nthe task particularly challenging. Given an image (respectively a caption),\nthere are multiple captions (respectively images) that equally make sense. In\nthis paper, we argue that deterministic functions are not sufficiently powerful\nto capture such one-to-many correspondences. Instead, we propose to use\nProbabilistic Cross-Modal Embedding (PCME), where samples from the different\nmodalities are represented as probabilistic distributions in the common\nembedding space. Since common benchmarks such as COCO suffer from\nnon-exhaustive annotations for cross-modal matches, we propose to additionally\nevaluate retrieval on the CUB dataset, a smaller yet clean database where all\npossible image-caption pairs are annotated. We extensively ablate PCME and\ndemonstrate that it not only improves the retrieval performance over its\ndeterministic counterpart but also provides uncertainty estimates that render\nthe embeddings more interpretable.

          "description": "Magnetic resonance (MR) image acquisition is an inherently prolonged process,\nwhose acceleration has long been the subject of research. This is commonly\nachieved by obtaining multiple undersampled images, simultaneously, through\nparallel imaging. In this paper, we propose the Dual-Octave Network (DONet),\nwhich is capable of learning multi-scale spatial-frequency features from both\nthe real and imaginary components of MR data, for fast parallel MR image\nreconstruction. More specifically, our DONet consists of a series of\nDual-Octave convolutions (Dual-OctConv), which are connected in a dense manner\nfor better reuse of features. In each Dual-OctConv, the input feature maps and\nconvolutional kernels are first split into two components (ie, real and\nimaginary), and then divided into four groups according to their spatial\nfrequencies. Then, our Dual-OctConv conducts intra-group information updating\nand inter-group information exchange to aggregate the contextual information\nacross different groups. Our framework provides three appealing benefits: (i)\nIt encourages information interaction and fusion between the real and imaginary\ncomponents at various spatial frequencies to achieve richer representational\ncapacity. (ii) The dense connections between the real and imaginary groups in\neach Dual-OctConv make the propagation of features more efficient by feature\nreuse. (iii) DONet enlarges the receptive field by learning multiple\nspatial-frequency features of both the real and imaginary components. Extensive\nexperiments on two popular datasets (ie, clinical knee and fastMRI), under\ndifferent undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our model in accelerated parallel MR image reconstruction.",

Then the descriptors of the query images and the support classes are\nprojected into different non-linear spaces in our proposed similarity metric\nlearning network to learn discriminative projection factors. This design can\neffectively operate in the challenging and restricted condition of a FSFGIC\ntask for making the distance between the samples within the same class smaller\nand the distance between samples from different classes larger and for reducing\nthe coupling relationship between samples from different categories.\nFurthermore, a novel similarity measure based on the proposed non-linear data\nproject is presented for evaluating the relationships of feature information\nbetween a query image and a support set. It is worth to note that our proposed\narchitecture can be easily embedded into any episodic training mechanisms for\nend-to-end training from scratch.

          "description": "How can neural networks trained by contrastive learning extract features from\nthe unlabeled data? Why does contrastive learning usually need much stronger\ndata augmentations than supervised learning to ensure good representations?\nThese questions involve both the optimization and statistical aspects of deep\nlearning, but can hardly be answered by analyzing supervised learning, where\nthe target functions are the highest pursuit. Indeed, in self-supervised\nlearning, it is inevitable to relate to the optimization/generalization of\nneural networks to how they can encode the latent structures in the data, which\nwe refer to as the feature learning process.\n\nIn this work, we formally study how contrastive learning learns the feature\nrepresentations for neural networks by analyzing its feature learning process.\nWe consider the case where our data are comprised of two types of features: the\nmore semantically aligned sparse features which we want to learn from, and the\nother dense features we want to avoid. Theoretically, we prove that contrastive\nlearning using $\\mathbf{ReLU}$ networks provably learns the desired sparse\nfeatures if proper augmentations are adopted. We present an underlying\nprinciple called $\\textbf{feature decoupling}$ to explain the effects of\naugmentations, where we theoretically characterize how augmentations can reduce\nthe correlations of dense features between positive samples while keeping the\ncorrelations of sparse features intact, thereby forcing the neural networks to\nlearn from the self-supervision of sparse features. Empirically, we verified\nthat the feature decoupling principle matches the underlying mechanism of\ncontrastive learning in practice.",

          "description": "While the advent of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has greatly improved node\nand graph representation learning in many applications, the neighborhood\naggregation scheme exposes additional vulnerabilities to adversaries seeking to\nextract node-level information about sensitive attributes. In this paper, we\nstudy the problem of protecting sensitive attributes by information obfuscation\nwhen learning with graph structured data. We propose a framework to locally\nfilter out pre-determined sensitive attributes via adversarial training with\nthe total variation and the Wasserstein distance. Our method creates a strong\ndefense against inference attacks, while only suffering small loss in task\nperformance. Theoretically, we analyze the effectiveness of our framework\nagainst a worst-case adversary, and characterize an inherent trade-off between\nmaximizing predictive accuracy and minimizing information leakage. Experiments\nacross multiple datasets from recommender systems, knowledge graphs and quantum\nchemistry demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a robust defense\nacross various graph structures and tasks, while producing competitive GNN\nencoders for downstream tasks.",

          "description": "In the field of eXplainable AI (XAI), robust ``blackbox'' algorithms such as\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known for making high prediction\nperformance. However, the ability to explain and interpret these algorithms\nstill require innovation in the understanding of influential and, more\nimportantly, explainable features that directly or indirectly impact the\nperformance of predictivity. A number of methods existing in literature focus\non visualization techniques but the concepts of explainability and\ninterpretability still require rigorous definition. In view of the above needs,\nthis paper proposes an interaction-based methodology -- Influence Score\n(I-score) -- to screen out the noisy and non-informative variables in the\nimages hence it nourishes an environment with explainable and interpretable\nfeatures that are directly associated to feature predictivity. We apply the\nproposed method on a real world application in Pneumonia Chest X-ray Image data\nset and produced state-of-the-art results. We demonstrate how to apply the\nproposed approach for more general big data problems by improving the\nexplainability and interpretability without sacrificing the prediction\nperformance.

          "description": "Generative modeling has evolved to a notable field of machine learning. Deep\npolynomial neural networks (PNNs) have demonstrated impressive results in\nunsupervised image generation, where the task is to map an input vector (i.e.,\nnoise) to a synthesized image. However, the success of PNNs has not been\nreplicated in conditional generation tasks, such as super-resolution. Existing\nPNNs focus on single-variable polynomial expansions which do not fare well to\ntwo-variable inputs, i.e., the noise variable and the conditional variable. In\nthis work, we introduce a general framework, called CoPE, that enables a\npolynomial expansion of two input variables and captures their auto- and\ncross-correlations. We exhibit how CoPE can be trivially augmented to accept an\narbitrary number of input variables. CoPE is evaluated in five tasks\n(class-conditional generation, inverse problems, edges-to-image translation,\nimage-to-image translation, attribute-guided generation) involving eight\ndatasets. The thorough evaluation suggests that CoPE can be useful for tackling\ndiverse conditional generation tasks.",

Weak supervision may leverage existing medical\ndata to classify multiple diseases and organ systems. Purpose: To design\nmulti-disease classifiers for body computed tomography (CT) scans using\nautomatically extracted labels from radiology text reports. Materials &\nMethods: This retrospective study deployed rule-based algorithms to extract\n19,255 disease labels from reports of 13,667 body CT scans of 12,092 subjects\nfor training. Using a 3D DenseVNet, three organ systems were segmented:\nlungs/pleura, liver/gallbladder, and kidneys/ureters. For each organ, a 3D\nconvolutional neural network classified normality versus four common diseases.\nTesting was performed on an additional 2,158 CT volumes relative to 2,875\nmanually derived reference labels. Results: Manual validation of the extracted\nlabels confirmed 91 to 99% accuracy. Performance using the receiver operating\ncharacteristic area under the curve (AUC) for lungs/pleura labels were as\nfollows: atelectasis 0.77 (95% CI: 0.74 to 0.81), nodule 0.65 (0.61 to 0.69),\nemphysema 0.89 (0.86 to 0.92), effusion 0.97 (0.96 to 0.98), and normal 0.89\n(0.87 to 0.91). For liver/gallbladder: stone 0.62 (0.56 to 0.67), lesion 0.73\n(0.69 to 0.77), dilation 0.87 (0.84 to 0.90), fatty 0.89 (0.86 to 0.92), and\nnormal 0.82 (0.78 to 0.85). For kidneys/ureters: stone 0.83 (0.79 to 0.87),\natrophy 0.92 (0.89 to 0.94), lesion 0.68 (0.64 to 0.72), cyst 0.70 (0.66 to\n0.73), and normal 0.79 (0.75 to 0.83).

          "description": "Recently, chest X-ray report generation, which aims to automatically generate\ndescriptions of given chest X-ray images, has received growing research\ninterests. The key challenge of chest X-ray report generation is to accurately\ncapture and describe the abnormal regions. In most cases, the normal regions\ndominate the entire chest X-ray image, and the corresponding descriptions of\nthese normal regions dominate the final report. Due to such data bias,\nlearning-based models may fail to attend to abnormal regions. In this work, to\neffectively capture and describe abnormal regions, we propose the Contrastive\nAttention (CA) model. Instead of solely focusing on the current input image,\nthe CA model compares the current input image with normal images to distill the\ncontrastive information. The acquired contrastive information can better\nrepresent the visual features of abnormal regions. According to the experiments\non the public IU-X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, incorporating our CA into\nseveral existing models can boost their performance across most metrics. In\naddition, according to the analysis, the CA model can help existing models\nbetter attend to the abnormal regions and provide more accurate descriptions\nwhich are crucial for an interpretable diagnosis.

          "description": "Lung ultrasound (LUS) is an increasingly popular diagnostic imaging modality\nfor continuous and periodic monitoring of lung infection, given its advantages\nof non-invasiveness, non-ionizing nature, portability and easy disinfection.\nThe major landmarks assessed by clinicians for triaging using LUS are pleura, A\nand B lines. There have been many efforts for the automatic detection of these\nlandmarks. However, restricting to a few pre-defined landmarks may not reveal\nthe actual imaging biomarkers particularly in case of new pathologies like\nCOVID-19. Rather, the identification of key landmarks should be driven by data\ngiven the availability of a plethora of neural network algorithms. This work is\na first of its kind attempt towards unsupervised detection of the key LUS\nlandmarks in LUS videos of COVID-19 subjects during various stages of\ninfection. We adapted the relatively newer approach of transporter neural\nnetworks to automatically mark and track pleura, A and B lines based on their\nperiodic motion and relatively stable appearance in the videos. Initial results\non unsupervised pleura detection show an accuracy of 91.8% employing 1081 LUS\nvideo frames.",

In this work, we analyse\ncommon corruptions in the frequency domain, i.e., High Frequency corruptions\n(HFc, e.g., noise) and Low Frequency corruptions (LFc, e.g., blur). Although a\nsimple solution to HFc is low-pass filtering, ReLU -- a widely used Activation\nFunction (AF), does not have any filtering mechanism. In this work, we instill\nlow-pass filtering into the AF (LP-ReLU) to improve robustness against HFc. To\ndeal with LFc, we complement LP-ReLU with Discrete Cosine Transform based\naugmentation. LP-ReLU, coupled with DCT augmentation, enables a deep network to\ntackle the entire spectrum of corruption. We use CIFAR-10-C and Tiny ImageNet-C\nfor evaluation and demonstrate improvements of 5% and 7.3% in accuracy\nrespectively, compared to the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA). We further evaluate our\nmethod's stability on a variety of perturbations in CIFAR-10-P and Tiny\nImageNet-P, achieving new SOTA in these experiments as well.

Thus, the PPKED includes three modules:\nPosterior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE), Prior Knowledge Explorer (PrKE) and\nMulti-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD). In detail, PoKE explores the posterior\nknowledge, which provides explicit abnormal visual regions to alleviate visual\ndata bias; PrKE explores the prior knowledge from the prior medical knowledge\ngraph (medical knowledge) and prior radiology reports (working experience) to\nalleviate textual data bias.

Despite the integration of multisource remote sensing\ndata for performance enhancement, there are still challenges with acquiring and\nexploiting the complementary merits from multisource data.

A depthwise cross attention module is designed to extract\nself-correlation and cross-correlation from multisource feature pairs. In this\nway, meaningful complementary information is emphasized for classification.\nDFINet is optimized by coordinating consistency loss, discrimination loss, and\nclassification loss. Accordingly, DFINet reaches the standard solution-space\nunder the regularity of loss functions, while the spatial consistency and\nfeature discrimination are preserved.

          "description": "The presence of non-zero helicity in intergalactic magnetic fields is a\nsmoking gun for their primordial origin since they have to be generated by\nprocesses that break CP invariance. As an experimental signature for the\npresence of helical magnetic fields, an estimator $Q$ based on the triple\nscalar product of the wave-vectors of photons generated in electromagnetic\ncascades from, e.g., TeV blazars, has been suggested previously.

          "description": "Recent research in adversarially robust classifiers suggests their\nrepresentations tend to be aligned with human perception, which makes them\nattractive for image synthesis and restoration applications. Despite favorable\nempirical results on a few downstream tasks, their advantages are limited to\nslow and sensitive optimization-based techniques. Moreover, their use on\ngenerative models remains unexplored. This work proposes the use of robust\nrepresentations as a perceptual primitive for feature inversion models, and\nshow its benefits with respect to standard non-robust image features. We\nempirically show that adopting robust representations as an image prior\nsignificantly improves the reconstruction accuracy of CNN-based feature\ninversion models. Furthermore, it allows reconstructing images at multiple\nscales out-of-the-box. Following these findings, we propose an\nencoding-decoding network based on robust representations and show its\nadvantages for applications such as anomaly detection, style transfer and image\ndenoising.",

Because medical\nimages often contain multiple classes of interest per image, a standard\nimage-level CL for these images is not applicable.

These patches are meaningfully constructed\nusing the semantic information of different classes obtained via pseudo\nlabeling.

In this work we: (i)\ntheoretically motivate why ensembles are a particularly suitable choice as base\nmodels for RS, and (ii) empirically confirm this choice, obtaining state of the\nart results in multiple settings. The key insight of our work is that the\nreduced variance of ensembles over the perturbations introduced in RS leads to\nsignificantly more consistent classifications for a given input, in turn\nleading to substantially increased certifiable radii for difficult samples. We\nalso introduce key optimizations which enable an up to 50-fold decrease in\nsample complexity of RS, thus drastically reducing its computational overhead.\nExperimentally, we show that ensembles of only 3 to 10 classifiers consistently\nimprove on the strongest single model with respect to their average certified\nradius (ACR) by 5% to 21% on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

Previous attempts heavily\nrely on vast quantities of training examples with manual annotation. However,\nin some practical cases, it is difficult to obtain a large number of samples\nfor inspection. To combat it, we propose a hierarchical texture-perceiving\ngenerative adversarial network (HTP-GAN) that is learned from the one-shot\nnormal image in an unsupervised scheme. Specifically, the HTP-GAN contains a\npyramid of convolutional GANs that can capture the global structure and\nfine-grained representation of an image simultaneously. This innovation helps\ndistinguishing defective surface regions from normal ones. In addition, in the\ndiscriminator, a texture-perceiving module is devised to capture the spatially\ninvariant representation of normal image via directional convolutions, making\nit more sensitive to defective areas.

To this end, we provide a\nnovel structure-regularized attention mechanism, which formalizes feature\ninteraction as structural factorization through the use of a pair of\nlight-weight operations.

Comprehensive studies on\nmultiple tasks and empirical comparisons with modern attention mechanisms\ndemonstrate the gains brought by our method in terms of both performance and\nmodel complexity.

Motivated by the intrinsic sparsity of the latent space, the basis\nis discovered by solving the low-rank approximation problem of the differential\nof the partial network. Moreover, the local traversal basis leads to a natural\niterative traversal on the latent space. Iterative Curve-Traversal shows stable\ntraversal on images, since the trajectory of latent code stays close to the\nlatent space even under the strong perturbations compared to the linear\ntraversal. This stability provides far more diverse variations of the given\nimage. Although the proposed method can be applied to various GAN models, we\nfocus on the W-space of the StyleGAN2, which is renowned for showing the better\ndisentanglement of the latent factors of variation. Our quantitative and\nqualitative analysis provides evidence showing that the W-space is still\nglobally warped while showing a certain degree of global consistency of\ninterpretable variation. In particular, we introduce some metrics on the\nGrassmannian manifolds to quantify the global warpage of the W-space and the\nsubspace traversal to test the stability of traversal directions.",

Each patch of a mosaic is encoded to a feature vector using\na deep network. The feature extractor model is fine-tuned using hierarchical\ntarget labels of WSIs, i.e., anatomic site and primary diagnosis. In the second\nstage, a set of encoded patch-level features from a WSI is used to compute the\nprimary diagnosis probability through the proposed Pay Attention with Focus\nscheme, an attention-weighted averaging of predicted probabilities for all\npatches of a mosaic modulated by a trainable focal factor.

However, the existing species\nrecognition apps do not take in consideration the wide variety of endemic and\nnative (Chilean) species, which leads to wrong species predictions. This study\nintroduces the development of a chilean species dataset and an optimized\nclassification model implemented to a mobile app. Method: the data set was\nbuilt by putting together pictures of several species captured on the field and\nby selecting some pictures available from other datasets available online.\nConvolutional neural networks were used in order to develop the images\nprediction models. The networks were trained by performing a sensitivity\nanalysis, validating with k-fold cross validation and performing tests with\ndifferent hyper-parameters, optimizers, convolutional layers, and learning\nrates in order to identify and choose the best models and then put them\ntogether in one classification model. Results: The final data set was\ncompounded by 46 species, including native species, endemic and exotic from\nChile, with 6120 training pictures and 655 testing pictures. The best models\nwere implemented on a mobile app, obtaining a 95% correct prediction rate with\nrespect to the set of tests. Conclusion: The app developed in this study is\ncapable of classifying species with a high level of accuracy, depending on the\nstate of the art of the artificial vision and it can also show relevant\ninformation related to the classified species.",

          "description": "Cross-modal correlation provides an inherent supervision for video\nunsupervised representation learning. Existing methods focus on distinguishing\ndifferent video clips by visual and audio representations. We human visual\nperception could attend to regions where sounds are made, and our auditory\nperception could also ground their frequencies of sounding objects, which we\ncall bidirectional local correspondence. Such supervision is intuitive but not\nwell explored in the contrastive learning framework. This paper introduces a\npretext task, Cross-Modal Attention Consistency (CMAC), for exploring the\nbidirectional local correspondence property. The CMAC approach aims to align\nthe regional attention generated purely from the visual signal with the target\nattention generated under the guidance of acoustic signal, and do a similar\nalignment for frequency grounding on the acoustic attention. Accompanied by a\nremoulded cross-modal contrastive loss where we consider additional\nwithin-modal interactions, the CMAC approach works effectively for enforcing\nthe bidirectional alignment. Extensive experiments on six downstream benchmarks\ndemonstrate that CMAC can improve the state-of-the-art performance on both\nvisual and audio modalities.",

This adversarial loss guarantees the map is diverse -- a very wide\nrange of anime can be produced from a single content code. Under plausible\nassumptions, the map is not just diverse, but also correctly represents the\nprobability of an anime, conditioned on an input face. In contrast, current\nmultimodal generation procedures cannot capture the complex styles that appear\nin anime. Extensive quantitative experiments support the idea the map is\ncorrect. Extensive qualitative results show that the method can generate a much\nmore diverse range of styles than SOTA comparisons.

          "description": "Medical imaging datasets usually exhibit domain shift due to the variations\nof scanner vendors, imaging protocols, etc. This raises the concern about the\ngeneralization capacity of machine learning models. Domain generalization (DG),\nwhich aims to learn a model from multiple source domains such that it can be\ndirectly generalized to unseen test domains, seems particularly promising to\nmedical imaging community. To address DG, recent model-agnostic meta-learning\n(MAML) has been introduced, which transfers the knowledge from previous\ntraining tasks to facilitate the learning of novel testing tasks. However, in\nclinical practice, there are usually only a few annotated source domains\navailable, which decreases the capacity of training task generation and thus\nincreases the risk of overfitting to training tasks in the paradigm. In this\npaper, we propose a novel DG scheme of episodic training with task augmentation\non medical imaging classification. Based on meta-learning, we develop the\nparadigm of episodic training to construct the knowledge transfer from episodic\ntraining-task simulation to the real testing task of DG. Motivated by the\nlimited number of source domains in real-world medical deployment, we consider\nthe unique task-level overfitting and we propose task augmentation to enhance\nthe variety during training task generation to alleviate it. With the\nestablished learning framework, we further exploit a novel meta-objective to\nregularize the deep embedding of training domains. To validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, we perform experiments on\nhistopathological images and abdominal CT images.",

In this work, we\nestablish a key connection between counterfactual fairness and stability and\nleverage it to propose a novel framework, NIFTY (uNIfying Fairness and\nstabiliTY), which can be used with any GNN to learn fair and stable\nrepresentations. We introduce a novel objective function that simultaneously\naccounts for fairness and stability and develop a layer-wise weight\nnormalization using the Lipschitz constant to enhance neural message passing in\nGNNs. In doing so, we enforce fairness and stability both in the objective\nfunction as well as in the GNN architecture. Further, we show theoretically\nthat our layer-wise weight normalization promotes counterfactual fairness and\nstability in the resulting representations. We introduce three new graph\ndatasets comprising of high-stakes decisions in criminal justice and financial\nlending domains. Extensive experimentation with the above datasets demonstrates\nthe efficacy of our framework.",

A recent work has shown that an algorithm for machine\nlearning by quantum computer, quantum machine learning (QML), can exponentially\nspeed up sampling of optimized random features, even without imposing\nrestrictive assumptions on sparsity and low-rankness of matrices that had\nlimited applicability of conventional QML algorithms; this QML algorithm makes\nit possible to significantly reduce and provably minimize the required number\nof features for regression tasks. However, a major interest in the field of QML\nis how widely the advantages of quantum computation can be exploited, not only\nin the regression tasks. We here construct a QML algorithm for a classification\ntask accelerated by the optimized random features. We prove that the QML\nalgorithm for sampling optimized random features, combined with stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD), can achieve state-of-the-art exponential convergence\nspeed of reducing classification error in a classification task under a\nlow-noise condition; at the same time, our algorithm with optimized random\nfeatures can take advantage of the significant reduction of the required number\nof features so as to accelerate each iteration in the SGD and evaluation of the\nclassifier obtained from our algorithm.

Both\ntypes of approaches often involve learning neural feature extractors such that\nthe embeddings of data exhibit high cross-view correlations. Although\nintuitive, the effectiveness of correlation-based neural embedding is only\nempirically validated. This work puts forth a theory-backed framework for\nunsupervised multiview learning. Our development starts with proposing a\nmultiview model, where each view is a nonlinear mixture of shared and private\ncomponents. Consequently, the learning problem boils down to shared/private\ncomponent identification and disentanglement. Under this model, latent\ncorrelation maximization is shown to guarantee the extraction of the shared\ncomponents across views (up to certain ambiguities). In addition, the private\ninformation in each view can be provably disentangled from the shared using\nproper regularization design.

Pure Machine Learning (ML) approaches often\nfail in the small sample regime and cannot provide actionable insights beyond\npredictions. A promising modification has been to incorporate expert domain\nknowledge into ML models. The application we consider is predicting the\nprogression of disease under medications, where a plethora of domain knowledge\nis available from pharmacology. Pharmacological models describe the dynamics of\ncarefully-chosen medically meaningful variables in terms of systems of Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODEs).

To close this gap, we propose the latent hybridisation\nmodel (LHM) that integrates a system of expert-designed ODEs with\nmachine-learned Neural ODEs to fully describe the dynamics of the system and to\nlink the expert and latent variables to observable quantities. We evaluated LHM\non synthetic data as well as real-world intensive care data of COVID-19\npatients.

          "description": "Besides its linguistic content, our speech is rich in biometric information\nthat can be inferred by classifiers. Learning privacy-preserving\nrepresentations for speech signals enables downstream tasks without sharing\nunnecessary, private information about an individual. In this paper, we show\nthat protecting gender information in speech is more effective than modelling\nspeaker-identity information only when generating a non-sensitive\nrepresentation of speech. Our method relies on reconstructing speech by\ndecoding linguistic content along with gender information using a variational\nautoencoder. Specifically, we exploit disentangled representation learning to\nencode information about different attributes into separate subspaces that can\nbe factorised independently. We present a novel way to encode gender\ninformation and disentangle two sensitive biometric identifiers, namely gender\nand identity, in a privacy-protecting setting. Experiments on the LibriSpeech\ndataset show that gender recognition and speaker verification can be reduced to\na random guess, protecting against classification-based attacks.",

There exist a few methods that allow to visualise and explain why a\nmodel has made a certain prediction. Those methods, however, allow\nvisualisation of the link between the input and output of the model without\npresenting how the model learns to represent the data used to train the model\nas whole. In this paper, a method that addresses that issue is proposed, with a\nfocus on visualising multi-dimensional time-series data. Experiments on a\nhigh-frequency stock market dataset show that the method provides fast and\ndiscernible visualisations.

Indeed, by exposing and\naccentuating various types of latent structure within the environment,\ndifferent classes of state abstraction have enabled improved theoretical\nguarantees and empirical performance. When dealing with state abstractions that\ncapture structure in the value function, however, a standard assumption is that\nthe true abstraction has been supplied or unrealistically computed a priori,\nleaving open the question of how to efficiently uncover such latent structure\nwhile jointly seeking out optimal behavior. Taking inspiration from the bandit\nliterature, we propose that an agent seeking out latent task structure must\nexplicitly represent and maintain its uncertainty over that structure as part\nof its overall uncertainty about the environment. We introduce a practical\nalgorithm for doing this using two posterior distributions over state\nabstractions and abstract-state values.

Despite the extraordinary effectiveness of shortcuts, there\nremain important questions on the underlying mechanism and associated\nfunctionalities. For example, why are shortcuts powerful?

Then, we present a novel\nwidth-bounded universal approximator in contrast to depth-bounded universal\napproximators, and also extend the approximation result to a family of networks\nsuch that in the view of approximation ability, these networks are equally\ncompetent. Furthermore, we use the generalization bound theory to show that the\ninvestigated shortcut topology enjoys an excellent generalizability.

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) has been proposed to allow collaborative training of\nmachine learning (ML) models among multiple parties where each party can keep\nits data private. In this paradigm, only model updates, such as model weights\nor gradients, are shared. Many existing approaches have focused on horizontal\nFL, where each party has the entire feature set and labels in the training data\nset. However, many real scenarios follow a vertically-partitioned FL setup,\nwhere a complete feature set is formed only when all the datasets from the\nparties are combined, and the labels are only available to a single party.\nPrivacy-preserving vertical FL is challenging because complete sets of labels\nand features are not owned by one entity. Existing approaches for vertical FL\nrequire multiple peer-to-peer communications among parties, leading to lengthy\ntraining times, and are restricted to (approximated) linear models and just two\nparties. To close this gap, we propose FedV, a framework for secure gradient\ncomputation in vertical settings for several widely used ML models such as\nlinear models, logistic regression, and support vector machines. FedV removes\nthe need for peer-to-peer communication among parties by using functional\nencryption schemes; this allows FedV to achieve faster training times. It also\nworks for larger and changing sets of parties. We empirically demonstrate the\napplicability for multiple types of ML models and show a reduction of 10%-70%\nof training time and 80% to 90% in data transfer with respect to the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

Prior methods towards this goal, including model\ncompression and network architecture search (NAS), are largely performed\nindependently and do not fully consider compiler-level optimizations which is a\nmust-do for mobile acceleration. In this work, we first propose (i) a general\ncategory of fine-grained structured pruning applicable to various DNN layers,\nand (ii) a comprehensive, compiler automatic code generation framework\nsupporting different DNNs and different pruning schemes, which bridge the gap\nof model compression and NAS. We further propose NPAS, a compiler-aware unified\nnetwork pruning, and architecture search. To deal with large search space, we\npropose a meta-modeling procedure based on reinforcement learning with fast\nevaluation and Bayesian optimization, ensuring the total number of training\nepochs comparable with representative NAS frameworks.

This deficiency remains a key\nchallenge when applying CNNs in important domains. Recent work on explanations\nthrough feature importance of approximate linear models has moved from\ninput-level features (pixels or segments) to features from mid-layer feature\nmaps in the form of concept activation vectors (CAVs). CAVs contain\nconcept-level information and could be learned via clustering. In this work, we\nrethink the ACE algorithm of Ghorbani et~al., proposing an alternative\ninvertible concept-based explanation (ICE) framework to overcome its\nshortcomings. Based on the requirements of fidelity (approximate models to\ntarget models) and interpretability (being meaningful to people), we design\nmeasurements and evaluate a range of matrix factorization methods with our\nframework. We find that non-negative concept activation vectors (NCAVs) from\nnon-negative matrix factorization provide superior performance in\ninterpretability and fidelity based on computational and human subject\nexperiments.

Yet, it has not\nachieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level\nprediction compared to mainstream GNN variants.

In this\npaper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the\nstandard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a\nbroad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent\nOGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the\ngraph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a\ngraph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective\nstructural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured\ndata. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of\nGraphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural\ninformation of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the\nspecial cases of Graphormer.",

          "description": "Robust multi-agent trajectory prediction is essential for the safe control of\nrobots and vehicles that interact with humans. Many existing methods treat\nsocial and temporal information separately and therefore fall short of\nmodelling the joint future trajectories of all agents in a socially consistent\nway. To address this, we propose a new class of Latent Variable Sequential Set\nTransformers which autoregressively model multi-agent trajectories. We refer to\nthese architectures as \"AutoBots\". AutoBots model the contents of sets (e.g.\nrepresenting the properties of agents in a scene) over time and employ\nmulti-head self-attention blocks over these sequences of sets to encode the\nsociotemporal relationships between the different actors of a scene. This\nproduces either the trajectory of one ego-agent or a distribution over the\nfuture trajectories for all agents under consideration. Our approach works for\ngeneral sequences of sets and we provide illustrative experiments modelling the\nsequential structure of the multiple strokes that make up symbols in the\nOmniglot data. For the single-agent prediction case, we validate our model on\nthe NuScenes motion prediction task and achieve competitive results on the\nglobal leaderboard. In the multi-agent forecasting setting, we validate our\nmodel on TrajNet. We find that our method outperforms physical extrapolation\nand recurrent network baselines and generates scene-consistent trajectories.",

However, such extraction of the domain-invariant representation is a\nnon-trivial task for time series data, due to the complex dependence among the\ntimestamps. In detail, in the fully dependent time series, a small change of\nthe time lags or the offsets may lead to difficulty in the domain invariant\nextraction. Fortunately, the stability of the causality inspired us to explore\nthe domain invariant structure of the data. To reduce the difficulty in the\ndiscovery of causal structure, we relax it to the sparse associative structure\nand propose a novel sparse associative structure alignment model for domain\nadaptation. First, we generate the segment set to exclude the obstacle of\noffsets. Second, the intra-variables and inter-variables sparse attention\nmechanisms are devised to extract associative structure time-series data with\nconsidering time lags.

Our contribution is to extend the identifiability theory of\ndeep generative models for a very broad class of structured models. While\nprevious works have shown identifiability for specific classes of time-series\nmodels, our theorems extend this to more general temporal structures as well as\nto models with more complex structures such as spatial dependencies. In\nparticular, we establish the major result that identifiability for this\nframework holds even in the presence of noise of unknown distribution. The\nSNICA setting therefore subsumes all the existing nonlinear ICA models for\ntime-series and also allows for new much richer identifiable models. Finally,\nas an example of our framework's flexibility, we introduce the first nonlinear\nICA model for time-series that combines the following very useful properties:\nit accounts for both nonstationarity and autocorrelation in a fully\nunsupervised setting; performs dimensionality reduction; models hidden states;\nand enables principled estimation and inference by variational\nmaximum-likelihood.",

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution\nfor face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and\npositioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such algorithms\ncan be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and\nother indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus.

The\ninference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing\nsufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably\nlow latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain\non the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address\nthese challenges, we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for\ncorrect facial-mask wear and positioning. The classification task is\nimplemented on an embedded FPGA, performing high-throughput binary operations.\nClassification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling\nmulti-camera, speed-gate settings or statistics collection in crowd settings.\nWhen deployed on a single entrance or gate, the idle power consumption is\nreduced to 1.6W, improving the battery-life of the device. We achieve an\naccuracy of up to 98% for four wearing positions of the MaskedFace-Net dataset.\nTo maintain equivalent classification accuracy for all face structures,\nskin-tones, hair types, and mask types, the algorithms are tested for their\nability to generalize the relevant features over all subjects using the\nGrad-CAM approach.",

Furthermore, in some settings detection is intrinsically\ndifficult e.g. finding small object instances in high resolution images. As a\nresult, multi-label training data is often plagued by false negatives. We\nconsider the hardest version of this problem, where annotators provide only one\nrelevant label for each image. As a result, training sets will have only one\npositive label per image and no confirmed negatives. We explore this special\ncase of learning from missing labels across four different multi-label image\nclassification datasets for both linear classifiers and end-to-end fine-tuned\ndeep networks. We extend existing multi-label losses to this setting and\npropose novel variants that constrain the number of expected positive labels\nduring training.

          "description": "Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCNs) to edge-perturbing attacks, such as maliciously inserting or\ndeleting graph edges. However, a theoretical proof of such vulnerability\nremains a big challenge, and effective defense schemes are still open issues.\nIn this paper, we first generalize the formulation of edge-perturbing attacks\nand strictly prove the vulnerability of GCNs to such attacks in node\nclassification tasks. Following this, an anonymous graph convolutional network,\nnamed AN-GCN, is proposed to counter against edge-perturbing attacks.\nSpecifically, we present a node localization theorem to demonstrate how the GCN\nlocates nodes during its training phase. In addition, we design a staggered\nGaussian noise based node position generator, and devise a spectral graph\nconvolution based discriminator in detecting the generated node positions.\nFurther, we give the optimization of the above generator and discriminator.\nAN-GCN can classify nodes without taking their position as input. It is\ndemonstrated that the AN-GCN is secure against edge-perturbing attacks in node\nclassification tasks, as AN-GCN classifies nodes without the edge information\nand thus makes it impossible for attackers to perturb edges anymore. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of the general edge-perturbing\nattack model in manipulating the classification results of the target nodes.\nMore importantly, the proposed AN-GCN can achieve 82.7% in node classification\naccuracy without the edge-reading permission, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art GCN.",

          "description": "Segmentation algorithms for medical images are widely studied for various\nclinical and research purposes. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient\nmethod for medical image segmentation under noisy labels. The method operates\nunder a deep learning paradigm, incorporating four novel contributions.\nFirstly, a residual interconnection is explored in different scale encoders to\ntransfer gradient information efficiently. Secondly, four copy-and-crop\nconnections are replaced by residual-block-based concatenation to alleviate the\ndisparity between encoders and decoders. Thirdly, convolutional attention\nmodules for feature refinement are studied on all scale decoders. Finally, an\nadaptive denoising learning strategy (ADL) is introduced into the training\nprocess to avoid too much influence from the noisy labels. Experimental results\nare illustrated on a publicly available benchmark database of spine CTs. Our\nproposed method achieves competitive performance against other state-of-the-art\nmethods over a variety of different evaluation measures.",

          "description": "Deep neural models in recent years have been successful in almost every\nfield, including extremely complex problem statements. However, these models\nare huge in size, with millions (and even billions) of parameters, thus\ndemanding more heavy computation power and failing to be deployed on edge\ndevices. Besides, the performance boost is highly dependent on redundant\nlabeled data. To achieve faster speeds and to handle the problems caused by the\nlack of data, knowledge distillation (KD) has been proposed to transfer\ninformation learned from one model to another. KD is often characterized by the\nso-called `Student-Teacher' (S-T) learning framework and has been broadly\napplied in model compression and knowledge transfer. This paper is about KD and\nS-T learning, which are being actively studied in recent years. First, we aim\nto provide explanations of what KD is and how/why it works. Then, we provide a\ncomprehensive survey on the recent progress of KD methods together with S-T\nframeworks typically for vision tasks. In general, we consider some fundamental\nquestions that have been driving this research area and thoroughly generalize\nthe research progress and technical details. Additionally, we systematically\nanalyze the research status of KD in vision applications. Finally, we discuss\nthe potentials and open challenges of existing methods and prospect the future\ndirections of KD and S-T learning.",

          "description": "The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial attack, which\nis an attack that can mislead state-of-the-art classifiers into making an\nincorrect classification with high confidence by deliberately perturbing the\noriginal inputs, raises concerns about the robustness of DNNs to such attacks.\nAdversarial training, which is the main heuristic method for improving\nadversarial robustness and the first line of defense against adversarial\nattacks, requires many sample-by-sample calculations to increase training size\nand is usually insufficiently strong for an entire network. This paper provides\na new perspective on the issue of adversarial robustness, one that shifts the\nfocus from the network as a whole to the critical part of the region close to\nthe decision boundary corresponding to a given class. From this perspective, we\npropose a method to generate a single but image-agnostic adversarial\nperturbation that carries the semantic information implying the directions to\nthe fragile parts on the decision boundary and causes inputs to be\nmisclassified as a specified target. We call the adversarial training based on\nsuch perturbations \"region adversarial training\" (RAT), which resembles\nclassical adversarial training but is distinguished in that it reinforces the\nsemantic information missing in the relevant regions. Experimental results on\nthe MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that this approach greatly improves\nadversarial robustness even using a very small dataset from the training data;\nmoreover, it can defend against FGSM adversarial attacks that have a completely\ndifferent pattern from the model seen during retraining.",

We investigate\nover-parameterized linear regression models focusing on the minimum norm\nsolution: This is the solution with the minimal norm that attains a perfect fit\nto the training set. We utilize the recently proposed predictive normalized\nmaximum likelihood (pNML) learner which is the min-max regret solution for the\ndistribution-free setting.

          "description": "Recent works in self-supervised learning have advanced the state-of-the-art\nby relying on the contrastive learning paradigm, which learns representations\nby pushing positive pairs, or similar examples from the same class, closer\ntogether while keeping negative pairs far apart. Despite the empirical\nsuccesses, theoretical foundations are limited -- prior analyses assume\nconditional independence of the positive pairs given the same class label, but\nrecent empirical applications use heavily correlated positive pairs (i.e., data\naugmentations of the same image). Our work analyzes contrastive learning\nwithout assuming conditional independence of positive pairs using a novel\nconcept of the augmentation graph on data. Edges in this graph connect\naugmentations of the same data, and ground-truth classes naturally form\nconnected sub-graphs. We propose a loss that performs spectral decomposition on\nthe population augmentation graph and can be succinctly written as a\ncontrastive learning objective on neural net representations. Minimizing this\nobjective leads to features with provable accuracy guarantees under linear\nprobe evaluation. By standard generalization bounds, these accuracy guarantees\nalso hold when minimizing the training contrastive loss. Empirically, the\nfeatures learned by our objective can match or outperform several strong\nbaselines on benchmark vision datasets. In all, this work provides the first\nprovable analysis for contrastive learning where guarantees for linear probe\nevaluation can apply to realistic empirical settings.",

          "description": "Reliable detection of the prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD)\nremains difficult even today because, unlike other neurocognitive impairments,\nthere is no definitive diagnosis of AD in vivo. In this context, existing\nresearch has shown that patients often develop language impairment even in mild\nAD conditions. We propose a multimodal deep learning method that utilizes\nspeech and the corresponding transcript simultaneously to detect AD. For audio\nsignals, the proposed audio-based network, a convolutional neural network (CNN)\nbased model, predicts the diagnosis for multiple speech segments, which are\ncombined for the final prediction. Similarly, we use contextual embedding\nextracted from BERT concatenated with a CNN-generated embedding for classifying\nthe transcript. The individual predictions of the two models are then combined\nto make the final classification. We also perform experiments to analyze the\nmodel performance when Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) system generated\ntranscripts are used instead of manual transcription in the text-based model.\nThe proposed method achieves 85.3% 10-fold cross-validation accuracy when\ntrained and evaluated on the Dementiabank Pitt corpus.",

          "description": "Overfitting is one of the critical problems in deep neural networks. Many\nregularization schemes try to prevent overfitting blindly. However, they\ndecrease the convergence speed of training algorithms. Adaptive regularization\nschemes can solve overfitting more intelligently. They usually do not affect\nthe entire network weights. This paper detects a subset of the weighting layers\nthat cause overfitting. The overfitting recognizes by matrix and tensor\ncondition numbers. An adaptive regularization scheme entitled Adaptive Low-Rank\n(ALR) is proposed that converges a subset of the weighting layers to their\nLow-Rank Factorization (LRF). It happens by minimizing a new Tikhonov-based\nloss function. ALR also encourages lazy weights to contribute to the\nregularization when epochs grow up. It uses a damping sequence to increment\nlayer selection likelihood in the last generations. Thus before falling the\ntraining accuracy, ALR reduces the lazy weights and regularizes the network\nsubstantially. The experimental results show that ALR regularizes the deep\nnetworks well with high training speed and low resource usage.",

We observe that UNMT models which use \\textit{word\nshuffle} noise (as in case of Undreamt) can generate correct words, but fail to\nstitch them together to form phrases. As a result, words of the translated\nsentence look \\textit{scrambled}, resulting in decreased BLEU.

To\ntest our hypothesis, we experiment by retraining UNMT models with a simple\n\\textit{retraining} strategy. We stop the training of the Denoising UNMT model\nafter a pre-decided number of iterations and resume the training for the\nremaining iterations -- which number is also pre-decided -- using original\nsentence as input without adding any noise. Our proposed solution achieves\nsignificant performance improvement UNMT models that train conventionally.

          "description": "Understanding the semantics of human movement -- the what, how and why of the\nmovement -- is an important problem that requires datasets of human actions\nwith semantic labels. Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale\nvideo datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D\nhuman motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body\nmotions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we\npresent BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions\nbeing performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about\n43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of\nabstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and\nframe labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame\nlabel is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the\nmocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence\nlabels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action\ncategories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action\nrecognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To\ndemonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of\nmodels on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting\nlearning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve\nas a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition.

We first evaluate\nmodels on toy multimodal MNIST datasets and then apply them to a multimodal\nneuroimaging dataset with Alzheimer's disease patients.

Meanwhile, pairwise\nmanners have shown great potential in supervised metric learning and\nunsupervised contrastive learning. Thus, a natural question is raised: does\nlearning in a pairwise manner mitigate label noise? To give an affirmative\nanswer, in this paper, we propose a framework called Class2Simi: it transforms\ndata points with noisy class labels to data pairs with noisy similarity labels,\nwhere a similarity label denotes whether a pair shares the class label or not.\nThrough this transformation, the reduction of the noise rate is theoretically\nguaranteed, and hence it is in principle easier to handle noisy similarity\nlabels. Amazingly, DNNs that predict the clean class labels can be trained from\nnoisy data pairs if they are first pretrained from noisy data points.\nClass2Simi is computationally efficient because not only this transformation is\non-the-fly in mini-batches, but also it just changes loss computation on top of\nmodel prediction into a pairwise manner.

We propose a novel model that expands on the Latent\nDirichlet Allocation by modeling strong dependence among the words in the same\ndocument, with user-level topic distributions. We also simultaneously cluster\nusers, removing the need for post-hoc cluster estimation and improving topic\nestimation by shrinking noisy user-level topic distributions towards typical\nvalues. Our method performs as well as -- or better -- than traditional\napproaches to problems arising in short text, and we demonstrate its usefulness\non a dataset of tweets from United States Senators, recovering both meaningful\ntopics and clusters that reflect partisan ideology.",

          "description": "Multi-head attention plays a crucial role in the recent success of\nTransformer models, which leads to consistent performance improvements over\nconventional attention in various applications. The popular belief is that this\neffectiveness stems from the ability of jointly attending multiple positions.\nIn this paper, we first demonstrate that jointly attending multiple positions\nis not a unique feature of multi-head attention, as multi-layer single-head\nattention also attends multiple positions and is more effective. Then, we\nsuggest the main advantage of the multi-head attention is the training\nstability, since it has less number of layers than the single-head attention,\nwhen attending the same number of positions. For example, 24-layer 16-head\nTransformer (BERT-large) and 384-layer single-head Transformer has the same\ntotal attention head number and roughly the same model size, while the\nmulti-head one is significantly shallower. Meanwhile, we show that, with recent\nadvances in deep learning, we can successfully stabilize the training of the\n384-layer Transformer.

          "description": "Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is widely used\nto complement ultrasound examinations and x-ray mammography during the early\ndetection and diagnosis of breast cancer. However, images generated by various\nMRI scanners (e.g. GE Healthcare vs Siemens) differ both in intensity and noise\ndistribution, preventing algorithms trained on MRIs from one scanner to\ngeneralize to data from other scanners successfully. We propose a method for\nimage normalization to solve this problem. MRI normalization is challenging\nbecause it requires both normalizing intensity values and mapping between the\nnoise distributions of different scanners. We utilize a cycle-consistent\ngenerative adversarial network to learn a bidirectional mapping between MRIs\nproduced by GE Healthcare and Siemens scanners. This allows us learning the\nmapping between two different scanner types without matched data, which is not\ncommonly available. To ensure the preservation of breast shape and structures\nwithin the breast, we propose two technical innovations. First, we incorporate\na mutual information loss with the CycleGAN architecture to ensure that the\nstructure of the breast is maintained. Second, we propose a modified\ndiscriminator architecture which utilizes a smaller field-of-view to ensure the\npreservation of finer details in the breast tissue. Quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations show that the second proposed method was able to\nconsistently preserve a high level of detail in the breast structure while also\nperforming the proper intensity normalization and noise mapping. Our results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model can successfully learn a bidirectional\nmapping between MRIs produced by different vendors, potentially enabling\nimproved accuracy of downstream computational algorithms for diagnosis and\ndetection of breast cancer.

          "description": "Following their success in natural language processing, transformers have\nrecently shown much promise for computer vision. The self-attention operation\nunderlying transformers yields global interactions between all tokens ,i.e.\nwords or image patches, and enables flexible modelling of image data beyond the\nlocal interactions of convolutions. This flexibility, however, comes with a\nquadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering application to long\nsequences and high-resolution images. We propose a \"transposed\" version of\nself-attention that operates across feature channels rather than tokens, where\nthe interactions are based on the cross-covariance matrix between keys and\nqueries. The resulting cross-covariance attention (XCA) has linear complexity\nin the number of tokens, and allows efficient processing of high-resolution\nimages. Our cross-covariance image transformer (XCiT) is built upon XCA. It\ncombines the accuracy of conventional transformers with the scalability of\nconvolutional architectures. We validate the effectiveness and generality of\nXCiT by reporting excellent results on multiple vision benchmarks, including\nimage classification and self-supervised feature learning on ImageNet-1k,\nobject detection and instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation\non ADE20k.",

As we pre-train larger models, conventional fine-tuning, which\nretrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an\nexample, deploying many independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with\n175B parameters, is extremely expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or\nLoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank\ndecomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly\nreducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. For GPT-3,\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\ncomputation hardware requirement by 3 times compared to full fine-tuning. LoRA\nperforms on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on both GPT-3 and\nGPT-2, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput,\nand no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation\ninto rank-deficiency in language model adaptations, which sheds light on the\nefficacy of LoRA.

The most successful approaches\nto alleviate this forgetting require extensive replay of previously seen data,\nwhich is problematic when memory constraints or data legality concerns exist.\nIn this work, we consider the high-impact problem of Data-Free\nClass-Incremental Learning (DFCIL), where an incremental learning agent must\nlearn new concepts over time without storing generators or training data from\npast tasks. One approach for DFCIL is to replay synthetic images produced by\ninverting a frozen copy of the learner's classification model, but we show this\napproach fails for common class-incremental benchmarks when using standard\ndistillation strategies. We diagnose the cause of this failure and propose a\nnovel incremental distillation strategy for DFCIL, contributing a modified\ncross-entropy training and importance-weighted feature distillation, and show\nthat our method results in up to a 25.1% increase in final task accuracy\n(absolute difference) compared to SOTA DFCIL methods for common\nclass-incremental benchmarks. Our method even outperforms several standard\nreplay based methods which store a coreset of images.",

          "description": "Adversarial training is the de facto most promising defense against\nadversarial examples. Yet, its passive nature inevitably prevents it from being\nimmune to unknown attackers. To achieve a proactive defense, we need a more\nfundamental understanding of adversarial examples, beyond the popular bounded\nthreat model. In this paper, we provide a causal viewpoint of adversarial\nvulnerability: the cause is the confounder ubiquitously existing in learning,\nwhere attackers are precisely exploiting the confounding effect. Therefore, a\nfundamental solution for adversarial robustness is causal intervention. As the\nconfounder is unobserved in general, we propose to use the instrumental\nvariable that achieves intervention without the need for confounder\nobservation. We term our robust training method as Causal intervention by\ninstrumental Variable (CiiV). It has a differentiable retinotopic sampling\nlayer and a consistency loss, which is stable and guaranteed not to suffer from\ngradient obfuscation. Extensive experiments on a wide spectrum of attackers and\nsettings applied in MNIST, CIFAR-10, and mini-ImageNet datasets empirically\ndemonstrate that CiiV is robust to adaptive attacks.",

Humans are very experienced in physical\nreasoning while it remains a major challenge for AI. To facilitate research\naddressing this problem, several benchmarks have been proposed recently.\nHowever, these benchmarks do not enable us to measure an agent's granular\nphysical reasoning capabilities when solving a complex reasoning task. In this\npaper, we propose a new benchmark for physical reasoning that allows us to test\nindividual physical reasoning capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire\nthese capabilities, we propose a general hierarchy of physical reasoning\ncapabilities with increasing complexity. Our benchmark tests capabilities\naccording to this hierarchy through generated physical reasoning tasks in the\nvideo game Angry Birds. This benchmark enables us to conduct a comprehensive\nagent evaluation by measuring the agent's granular physical reasoning\ncapabilities. We conduct an evaluation with human players, learning agents, and\nheuristic agents and determine their capabilities. Our evaluation shows that\nlearning agents, with good local generalization ability, still struggle to\nlearn the underlying physical reasoning capabilities and perform worse than\ncurrent state-of-the-art heuristic agents and humans.

          "description": "Classical machine learning frameworks assume access to a possibly large\ndataset in order to train a predictive model. In many practical applications\nhowever, data does not arrive all at once, but in batches over time. This\ncreates a natural trade-off between accuracy of a model and time to obtain such\na model. A greedy predictor could produce non-trivial predictions by\nimmediately training on batches as soon as these become available but, it may\nalso make sub-optimal use of future data. On the other hand, a tardy predictor\ncould wait for a long time to aggregate several batches into a larger dataset,\nbut ultimately deliver a much better performance. In this work, we consider\nsuch a streaming learning setting, which we dub {\\em anytime learning at\nmacroscale} (ALMA). It is an instance of anytime learning applied not at the\nlevel of a single chunk of data, but at the level of the entire sequence of\nlarge batches. We first formalize this learning setting, we then introduce\nmetrics to assess how well learners perform on the given task for a given\nmemory and compute budget, and finally we test several baseline approaches on\nstandard benchmarks repurposed for anytime learning at macroscale. The general\nfinding is that bigger models always generalize better. In particular, it is\nimportant to grow model capacity over time if the initial model is relatively\nsmall. Moreover, updating the model at an intermediate rate strikes the best\ntrade off between accuracy and time to obtain a useful predictor.",

          "description": "Federated learning is a distributed learning paradigm where multiple agents,\neach only with access to local data, jointly learn a global model. There has\nrecently been an explosion of research aiming not only to improve the accuracy\nrates of federated learning, but also provide certain guarantees around social\ngood properties such as total error. One branch of this research has taken a\ngame-theoretic approach, and in particular, prior work has viewed federated\nlearning as a hedonic game, where error-minimizing players arrange themselves\ninto federating coalitions. This past work proves the existence of stable\ncoalition partitions, but leaves open a wide range of questions, including how\nfar from optimal these stable solutions are. In this work, we motivate and\ndefine a notion of optimality given by the average error rates among federating\nagents (players). First, we provide and prove the correctness of an efficient\nalgorithm to calculate an optimal (error minimizing) arrangement of players.\nNext, we analyze the relationship between the stability and optimality of an\narrangement. First, we show that for some regions of parameter space, all\nstable arrangements are optimal (Price of Anarchy equal to 1). However, we show\nthis is not true for all settings: there exist examples of stable arrangements\nwith higher cost than optimal (Price of Anarchy greater than 1). Finally, we\ngive the first constant-factor bound on the performance gap between stability\nand optimality, proving that the total error of the worst stable solution can\nbe no higher than 9 times the total error of an optimal solution (Price of\nAnarchy bound of 9).",

          "description": "Sparse linear regression is a fundamental problem in high-dimensional\nstatistics, but strikingly little is known about how to efficiently solve it\nwithout restrictive conditions on the design matrix. We consider the\n(correlated) random design setting, where the covariates are independently\ndrawn from a multivariate Gaussian $N(0,\\Sigma)$ with $\\Sigma : n \\times n$,\nand seek estimators $\\hat{w}$ minimizing $(\\hat{w}-w^*)^T\\Sigma(\\hat{w}-w^*)$,\nwhere $w^*$ is the $k$-sparse ground truth. Information theoretically, one can\nachieve strong error bounds with $O(k \\log n)$ samples for arbitrary $\\Sigma$\nand $w^*$; however, no efficient algorithms are known to match these guarantees\neven with $o(n)$ samples, without further assumptions on $\\Sigma$ or $w^*$. As\nfar as hardness, computational lower bounds are only known with worst-case\ndesign matrices. Random-design instances are known which are hard for the\nLasso, but these instances can generally be solved by Lasso after a simple\nchange-of-basis (i.e. preconditioning).\n\nIn this work, we give upper and lower bounds clarifying the power of\npreconditioning in sparse linear regression. First, we show that the\npreconditioned Lasso can solve a large class of sparse linear regression\nproblems nearly optimally: it succeeds whenever the dependency structure of the\ncovariates, in the sense of the Markov property, has low treewidth -- even if\n$\\Sigma$ is highly ill-conditioned. Second, we construct (for the first time)\nrandom-design instances which are provably hard for an optimally preconditioned\nLasso. In fact, we complete our treewidth classification by proving that for\nany treewidth-$t$ graph, there exists a Gaussian Markov Random Field on this\ngraph such that the preconditioned Lasso, with any choice of preconditioner,\nrequires $\\Omega(t^{1/20})$ samples to recover $O(\\log n)$-sparse signals when\ncovariates are drawn from this model.",

          "description": "Entity alignment, aiming to identify equivalent entities across different\nknowledge graphs (KGs), is a fundamental problem for constructing large-scale\nKGs. Over the course of its development, supervision has been considered\nnecessary for accurate alignments. Inspired by the recent progress of\nself-supervised learning, we explore the extent to which we can get rid of\nsupervision for entity alignment. Existing supervised methods for this task\nfocus on pulling each pair of positive (labeled) entities close to each other.\nHowever, our analysis suggests that the learning of entity alignment can\nactually benefit more from pushing sampled (unlabeled) negatives far away than\npulling positive aligned pairs close. We present SelfKG by leveraging this\ndiscovery to design a contrastive learning strategy across two KGs. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SelfKG without supervision\ncan match or achieve comparable results with state-of-the-art supervised\nbaselines. The performance of SelfKG demonstrates self-supervised learning\noffers great potential for entity alignment in KGs.",

To address this, we propose a\nmethod that enables traditionally intrusive reduced-order models to be\naccurately approximated in a non-intrusive manner. Specifically, the approach\napproximates the low-dimensional operators associated with projection-based\nreduced-order models (ROMs) using modern machine-learning regression\ntechniques. The only requirement of the simulation code is the ability to\nexport the velocity given the state and parameters as this functionality is\nused to train the approximated low-dimensional operators.

          "description": "Graph-level representations are critical in various real-world applications,\nsuch as predicting the properties of molecules. But in practice, precise graph\nannotations are generally very expensive and time-consuming. To address this\nissue, graph contrastive learning constructs instance discrimination task which\npulls together positive pairs (augmentation pairs of the same graph) and pushes\naway negative pairs (augmentation pairs of different graphs) for unsupervised\nrepresentation learning. However, since for a query, its negatives are\nuniformly sampled from all graphs, existing methods suffer from the critical\nsampling bias issue, i.e., the negatives likely having the same semantic\nstructure with the query, leading to performance degradation. To mitigate this\nsampling bias issue, in this paper, we propose a Prototypical Graph Contrastive\nLearning (PGCL) approach. Specifically, PGCL models the underlying semantic\nstructure of the graph data via clustering semantically similar graphs into the\nsame group, and simultaneously encourages the clustering consistency for\ndifferent augmentations of the same graph. Then given a query, it performs\nnegative sampling via drawing the graphs from those clusters that differ from\nthe cluster of query, which ensures the semantic difference between query and\nits negative samples. Moreover, for a query, PGCL further reweights its\nnegative samples based on the distance between their prototypes (cluster\ncentroids) and the query prototype such that those negatives having moderate\nprototype distance enjoy relatively large weights. This reweighting strategy is\nproved to be more effective than uniform sampling. Experimental results on\nvarious graph benchmarks testify the advantages of our PGCL over\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

WaveGrad 2 is trained to estimate the gradient of the\nlog conditional density of the waveform given a phoneme sequence. The model\ntakes an input phoneme sequence, and through an iterative refinement process,\ngenerates an audio waveform. This contrasts to the original WaveGrad vocoder\nwhich conditions on mel-spectrogram features, generated by a separate model.\nThe iterative refinement process starts from Gaussian noise, and through a\nseries of refinement steps (e.g., 50 steps), progressively recovers the audio\nsequence. WaveGrad 2 offers a natural way to trade-off between inference speed\nand sample quality, through adjusting the number of refinement steps.\nExperiments show that the model can generate high fidelity audio, approaching\nthe performance of a state-of-the-art neural TTS system. We also report various\nablation studies over different model configurations. Audio samples are\navailable at https://wavegrad.github.io/v2.",

          "description": "Nowadays new technologies, and especially artificial intelligence, are more\nand more established in our society. Big data analysis and machine learning,\ntwo sub-fields of artificial intelligence, are at the core of many recent\nbreakthroughs in many application fields (e.g., medicine, communication,\nfinance, ...), including some that are strongly related to our day-to-day life\n(e.g., social networks, computers, smartphones, ...). In machine learning,\nsignificant improvements are usually achieved at the price of an increasing\ncomputational complexity and thanks to bigger datasets. Currently, cutting-edge\nmodels built by the most advanced machine learning algorithms typically became\nsimultaneously very efficient and profitable but also extremely complex. Their\ncomplexity is to such an extent that these models are commonly seen as\nblack-boxes providing a prediction or a decision which can not be interpreted\nor justified. Nevertheless, whether these models are used autonomously or as a\nsimple decision-making support tool, they are already being used in machine\nlearning applications where health and human life are at stake. Therefore, it\nappears to be an obvious necessity not to blindly believe everything coming out\nof those models without a detailed understanding of their predictions or\ndecisions. Accordingly, this thesis aims at improving the interpretability of\nmodels built by a specific family of machine learning algorithms, the so-called\ntree-based methods. Several mechanisms have been proposed to interpret these\nmodels and we aim along this thesis to improve their understanding, study their\nproperties, and define their limitations.",

However, majority of the developments\nfocus on performance of GANs on balanced datasets. We find that the existing\nGANs and their training regimes which work well on balanced datasets fail to be\neffective in case of imbalanced (i.e. long-tailed) datasets. In this work we\nintroduce a novel theoretically motivated Class Balancing regularizer for\ntraining GANs. Our regularizer makes use of the knowledge from a pre-trained\nclassifier to ensure balanced learning of all the classes in the dataset. This\nis achieved via modelling the effective class frequency based on the\nexponential forgetting observed in neural networks and encouraging the GAN to\nfocus on underrepresented classes. We demonstrate the utility of our\nregularizer in learning representations for long-tailed distributions via\nachieving better performance than existing approaches over multiple datasets.\nSpecifically, when applied to an unconditional GAN, it improves the FID from\n$13.03$ to $9.01$ on the long-tailed iNaturalist-$2019$ dataset.",

          "description": "Postprocessing ensemble weather predictions to correct systematic errors has\nbecome a standard practice in research and operations. However, only few recent\nstudies have focused on ensemble postprocessing of wind gust forecasts, despite\nits importance for severe weather warnings. Here, we provide a comprehensive\nreview and systematic comparison of eight statistical and machine learning\nmethods for probabilistic wind gust forecasting via ensemble postprocessing,\nthat can be divided in three groups: State of the art postprocessing techniques\nfrom statistics (ensemble model output statistics (EMOS), member-by-member\npostprocessing, isotonic distributional regression), established machine\nlearning methods (gradient-boosting extended EMOS, quantile regression forests)\nand neural network-based approaches (distributional regression network,\nBernstein quantile network, histogram estimation network). The methods are\nsystematically compared using six years of data from a high-resolution,\nconvection-permitting ensemble prediction system that was run operationally at\nthe German weather service, and hourly observations at 175 surface weather\nstations in Germany. While all postprocessing methods yield calibrated\nforecasts and are able to correct the systematic errors of the raw ensemble\npredictions, incorporating information from additional meteorological predictor\nvariables beyond wind gusts leads to significant improvements in forecast\nskill. In particular, we propose a flexible framework of locally adaptive\nneural networks with different probabilistic forecast types as output, which\nnot only significantly outperform all benchmark postprocessing methods but also\nlearn physically consistent relations associated with the diurnal cycle,\nespecially the evening transition of the planetary boundary layer.",

          "description": "Machine learning systems based on minimizing average error have been shown to\nperform inconsistently across notable subsets of the data, which is not exposed\nby a low average error for the entire dataset. In consequential social and\neconomic applications, where data represent people, this can lead to\ndiscrimination of underrepresented gender and ethnic groups. Given the\nimportance of bias mitigation in machine learning, the topic leads to\ncontentious debates on how to ensure fairness in practice (data bias versus\nalgorithmic bias). Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) seemingly\naddresses this problem by minimizing the worst expected risk across\nsubpopulations. We establish theoretical results that clarify the relation\nbetween DRO and the optimization of the same loss averaged on an adequately\nweighted training dataset. The results cover finite and infinite number of\ntraining distributions, as well as convex and non-convex loss functions. We\nshow that neither DRO nor curating the training set should be construed as a\ncomplete solution for bias mitigation: in the same way that there is no\nuniversally robust training set, there is no universal way to setup a DRO\nproblem and ensure a socially acceptable set of results. We then leverage these\ninsights to provide a mininal set of practical recommendations for addressing\nbias with DRO. Finally, we discuss ramifications of our results in other\nrelated applications of DRO, using an example of adversarial robustness. Our\nresults show that there is merit to both the algorithm-focused and the\ndata-focused side of the bias debate, as long as arguments in favor of these\npositions are precisely qualified and backed by relevant mathematics known\ntoday.",

Earlier works on attribute\nnormalization focused on fuzzy string matching (also referred as syntactic\nmatching in this paper). In this work, we first perform an extensive study of\nnine syntactic matching algorithms and establish that 'cosine' similarity leads\nto best results, showing 2.7% improvement over commonly used Jaccard index.\nNext, we argue that string similarity alone is not sufficient for attribute\nnormalization as many surface forms require going beyond syntactic matching\n(e.g. \"720p\" and \"HD\" are synonyms). While semantic techniques like\nunsupervised embeddings (e.g. word2vec/fastText) have shown good results in\nword similarity tasks, we observed that they perform poorly to distinguish\nbetween close canonical forms, as these close forms often occur in similar\ncontexts. We propose to learn token embeddings using a twin network with\ntriplet loss. We propose an embedding learning task leveraging raw attribute\nvalues and product titles to learn these embeddings in a self-supervised\nfashion. We show that providing supervision using our proposed task improves\nover both syntactic and unsupervised embeddings based techniques for attribute\nnormalization. Experiments on a real-world attribute normalization dataset of\n50 attributes show that the embeddings trained using our proposed approach\nobtain 2.3% improvement over best string matching and 19.3% improvement over\nbest unsupervised embeddings.",

Recent work has\nshown that autoregressive generative models with cross-entropy objective\nfunctions exhibit smooth power-law relationships, or scaling laws, that predict\nmodel quality from model size, training set size, and the available compute\nbudget. These scaling laws allow one to choose nearly optimal hyper-parameters\ngiven constraints on available training data, model parameter count, or\ntraining computation budget. In this paper, we demonstrate that acoustic models\ntrained with an auto-predictive coding loss behave as if they are subject to\nsimilar scaling laws. We extend previous work to jointly predict loss due to\nmodel size, to training set size, and to the inherent \"irreducible loss\" of the\ntask.

          "description": "Recent works demonstrated the promise of using resistive random access memory\n(ReRAM) as an emerging technology to perform inherently parallel analog domain\nin-situ matrix-vector multiplication -- the intensive and key computation in\nDNNs. With weights stored in the ReRAM crossbar cells as conductance, when the\ninput vector is applied to word lines, the matrix-vector multiplication results\ncan be generated as the current in bit lines. A key problem is that the weight\ncan be either positive or negative, but the in-situ computation assumes all\ncells on each crossbar column with the same sign. The current architectures\neither use two ReRAM crossbars for positive and negative weights, or add an\noffset to weights so that all values become positive. Neither solution is\nideal: they either double the cost of crossbars, or incur extra offset\ncircuity. To better solve this problem, this paper proposes FORMS, a\nfine-grained ReRAM-based DNN accelerator with polarized weights. Instead of\ntrying to represent the positive/negative weights, our key design principle is\nto enforce exactly what is assumed in the in-situ computation -- ensuring that\nall weights in the same column of a crossbar have the same sign. It naturally\navoids the cost of an additional crossbar. Such weights can be nicely generated\nusing alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) regularized\noptimization, which can exactly enforce certain patterns in DNN weights. To\nachieve high accuracy, we propose to use fine-grained sub-array columns, which\nprovide a unique opportunity for input zero-skipping, significantly avoiding\nunnecessary computations. It also makes the hardware much easier to implement.\nPutting all together, with the same optimized models, FORMS achieves\nsignificant throughput improvement and speed up in frame per second over ISAAC\nwith similar area cost.",

However, theoretical analysis of these models\nis scarce and challenging since the pretraining and downstream tasks can be\nvery different.

We analyze head tuning (learning a classifier on top\nof the frozen pretrained model) and prompt tuning in this setting.

We show that 1) under certain non-degeneracy\nconditions on the HMM, simple classification heads can solve the downstream\ntask, 2) prompt tuning obtains downstream guarantees with weaker non-degeneracy\nconditions, and 3) our recovery guarantees for the memory-augmented HMM are\nstronger than for the vanilla HMM because task-relevant information is easier\nto recover from the long-term memory.

Ramanujan et al.\n(2020) empirically showed that only pruning the weights can achieve remarkable\nperformance instead of optimizing the weight values. However, to achieve the\nsame level of performance as the weight optimization, the pruning approach\nrequires more parameters in the networks before pruning and thus more memory\nspace. To overcome this parameter inefficiency, we introduce a novel framework\nto prune randomly initialized neural networks with iteratively randomizing\nweight values (IteRand).

          "description": "We revisit the question of predicting both Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}$ and\n$h^{2,1}$ of complete intersection Calabi-Yau (CICY) 3-folds using machine\nlearning (ML), considering both the old and new datasets built respectively by\nCandelas-Dale-Lutken-Schimmrigk / Green-H\\\"ubsch-Lutken and by\nAnderson-Gao-Gray-Lee.

It\nis followed by the design of a validation procedure and a baseline model.\nFinally, several ML models are compared and combined, often involving neural\nnetworks with a topology more complicated than the sequential models typically\nused in physics. By following this procedure, we improve the accuracy of ML\ncomputations for Hodge numbers with respect to the existing literature. First,\nwe obtain 97% (resp. 99%) accuracy for $h^{1,1}$ using a neural network\ninspired by the Inception model for the old dataset, using only 30% (resp. 70%)\nof the data for training. For the new one, a simple linear regression leads to\nalmost 100% accuracy with 30% of the data for training. The computation of\n$h^{2,1}$ is less successful as we manage to reach only 50% accuracy for both\ndatasets, but this is still better than the 16% obtained with a simple neural\nnetwork (SVM with Gaussian kernel and feature engineering and sequential\nconvolutional network reach at best 36%).

As a result, a\nvariety of machine learning methods have been studied for graph data analysis.\nAlthough many such learning methods depend on the measurement of differences\nbetween input graphs, defining an appropriate distance metric for graphs\nremains a controversial issue. Hence, we propose a supervised distance metric\nlearning method for the graph classification problem. Our method, named\ninterpretable graph metric learning (IGML), learns discriminative metrics in a\nsubgraph-based feature space, which has a strong graph representation\ncapability. By introducing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weight of each\nsubgraph, IGML can identify a small number of important subgraphs that can\nprovide insight into the given classification task. Because our formulation has\na large number of optimization variables, an efficient algorithm that uses\npruning techniques based on safe screening and working set selection methods is\nalso proposed. An important property of IGML is that solution optimality is\nguaranteed because the problem is formulated as a convex problem and our\npruning strategies only discard unnecessary subgraphs. Furthermore, we show\nthat IGML is also applicable to other structured data such as itemset and\nsequence data, and that it can incorporate vertex-label similarity by using a\ntransportation-based subgraph feature. We empirically evaluate the\ncomputational efficiency and classification performance of IGML on several\nbenchmark datasets and provide some illustrative examples of how IGML\nidentifies important subgraphs from a given graph dataset.",

          "description": "Smart contracts hold digital coins worth billions of dollars, their security\nissues have drawn extensive attention in the past years. Towards smart contract\nvulnerability detection, conventional methods heavily rely on fixed expert\nrules, leading to low accuracy and poor scalability. Recent deep learning\napproaches alleviate this issue but fail to encode useful expert knowledge. In\nthis paper, we explore combining deep learning with expert patterns in an\nexplainable fashion. Specifically, we develop automatic tools to extract expert\npatterns from the source code. We then cast the code into a semantic graph to\nextract deep graph features. Thereafter, the global graph feature and local\nexpert patterns are fused to cooperate and approach the final prediction, while\nyielding their interpretable weights. Experiments are conducted on all\navailable smart contracts with source code in two platforms, Ethereum and VNT\nChain. Empirically, our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods.

          "description": "Modern neural networks are highly uncalibrated. It poses a significant\nchallenge for safety-critical systems to utilise deep neural networks (DNNs),\nreliably. Many recently proposed approaches have demonstrated substantial\nprogress in improving DNN calibration. However, they hardly touch upon\nrefinement, which historically has been an essential aspect of calibration.\nRefinement indicates separability of a network's correct and incorrect\npredictions. This paper presents a theoretically and empirically supported\nexposition for reviewing a model's calibration and refinement. Firstly, we show\nthe breakdown of expected calibration error (ECE), into predicted confidence\nand refinement. Connecting with this result, we highlight that regularisation\nbased calibration only focuses on naively reducing a model's confidence. This\nlogically has a severe downside to a model's refinement. We support our claims\nthrough rigorous empirical evaluations of many state of the art calibration\napproaches on standard datasets. We find that many calibration approaches with\nthe likes of label smoothing, mixup etc. lower the utility of a DNN by\ndegrading its refinement. Even under natural data shift, this\ncalibration-refinement trade-off holds for the majority of calibration methods.\nThese findings call for an urgent retrospective into some popular pathways\ntaken for modern DNN calibration.",

In this paper, we propose Elastic Federated\nLearning (EFL), an unbiased algorithm to tackle the heterogeneity in the\nsystem, which makes the most informative parameters less volatile during\ntraining, and utilizes the incomplete local updates. It is an efficient and\neffective algorithm that compresses both upstream and downstream\ncommunications.

          "description": "Pre-trained language models induce dense entity representations that offer\nstrong performance on entity-centric NLP tasks, but such representations are\nnot immediately interpretable. This can be a barrier to model uptake in\nimportant domains such as biomedicine. There has been recent work on general\ninterpretable representation learning (Onoe and Durrett, 2020), but these\ndomain-agnostic representations do not readily transfer to the important domain\nof biomedicine. In this paper, we create a new entity type system and training\nset from a large corpus of biomedical texts by mapping entities to concepts in\na medical ontology, and from these to Wikipedia pages whose categories are our\ntypes. From this mapping we derive Biomedical Interpretable Entity\nRepresentations(BIERs), in which dimensions correspond to fine-grained entity\ntypes, and values are predicted probabilities that a given entity is of the\ncorresponding type. We propose a novel method that exploits BIER's final sparse\nand intermediate dense representations to facilitate model and entity type\ndebugging. We show that BIERs achieve strong performance in biomedical tasks\nincluding named entity disambiguation and entity label classification, and we\nprovide error analysis to highlight the utility of their interpretability,\nparticularly in low-supervision settings. Finally, we provide our induced 68K\nbiomedical type system, the corresponding 37 million triples of derived data\nused to train BIER models and our best performing model.",

          "description": "Path representations are critical in a variety of transportation\napplications, such as estimating path ranking in path recommendation systems\nand estimating path travel time in navigation systems. Existing studies often\nlearn task-specific path representations in a supervised manner, which require\na large amount of labeled training data and generalize poorly to other tasks.\nWe propose an unsupervised learning framework Path InfoMax (PIM) to learn\ngeneric path representations that work for different downstream tasks. We first\npropose a curriculum negative sampling method, for each input path, to generate\na small amount of negative paths, by following the principles of curriculum\nlearning. Next, \\emph{PIM} employs mutual information maximization to learn\npath representations from both a global and a local view. In the global view,\nPIM distinguishes the representations of the input paths from those of the\nnegative paths. In the local view, \\emph{PIM} distinguishes the input path\nrepresentations from the representations of the nodes that appear only in the\nnegative paths. This enables the learned path representations to encode both\nglobal and local information at different scales. Extensive experiments on two\ndownstream tasks, ranking score estimation and travel time estimation, using\ntwo road network datasets suggest that PIM significantly outperforms other\nunsupervised methods and is also able to be used as a pre-training method to\nenhance supervised path representation learning.",

We derive conditional MI bounds as an\ninstance, with special choice of prior, of conditional MAC-Bayesian (Mean\nApproximately Correct) bounds, itself derived from conditional PAC-Bayesian\nbounds, where `conditional' means that one can use priors conditioned on a\njoint training and ghost sample.

We use the\nproposed RL robustness certification framework to evaluate six methods that\nhave previously been shown to yield empirically robust RL, including\nadversarial training and several forms of regularization, on two representative\nAtari games. We show that RegPGD, RegCVX, and RadialRL achieve high certified\nrobustness among these. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our certifications are\noften tight by evaluating these algorithms against adversarial attacks.",

          "description": "Analyzing the worst-case performance of deep neural networks against input\nperturbations amounts to solving a large-scale non-convex optimization problem,\nfor which several past works have proposed convex relaxations as a promising\nalternative. However, even for reasonably-sized neural networks, these\nrelaxations are not tractable, and so must be replaced by even weaker\nrelaxations in practice. In this work, we propose a novel operator splitting\nmethod that can directly solve a convex relaxation of the problem to high\naccuracy, by splitting it into smaller sub-problems that often have analytical\nsolutions. The method is modular and scales to problem instances that were\npreviously impossible to solve exactly due to their size. Furthermore, the\nsolver operations are amenable to fast parallelization with GPU acceleration.\nWe demonstrate our method in obtaining tighter bounds on the worst-case\nperformance of large convolutional networks in image classification and\nreinforcement learning settings.",

          "description": "With the surge in the number of hyperparameters and training times of modern\nmachine learning models, hyperparameter tuning is becoming increasingly\nexpensive. Although methods have been proposed to speed up tuning via knowledge\ntransfer, they typically require the final performance of hyperparameters and\ndo not focus on low-fidelity information. Nevertheless, this common practice is\nsuboptimal and can incur an unnecessary use of resources. It is more\ncost-efficient to instead leverage the low-fidelity tuning observations to\nmeasure inter-task similarity and transfer knowledge from existing to new tasks\naccordingly. However, performing multi-fidelity tuning comes with its own\nchallenges in the transfer setting: the noise in the additional observations\nand the need for performance forecasting. Therefore, we conduct a thorough\nanalysis of the multi-task multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization framework,\nwhich leads to the best instantiation--amortized auto-tuning (AT2). We further\npresent an offline-computed 27-task hyperparameter recommendation (HyperRec)\ndatabase to serve the community. Extensive experiments on HyperRec and other\nreal-world databases illustrate the effectiveness of our AT2 method.",

These embeddings are generally compared\nusing either linear or 2nd-order scoring and, until recently, do not handle\nutterance-specific uncertainty. In this work we propose scoring these\nrepresentations in a way that can capture uncertainty, enroll/test asymmetry\nand additional non-linear information. This is achieved by incorporating a\n2nd-stage neural network (known as a decision network) as part of an end-to-end\ntraining regimen. In particular, we propose the concept of decision residual\nnetworks which involves the use of a compact decision network to leverage\ncosine scores and to model the residual signal that's needed. Additionally, we\npresent a modification to the generalized end-to-end softmax loss function to\ntarget the separation of same/different speaker scores.

We demonstrate the method for joint control of room\ntemperature and bidirectional EV charging to maximize the occupant thermal\ncomfort and energy savings while leaving enough energy in the EV battery for\nthe next trip. We modelled the room temperature with a recurrent neural network\nand EV charging with a piece-wise linear function. Using these models as a\nsimulation environment, we applied a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nalgorithm to obtain an optimal control policy. The learnt policy achieves on\naverage 17% energy savings over the heating season and 19% better comfort\nsatisfaction than a standard RB room temperature controller. When a\nbidirectional EV is additionally connected and a two-tariff electricity pricing\nis applied, the MIMO DRL policy successfully leverages the battery and\ndecreases the overall cost of electricity compared to two standard RB\ncontrollers, one controlling the room temperature and another controlling the\nbidirectional EV (dis-)charging. Finally, we demonstrate a successful transfer\nof the learnt DRL policy from simulation onto a real building, the DFAB HOUSE\nat Empa Duebendorf in Switzerland, achieving up to 30% energy savings while\nmaintaining similar comfort levels compared to a conventional RB room\ntemperature controller over three weeks during the heating season.",

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) has been recognized as a viable distributed learning\nparadigm which trains a machine learning model collaboratively with massive\nmobile devices in the wireless edge while protecting user privacy. Although\nvarious communication schemes have been proposed to expedite the FL process,\nmost of them have assumed ideal wireless channels which provide reliable and\nlossless communication links between the server and mobile clients.\nUnfortunately, in practical systems with limited radio resources such as\nconstraint on the training latency and constraints on the transmission power\nand bandwidth, transmission of a large number of model parameters inevitably\nsuffers from quantization errors (QE) and transmission outage (TO). In this\npaper, we consider such non-ideal wireless channels, and carry out the first\nanalysis showing that the FL convergence can be severely jeopardized by TO and\nQE, but intriguingly can be alleviated if the clients have uniform outage\nprobabilities. These insightful results motivate us to propose a robust FL\nscheme, named FedTOE, which performs joint allocation of wireless resources and\nquantization bits across the clients to minimize the QE while making the\nclients have the same TO probability. Extensive experimental results are\npresented to show the superior performance of FedTOE for a deep learning-based\nclassification task with transmission latency constraints.",

Better estimations of prognosis would support treatment planning and\npatient support. Advances in machine learning have informed development of\nclinical predictive models, but their integration into clinical practice is\nalmost non-existent. One reasons for this is the lack of interpretability of\nmodels. In this paper, we use a novel brain tumour dataset to compare two\ninterpretable rule list models against popular machine learning approaches for\nbrain tumour survival prediction. All models are quantitatively evaluated using\nstandard performance metrics. The rule lists are also qualitatively assessed\nfor their interpretability and clinical utility. The interpretability of the\nblack box machine learning models is evaluated using two post-hoc explanation\ntechniques, LIME and SHAP. Our results show that the rule lists were only\nslightly outperformed by the black box models. We demonstrate that rule list\nalgorithms produced simple decision lists that align with clinical expertise.\nBy comparison, post-hoc interpretability methods applied to black box models\nmay produce unreliable explanations of local model predictions.

I experimented with three different\nmodels: a baseline linear regression model, a random forest regression model,\nand a neural network. I collected Reddit post data from an online data set and\nanalyzed the model's performance when trained on a single subreddit and a\ncollection of subreddits. The results showed that the neural network model\nperformed the best when the loss of the models were compared. With the use of a\nmachine learning model to predict social trends through the reaction users have\nto post, a better picture of the near future can be envisioned.",

          "description": "Reward shaping (RS) is a powerful method in reinforcement learning (RL) for\novercoming the problem of sparse or uninformative rewards. However, RS\ntypically relies on manually engineered shaping-reward functions whose\nconstruction is time-consuming and error-prone. It also requires domain\nknowledge which runs contrary to the goal of autonomous learning. We introduce\nReinforcement Learning Optimal Shaping Algorithm (ROSA), an automated RS\nframework in which the shaping-reward function is constructed in a novel Markov\ngame between two agents. A reward-shaping agent (Shaper) uses switching\ncontrols to determine which states to add shaping rewards and their optimal\nvalues while the other agent (Controller) learns the optimal policy for the\ntask using these shaped rewards. We prove that ROSA, which easily adopts\nexisting RL algorithms, learns to construct a shaping-reward function that is\ntailored to the task thus ensuring efficient convergence to high performance\npolicies. We demonstrate ROSA's congenial properties in three carefully\ndesigned experiments and show its superior performance against state-of-the-art\nRS algorithms in challenging sparse reward environments.",

          "description": "Unsupervised image-to-image translation methods such as CycleGAN learn to\nconvert images from one domain to another using unpaired training data sets\nfrom different domains. Unfortunately, these approaches still require centrally\ncollected unpaired records, potentially violating privacy and security issues.\nAlthough the recent federated learning (FL) allows a neural network to be\ntrained without data exchange, the basic assumption of the FL is that all\nclients have their own training data from a similar domain, which is different\nfrom our image-to-image translation scenario in which each client has images\nfrom its unique domain and the goal is to learn image translation between\ndifferent domains without accessing the target domain data. To address this,\nhere we propose a novel federated CycleGAN architecture that can learn image\ntranslation in an unsupervised manner while maintaining the data privacy.\nSpecifically, our approach arises from a novel observation that CycleGAN loss\ncan be decomposed into the sum of client specific local objectives that can be\nevaluated using only their data. This local objective decomposition allows\nmultiple clients to participate in federated CycleGAN training without\nsacrificing performance. Furthermore, our method employs novel switchable\ngenerator and discriminator architecture using Adaptive Instance Normalization\n(AdaIN) that significantly reduces the band-width requirement of the federated\nlearning. Our experimental results on various unsupervised image translation\ntasks show that our federated CycleGAN provides comparable performance compared\nto the non-federated counterpart.",

Visual RL, in particular, can be easily distracted by irrelevant factors\nin high-dimensional observation space. In this work, we consider robust policy\nlearning which targets zero-shot generalization to unseen visual environments\nwith large distributional shift. We propose SECANT, a novel self-expert cloning\ntechnique that leverages image augmentation in two stages to decouple robust\nrepresentation learning from policy optimization.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nSECANT significantly advances the state of the art in zero-shot generalization\nacross 4 challenging domains.

However, the most existing GNNs are oriented\nto homogeneous graphs and each layer can only aggregate the information of\none-hop neighbors. Stacking multi-layer networks will introduce a lot of noise\nand easily lead to over smoothing. We propose a Multi-hop Heterogeneous\nNeighborhood information Fusion graph representation learning method (MHNF).\nSpecifically, we first propose a hybrid metapath autonomous extraction model to\nefficiently extract multi-hop hybrid neighbors. Then, we propose a hop-level\nheterogeneous Information aggregation model, which selectively aggregates\ndifferent-hop neighborhood information within the same hybrid metapath.\nFinally, a hierarchical semantic attention fusion model (HSAF) is proposed,\nwhich can efficiently integrate different-hop and different-path neighborhood\ninformation respectively. This paper can solve the problem of aggregating the\nmulti-hop neighborhood information and can learn hybrid metapaths for target\ntask, reducing the limitation of manually specifying metapaths. In addition,\nHSAF can extract the internal node information of the metapaths and better\nintegrate the semantic information of different levels. Experimental results on\nreal datasets show that MHNF is superior to state-of-the-art methods in node\nclassification and clustering tasks (10.94% - 69.09% and 11.58% - 394.93%\nrelative improvement on average, respectively).",

          "description": "Two crucial requirements for a successful adoption of deep learning (DL) in\nthe wild are: (1) robustness to distributional shifts, and (2) model\ncompactness for achieving efficiency. Unfortunately, efforts towards\nsimultaneously achieving Out-of-Distribution (OOD) robustness and extreme model\ncompactness without sacrificing accuracy have mostly been unsuccessful. This\nraises an important question: \"Is the inability to create compact, accurate,\nand robust deep neural networks (CARDs) fundamental?\" To answer this question,\nwe perform a large-scale analysis for a range of popular model compression\ntechniques which uncovers several intriguing patterns. Notably, in contrast to\ntraditional pruning approaches (e.g., fine tuning and gradual magnitude\npruning), we find that \"lottery ticket-style\" pruning approaches can\nsurprisingly be used to create high performing CARDs. Specifically, we are able\nto create extremely compact CARDs that are dramatically more robust than their\nsignificantly larger and full-precision counterparts while matching (or\nbeating) their test accuracy, simply by pruning and/or quantizing. To better\nunderstand these differences, we perform sensitivity analysis in the Fourier\ndomain for CARDs trained using different data augmentation methods. Motivated\nby our analysis, we develop a simple domain-adaptive test-time ensembling\napproach (CARD-Deck) that uses a gating module to dynamically select an\nappropriate CARD from the CARD-Deck based on their spectral-similarity with\ntest samples. By leveraging complementary frequency biases of different\ncompressed models, the proposed approach builds a \"winning hand\" of CARDs that\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10-C accuracies (i.e., 96.8% clean\nand 92.75% robust) with dramatically better memory usage than their\nnon-compressed counterparts.

To learn with differential\nprivacy, we design \\emph{reparametrized gradient perturbation (RGP)} that\nperturbs the gradients on gradient-carrier matrices and reconstructs an update\nfor the original weight from the noisy gradients. Importantly, we use\nhistorical updates to find the gradient-carrier matrices, whose optimality is\nrigorously justified under linear regression and empirically verified with deep\nlearning tasks. RGP significantly reduces the memory cost and improves the\nutility. For example, we are the first able to apply differential privacy on\nthe BERT model and achieve an average accuracy of $83.9\\%$ on four downstream\ntasks with $\\epsilon=8$, which is within $5\\%$ loss compared to the non-private\nbaseline but enjoys much lower privacy leakage risk.",

          "description": "With increasingly more hyperparameters involved in their training, machine\nlearning systems demand a better understanding of hyperparameter tuning\nautomation. This has raised interest in studies of provably black-box\noptimization, which is made more practical by better exploration mechanism\nimplemented in algorithm design, managing the flux of both optimization and\nstatistical errors. Prior efforts focus on delineating optimization errors, but\nthis is deficient: black-box optimization algorithms can be inefficient without\nconsidering heterogeneity among reward samples. In this paper, we make the key\ndelineation on the role of statistical uncertainty in black-box optimization,\nguiding a more efficient algorithm design. We introduce\n\\textit{optimum-statistical collaboration}, a framework of managing the\ninteraction between optimization error flux and statistical error flux evolving\nin the optimization process.

          "description": "In Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, perception is both security and safety\ncritical. Despite various prior studies on its security issues, all of them\nonly consider attacks on camera- or LiDAR-based AD perception alone. However,\nproduction AD systems today predominantly adopt a Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF)\nbased design, which in principle can be more robust against these attacks under\nthe assumption that not all fusion sources are (or can be) attacked at the same\ntime. In this paper, we present the first study of security issues of MSF-based\nperception in AD systems. We directly challenge the basic MSF design assumption\nabove by exploring the possibility of attacking all fusion sources\nsimultaneously. This allows us for the first time to understand how much\nsecurity guarantee MSF can fundamentally provide as a general defense strategy\nfor AD perception.\n\nWe formulate the attack as an optimization problem to generate a\nphysically-realizable, adversarial 3D-printed object that misleads an AD system\nto fail in detecting it and thus crash into it. We propose a novel attack\npipeline that addresses two main design challenges: (1) non-differentiable\ntarget camera and LiDAR sensing systems, and (2) non-differentiable cell-level\naggregated features popularly used in LiDAR-based AD perception. We evaluate\nour attack on MSF included in representative open-source industry-grade AD\nsystems in real-world driving scenarios. Our results show that the attack\nachieves over 90% success rate across different object types and MSF. Our\nattack is also found stealthy, robust to victim positions, transferable across\nMSF algorithms, and physical-world realizable after being 3D-printed and\ncaptured by LiDAR and camera devices. To concretely assess the end-to-end\nsafety impact, we further perform simulation evaluation and show that it can\ncause a 100% vehicle collision rate for an industry-grade AD system.",

Although much recent research\nhas focused on the development of safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms\nthat produce a safe policy after training, ensuring safety during training as\nwell remains an open problem. A fundamental challenge is performing exploration\nwhile still satisfying constraints in an unknown Markov decision process (MDP).\nIn this work, we address this problem for the chance-constrained setting. We\npropose a new algorithm, SAILR, that uses an intervention mechanism based on\nadvantage functions to keep the agent safe throughout training and optimizes\nthe agent's policy using off-the-shelf RL algorithms designed for unconstrained\nMDPs. Our method comes with strong guarantees on safety during both training\nand deployment (i.e., after training and without the intervention mechanism)\nand policy performance compared to the optimal safety-constrained policy. In\nour experiments, we show that SAILR violates constraints far less during\ntraining than standard safe RL and constrained MDP approaches and converges to\na well-performing policy that can be deployed safely without intervention.

This problem finds various applications in signal\nand data analytics, e.g., nonlinear hyperspectral unmixing, image embedding,\nand nonlinear clustering. Linear mixture learning problems are already\nill-posed, as identifiability of the target latent components is hard to\nestablish in general.

          "description": "We propose Automatic Curricula via Expert Demonstrations (ACED), a\nreinforcement learning (RL) approach that combines the ideas of imitation\nlearning and curriculum learning in order to solve challenging robotic\nmanipulation tasks with sparse reward functions. Curriculum learning solves\ncomplicated RL tasks by introducing a sequence of auxiliary tasks with\nincreasing difficulty, yet how to automatically design effective and\ngeneralizable curricula remains a challenging research problem. ACED extracts\ncurricula from a small amount of expert demonstration trajectories by dividing\ndemonstrations into sections and initializing training episodes to states\nsampled from different sections of demonstrations. Through moving the reset\nstates from the end to the beginning of demonstrations as the learning agent\nimproves its performance, ACED not only learns challenging manipulation tasks\nwith unseen initializations and goals, but also discovers novel solutions that\nare distinct from the demonstrations. In addition, ACED can be naturally\ncombined with other imitation learning methods to utilize expert demonstrations\nin a more efficient manner, and we show that a combination of ACED with\nbehavior cloning allows pick-and-place tasks to be learned with as few as 1\ndemonstration and block stacking tasks to be learned with 20 demonstrations.",

          "description": "Analyzing the relation between intelligence and neural activity is of the\nutmost importance in understanding the working principles of the human brain in\nhealth and disease. In existing literature, functional brain connectomes have\nbeen used successfully to predict cognitive measures such as intelligence\nquotient (IQ) scores in both healthy and disordered cohorts using machine\nlearning models. However, existing methods resort to flattening the brain\nconnectome (i.e., graph) through vectorization which overlooks its topological\nproperties. To address this limitation and inspired from the emerging graph\nneural networks (GNNs), we design a novel regression GNN model (namely RegGNN)\nfor predicting IQ scores from brain connectivity. On top of that, we introduce\na novel, fully modular sample selection method to select the best samples to\nlearn from for our target prediction task. However, since such deep learning\narchitectures are computationally expensive to train, we further propose a\n\\emph{learning-based sample selection} method that learns how to choose the\ntraining samples with the highest expected predictive power on unseen samples.\nFor this, we capitalize on the fact that connectomes (i.e., their adjacency\nmatrices) lie in the symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix cone. Our results\non full-scale and verbal IQ prediction outperforms comparison methods in autism\nspectrum disorder cohorts and achieves a competitive performance for\nneurotypical subjects using 3-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, we show that\nour sample selection approach generalizes to other learning-based methods,\nwhich shows its usefulness beyond our GNN architecture.",

          "description": "Enforcing orthogonality in neural networks is an antidote for gradient\nvanishing/exploding problems, sensitivity by adversarial perturbation, and\nbounding generalization errors. However, many previous approaches are\nheuristic, and the orthogonality of convolutional layers is not systematically\nstudied: some of these designs are not exactly orthogonal, while others only\nconsider standard convolutional layers and propose specific classes of their\nrealizations. To address this problem, we propose a theoretical framework for\northogonal convolutional layers, which establishes the equivalence between\nvarious orthogonal convolutional layers in the spatial domain and the\nparaunitary systems in the spectral domain. Since there exists a complete\nspectral factorization of paraunitary systems, any orthogonal convolution layer\ncan be parameterized as convolutions of spatial filters. Our framework endows\nhigh expressive power to various convolutional layers while maintaining their\nexact orthogonality. Furthermore, our layers are memory and computationally\nefficient for deep networks compared to previous designs. Our versatile\nframework, for the first time, enables the study of architecture designs for\ndeep orthogonal networks, such as choices of skip connection, initialization,\nstride, and dilation. Consequently, we scale up orthogonal networks to deep\narchitectures, including ResNet, WideResNet, and ShuffleNet, substantially\nincreasing the performance over the traditional shallow orthogonal networks.",

          "description": "Main characters in images are the most important humans that catch the\nviewer's attention upon first look, and they are emphasized by properties such\nas size, position, color saturation, and sharpness of focus. Identifying the\nmain character in images plays an important role in traditional photographic\nstudies and media analysis, but the task is performed manually and can be slow\nand laborious. Furthermore, selection of main characters can be sometimes\nsubjective. In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of solving the main\ncharacter recognition needed for photographic studies automatically and propose\na method for identifying the main characters. The proposed method uses machine\nlearning based human pose estimation along with traditional computer vision\napproaches for this task. We approach the task as a binary classification\nproblem where each detected human is classified either as a main character or\nnot. To evaluate both the subjectivity of the task and the performance of our\nmethod, we collected a dataset of 300 varying images from multiple sources and\nasked five people, a photographic researcher and four other persons, to\nannotate the main characters. Our analysis showed a relatively high agreement\nbetween different annotators.

          "description": "Deep neural networks can be trained in reciprocal space, by acting on the\neigenvalues and eigenvectors of suitable transfer operators in direct space.\nAdjusting the eigenvalues, while freezing the eigenvectors, yields a\nsubstantial compression of the parameter space. This latter scales by\ndefinition with the number of computing neurons. The classification scores, as\nmeasured by the displayed accuracy, are however inferior to those attained when\nthe learning is carried in direct space, for an identical architecture and by\nemploying the full set of trainable parameters (with a quadratic dependence on\nthe size of neighbor layers). In this Letter, we propose a variant of the\nspectral learning method as appeared in Giambagli et al {Nat. Comm.} 2021,\nwhich leverages on two sets of eigenvalues, for each mapping between adjacent\nlayers. The eigenvalues act as veritable knobs which can be freely tuned so as\nto (i) enhance, or alternatively silence, the contribution of the input nodes,\n(ii) modulate the excitability of the receiving nodes with a mechanism which we\ninterpret as the artificial analogue of the homeostatic plasticity. The number\nof trainable parameters is still a linear function of the network size, but the\nperformances of the trained device gets much closer to those obtained via\nconventional algorithms, these latter requiring however a considerably heavier\ncomputational cost. The residual gap between conventional and spectral\ntrainings can be eventually filled by employing a suitable decomposition for\nthe non trivial block of the eigenvectors matrix. Each spectral parameter\nreflects back on the whole set of inter-nodes weights, an attribute which we\nshall effectively exploit to yield sparse networks with stunning classification\nabilities, as compared to their homologues trained with conventional means.",

          "description": "With the fast development of quantum computing and deep learning, quantum\nneural networks have attracted great attention recently. By leveraging the\npower of quantum computing, deep neural networks can potentially overcome\ncomputational power limitations in classic machine learning. However, when\nmultiple quantum machines wish to train a global model using the local data on\neach machine, it may be very difficult to copy the data into one machine and\ntrain the model. Therefore, a collaborative quantum neural network framework is\nnecessary. In this article, we borrow the core idea of federated learning to\npropose QuantumFed, a quantum federated learning framework to have multiple\nquantum nodes with local quantum data train a mode together. Our experiments\nshow the feasibility and robustness of our framework.",

          "description": "Our goal in this work is to generate realistic videos given just one initial\nframe as input. Existing unsupervised approaches to this task do not consider\nthe fact that a video typically shows a 3D environment, and that this should\nremain coherent from frame to frame even as the camera and objects move. We\naddress this by developing a model that first estimates the latent 3D structure\nof the scene, including the segmentation of any moving objects. It then\npredicts future frames by simulating the object and camera dynamics, and\nrendering the resulting views. Importantly, it is trained end-to-end using only\nthe unsupervised objective of predicting future frames, without any 3D\ninformation nor segmentation annotations. Experiments on two challenging\ndatasets of natural videos show that our model can estimate 3D structure and\nmotion segmentation from a single frame, and hence generate plausible and\nvaried predictions.",

In this paper, we define a new problem, Network Space Search\n(NSS), as searching for favorable network spaces instead of a single\narchitecture. We propose an NSS method to directly search for efficient-aware\nnetwork spaces automatically, reducing the manual effort and immense cost in\ndiscovering satisfactory ones. The resultant network spaces, named Elite\nSpaces, are discovered from Expanded Search Space with minimal human expertise\nimposed. The Pareto-efficient Elite Spaces are aligned with the Pareto front\nunder various complexity constraints and can be further served as NAS search\nspaces, benefiting differentiable NAS approaches (e.g. In CIFAR-100, an\naveragely 2.3% lower error rate and 3.7% closer to target constraint than the\nbaseline with around 90% fewer samples required to find satisfactory networks).\nMoreover, our NSS approach is capable of searching for superior spaces in\nfuture unexplored spaces, revealing great potential in searching for network\nspaces automatically.

          "description": "Fetoscopy laser photocoagulation is a widely used procedure for the treatment\nof Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS), that occur in mono-chorionic\nmultiple pregnancies due to placental vascular anastomoses. This procedure is\nparticularly challenging due to limited field of view, poor manoeuvrability of\nthe fetoscope, poor visibility due to fluid turbidity, variability in light\nsource, and unusual position of the placenta. This may lead to increased\nprocedural time and incomplete ablation, resulting in persistent TTTS.\nComputer-assisted intervention may help overcome these challenges by expanding\nthe fetoscopic field of view through video mosaicking and providing better\nvisualization of the vessel network. However, the research and development in\nthis domain remain limited due to unavailability of high-quality data to encode\nthe intra- and inter-procedure variability. Through the \\textit{Fetoscopic\nPlacental Vessel Segmentation and Registration (FetReg)} challenge, we present\na large-scale multi-centre dataset for the development of generalized and\nrobust semantic segmentation and video mosaicking algorithms for the fetal\nenvironment with a focus on creating drift-free mosaics from long duration\nfetoscopy videos. In this paper, we provide an overview of the FetReg dataset,\nchallenge tasks, evaluation metrics and baseline methods for both segmentation\nand registration.

We answer this question by\nadapting an encoder-decoder transfer learning method from computer vision to\ninvestigate the structure among 100 different feature spaces extracted from\nhidden representations of various networks trained on language tasks. This\nmethod reveals a low-dimensional structure where language models and\ntranslation models smoothly interpolate between word embeddings, syntactic and\nsemantic tasks, and future word embeddings. We call this low-dimensional\nstructure a language representation embedding because it encodes the\nrelationships between representations needed to process language for a variety\nof NLP tasks. We find that this representation embedding can predict how well\neach individual feature space maps to human brain responses to natural language\nstimuli recorded using fMRI. Additionally, we find that the principal dimension\nof this structure can be used to create a metric which highlights the brain's\nnatural language processing hierarchy.

Stability analysis of MPC with a\nlimited horizon but without terminal weight is a long-standing open problem. By\nusing a modified value function as an Lyapunov function candidate and the\nprinciple of optimality, this paper establishes stability conditions for this\ntype of widely spread MPC algorithms. A new stability guaranteed MPC algorithm\nwithout terminal weight (MPCS) is presented. With the help of designing a new\nsublevel set defined by the value function of one-step ahead stage cost,\nconditions for checking its recursive feasibility and stability of the proposed\nMPC algorithm are presented. The new stability condition and the derived MPCS\novercome the difficulties arising in the existing terminal weight based MPC\nframework, including the need of searching a suitable terminal weight and\npossible poor performance caused by an inappropriate terminal weight. This work\nis further extended to MPC with a terminal weight for the completeness.\nNumerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed tool, whereas the existing stability analysis tools are either not\napplicable or lead to quite conservative results. It shows that the proposed\ntools offer a number of mechanisms to achieve stability: adjusting state and/or\ncontrol weights, extending the length of horizon, and adding a simple extra\nconstraint on the first or second state in the optimisation.",

A key challenge of this setting is that users do\nnot have access to the ground truth (i.e. they cannot correctly identify\nwhether an app is malicious). To tackle this, LiM uses a safe semi-supervised\nensemble that maximizes classification accuracy with respect to a baseline\nclassifier trained by the service provider (i.e. the cloud). We implement LiM\nand show that the cloud server has F1 score of 95%, while clients have perfect\nrecall with only 1 false positive in >100 apps, using a dataset of 25K clean\napps and 25K malicious apps, 200 users and 50 rounds of federation.\nFurthermore, we conduct a security analysis and demonstrate that LiM is robust\nagainst both poisoning attacks by adversaries who control half of the clients,\nand inference attacks performed by an honest-but-curious cloud server.

Our methodology and results have five main\nparts. First, we utilize a group ICA model to extract functional networks from\nthe ASD group and rank the top 20 regions of interest (ROIs). Second, we\nutilize a dictionary learning model to extract functional networks from the ASD\ngroup and rank the top 20 ROIs. Third, we merged the 40 selected ROIs from the\ntwo models together as the ASD functional networks. Fourth, we generate three\ncorresponding masks based on the 20 selected ROIs from group ICA, the 20 ROIs\nselected from dictionary learning, and the 40 combined ROIs selected from both.\nFinally, we extract ROIs for all training samples using the above three masks,\nand the calculated functional connectivity was used as features for ASD and TD\nclassification.

          "description": "In performative prediction, predictions guide decision-making and hence can\ninfluence the distribution of future data. To date, work on performative\nprediction has focused on finding performatively stable models, which are the\nfixed points of repeated retraining. However, stable solutions can be far from\noptimal when evaluated in terms of the performative risk, the loss experienced\nby the decision maker when deploying a model. In this paper, we shift attention\nbeyond performative stability and focus on optimizing the performative risk\ndirectly. We identify a natural set of properties of the loss function and\nmodel-induced distribution shift under which the performative risk is convex, a\nproperty which does not follow from convexity of the loss alone. Furthermore,\nwe develop algorithms that leverage our structural assumptions to optimize the\nperformative risk with better sample efficiency than generic methods for\nderivative-free convex optimization.",

However, the current theoretical\nunderstanding of self-training only applies to linear models. This work\nprovides a unified theoretical analysis of self-training with deep networks for\nsemi-supervised learning, unsupervised domain adaptation, and unsupervised\nlearning. At the core of our analysis is a simple but realistic \"expansion\"\nassumption, which states that a low probability subset of the data must expand\nto a neighborhood with large probability relative to the subset. We also assume\nthat neighborhoods of examples in different classes have minimal overlap. We\nprove that under these assumptions, the minimizers of population objectives\nbased on self-training and input-consistency regularization will achieve high\naccuracy with respect to ground-truth labels. By using off-the-shelf\ngeneralization bounds, we immediately convert this result to sample complexity\nguarantees for neural nets that are polynomial in the margin and Lipschitzness.\nOur results help explain the empirical successes of recently proposed\nself-training algorithms which use input consistency regularization.",

          "description": "Fine-grained location prediction on smart phones can be used to improve\napp/system performance. Application scenarios include video quality adaptation\nas a function of the 5G network quality at predicted user locations, and\naugmented reality apps that speed up content rendering based on predicted user\nlocations. Such use cases require prediction error in the same range as the GPS\nerror, and no existing works on location prediction can achieve this level of\naccuracy. We present a system for fine-grained location prediction (FGLP) of\nmobile users, based on GPS traces collected on the phones. FGLP has two\ncomponents: a federated learning framework and a prediction model. The\nframework runs on the phones of the users and also on a server that coordinates\nlearning from all users in the system. FGLP represents the user location data\nas relative points in an abstract 2D space, which enables learning across\ndifferent physical spaces. The model merges Bidirectional Long Short-Term\nMemory (BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), where BiLSTM learns\nthe speed and direction of the mobile users, and CNN learns information such as\nuser movement preferences. FGLP uses federated learning to protect user privacy\nand reduce bandwidth consumption. Our experimental results, using a dataset\nwith over 600,000 users, demonstrate that FGLP outperforms baseline models in\nterms of prediction accuracy. We also demonstrate that FGLP works well in\nconjunction with transfer learning, which enables model reusability. Finally,\nbenchmark results on several types of Android phones demonstrate FGLP's\nfeasibility in real life.",

          "description": "Recently developed large pre-trained language models, e.g., BERT, have\nachieved remarkable performance in many downstream natural language processing\napplications. These pre-trained language models often contain hundreds of\nmillions of parameters and suffer from high computation and latency in\nreal-world applications. It is desirable to reduce the computation overhead of\nthe models for fast training and inference while keeping the model performance\nin downstream applications. Several lines of work utilize knowledge\ndistillation to compress the teacher model to a smaller student model. However,\nthey usually discard the teacher's knowledge when in inference. Differently, in\nthis paper, we propose RefBERT to leverage the knowledge learned from the\nteacher, i.e., facilitating the pre-computed BERT representation on the\nreference sample and compressing BERT into a smaller student model. To\nguarantee our proposal, we provide theoretical justification on the loss\nfunction and the usage of reference samples. Significantly, the theoretical\nresult shows that including the pre-computed teacher's representations on the\nreference samples indeed increases the mutual information in learning the\nstudent model. Finally, we conduct the empirical evaluation and show that our\nRefBERT can beat the vanilla TinyBERT over 8.1\\% and achieves more than 94\\% of\nthe performance of $\\BERTBASE$ on the GLUE benchmark. Meanwhile, RefBERT is\n7.4x smaller and 9.5x faster on inference than BERT$_{\\rm BASE}$.",

          "description": "A key limitation in using various modern methods of machine learning in\ndeveloping feedback control policies is the lack of appropriate methodologies\nto analyze their long-term dynamics, in terms of making any sort of guarantees\n(even statistically) about robustness. The central reasons for this are largely\ndue to the so-called curse of dimensionality, combined with the black-box\nnature of the resulting control policies themselves. This paper aims at the\nfirst of these issues. Although the full state space of a system may be quite\nlarge in dimensionality, it is a common feature of most model-based control\nmethods that the resulting closed-loop systems demonstrate dominant dynamics\nthat are rapidly driven to some lower-dimensional sub-space within. In this\nwork we argue that the dimensionality of this subspace is captured by tools\nfrom fractal geometry, namely various notions of a fractional dimension. We\nthen show that the dimensionality of trajectories induced by model free\nreinforcement learning agents can be influenced adding a post processing\nfunction to the agents reward signal. We verify that the dimensionality\nreduction is robust to noise being added to the system and show that that the\nmodified agents are more actually more robust to noise and push disturbances in\ngeneral for the systems we examined.",

Counterfactuals essentially show how the\nmodel decision alters with input perturbations. Existing methods for generating\ncounterfactuals are mainly algorithm-based, which are time-inefficient and\nassume the same counterfactual universe for different queries.

To better approximate the\ncounterfactual universe for those rare queries, we novelly employ the umbrella\nsampling technique to conduct the MCS framework training. Besides, we also\nenhance the MCS framework by incorporating the causal dependence among\nattributes with model inductive bias, and validate its design correctness from\nthe causality identification perspective.

At each timestep OBL agents\nfollow a policy $\\pi_1$ that is optimized assuming past actions were taken by a\ngiven, fixed policy ($\\pi_0$), but assuming that future actions will be taken\nby $\\pi_1$. When $\\pi_0$ is uniform random, OBL converges to an optimal policy\nthat does not rely on inferences based on other agents' behavior (an optimal\ngrounded policy). OBL can be iterated in a hierarchy, where the optimal policy\nfrom one level becomes the input to the next, thereby introducing multi-level\ncognitive reasoning in a controlled manner. Unlike existing approaches, which\nmay converge to any equilibrium policy, OBL converges to a unique policy,\nmaking it suitable for zero-shot coordination (ZSC). OBL can be scaled to\nhigh-dimensional settings with a fictitious transition mechanism and shows\nstrong performance in both a toy-setting and the benchmark human-AI & ZSC\nproblem Hanabi.",

          "description": "The remarkable flexibility and adaptability of both deep learning models and\nensemble methods have led to the proliferation for their application in\nunderstanding many physical phenomena. Traditionally, these two techniques have\nlargely been treated as independent methodologies in practical applications.\nThis study develops an optimized ensemble deep learning (OEDL) framework\nwherein these two machine learning techniques are jointly used to achieve\nsynergistic improvements in model accuracy, stability, scalability, and\nreproducibility prompting a new wave of applications in the forecasting of\ndynamics. Unpredictability is considered as one of the key features of chaotic\ndynamics, so forecasting such dynamics of nonlinear systems is a relevant issue\nin the scientific community. It becomes more challenging when the prediction of\nextreme events is the focus issue for us. In this circumstance, the proposed\nOEDL model based on a best convex combination of feed-forward neural networks,\nreservoir computing, and long short-term memory can play a key role in\nadvancing predictions of dynamics consisting of extreme events. The combined\nframework can generate the best out-of-sample performance than the individual\ndeep learners and standard ensemble framework for both numerically simulated\nand real world data sets.

We formalize it in a principled way\nas the problem of optimizing a welfare function that explicitly encodes two\nimportant aspects of fairness: efficiency and equity. As a solution method, we\npropose a novel neural network architecture, which is composed of two\nsub-networks specifically designed for taking into account the two aspects of\nfairness. In experiments, we demonstrate the importance of the two sub-networks\nfor fair optimization. Our overall approach is general as it can accommodate\nany (sub)differentiable welfare function. Therefore, it is compatible with\nvarious notions of fairness that have been proposed in the literature (e.g.,\nlexicographic maximin, generalized Gini social welfare function, proportional\nfairness). Our solution method is generic and can be implemented in various\nMARL settings: centralized training and decentralized execution, or fully\ndecentralized.

The NRSM errors of NN,\nGBM, RF, and SVM are 2.59\\%, 3.30\\%, 4.21\\%, and 5.34\\%, respectively. Among\nthese techniques, GBM has a more stable results as it has the smallest output\nvariance.

Typical backdoor attacks insert the trigger directly into\nthe training data, although the presence of such an attack may be visible upon\ninspection. In contrast, the Hidden Trigger Backdoor Attack achieves poisoning\nwithout placing a trigger into the training data at all.

To alleviate this problem, Federated learning\nis proposed to perform model training by multiple clients' combined data\nwithout the dataset sharing within the cluster. Nevertheless, federated\nlearning introduces massive communication overhead as the synchronized data in\neach epoch is of the same size as the model, and thereby leading to a low\ncommunication efficiency. Consequently, variant methods mainly focusing on the\ncommunication rounds reduction and data compression are proposed to reduce the\ncommunication overhead of federated learning. In this paper, we propose\nOverlap-FedAvg, a framework that parallels the model training phase with model\nuploading & downloading phase, so that the latter phase can be totally covered\nby the former phase. Compared to vanilla FedAvg, Overlap-FedAvg is further\ndeveloped with a hierarchical computing strategy, a data compensation mechanism\nand a nesterov accelerated gradients~(NAG) algorithm. Besides, Overlap-FedAvg\nis orthogonal to many other compression methods so that they can be applied\ntogether to maximize the utilization of the cluster. Furthermore, the\ntheoretical analysis is provided to prove the convergence of the proposed\nOverlap-FedAvg framework. Extensive experiments on both conventional and\nrecurrent tasks with multiple models and datasets also demonstrate that the\nproposed Overlap-FedAvg framework substantially boosts the federated learning\nprocess.",

          "description": "User data confidentiality protection is becoming a rising challenge in the\npresent deep learning research. Without access to data, conventional\ndata-driven model compression faces a higher risk of performance degradation.\nRecently, some works propose to generate images from a specific pretrained\nmodel to serve as training data. However, the inversion process only utilizes\nbiased feature statistics stored in one model and is from low-dimension to\nhigh-dimension. As a consequence, it inevitably encounters the difficulties of\ngeneralizability and inexact inversion, which leads to unsatisfactory\nperformance. To address these problems, we propose MixMix based on two simple\nyet effective techniques: (1) Feature Mixing: utilizes various models to\nconstruct a universal feature space for generalized inversion; (2) Data Mixing:\nmixes the synthesized images and labels to generate exact label information. We\nprove the effectiveness of MixMix from both theoretical and empirical\nperspectives. Extensive experiments show that MixMix outperforms existing\nmethods on the mainstream compression tasks, including quantization, knowledge\ndistillation, and pruning. Specifically, MixMix achieves up to 4% and 20%\naccuracy uplift on quantization and pruning, respectively, compared to existing\ndata-free compression work.",

          "description": "Reliable automation of the labor-intensive manual task of scoring animal\nsleep can facilitate the analysis of long-term sleep studies. In recent years,\ndeep-learning-based systems, which learn optimal features from the data,\nincreased scoring accuracies for the classical sleep stages of Wake, REM, and\nNon-REM. Meanwhile, it has been recognized that the statistics of transitional\nstages such as pre-REM, found between Non-REM and REM, may hold additional\ninsight into the physiology of sleep and are now under vivid investigation. We\npropose a classification system based on a simple neural network architecture\nthat scores the classical stages as well as pre-REM sleep in mice. When\nrestricted to the classical stages, the optimized network showed\nstate-of-the-art classification performance with an out-of-sample F1 score of\n0.95 in male C57BL/6J mice. When unrestricted, the network showed lower F1\nscores on pre-REM (0.5) compared to the classical stages. The result is\ncomparable to previous attempts to score transitional stages in other species\nsuch as transition sleep in rats or N1 sleep in humans. Nevertheless, we\nobserved that the sequence of predictions including pre-REM typically\ntransitioned from Non-REM to REM reflecting sleep dynamics observed by human\nscorers. Our findings provide further evidence for the difficulty of scoring\ntransitional sleep stages, likely because such stages of sleep are\nunder-represented in typical data sets or show large inter-scorer variability.\nWe further provide our source code and an online platform to run predictions\nwith our trained network.",

In this paper, we\nshow that Deep Learning techniques can successfully address this problem.\nEssentially, we tackle a text classification task: an algorithm must learn to\ninfer whether an Italian enterprise performs e-commerce from the textual\ncontent of its website. To reach this goal, we developed a sophisticated\nprocessing pipeline and evaluated its performance through extensive\nexperiments. Our pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks and relies on Word\nEmbeddings to encode raw texts into grayscale images (i.e. normalized numeric\nmatrices). Web-scraped texts are huge and have very low signal to noise ratio:\nto overcome these issues, we adopted a framework known as False Positive\nReduction, which has seldom (if ever) been applied before to text\nclassification tasks.

          "description": "Among interpretable machine learning methods, the class of Generalised\nAdditive Neural Networks (GANNs) is referred to as Self-Explaining Neural\nNetworks (SENN) because of the linear dependence on explicit functions of the\ninputs. In binary classification this shows the precise weight that each input\ncontributes towards the logit. The nomogram is a graphical representation of\nthese weights. We show that functions of individual and pairs of variables can\nbe derived from a functional Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) representation,\nenabling an efficient feature selection to be carried by application of the\nlogistic Lasso. This process infers the structure of GANNs which otherwise\nneeds to be predefined. As this method is particularly suited for tabular data,\nit starts by fitting a generic flexible model, in this case a Multi-layer\nPerceptron (MLP) to which the ANOVA decomposition is applied. This has the\nfurther advantage that the resulting GANN can be replicated as a SENN, enabling\nfurther refinement of the univariate and bivariate component functions to take\nplace. The component functions are partial responses hence the SENN is a\npartial response network. The Partial Response Network (PRN) is equally as\ntransparent as a traditional logistic regression model, but capable of\nnon-linear classification with comparable or superior performance to the\noriginal MLP. In other words, the PRN is a fully interpretable representation\nof the MLP, at the level of univariate and bivariate effects. The performance\nof the PRN is shown to be competitive for benchmark data, against\nstate-of-the-art machine learning methods including GBM, SVM and Random\nForests. It is also compared with spline-based Sparse Additive Models (SAM)\nshowing that a semi-parametric representation of the GAM as a neural network\ncan be as effective as the SAM though less constrained by the need to set\nspline nodes.",

This has created a strong interest\nin monitoring the social distances either as a safety measure or to study how\nthe measures have affected human behavior and country-wise differences in this.\nThe need for automatic social distance estimation algorithms is evident, but\nthere is no suitable test benchmark for such algorithms. Collecting images with\nmeasured ground-truth pair-wise distances between all the people using\ndifferent camera settings is cumbersome. Furthermore, performance evaluation\nfor social distance estimation algorithms is not straightforward and there is\nno widely accepted evaluation protocol. In this paper, we provide a dataset of\nvarying images with measured pair-wise social distances under different camera\npositionings and focal length values. We suggest a performance evaluation\nprotocol and provide a benchmark to easily evaluate social distance estimation\nalgorithms. We also propose a method for automatic social distance estimation.\nOur method takes advantage of object detection and human pose estimation.

In particular, the discriminator and the self-supervised\nclassifier are unified to learn a single task that predicts the augmented label\nsuch that the discriminator/classifier is aware of the generator distribution,\nwhile the generator tries to confuse the discriminator/classifier by optimizing\nthe discrepancy between the transformed real and generated distributions.\nTheoretically, we prove that the generator, at the equilibrium point, converges\nto replicate the data distribution. Empirically, we demonstrate that the\nproposed method significantly outperforms competitive baselines on both\ngenerative modeling and representation learning across benchmark datasets.",

The\nsource separation module segregates the percussive and non-percussive\ncomponents of the input signal, over which beat and downbeat tracking are\nperformed separately and then the results are aggregated with a learnable\nfusion mechanism. This way, the system can adaptively determine how much the\ntracking result for an input signal should depend on the input's percussive or\nnon-percussive components.

To close this gap, we step towards\npersistent exploration in continuous space through policy parameterizations\ndefined by distributions of heavier tails defined by tail-index parameter\nalpha, which increases the likelihood of jumping in state space. Doing so\ninvalidates smoothness conditions of the score function common to PG. Thus, we\nestablish how the convergence rate to stationarity depends on the policy's tail\nindex alpha, a Holder continuity parameter, integrability conditions, and an\nexploration tolerance parameter introduced here for the first time. Further, we\ncharacterize the dependence of the set of local maxima on the tail index\nthrough an exit and transition time analysis of a suitably defined Markov\nchain, identifying that policies associated with Levy Processes of a heavier\ntail converge to wider peaks.

Further, the model is regularized to align\nthe importance scores with human knowledge, so that the unintended model\nbehaviors are eliminated.

          "description": "Multi-modal distributions are commonly used to model clustered data in\nstatistical learning tasks. In this paper, we consider the Mixed Linear\nRegression (MLR) problem. We propose an optimal transport-based framework for\nMLR problems, Wasserstein Mixed Linear Regression (WMLR), which minimizes the\nWasserstein distance between the learned and target mixture regression models.\nThrough a model-based duality analysis, WMLR reduces the underlying MLR task to\na nonconvex-concave minimax optimization problem, which can be provably solved\nto find a minimax stationary point by the Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA)\nalgorithm. In the special case of mixtures of two linear regression models, we\nshow that WMLR enjoys global convergence and generalization guarantees. We\nprove that WMLR's sample complexity grows linearly with the dimension of data.\nFinally, we discuss the application of WMLR to the federated learning task\nwhere the training samples are collected by multiple agents in a network.\nUnlike the Expectation Maximization algorithm, WMLR directly extends to the\ndistributed, federated learning setting. We support our theoretical results\nthrough several numerical experiments, which highlight our framework's ability\nto handle the federated learning setting with mixture models.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of learning a tree-structured Ising model from data,\nsuch that subsequent predictions computed using the model are accurate.\nConcretely, we aim to learn a model such that posteriors $P(X_i|X_S)$ for small\nsets of variables $S$ are accurate. Since its introduction more than 50 years\nago, the Chow-Liu algorithm, which efficiently computes the maximum likelihood\ntree, has been the benchmark algorithm for learning tree-structured graphical\nmodels. A bound on the sample complexity of the Chow-Liu algorithm with respect\nto the prediction-centric local total variation loss was shown in [BK19]. While\nthose results demonstrated that it is possible to learn a useful model even\nwhen recovering the true underlying graph is impossible, their bound depends on\nthe maximum strength of interactions and thus does not achieve the\ninformation-theoretic optimum. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm that\ncarefully combines elements of the Chow-Liu algorithm with tree metric\nreconstruction methods to efficiently and optimally learn tree Ising models\nunder a prediction-centric loss. Our algorithm is robust to model\nmisspecification and adversarial corruptions. In contrast, we show that the\ncelebrated Chow-Liu algorithm can be arbitrarily suboptimal.",

We present momentum pseudo-labeling (MPL), a\nsimple yet effective strategy for semi-supervised ASR.

The online model is trained to predict\npseudo-labels generated on the fly by the offline model. The offline model\nmaintains a momentum-based moving average of the online model. MPL is performed\nin a single training process and the interaction between the two models\neffectively helps them reinforce each other to improve the ASR performance.

Two key factors,\nevery component base classifier's performance and dissimilarity between each\npair of component classifiers are evaluated by the same metric - the Euclidean\ndistance. Consequently, ensembling becomes a deterministic problem and the\nperformance of an ensemble can be calculated directly by a formula.

          "description": "Adversarial training has been the topic of dozens of studies and a leading\nmethod for defending against adversarial attacks. Yet, it remains largely\nunknown (a) how adversarially-robust ImageNet classifiers (R classifiers)\ngeneralize to out-of-distribution examples; and (b) how their generalization\ncapability relates to their hidden representations. In this paper, we perform a\nthorough, systematic study to answer these two questions across AlexNet,\nGoogLeNet, and ResNet-50 architectures. We found that while standard ImageNet\nclassifiers have a strong texture bias, their R counterparts rely heavily on\nshapes. Remarkably, adversarial training induces three simplicity biases into\nhidden neurons in the process of 'robustifying' the network. That is, each\nconvolutional neuron in R networks often changes to detecting (1) pixel-wise\nsmoother patterns i.e. a mechanism that blocks high-frequency noise from\npassing through the network; (2) more lower-level features i.e. textures and\ncolors (instead of objects); and (3) fewer types of inputs. Our findings reveal\nthe interesting mechanisms that made networks more adversarially robust and\nalso explain some recent findings. Our findings reveal the interesting\nmechanisms that made networks more adversarially robust and also explain some\nrecent findings e.g. why R networks benefit from much larger capacity (Xie and\nYuille, 2020) and can act as a strong image prior in image synthesis (Santurkar\net al., 2019).",

          "description": "This work focuses on the use of deep learning for vulnerability analysis of\ncyber-physical systems (CPS). Specifically, we consider a control architecture\nwidely used in CPS (e.g., robotics), where the low-level control is based on\ne.g., the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and an anomaly detector. To facilitate\nanalyzing the impact potential sensing attacks could have, our objective is to\ndevelop learning-enabled attack generators capable of designing stealthy\nattacks that maximally degrade system operation. We show how such problem can\nbe cast within a learning-based grey-box framework where parts of the runtime\ninformation are known to the attacker, and introduce two models based on\nfeed-forward neural networks (FNN); both models are trained offline, using a\ncost function that combines the attack effects on the estimation error and the\nresidual signal used for anomaly detection, so that the trained models are\ncapable of recursively generating such effective sensor attacks in real-time.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed methods is illustrated on several case\nstudies.",

          "description": "This work builds a novel point process and tools to use the Hawkes process\nwith interval-censored data. Such data records the aggregated counts of events\nsolely during specific time intervals -- such as the number of patients\nadmitted to the hospital or the volume of vehicles passing traffic loop\ndetectors -- and not the exact occurrence time of the events. First, we\nestablish the Mean Behavior Poisson (MBP) process, a novel Poisson process with\na direct parameter correspondence to the popular self-exciting Hawkes process.\nThe event intensity function of the MBP is the expected intensity over all\npossible Hawkes realizations with the same parameter set. We fit MBP in the\ninterval-censored setting using an interval-censored Poisson log-likelihood\n(IC-LL). We use the parameter equivalence to uncover the parameters of the\nassociated Hawkes process. Second, we introduce two novel exogenous functions\nto distinguish the exogenous from the endogenous events. We propose the\nmulti-impulse exogenous function when the exogenous events are observed as\nevent time and the latent homogeneous Poisson process exogenous function when\nthe exogenous events are presented as interval-censored volumes. Third, we\nprovide several approximation methods to estimate the intensity and compensator\nfunction of MBP when no analytical solution exists. Fourth and finally, we\nconnect the interval-censored loss of MBP to a broader class of Bregman\ndivergence-based functions. Using the connection, we show that the current\nstate of the art in popularity estimation (Hawkes Intensity Process (HIP)\n(Rizoiu et al.,2017b)) is a particular case of the MBP process. We verify our\nmodels through empirical testing on synthetic data and real-world data. We find\nthat on real-world datasets that ourMBP process outperforms HIP for the task of\npopularity prediction.",

In training such deep learning based models, data augmentation has been\nfound an important technique. However, existing data augmentation methods for\nthis task mainly target at balancing the distribution of the training data with\nrespect to their tempo. In this paper, we investigate another approach for data\naugmentation, to account for the composition of the training data in terms of\nthe percussive and non-percussive sound sources. Specifically, we propose to\nemploy a blind drum separation model to segregate the drum and non-drum sounds\nfrom each training audio signal, filtering out training signals that are\ndrumless, and then use the obtained drum and non-drum stems to augment the\ntraining data.

          "description": "In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, fermentation processes play a critical\nrole on productivity and profit. A fermentation process uses living cells with\ncomplex biological mechanisms, and this leads to high variability in the\nprocess outputs. By building on the biological mechanisms of protein and\nimpurity growth, we introduce a stochastic model to characterize the\naccumulation of the protein and impurity levels in the fermentation process.\nHowever, a common challenge in industry is the availability of only very\nlimited amount of data especially in the development and early stage of\nproduction. This adds an additional layer of uncertainty, referred to as model\nrisk, due to the difficulty of estimating the model parameters with limited\ndata. In this paper, we study the harvesting decision for a fermentation\nprocess under model risk. In particular, we adopt a Bayesian approach to update\nthe unknown parameters of the growth-rate distributions, and use the resulting\nposterior distributions to characterize the impact of model risk on\nfermentation output variability. The harvesting problem is formulated as a\nMarkov decision process model with knowledge states that summarize the\nposterior distributions and hence incorporate the model risk in\ndecision-making. The resulting model is solved by using a reinforcement\nlearning algorithm based on Bayesian sparse sampling. We provide analytical\nresults on the structure of the optimal policy and its objective function, and\nexplicitly study the impact of model risk on harvesting decisions. Our case\nstudies at MSD Animal Health demonstrate that the proposed model and solution\napproach improve the harvesting decisions in real life by achieving\nsubstantially higher average output from a fermentation batch along with lower\nbatch-to-batch variability.",

          "description": "Recommender Systems (RS) have employed knowledge distillation which is a\nmodel compression technique training a compact student model with the knowledge\ntransferred from a pre-trained large teacher model. Recent work has shown that\ntransferring knowledge from the teacher's intermediate layer significantly\nimproves the recommendation quality of the student. However, they transfer the\nknowledge of individual representation point-wise and thus have a limitation in\nthat primary information of RS lies in the relations in the representation\nspace. This paper proposes a new topology distillation approach that guides the\nstudent by transferring the topological structure built upon the relations in\nthe teacher space. We first observe that simply making the student learn the\nwhole topological structure is not always effective and even degrades the\nstudent's performance. We demonstrate that because the capacity of the student\nis highly limited compared to that of the teacher, learning the whole\ntopological structure is daunting for the student. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel method named Hierarchical Topology Distillation (HTD) which\ndistills the topology hierarchically to cope with the large capacity gap. Our\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors. We also provide\nin-depth analyses to ascertain the benefit of distilling the topology for RS.",

They perform an iterative message passing operation on each\nnode and its neighbors, to solve classification/ clustering tasks --- on some\nnodes or on the whole graph --- collecting all such messages, regardless of\ntheir order. Despite the differences among the various models belonging to this\nclass, most of them adopt the same computation scheme, based on a local\naggregation mechanism and, intuitively, the local computation framework is\nmainly responsible for the expressive power of GNNs. In this paper, we prove\nthat the Weisfeiler--Lehman test induces an equivalence relationship on the\ngraph nodes that exactly corresponds to the unfolding equivalence, defined on\nthe original GNN model. Therefore, the results on the expressive power of the\noriginal GNNs can be extended to general GNNs which, under mild conditions, can\nbe proved capable of approximating, in probability and up to any precision, any\nfunction on graphs that respects the unfolding equivalence.",

In contrast,\nsolving the Schr\\\"odinger Bridge problem (SB), i.e. an entropy-regularized\noptimal transport problem on path spaces, yields diffusions which generate\nsamples from the data distribution in finite time. We present Diffusion SB\n(DSB), an original approximation of the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF)\nprocedure to solve the SB problem, and provide theoretical analysis along with\ngenerative modeling experiments. The first DSB iteration recovers the\nmethodology proposed by Song et al. (2021), with the flexibility of using\nshorter time intervals, as subsequent DSB iterations reduce the discrepancy\nbetween the final-time marginal of the forward (resp. backward) SDE with\nrespect to the prior (resp. data) distribution. Beyond generative modeling, DSB\noffers a widely applicable computational optimal transport tool as the\ncontinuous state-space analogue of the popular Sinkhorn algorithm (Cuturi,\n2013).",

Moreover, this system is subjected to\nusual thermodynamic cycles, such as adiabatic expansion and isochoric heating,\nresulting in a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE).

          "description": "Text does not fully specify the spoken form, so text-to-speech models must be\nable to learn from speech data that vary in ways not explained by the\ncorresponding text. One way to reduce the amount of unexplained variation in\ntraining data is to provide acoustic information as an additional learning\nsignal. When generating speech, modifying this acoustic information enables\nmultiple distinct renditions of a text to be produced.\n\nSince much of the unexplained variation is in the prosody, we propose a model\nthat generates speech explicitly conditioned on the three primary acoustic\ncorrelates of prosody: $F_{0}$, energy and duration. The model is flexible\nabout how the values of these features are specified: they can be externally\nprovided, or predicted from text, or predicted then subsequently modified.\n\nCompared to a model that employs a variational auto-encoder to learn\nunsupervised latent features, our model provides more interpretable,\ntemporally-precise, and disentangled control. When automatically predicting the\nacoustic features from text, it generates speech that is more natural than that\nfrom a Tacotron 2 model with reference encoder.

          "description": "Although the adoption rate of deep neural networks (DNNs) has tremendously\nincreased in recent years, a solution for their vulnerability against\nadversarial examples has not yet been found. As a result, substantial research\nefforts are dedicated to fix this weakness, with many studies typically using a\nsubset of source images to generate adversarial examples, treating every image\nin this subset as equal. We demonstrate that, in fact, not every source image\nis equally suited for this kind of assessment. To do so, we devise a\nlarge-scale model-to-model transferability scenario for which we meticulously\nanalyze the properties of adversarial examples, generated from every suitable\nsource image in ImageNet by making use of two of the most frequently deployed\nattacks. In this transferability scenario, which involves seven distinct DNN\nmodels, including the recently proposed vision transformers, we reveal that it\nis possible to have a difference of up to $12.5\\%$ in model-to-model\ntransferability success, $1.01$ in average $L_2$ perturbation, and $0.03$\n($8/225$) in average $L_{\\infty}$ perturbation when $1,000$ source images are\nsampled randomly among all suitable candidates. We then take one of the first\nsteps in evaluating the robustness of images used to create adversarial\nexamples, proposing a number of simple but effective methods to identify\nunsuitable source images, thus making it possible to mitigate extreme cases in\nexperimentation and support high-quality benchmarking.",

In this work, we aim to theoretically understand the\nrelationship between these two approaches, which are the cornerstones of\nmodel-based recommendations. Through the derivation and analysis of the\nclosed-form solutions for two basic regression and matrix factorization\napproaches, we found these two approaches are indeed inherently related but\nalso diverge in how they \"scale-down\" the singular values of the original\nuser-item interaction matrix. This analysis also helps resolve the questions\nrelated to the regularization parameter range and model complexities.

          "description": "Attention mechanism of late has been quite popular in the computer vision\ncommunity. A lot of work has been done to improve the performance of the\nnetwork, although almost always it results in increased computational\ncomplexity. In this paper, we propose a new attention module that not only\nachieves the best performance but also has lesser parameters compared to most\nexisting models. Our attention module can easily be integrated with other\nconvolutional neural networks because of its lightweight nature. The proposed\nnetwork named Dual Multi Scale Attention Network (DMSANet) is comprised of two\nparts: the first part is used to extract features at various scales and\naggregate them, the second part uses spatial and channel attention modules in\nparallel to adaptively integrate local features with their global dependencies.\nWe benchmark our network performance for Image Classification on ImageNet\ndataset, Object Detection and Instance Segmentation both on MS COCO dataset.",

We first develop a variation-aware Bernstein-based upper\nconfidence reinforcement learning (VB-UCRL), which we allow to restart\naccording to a schedule dependent on the variations. We successfully overcome\nthe challenges due to the exogeneous uncertainty and establish a regret bound\nof saving at most $\\sqrt{S}$ or $S^{\\frac{1}{6}}T^{\\frac{1}{12}}$ compared with\nthe latest results in the literature, where $S$ denotes the state size of the\nMDP and $T$ indicates the iteration index of learning steps.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of\nspeaker verification systems at the scale of 46 languages.

Modern trends in machine learning research have led to algorithms\nthat are increasingly intricate to the degree that they are considered to be\nblack boxes. In an effort to reduce the opacity of decisions, methods have been\nproposed to construe the inner workings of such models in a\nhuman-comprehensible manner. These post hoc techniques are described as being\nuniversal explainers - capable of faithfully augmenting decisions with\nalgorithmic insight. Unfortunately, there is little agreement about what\nconstitutes a \"good\" explanation. Moreover, current methods of explanation\nevaluation are derived from either subjective or proxy means. In this work, we\npropose a framework for the evaluation of post hoc explainers on ground truth\nthat is directly derived from the additive structure of a model. We demonstrate\nthe efficacy of the framework in understanding explainers by evaluating popular\nexplainers on thousands of synthetic and several real-world tasks.

          "description": "Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to improve the generalization of several\nrelated tasks by learning them jointly. As a comparison, in addition to the\njoint training scheme, modern meta-learning allows unseen tasks with limited\nlabels during the test phase, in the hope of fast adaptation over them. Despite\nthe subtle difference between MTL and meta-learning in the problem formulation,\nboth learning paradigms share the same insight that the shared structure\nbetween existing training tasks could lead to better generalization and\nadaptation. In this paper, we take one important step further to understand the\nclose connection between these two learning paradigms, through both theoretical\nanalysis and empirical investigation. Theoretically, we first demonstrate that\nMTL shares the same optimization formulation with a class of gradient-based\nmeta-learning (GBML) algorithms. We then prove that for over-parameterized\nneural networks with sufficient depth, the learned predictive functions of MTL\nand GBML are close. In particular, this result implies that the predictions\ngiven by these two models are similar over the same unseen task. Empirically,\nwe corroborate our theoretical findings by showing that, with proper\nimplementation, MTL is competitive against state-of-the-art GBML algorithms on\na set of few-shot image classification benchmarks. Since existing GBML\nalgorithms often involve costly second-order bi-level optimization, our\nfirst-order MTL method is an order of magnitude faster on large-scale datasets\nsuch as mini-ImageNet. We believe this work could help bridge the gap between\nthese two learning paradigms, and provide a computationally efficient\nalternative to GBML that also supports fast task adaptation.",

Despite great successes of Deep Reinforcement Learning,\ndevelopment of reliable and efficient numerical algorithms to minimise the\nBellman Error is still of great scientific interest and practical demand. Such\na challenge is partially due to the underlying optimisation problem being\nhighly non-convex or using incorrect gradient information as done in\nSemi-Gradient algorithms. In this work, we analyse the Mean Squared Bellman\nError from a smooth optimisation perspective combined with a Residual Gradient\nformulation. Our contribution is two-fold.\n\nFirst, we analyse critical points of the error function and provide technical\ninsights on the optimisation procure and design choices for neural networks.\nWhen the existence of global minima is assumed and the objective fulfils\ncertain conditions we can eliminate suboptimal local minima when using\nover-parametrised neural networks. We can construct an efficient Approximate\nNewton's algorithm based on our analysis and confirm theoretical properties of\nthis algorithm such as being locally quadratically convergent to a global\nminimum numerically.\n\nSecond, we demonstrate feasibility and generalisation capabilities of the\nproposed algorithm empirically using continuous control problems and provide a\nnumerical verification of our critical point analysis.

In this paper, we\nstudy the problem of graph data augmentation for Graph Convolutional Network\n(GCN) in the context of improving the node embeddings for semi-supervised node\nclassification. Specifically, we conduct cosine similarity based cross\noperation on the original features to create new graph features, including new\nnode attributes and new graph topologies, and we combine them as new pairwise\ninputs for specific GCNs. Then, we propose an attentional integrating model to\nweighted sum the hidden node embeddings encoded by these GCNs into the final\nnode embeddings. We also conduct a disparity constraint on these hidden node\nembeddings when training to ensure that non-redundant information is captured\nfrom different features.

          "description": "Given a stream of graph edges from a dynamic graph, how can we assign anomaly\nscores to edges in an online manner, for the purpose of detecting unusual\nbehavior, using constant time and memory? Existing approaches aim to detect\nindividually surprising edges. In this work, we propose MIDAS, which focuses on\ndetecting microcluster anomalies, or suddenly arriving groups of suspiciously\nsimilar edges, such as lockstep behavior, including denial of service attacks\nin network traffic data. We further propose MIDAS-F, to solve the problem by\nwhich anomalies are incorporated into the algorithm's internal states, creating\na `poisoning' effect that can allow future anomalies to slip through\nundetected. MIDAS-F introduces two modifications: 1) We modify the anomaly\nscoring function, aiming to reduce the `poisoning' effect of newly arriving\nedges; 2) We introduce a conditional merge step, which updates the algorithm's\ndata structures after each time tick, but only if the anomaly score is below a\nthreshold value, also to reduce the `poisoning' effect. Experiments show that\nMIDAS-F has significantly higher accuracy than MIDAS. MIDAS has the following\nproperties: (a) it detects microcluster anomalies while providing theoretical\nguarantees about its false positive probability; (b) it is online, thus\nprocessing each edge in constant time and constant memory, and also processes\nthe data orders-of-magnitude faster than state-of-the-art approaches; (c) it\nprovides up to 62% higher ROC-AUC than state-of-the-art approaches.",

Over\nthe years, several deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this\ntask, however their performance has been subpar compared to handcrafted\ntechniques, especially while dealing with reverse loops. In this paper, we\nintroduce the novel LCDNet that effectively detects loop closures in LiDAR\npoint clouds by simultaneously identifying previously visited places and\nestimating the 6-DoF relative transformation between the current scan and the\nmap. LCDNet is composed of a shared encoder, a place recognition head that\nextracts global descriptors, and a relative pose head that estimates the\ntransformation between two point clouds. We introduce a novel relative pose\nhead based on the unbalanced optimal transport theory that we implement in a\ndifferentiable manner to allow for end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations\nof LCDNet on multiple real-world autonomous driving datasets show that our\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art loop closure detection and point cloud\nregistration techniques by a large margin, especially while dealing with\nreverse loops.

Here, we develop a\nframework that allows expediting the search of solutions close to global\noptimum on complex optimization spaces. We study the way representative black\nbox optimization algorithms work, including genetic algorithm (GA), particle\nswarm optimization (PSO), simulated annealing (SA), and mesh adaptive direct\nsearch (NOMAD). We then propose and utilize a two-step approach that identifies\nbest performance algorithms on arbitrarily complex search spaces.

          "description": "For deployment, neural architecture search should be hardware-aware, in order\nto satisfy the device-specific constraints (e.g., memory usage, latency and\nenergy consumption) and enhance the model efficiency. Existing methods on\nhardware-aware NAS collect a large number of samples (e.g., accuracy and\nlatency) from a target device, either builds a lookup table or a latency\nestimator. However, such approach is impractical in real-world scenarios as\nthere exist numerous devices with different hardware specifications, and\ncollecting samples from such a large number of devices will require prohibitive\ncomputational and monetary cost. To overcome such limitations, we propose\nHardware-adaptive Efficient Latency Predictor (HELP), which formulates the\ndevice-specific latency estimation problem as a meta-learning problem, such\nthat we can estimate the latency of a model's performance for a given task on\nan unseen device with a few samples. To this end, we introduce novel hardware\nembeddings to embed any devices considering them as black-box functions that\noutput latencies, and meta-learn the hardware-adaptive latency predictor in a\ndevice-dependent manner, using the hardware embeddings. We validate the\nproposed HELP for its latency estimation performance on unseen platforms, on\nwhich it achieves high estimation performance with as few as 10 measurement\nsamples, outperforming all relevant baselines. We also validate end-to-end NAS\nframeworks using HELP against ones without it, and show that it largely reduces\nthe total time cost of the base NAS method, in latency-constrained settings.",

          "description": "Much work has been done recently to make neural networks more interpretable,\nand one obvious approach is to arrange for the network to use only a subset of\nthe available features. In linear models, Lasso (or $\\ell_1$-regularized)\nregression assigns zero weights to the most irrelevant or redundant features,\nand is widely used in data science. However the Lasso only applies to linear\nmodels. Here we introduce LassoNet, a neural network framework with global\nfeature selection. Our approach enforces a hierarchy: specifically a feature\ncan participate in a hidden unit only if its linear representative is active.\nUnlike other approaches to feature selection for neural nets, our method uses a\nmodified objective function with constraints, and so integrates feature\nselection with the parameter learning directly. As a result, it delivers an\nentire regularization path of solutions with a range of feature sparsity. On\nsystematic experiments, LassoNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods for feature selection and regression. The LassoNet method uses\nprojected proximal gradient descent, and generalizes directly to deep networks.\nIt can be implemented by adding just a few lines of code to a standard neural\nnetwork.",

Towards formally\nexplaining such structures of the Hessian, we show that the new eigenspace\nstructure can be explained by approximating the Hessian using Kronecker\nfactorization; we also prove the low rank structure for random data at random\ninitialization for over-parametrized two-layer neural nets.

The latter comes as a result of\nthe imbalanced scale between the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence in\nthe objective function. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose the\ndiscrete variational attention model with categorical distribution over the\nattention mechanism owing to the discrete nature in languages. Our approach is\ncombined with an auto-regressive prior to capture the sequential dependency\nfrom observations, which can enhance the latent space for language generation.\nMoreover, thanks to the property of discreteness, the training of our proposed\napproach does not suffer from posterior collapse. Furthermore, we carefully\nanalyze the superiority of discrete latent space over the continuous space with\nthe common Gaussian distribution. Extensive experiments on language generation\ndemonstrate superior advantages of our proposed approach in comparison with the\nstate-of-the-art counterparts.",

          "description": "Quantization is used to speed up execution time and save power when runnning\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices like AI chips. To investigate the\neffect of quantization, we need performing inference after quantizing the\nweights of DNN with 32-bit floating-point precision by a some bit width, and\nthen quantizing them back to 32-bit floating-point precision. This is because\nthe DNN library can only handle floating-point numbers. However, the accuracy\nof the emulation does not provide accurate precision. We need accurate\nprecision to detect overflow in MAC operations or to verify the operation on\nedge de vices. We have developed PyParch, a DNN library that executes quantized\nDNNs (QNNs) with exactly the same be havior as hardware. In this paper, we\ndescribe a new proposal and implementation of PyParch. As a result of the\nevaluation, the accuracy of QNNs with arbitrary bit widths can be estimated for\nla rge and complex DNNs such as YOLOv5, and the overflow can be detected. We\nevaluated the overhead of the emulation time and found that it was 5.6 times\nslower for QNN and 42\n\ntimes slower for QNN with overflow detection compared to the normal DNN\nexecution time.",

Thus, in the presence of noise, the effects of the delay become\nnegligible after a few iterations and the algorithm converges at the same\noptimal rate as standard SGD. This result extends a line of research that\nshowed similar results in the asymptotic regime or for strongly-convex\nquadratic functions only.

In all of these settings, we improve upon\nthe best known rates. These results show that SGD is robust to compressed\nand/or delayed stochastic gradient updates.

          "description": "Image-to-Image (I2I) multi-domain translation models are usually evaluated\nalso using the quality of their semantic interpolation results. However,\nstate-of-the-art models frequently show abrupt changes in the image appearance\nduring interpolation, and usually perform poorly in interpolations across\ndomains. In this paper, we propose a new training protocol based on three\nspecific losses which help a translation network to learn a smooth and\ndisentangled latent style space in which: 1) Both intra- and inter-domain\ninterpolations correspond to gradual changes in the generated images and 2) The\ncontent of the source image is better preserved during the translation.\nMoreover, we propose a novel evaluation metric to properly measure the\nsmoothness of latent style space of I2I translation models. The proposed method\ncan be plugged into existing translation approaches, and our extensive\nexperiments on different datasets show that it can significantly boost the\nquality of the generated images and the graduality of the interpolations.",

This approximation, termed the KALE (KL approximate lower-bound\nestimator), solves a regularized version of the Fenchel dual problem defining\nthe KL over a restricted class of functions. When using a Reproducing Kernel\nHilbert Space (RKHS) to define the function class, we show that the KALE\ncontinuously interpolates between the KL and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy\n(MMD). Like the MMD and other Integral Probability Metrics, the KALE remains\nwell defined for mutually singular distributions. Nonetheless, the KALE\ninherits from the limiting KL a greater sensitivity to mismatch in the support\nof the distributions, compared with the MMD. These two properties make the KALE\ngradient flow particularly well suited when the target distribution is\nsupported on a low-dimensional manifold. Under an assumption of sufficient\nsmoothness of the trajectories, we show the global convergence of the KALE\nflow. We propose a particle implementation of the flow given initial samples\nfrom the source and the target distribution, which we use to empirically\nconfirm the KALE's properties.",

A highly visible\ninstance of this is in molecular biology, where an important goal is to\ndetermine functionally-relevant forms/structures that a protein molecule\nemploys to interact with molecular partners in the living cell. This goal is\ntypically pursued under the umbrella of stochastic optimization with algorithms\nthat optimize a scoring function. Research repeatedly shows that current\nscoring function, though steadily improving, correlate weakly with molecular\nactivity. Inspired by recent momentum in generative deep learning, this paper\nproposes and evaluates an alternative approach to generating\nfunctionally-relevant three-dimensional structures of a protein. Though\ntypically deep generative models struggle with highly-structured data, the work\npresented here circumvents this challenge via graph-generative models. A\ncomprehensive evaluation of several deep architectures shows the promise of\ngenerative models in directly revealing the latent space for sampling novel\ntertiary structures, as well as in highlighting axes/factors that carry\nstructural meaning and open the black box often associated with deep models.\nThe work presented here is a first step towards interpretative, deep generative\nmodels becoming viable and informative complementary approaches to protein\nstructure prediction.",

Such systems may\nbehave chaotically under certain conditions, and so the ability to detect chaos\nbased on empirical measurement is an important step in characterizing and\npredicting these processes. Classifying a system as chaotic usually requires\nestimating its largest Lyapunov exponent, which quantifies the average rate of\nconvergence or divergence of initially close trajectories in state space, and\nfor which a positive value is generally accepted as an operational definition\nof chaos. Estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent from observations of a\nprocess is especially challenging in systems affected by dynamical noise, which\nis the case for many models of real-world processes, in particular models of\nbiological systems. We describe a novel method for estimating the largest\nLyapunov exponent from data, based on training Deep Learning models on\nsynthetically generated trajectories, and demonstrate that this method yields\naccurate and noise-robust predictions given relatively short inputs and across\na range of different dynamical systems. Our method is unique in that it can\nanalyze tree-shaped data, a ubiquitous topology in biological settings, and\nspecifically in dynamics over lineages of cells or organisms.

          "description": "Training sparse networks to converge to the same performance as dense neural\narchitectures has proven to be elusive. Recent work suggests that\ninitialization is the key. However, while this direction of research has had\nsome success, focusing on initialization alone appears to be inadequate. In\nthis paper, we take a broader view of training sparse networks and consider the\nrole of regularization, optimization, and architecture choices on sparse\nmodels. We propose a simple experimental framework, Same Capacity Sparse vs\nDense Comparison (SC-SDC), that allows for a fair comparison of sparse and\ndense networks. Furthermore, we propose a new measure of gradient flow,\nEffective Gradient Flow (EGF), that better correlates to performance in sparse\nnetworks. Using top-line metrics, SC-SDC and EGF, we show that default choices\nof optimizers, activation functions and regularizers used for dense networks\ncan disadvantage sparse networks. Based upon these findings, we show that\ngradient flow in sparse networks can be improved by reconsidering aspects of\nthe architecture design and the training regime. Our work suggests that\ninitialization is only one piece of the puzzle and taking a wider view of\ntailoring optimization to sparse networks yields promising results.",

To study this question, we introduce the notions of the\n\\textit{ordinal capacity} of a target space form and \\emph{ordinal spread} of\nthe similarity measurements. The latter is an indicator of complex patterns in\nthe measurements, while the former quantifies the capacity of a space form to\naccommodate a set of measurements with a specific ordinal spread profile. We\nprove that the ordinal capacity of a space form is related to its dimension and\nthe sign of its curvature. This leads to a lower bound on the Euclidean and\nspherical embedding dimension of what we term similarity graphs. More\nimportantly, we show that the statistical behavior of the ordinal spread random\nvariables defined on a similarity graph can be used to identify its underlying\nspace form.

          "description": "Weak supervision has shown promising results in many natural language\nprocessing tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Existing work mainly\nfocuses on learning deep NER models only with weak supervision, i.e., without\nany human annotation, and shows that by merely using weakly labeled data, one\ncan achieve good performance, though still underperforms fully supervised NER\nwith manually/strongly labeled data. In this paper, we consider a more\npractical scenario, where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data\nand a large amount of weakly labeled data. Unfortunately, we observe that\nweakly labeled data does not necessarily improve, or even deteriorate the model\nperformance (due to the extensive noise in the weak labels) when we train deep\nNER models over a simple or weighted combination of the strongly labeled and\nweakly labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-stage\ncomputational framework -- NEEDLE with three essential ingredients: (1) weak\nlabel completion, (2) noise-aware loss function, and (3) final fine-tuning over\nthe strongly labeled data. Through experiments on E-commerce query NER and\nBiomedical NER, we demonstrate that NEEDLE can effectively suppress the noise\nof the weak labels and outperforms existing methods.

However, the exact tradeoff between fairness and accuracy with a\nreal-valued target is not clear. In this paper, we characterize the inherent\ntradeoff between statistical parity and accuracy in the regression setting by\nproviding a lower bound on the error of any fair regressor. Our lower bound is\nsharp, algorithm-independent, and admits a simple interpretation: when the\nmoments of the target differ between groups, any fair algorithm has to make a\nlarge error on at least one of the groups. We further extend this result to\ngive a lower bound on the joint error of any (approximately) fair algorithm,\nusing the Wasserstein distance to measure the quality of the approximation. On\nthe upside, we establish the first connection between individual fairness,\naccuracy parity, and the Wasserstein distance by showing that if a regressor is\nindividually fair, it also approximately verifies the accuracy parity, where\nthe gap is given by the Wasserstein distance between the two groups. Inspired\nby our theoretical results, we develop a practical algorithm for fair\nregression through the lens of representation learning, and conduct experiments\non a real-world dataset to corroborate our findings.",

In this paper we re-think the ReLU computation and propose\noptimizations for PI tailored to properties of neural networks. Specifically,\nwe reformulate ReLU as an approximate sign test and introduce a novel\ntruncation method for the sign test that significantly reduces the cost per\nReLU. These optimizations result in a specific type of stochastic ReLU. The key\nobservation is that the stochastic fault behavior is well suited for the\nfault-tolerant properties of neural network inference. Thus, we provide\nsignificant savings without impacting accuracy. We collectively call the\noptimizations Circa and demonstrate improvements of up to 4.7x storage and 3x\nruntime over baseline implementations; we further show that Circa can be used\non top of recent PI optimizations to obtain 1.8x additional speedup.",

          "description": "In this paper, we present a novel method to constrain invexity on Neural\nNetworks (NN). Invex functions ensure every stationary point is global minima.\nHence, gradient descent commenced from any point will lead to the global\nminima. Another advantage of invexity on NN is to divide data space locally\ninto two connected sets with a highly non-linear decision boundary by simply\nthresholding the output. To this end, we formulate a universal invex function\napproximator and employ it to enforce invexity in NN. We call it Input Invex\nNeural Networks (II-NN). We first fit data with a known invex function,\nfollowed by modification with a NN, compare the direction of the gradient and\npenalize the direction of gradient on NN if it contradicts with the direction\nof reference invex function. In order to penalize the direction of the gradient\nwe perform Gradient Clipped Gradient Penalty (GC-GP). We applied our method to\nthe existing NNs for both image classification and regression tasks. From the\nextensive empirical and qualitative experiments, we observe that our method\ngives the performance similar to ordinary NN yet having invexity.

Methods such as Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) tackle this\nissue by also learning from realized but unplanned-for goals. But HER is known\nto introduce bias, and can converge to low-return policies by overestimating\nchancy outcomes. First, we vindicate HER by proving that it is actually\nunbiased in deterministic environments, such as many optimal control settings.\nNext, for stochastic environments in continuous spaces, we tackle sparse\nrewards by directly taking the infinitely sparse reward limit. We fully\nformalize the problem of multi-goal RL with infinitely sparse Dirac rewards at\neach goal.

Instead of constructing a boundary between\nthe given class and other classes, our method can conduct discriminative\nclassification between all the classes even if no data from the other classes\nare provided. We further theoretically and experimentally show that our method\ncan be Bayes-consistent with a simple modification even if the provided\nconfidences are highly noisy.

Pipelines are\nconceptually simple, but errors propagate from one component to the next,\nwithout later components being able to revise earlier decisions. We present an\narchitecture for joint document and snippet ranking, the two middle stages,\nwhich leverages the intuition that relevant documents have good snippets and\ngood snippets come from relevant documents. The architecture is general and can\nbe used with any neural text relevance ranker. We experiment with two main\ninstantiations of the architecture, based on POSIT-DRMM (PDRMM) and a\nBERT-based ranker. Experiments on biomedical data from BIOASQ show that our\njoint models vastly outperform the pipelines in snippet retrieval, the main\ngoal for QA, with fewer trainable parameters, also remaining competitive in\ndocument retrieval. Furthermore, our joint PDRMM-based model is competitive\nwith BERT-based models, despite using orders of magnitude fewer parameters.\nThese claims are also supported by human evaluation on two test batches of\nBIOASQ. To test our key findings on another dataset, we modified the Natural\nQuestions dataset so that it can also be used for document and snippet\nretrieval. Our joint PDRMM-based model again outperforms the corresponding\npipeline in snippet retrieval on the modified Natural Questions dataset, even\nthough it performs worse than the pipeline in document retrieval.

          "description": "Language is an interface to the outside world. In order for embodied agents\nto use it, language must be grounded in other, sensorimotor modalities. While\nthere is an extended literature studying how machines can learn grounded\nlanguage, the topic of how to learn spatio-temporal linguistic concepts is\nstill largely uncharted. To make progress in this direction, we here introduce\na novel spatio-temporal language grounding task where the goal is to learn the\nmeaning of spatio-temporal descriptions of behavioral traces of an embodied\nagent. This is achieved by training a truth function that predicts if a\ndescription matches a given history of observations. The descriptions involve\ntime-extended predicates in past and present tense as well as spatio-temporal\nreferences to objects in the scene. To study the role of architectural biases\nin this task, we train several models including multimodal Transformer\narchitectures; the latter implement different attention computations between\nwords and objects across space and time. We test models on two classes of\ngeneralization: 1) generalization to randomly held-out sentences; 2)\ngeneralization to grammar primitives. We observe that maintaining object\nidentity in the attention computation of our Transformers is instrumental to\nachieving good performance on generalization overall, and that summarizing\nobject traces in a single token has little influence on performance. We then\ndiscuss how this opens new perspectives for language-guided autonomous embodied\nagents. We also release our code under open-source license as well as\npretrained models and datasets to encourage the wider community to build upon\nand extend our work in the future.",

          "description": "Predicting the future motion of multiple agents is necessary for planning in\ndynamic environments. This task is challenging for autonomous driving since\nagents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) and their associated behaviors may be\ndiverse and influence each other. Most prior work has focused on first\npredicting independent futures for each agent based on all past motion, and\nthen planning against these independent predictions. However, planning against\nfixed predictions can suffer from the inability to represent the future\ninteraction possibilities between different agents, leading to sub-optimal\nplanning. In this work, we formulate a model for predicting the behavior of all\nagents jointly in real-world driving environments in a unified manner. Inspired\nby recent language modeling approaches, we use a masking strategy as the query\nto our model, enabling one to invoke a single model to predict agent behavior\nin many ways, such as potentially conditioned on the goal or full future\ntrajectory of the autonomous vehicle or the behavior of other agents in the\nenvironment. Our model architecture fuses heterogeneous world state in a\nunified Transformer architecture by employing attention across road elements,\nagent interactions and time steps. We evaluate our approach on autonomous\ndriving datasets for behavior prediction, and achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance. Our work demonstrates that formulating the problem of behavior\nprediction in a unified architecture with a masking strategy may allow us to\nhave a single model that can perform multiple motion prediction and planning\nrelated tasks effectively.",

Integration of BSR\noperations enables the TVM runtime execution to leverage structured pattern\nsparsity induced by model regularization.\n\nThis integrated view of pruning algorithms enables us to study relationships\nbetween modeling decisions and their direct impact on sparsity-enhanced\nexecution.

In this paper, we\ntherefore explore a new way of such a scenario-based robustness approximation\nby using methods from machine learning.

The network is then able\nto predict the robustness of untrained instances with high accuracy using only\nits key features, allowing for a robustness oracle for transport planners that\napproximates the robustness in constant time. Such an oracle can be used as\nblack box to increase the robustness within a local search framework for\nintegrated public transportation planning.

          "description": "Reinforcement learning is made much more complex when the agent's observation\nis partial or noisy. This case corresponds to a partially observable Markov\ndecision process (POMDP). One strategy to seek good performance in POMDPs is to\nendow the agent with a finite memory, whose update is governed by the policy.\nHowever, policy optimization is non-convex in that case and can lead to poor\ntraining performance for random initialization. The performance can be\nempirically improved by constraining the memory architecture, then sacrificing\noptimality to facilitate training. Here we study this trade-off in the two-arm\nbandit problem, and compare two extreme cases: (i) the random access memory\nwhere any transitions between $M$ memory states are allowed and (ii) a fixed\nmemory where the agent can access its last $m$ actions and rewards. For (i),\nthe probability $q$ to play the worst arm is known to be exponentially small in\n$M$ for the optimal policy. Our main result is to show that similar performance\ncan be reached for (ii) as well, despite the simplicity of the memory\narchitecture: using a conjecture on Gray-ordered binary necklaces, we find\npolicies for which $q$ is exponentially small in $2^m$ i.e. $q\\sim\\alpha^{2^m}$\nfor some $\\alpha < 1$. Interestingly, we observe empirically that training from\nrandom initialization leads to very poor results for (i), and significantly\nbetter results for (ii).",

Using heuristic methods from physics, we find in the\nridgeless case that locality is key in determining the learning curve exponent\n$\\beta$ (that relates the test error $\\epsilon_t\\sim P^{-\\beta}$ to the size of\nthe training set $P$), whereas translational invariance is not. In particular,\nif the filter size of the teacher $t$ is smaller than that of the student $s$,\n$\\beta$ is a function of $s$ only and does not depend on the input dimension.\nWe confirm our predictions on $\\beta$ empirically. Theoretically, in some cases\n(including when teacher and student are equal) it can be shown that this\nprediction is an upper bound on performance.

In particular, we study the power of a malicious agent whose\ngoal is to construct a model g that fits its training data and nothing else,\nbut is indistinguishable from an accurate model f. We say that g strongly\nspoofs f if no polynomial-time algorithm can tell them apart. If instead we\nrestrict to algorithms that run in $n^c$ time for some fixed $c$, we say that g\nc-weakly spoofs f. Our main results are\n\n1. Under cryptographic assumptions, strong spoofing is possible and 2. For\nany c> 0, c-weak spoofing is possible unconditionally\n\nWhile the assumption of a malicious agent is an extreme scenario (hopefully\ncompanies training large models are not malicious), we believe that it sheds\nlight on the inherent difficulties of blindly trusting large proprietary models\nor data.",

          "description": "Training graph classifiers able to distinguish between healthy brains and\ndysfunctional ones, can help identifying substructures associated to specific\ncognitive phenotypes. However, the mere predictive power of the graph\nclassifier is of limited interest to the neuroscientists, which have plenty of\ntools for the diagnosis of specific mental disorders. What matters is the\ninterpretation of the model, as it can provide novel insights and new\nhypotheses.\n\nIn this paper we propose \\emph{counterfactual graphs} as a way to produce\nlocal post-hoc explanations of any black-box graph classifier. Given a graph\nand a black-box, a counterfactual is a graph which, while having high\nstructural similarity with the original graph, is classified by the black-box\nin a different class. We propose and empirically compare several strategies for\ncounterfactual graph search. Our experiments against a white-box classifier\nwith known optimal counterfactual, show that our methods, although heuristic,\ncan produce counterfactuals very close to the optimal one. Finally, we show how\nto use counterfactual graphs to build global explanations correctly capturing\nthe behaviour of different black-box classifiers and providing interesting\ninsights for the neuroscientists.",

          "description": "Hospital readmission prediction is a study to learn models from historical\nmedical data to predict probability of a patient returning to hospital in a\ncertain period, 30 or 90 days, after the discharge. The motivation is to help\nhealth providers deliver better treatment and post-discharge strategies, lower\nthe hospital readmission rate, and eventually reduce the medical costs. Due to\ninherent complexity of diseases and healthcare ecosystems, modeling hospital\nreadmission is facing many challenges. By now, a variety of methods have been\ndeveloped, but existing literature fails to deliver a complete picture to\nanswer some fundamental questions, such as what are the main challenges and\nsolutions in modeling hospital readmission; what are typical features/models\nused for readmission prediction; how to achieve meaningful and transparent\npredictions for decision making; and what are possible conflicts when deploying\npredictive approaches for real-world usages. In this paper, we systematically\nreview computational models for hospital readmission prediction, and propose a\ntaxonomy of challenges featuring four main categories: (1) data variety and\ncomplexity; (2) data imbalance, locality and privacy; (3) model\ninterpretability; and (4) model implementation. The review summarizes methods\nin each category, and highlights technical solutions proposed to address the\nchallenges. In addition, a review of datasets and resources available for\nhospital readmission modeling also provides firsthand materials to support\nresearchers and practitioners to design new approaches for effective and\nefficient hospital readmission prediction.",

          "description": "Gaussian process optimization is a successful class of algorithms (e.g.\nGP-UCB) to optimize a black-box function through sequential evaluations.\nHowever, when the domain of the function is continuous, Gaussian process\noptimization has to either rely on a fixed discretization of the space, or\nsolve a non-convex optimization subproblem at each evaluation. The first\napproach can negatively affect performance, while the second one puts a heavy\ncomputational burden on the algorithm. A third option, that only recently has\nbeen theoretically studied, is to adaptively discretize the function domain.\nEven though this approach avoids the extra non-convex optimization costs, the\noverall computational complexity is still prohibitive. An algorithm such as\nGP-UCB has a runtime of $O(T^4)$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. In\nthis paper, we introduce Ada-BKB (Adaptive Budgeted Kernelized Bandit), a\nno-regret Gaussian process optimization algorithm for functions on continuous\ndomains, that provably runs in $O(T^2 d_\\text{eff}^2)$, where $d_\\text{eff}$ is\nthe effective dimension of the explored space, and which is typically much\nsmaller than $T$.

          "description": "Anomalous diffusion, which shows a deviation of transport dynamics from the\nframework of standard Brownian motion, is involved in the evolution of various\nphysical, chemical, biological, and economic systems. The study of such random\nprocesses is of fundamental importance in unveiling the physical properties of\nrandom walkers and complex systems. However, classical methods to characterize\nanomalous diffusion are often disqualified for individual short trajectories,\nleading to the launch of the Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge. This\nchallenge aims at objectively assessing and comparing new approaches for single\ntrajectory characterization, with respect to three different aspects: the\ninference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the\ndiffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, to\naddress the inference and classification tasks in the challenge, we develop a\nWaveNet-based deep neural network (WADNet) by combining a modified WaveNet\nencoder with long short-term memory networks, without any prior knowledge of\nanomalous diffusion. As the performance of our model has surpassed the current\n1st places in the challenge leaderboard on both two tasks for all dimensions (6\nsubtasks), WADNet could be the part of state-of-the-art techniques to decode\nthe AnDi database.

          "description": "The training of deep learning models poses vast challenges of including\nparameter tuning and ordering of training data. Significant research has been\ndone in Curriculum learning for optimizing the sequence of training data.\nRecent works have focused on using complex reinforcement learning techniques to\nfind the optimal data ordering strategy to maximize learning for a given\nnetwork. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient technique based on\ncontinuous optimization. We call this new approach Training Sequence\nOptimization (TSO). There are three critical components in our proposed\napproach: (a) An encoder network maps/embeds training sequence into continuous\nspace. (b) A predictor network uses the continuous representation of a strategy\nas input and predicts the accuracy for fixed network architecture. (c) A\ndecoder further maps a continuous representation of a strategy to the ordered\ntraining dataset. The performance predictor and encoder enable us to perform\ngradient-based optimization in the continuous space to find the embedding of\noptimal training data ordering with potentially better accuracy. Experiments\nshow that we can gain 2AP with our generated optimal curriculum strategy over\nthe random strategy using the CIFAR-100 dataset and have better boosts than the\nstate of the art CL algorithms.

          "description": "A variety of dimensionality reduction techniques have been applied for\ncomputations involving large matrices. The underlying matrix is randomly\ncompressed into a smaller one, while approximately retaining many of its\noriginal properties. As a result, much of the expensive computation can be\nperformed on the small matrix. The sketching of positive semidefinite (PSD)\nmatrices is well understood, but there are many applications where the related\nmatrices are not PSD, including Hessian matrices in non-convex optimization and\ncovariance matrices in regression applications involving complex numbers. In\nthis paper, we present novel dimensionality reduction methods for non-PSD\nmatrices, as well as their ``square-roots\", which involve matrices with complex\nentries. We show how these techniques can be used for multiple downstream\ntasks. In particular, we show how to use the proposed matrix sketching\ntechniques for both convex and non-convex optimization, $\\ell_p$-regression for\nevery $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$, and vector-matrix-vector queries.",

          "description": "Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are increasingly commonly used in software\nengineering and code intelligence tasks. These are powerful tools that are\ncapable of learning highly generalizable patterns from large datasets through\nmillions of parameters. At the same time, training DNNs means walking a knife's\nedges, because their large capacity also renders them prone to memorizing data\npoints. While traditionally thought of as an aspect of over-training, recent\nwork suggests that the memorization risk manifests especially strongly when the\ntraining datasets are noisy and memorization is the only recourse.\nUnfortunately, most code intelligence tasks rely on rather noise-prone and\nrepetitive data sources, such as GitHub, which, due to their sheer size, cannot\nbe manually inspected and evaluated. We evaluate the memorization and\ngeneralization tendencies in neural code intelligence models through a case\nstudy across several benchmarks and model families by leveraging established\napproaches from other fields that use DNNs, such as introducing targeted noise\ninto the training dataset. In addition to reinforcing prior general findings\nabout the extent of memorization in DNNs, our results shed light on the impact\nof noisy dataset in training.",

          "description": "Efficient evaluation of a network architecture drawn from a large search\nspace remains a key challenge in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Vanilla NAS\nevaluates each architecture by training from scratch, which gives the true\nperformance but is extremely time-consuming. Recently, one-shot NAS\nsubstantially reduces the computation cost by training only one supernetwork,\na.k.a. supernet, to approximate the performance of every architecture in the\nsearch space via weight-sharing. However, the performance estimation can be\nvery inaccurate due to the co-adaption among operations. In this paper, we\npropose few-shot NAS that uses multiple supernetworks, called sub-supernet,\neach covering different regions of the search space to alleviate the undesired\nco-adaption. Compared to one-shot NAS, few-shot NAS improves the accuracy of\narchitecture evaluation with a small increase of evaluation cost. With only up\nto 7 sub-supernets, few-shot NAS establishes new SoTAs: on ImageNet, it finds\nmodels that reach 80.5% top-1 accuracy at 600 MB FLOPS and 77.5% top-1 accuracy\nat 238 MFLOPS; on CIFAR10, it reaches 98.72% top-1 accuracy without using extra\ndata or transfer learning. In Auto-GAN, few-shot NAS outperforms the previously\npublished results by up to 20%. Extensive experiments show that few-shot NAS\nsignificantly improves various one-shot methods, including 4 gradient-based and\n6 search-based methods on 3 different tasks in NasBench-201 and\nNasBench1-shot-1.",

          "description": "A data science task can be deemed as making sense of the data or testing a\nhypothesis about it. The conclusions inferred from data can greatly guide us to\nmake informative decisions. Big data has enabled us to carry out countless\nprediction tasks in conjunction with machine learning, such as identifying high\nrisk patients suffering from a certain disease and taking preventable measures.\nHowever, healthcare practitioners are not content with mere predictions - they\nare also interested in the cause-effect relation between input features and\nclinical outcomes. Understanding such relations will help doctors treat\npatients and reduce the risk effectively. Causality is typically identified by\nrandomized controlled trials. Often such trials are not feasible when\nscientists and researchers turn to observational studies and attempt to draw\ninferences. However, observational studies may also be affected by selection\nand/or confounding biases that can result in wrong causal conclusions. In this\nchapter, we will try to highlight some of the drawbacks that may arise in\ntraditional machine learning and statistical approaches to analyze the\nobservational data, particularly in the healthcare data analytics domain. We\nwill discuss causal inference and ways to discover the cause-effect from\nobservational studies in healthcare domain. Moreover, we will demonstrate the\napplications of causal inference in tackling some common machine learning\nissues such as missing data and model transportability. Finally, we will\ndiscuss the possibility of integrating reinforcement learning with causality as\na way to counter confounding bias.",

          "description": "Forecasting the formation and development of clouds is a central element of\nmodern weather forecasting systems. Incorrect clouds forecasts can lead to\nmajor uncertainty in the overall accuracy of weather forecasts due to their\nintrinsic role in the Earth's climate system. Few studies have tackled this\nchallenging problem from a machine learning point-of-view due to a shortage of\nhigh-resolution datasets with many historical observations globally. In this\npaper, we present a novel satellite-based dataset called ``CloudCast''. It\nconsists of 70,080 images with 10 different cloud types for multiple layers of\nthe atmosphere annotated on a pixel level. The spatial resolution of the\ndataset is 928 x 1530 pixels (3x3 km per pixel) with 15-min intervals between\nframes for the period 2017-01-01 to 2018-12-31. All frames are centered and\nprojected over Europe. To supplement the dataset, we conduct an evaluation\nstudy with current state-of-the-art video prediction methods such as\nconvolutional long short-term memory networks, generative adversarial networks,\nand optical flow-based extrapolation methods. As the evaluation of video\nprediction is difficult in practice, we aim for a thorough evaluation in the\nspatial and temporal domain. Our benchmark models show promising results but\nwith ample room for improvement.

          "description": "In design, fabrication, and control problems, we are often faced with the\ntask of synthesis, in which we must generate an object or configuration that\nsatisfies a set of constraints while maximizing one or more objective\nfunctions. The synthesis problem is typically characterized by a physical\nprocess in which many different realizations may achieve the goal. This\nmany-to-one map presents challenges to the supervised learning of feed-forward\nsynthesis, as the set of viable designs may have a complex structure. In\naddition, the non-differentiable nature of many physical simulations prevents\ndirect optimization. We address both of these problems with a two-stage neural\nnetwork architecture that we may consider to be an autoencoder. We first learn\nthe decoder: a differentiable surrogate that approximates the many-to-one\nphysical realization process. We then learn the encoder, which maps from goal\nto design, while using the fixed decoder to evaluate the quality of the\nrealization. We evaluate the approach on two case studies: extruder path\nplanning in additive manufacturing and constrained soft robot inverse\nkinematics. We compare our approach to direct optimization of design using the\nlearned surrogate, and to supervised learning of the synthesis problem. We find\nthat our approach produces higher quality solutions than supervised learning,\nwhile being competitive in quality with direct optimization, at a greatly\nreduced computational cost.",

One of the critical problems in mining tabular data is how to\nunderstand their inherent semantic structures automatically. Existing studies\ntypically adopt Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to model the spatial\ninformation of tabular structures yet ignore more diverse relational\ninformation between cells, such as the hierarchical and paratactic\nrelationships. To simultaneously extract spatial and relational information\nfrom tables, we propose a novel neural network architecture, TabularNet. The\nspatial encoder of TabularNet utilizes the row/column-level Pooling and the\nBidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) to capture statistical information\nand local positional correlation, respectively. For relational information, we\ndesign a new graph construction method based on the WordNet tree and adopt a\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) based encoder that focuses on the\nhierarchical and paratactic relationships between cells. Our neural network\narchitecture can be a unified neural backbone for different understanding tasks\nand utilized in a multitask scenario.

          "description": "We consider the problem of minimizing regret in an $N$ agent heterogeneous\nstochastic linear bandits framework, where the agents (users) are similar but\nnot all identical. We model user heterogeneity using two popularly used ideas\nin practice; (i) A clustering framework where users are partitioned into groups\nwith users in the same group being identical to each other, but different\nacross groups, and (ii) a personalization framework where no two users are\nnecessarily identical, but a user's parameters are close to that of the\npopulation average. In the clustered users' setup, we propose a novel\nalgorithm, based on successive refinement of cluster identities and regret\nminimization. We show that, for any agent, the regret scales as\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T/N})$, if the agent is in a `well separated' cluster, or\nscales as $\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{1}{2} + \\varepsilon}/(N)^{\\frac{1}{2}\n-\\varepsilon})$ if its cluster is not well separated, where $\\varepsilon$ is\npositive and arbitrarily close to $0$. Our algorithm is adaptive to the cluster\nseparation, and is parameter free -- it does not need to know the number of\nclusters, separation and cluster size, yet the regret guarantee adapts to the\ninherent complexity. In the personalization framework, we introduce a natural\nalgorithm where, the personal bandit instances are initialized with the\nestimates of the global average model. We show that, an agent $i$ whose\nparameter deviates from the population average by $\\epsilon_i$, attains a\nregret scaling of $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon_i\\sqrt{T})$. This demonstrates that\nif the user representations are close (small $\\epsilon_i)$, the resulting\nregret is low, and vice-versa. The results are empirically validated and we\nobserve superior performance of our adaptive algorithms over non-adaptive\nbaselines.",

Estimating the gaze direction is the most obvious way to\ngauge a driver's state under ideal conditions when limited to using\nnon-intrusive imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the vehicular environment\nintroduces a variety of challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh\nillumination, nighttime conditions, and reflective eyeglasses. Relying on head\npose alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable and erroneous. In\nthis study, we offer solutions to address these problems encountered in the\nreal world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate that using an\ninfrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization suffices. To\nhandle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we adopt image-to-image\ntranslation using generative adversarial networks to pre-process images prior\nto gaze estimation. Our proposed Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN) is\ntrained to preserve the driver's gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from\nface images.

While improving the\ndifferent components of these systems has been the focus of numerous studies,\nestimating the impact of such improvements on the revenue has been overlooked\nin the literature despite its practical importance. Indeed, quantifying the\nbenefit of a change in a system serves as support for investment decisions.\nThis is a challenging problem as it corresponds to the difference between the\ngenerated value and the value that would have been generated keeping the system\nas before. The latter is not observable. Moreover, the expected impact can be\nsmall in relative value. In this paper, we cast the problem as counterfactual\nprediction of unobserved revenue.

The originality of this work\nlies in the innovative application of econometric methods proposed for\nmacroeconomic applications to a new problem setting. Broadly applicable, the\napproach benefits from only requiring revenue data observed for\norigin-destination pairs in the network of the airline at each day, before and\nafter a change in the system is applied.

          "description": "Most prior approaches to offline reinforcement learning (RL) have taken an\niterative actor-critic approach involving off-policy evaluation. In this paper\nwe show that simply doing one step of constrained/regularized policy\nimprovement using an on-policy Q estimate of the behavior policy performs\nsurprisingly well. This one-step algorithm beats the previously reported\nresults of iterative algorithms on a large portion of the D4RL benchmark. The\nsimple one-step baseline achieves this strong performance without many of the\ntricks used by previously proposed iterative algorithms and is more robust to\nhyperparameters. We argue that the relatively poor performance of iterative\napproaches is a result of the high variance inherent in doing off-policy\nevaluation and magnified by the repeated optimization of policies against those\nhigh-variance estimates. In addition, we hypothesize that the strong\nperformance of the one-step algorithm is due to a combination of favorable\nstructure in the environment and behavior policy.",

          "description": "Purpose: This study evaluates the effectiveness and impact of automated\norder-based protocol assignment for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams\nusing natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL).\n\nMethods: NLP tools were applied to retrospectively process orders from over\n116,000 MRI exams with 200 unique sub-specialized protocols (\"Local\" protocol\nclass). Separate DL models were trained on 70\\% of the processed data for\n\"Local\" protocols as well as 93 American College of Radiology (\"ACR\") protocols\nand 48 \"General\" protocols. The DL Models were assessed in an \"auto-protocoling\n(AP)\" inference mode which returns the top recommendation and in a \"clinical\ndecision support (CDS)\" inference mode which returns up to 10 protocols for\nradiologist review. The accuracy of each protocol recommendation was computed\nand analyzed based on the difference between the normalized output score of the\ncorresponding neural net for the top two recommendations.\n\nResults: The top predicted protocol in AP mode was correct for 82.8%, 73.8%,\nand 69.3% of the test cases for \"General\", \"ACR\", and \"Local\" protocol classes,\nrespectively. Higher levels of accuracy over 96% were obtained for all protocol\nclasses in CDS mode. However, at current validation performance levels, the\nproposed models offer modest, positive, financial impact on large-scale imaging\nnetworks.\n\nConclusions: DL-based protocol automation is feasible and can be tuned to\nroute substantial fractions of exams for auto-protocoling, with higher accuracy\nwith more general protocols. Economic analyses of the tested algorithms\nindicate that improved algorithm performance is required to yield a practical\nexam auto-protocoling tool for sub-specialized imaging exams.",

          "description": "Sub-optimal control policies in intersection traffic signal controllers (TSC)\ncontribute to congestion and lead to negative effects on human health and the\nenvironment. Reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic signal control is a\npromising approach to design better control policies and has attracted\nconsiderable research interest in recent years. However, most work done in this\narea used simplified simulation environments of traffic scenarios to train\nRL-based TSC. To deploy RL in real-world traffic systems, the gap between\nsimplified simulation environments and real-world applications has to be\nclosed. Therefore, we propose LemgoRL, a benchmark tool to train RL agents as\nTSC in a realistic simulation environment of Lemgo, a medium-sized town in\nGermany. In addition to the realistic simulation model, LemgoRL encompasses a\ntraffic signal logic unit that ensures compliance with all regulatory and\nsafety requirements. LemgoRL offers the same interface as the well-known OpenAI\ngym toolkit to enable easy deployment in existing research work. Our benchmark\ntool drives the development of RL algorithms towards real-world applications.\nWe provide LemgoRL as an open-source tool at https://github.com/rl-ina/lemgorl.",

SHAP values enable interpretation of various black box\nmodels, but little progress has been made in two-part models. In this paper, we\npropose mSHAP (or multiplicative SHAP), a method for computing SHAP values of\ntwo-part models using the SHAP values of the individual models. This method\nwill allow for the predictions of two-part models to be explained at an\nindividual observation level. After developing mSHAP, we perform an in-depth\nsimulation study. Although the kernelSHAP algorithm is also capable of\ncomputing approximate SHAP values for a two-part model, a comparison with our\nmethod demonstrates that mSHAP is exponentially faster.

This paper\nproposes PatchMix, a data augmentation method that creates new samples by\ncomposing patches from pairs of images in a grid-like pattern. These new\nsamples' ground truth labels are set as proportional to the number of patches\nfrom each image. We then add a set of additional losses at the patch-level to\nregularize and to encourage good representations at both the patch and image\nlevels. A ResNet-50 model trained on ImageNet using PatchMix exhibits superior\ntransfer learning capabilities across a wide array of benchmarks. Although\nPatchMix can rely on random pairings and random grid-like patterns for mixing,\nwe explore evolutionary search as a guiding strategy to discover optimal\ngrid-like patterns and image pairing jointly. For this purpose, we conceive a\nfitness function that bypasses the need to re-train a model to evaluate each\nchoice. In this way, PatchMix outperforms a base model on CIFAR-10 (+1.91),\nCIFAR-100 (+5.31), Tiny Imagenet (+3.52), and ImageNet (+1.16) by significant\nmargins, also outperforming previous state-of-the-art pairwise augmentation\nstrategies.",

          "description": "Humans and animals have a natural ability to quickly adapt to their\nsurroundings, but machine-learning models, when subjected to changes, often\nrequire a complete retraining from scratch. We present Knowledge-adaptation\npriors (K-priors) to reduce the cost of retraining by enabling quick and\naccurate adaptation for a wide-variety of tasks and models. This is made\npossible by a combination of weight and function-space priors to reconstruct\nthe gradients of the past, which recovers and generalizes many existing, but\nseemingly-unrelated, adaptation strategies. Training with simple first-order\ngradient methods can often recover the exact retrained model to an arbitrary\naccuracy by choosing a sufficiently large memory of the past data. Empirical\nresults confirm that the adaptation can be cheap and accurate, and a promising\nalternative to retraining.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of estimating a $d$-dimensional $s$-sparse discrete\ndistribution from its samples observed under a $b$-bit communication\nconstraint. The best-known previous result on $\\ell_2$ estimation error for\nthis problem is $O\\left( \\frac{s\\log\\left( {d}/{s}\\right)}{n2^b}\\right)$.\nSurprisingly, we show that when sample size $n$ exceeds a minimum threshold\n$n^*(s, d, b)$, we can achieve an $\\ell_2$ estimation error of $O\\left(\n\\frac{s}{n2^b}\\right)$. This implies that when $n>n^*(s, d, b)$ the convergence\nrate does not depend on the ambient dimension $d$ and is the same as knowing\nthe support of the distribution beforehand.\n\nWe next ask the question: ``what is the minimum $n^*(s, d, b)$ that allows\ndimension-free convergence?''. To upper bound $n^*(s, d, b)$, we develop novel\nlocalization schemes to accurately and efficiently localize the unknown\nsupport. For the non-interactive setting, we show that $n^*(s, d, b) = O\\left(\n\\min \\left( {d^2\\log^2 d}/{2^b}, {s^4\\log^2 d}/{2^b}\\right) \\right)$. Moreover,\nwe connect the problem with non-adaptive group testing and obtain a\npolynomial-time estimation scheme when $n = \\tilde{\\Omega}\\left({s^4\\log^4\nd}/{2^b}\\right)$. This group testing based scheme is adaptive to the sparsity\nparameter $s$, and hence can be applied without knowing it. For the interactive\nsetting, we propose a novel tree-based estimation scheme and show that the\nminimum sample-size needed to achieve dimension-free convergence can be further\nreduced to $n^*(s, d, b) = \\tilde{O}\\left( {s^2\\log^2 d}/{2^b} \\right)$.",

As a result, a small\nperturbation in the initial conditions results in deviation in state trajectory\nafter a few time steps. The algorithms and computational resources needed to\naccurately identify the system states vary depending on whether the solution is\nin transition region or not. We refer to the transition and non-transition\nregions as unstable and stable regions respectively. We label a system state to\nbe stable if it's immediate past and future states reside in the same regime.\nHowever, at a given time step we don't have the prior knowledge about whether\nsystem is in stable or unstable region. In this paper, we develop and train a\nfeed forward (multi-layer perceptron) Neural Network to classify the system\nstates of a Lorenz system as stable and unstable. We pose this task as a\nsupervised learning problem where we train the neural network on Lorenz system\nwhich have states labeled as stable or unstable. We then test the ability of\nthe neural network models to identify the stable and unstable states on a\ndifferent Lorenz system that is generated using different initial conditions.\nWe also evaluate the classification performance in the mismatched case i.e.,\nwhen the initial conditions for training and validation data are sampled from\ndifferent intervals. We show that certain normalization schemes can greatly\nimprove the performance of neural networks in especially these mismatched\nscenarios. The classification framework developed in the paper can be a\npreprocessor for a larger context of sequential decision making framework where\nthe decision making is performed based on observed stable or unstable states.",

In this context, the\nrelationship among experts can be captured by a feedback graph, which can be\nused to assist the learner's decision making. However, in practice, the nominal\nfeedback graph often entails uncertainties, which renders it impossible to\nreveal the actual relationship among experts.

The most efficient models use deep-learning\narchitectures similar to those in the NLP community, posing a challenge due to\ntheir tremendous number of parameters and limited robustness. In particular,\ndeep-learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: a little change in\nthe input harms the model's output.\n\nIn this work, we examine adversarial attacks on transaction records data and\ndefences from these attacks. The transaction records data have a different\nstructure than the canonical NLP or time series data, as neighbouring records\nare less connected than words in sentences, and each record consists of both\ndiscrete merchant code and continuous transaction amount. We consider a\nblack-box attack scenario, where the attack doesn't know the true decision\nmodel, and pay special attention to adding transaction tokens to the end of a\nsequence. These limitations provide more realistic scenario, previously\nunexplored in NLP world.\n\nThe proposed adversarial attacks and the respective defences demonstrate\nremarkable performance using relevant datasets from the financial industry. Our\nresults show that a couple of generated transactions are sufficient to fool a\ndeep-learning model.

However, the\nsequential order of dialogue is important to build a robust spoken\nconversational question answering system, and the changes of utterances order\nmay severely result in low-quality and incoherent corpora. To this end, we\nintroduce a self-supervised learning approach, including incoherence\ndiscrimination, insertion detection, and question prediction, to explicitly\ncapture the coreference resolution and dialogue coherence among spoken\ndocuments. Specifically, we design a joint learning framework where the\nauxiliary self-supervised tasks can enable the pre-trained SCQA systems towards\nmore coherent and meaningful spoken dialogue learning. We also utilize the\nproposed self-supervised learning tasks to capture intra-sentence coherence.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed method provides more\ncoherent, meaningful, and appropriate responses, yielding superior performance\ngains compared to the original pre-trained language models. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on the Spoken-CoQA dataset.",

          "description": "In the last few years, deep learning classifiers have shown promising results\nin image-based medical diagnosis. However, interpreting the outputs of these\nmodels remains a challenge. In cancer diagnosis, interpretability can be\nachieved by localizing the region of the input image responsible for the\noutput, i.e. the location of a lesion. Alternatively, segmentation or detection\nmodels can be trained with pixel-wise annotations indicating the locations of\nmalignant lesions. Unfortunately, acquiring such labels is labor-intensive and\nrequires medical expertise. To overcome this difficulty, weakly-supervised\nlocalization can be utilized. These methods allow neural network classifiers to\noutput saliency maps highlighting the regions of the input most relevant to the\nclassification task (e.g. malignant lesions in mammograms) using only\nimage-level labels (e.g. whether the patient has cancer or not) during\ntraining. When applied to high-resolution images, existing methods produce\nlow-resolution saliency maps. This is problematic in applications in which\nsuspicious lesions are small in relation to the image size. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel neural network architecture to perform weakly-supervised\nsegmentation of high-resolution images. The proposed model selects regions of\ninterest via coarse-level localization, and then performs fine-grained\nsegmentation of those regions. We apply this model to breast cancer diagnosis\nwith screening mammography, and validate it on a large clinically-realistic\ndataset. Measured by Dice similarity score, our approach outperforms existing\nmethods by a large margin in terms of localization performance of benign and\nmalignant lesions, relatively improving the performance by 39.6% and 20.0%,\nrespectively.

For the common case where\noutputs are structured as a sequence, linear-chain conditional random fields\n(CRFs) are a widely used model class which can learn local dependencies in\noutput sequences. However, the CRF's Markov assumption makes it impossible for\nthese models to capture nonlocal dependencies, and standard CRFs are unable to\nrespect nonlocal constraints of the data (such as global arity constraints on\noutput labels). We present a generalization of CRFs that can enforce a broad\nclass of constraints, including nonlocal ones, by specifying the space of\npossible output structures as a regular language $\\mathcal{L}$. The resulting\nregular-constrained CRF (RegCCRF) has the same formal properties as a standard\nCRF, but assigns zero probability to all label sequences not in $\\mathcal{L}$.\nNotably, RegCCRFs can incorporate their constraints during training, while\nrelated models only enforce constraints during decoding. We prove that\nconstrained training is never worse than constrained decoding, and show using\nsynthetic data that it can be substantially better in practice. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate a practical benefit on downstream tasks by incorporating a\nRegCCRF into a deep neural model for semantic role labeling, exceeding\nstate-of-the-art results on a standard dataset.",

          "description": "Predicting the motion of agents such as pedestrians or human-driven vehicles\nis one of the most critical problems in the autonomous driving domain. The\noverall safety of driving and the comfort of a passenger directly depend on its\nsuccessful solution. The motion prediction problem also remains one of the most\nchallenging problems in autonomous driving engineering, mainly due to high\nvariance of the possible agent's future behavior given a situation. The two\nphenomena responsible for the said variance are the multimodality caused by the\nuncertainty of the agent's intent (e.g., turn right or move forward) and\nuncertainty in the realization of a given intent (e.g., which lane to turn\ninto). To be useful within a real-time autonomous driving pipeline, a motion\nprediction system must provide efficient ways to describe and quantify this\nuncertainty, such as computing posterior modes and their probabilities or\nestimating density at the point corresponding to a given trajectory. It also\nshould not put substantial density on physically impossible trajectories, as\nthey can confuse the system processing the predictions. In this paper, we\nintroduce the PRANK method, which satisfies these requirements. PRANK takes\nrasterized bird-eye images of agent's surroundings as an input and extracts\nfeatures of the scene with a convolutional neural network. It then produces the\nconditional distribution of agent's trajectories plausible in the given scene.\nThe key contribution of PRANK is a way to represent that distribution using\nnearest-neighbor methods in latent trajectory space, which allows for efficient\ninference in real time. We evaluate PRANK on the in-house and Argoverse\ndatasets, where it shows competitive results.",

          "description": "Adversarial robustness of deep neural networks is an extensively studied\nproblem in the literature and various methods have been proposed to defend\nagainst adversarial images. However, only a handful of defense methods have\nbeen developed for defending against attacked videos.

This approach learns undercomplete representations, which have large\nreceptive fields to collect global information but overlooks local details. On\nthe other hand, overcomplete representations have opposite properties. Hence,\nOUDefend is designed to balance local and global features by learning those two\nrepresentations. We attach OUDefend to target video recognition models as a\nfeature restoration block and train the entire network end-to-end. Experimental\nresults show that the defenses focusing on images may be ineffective to videos,\nwhile OUDefend enhances robustness against different types of adversarial\nvideos, ranging from additive attacks, multiplicative attacks to physically\nrealizable attacks.

Recent studies\nabout adversarial robustness focus on the loss landscape in the parameter space\nsince it is related to optimization and generalization performance. These\nstudies conclude that the difficulty of adversarial training is caused by the\nnon-smoothness of the loss function: i.e., its gradient is not Lipschitz\ncontinuous. However, this analysis ignores the dependence of adversarial\nattacks on model parameters. Since adversarial attacks are optimized for\nmodels, they should depend on the parameters. Considering this dependence, we\nanalyze the smoothness of the loss function of adversarial training using the\noptimal attacks for the model parameter in more detail. We reveal that the\nconstraint of adversarial attacks is one cause of the non-smoothness and that\nthe smoothness depends on the types of the constraints. Specifically, the\n$L_\\infty$ constraint can cause non-smoothness more than the $L_2$ constraint.\nMoreover, our analysis implies that if we flatten the loss function with\nrespect to input data, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of adversarial\nloss tends to increase. To address the non-smoothness, we show that EntropySGD\nsmoothens the non-smooth loss and improves the performance of adversarial\ntraining.",

In\nthis work we propose an instance of the exponential mechanism that\nsimultaneously estimates exactly $m$ quantiles from $n$ data points while\nguaranteeing differential privacy. The utility function is carefully structured\nto allow for an efficient implementation that returns estimates of all $m$\nquantiles in time $O(mn\\log(n) + m^2n)$. Experiments show that our method\nsignificantly outperforms the current state of the art on both real and\nsynthetic data while remaining efficient enough to be practical.",

          "description": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction models are common in many online\napplications such as digital advertising and recommender systems. Field-Aware\nFactorization Machine (FFM) and Field-weighted Factorization Machine (FwFM) are\nstate-of-the-art among the shallow models for CTR prediction. Recently, many\ndeep learning-based models have also been proposed. Among deeper models,\nDeepFM, xDeepFM, AutoInt+, and FiBiNet are state-of-the-art models. The deeper\nmodels combine a core architectural component, which learns explicit feature\ninteractions, with a deep neural network (DNN) component. We propose a novel\nshallow Field-Embedded Factorization Machine (FEFM) and its deep counterpart\nDeep Field-Embedded Factorization Machine (DeepFEFM). FEFM learns symmetric\nmatrix embeddings for each field pair along with the usual single vector\nembeddings for each feature. FEFM has significantly lower model complexity than\nFFM and roughly the same complexity as FwFM. FEFM also has insightful\nmathematical properties about important fields and field interactions. DeepFEFM\ncombines the FEFM interaction vectors learned by the FEFM component with a DNN\nand is thus able to learn higher order interactions. We conducted comprehensive\nexperiments over a wide range of hyperparameters on two large publicly\navailable real-world datasets. When comparing test AUC and log loss, the\nresults show that FEFM and DeepFEFM outperform the existing state-of-the-art\nshallow and deep models for CTR prediction tasks.

          "description": "Low-rank matrix estimation is a canonical problem that finds numerous\napplications in signal processing, machine learning and imaging science. A\npopular approach in practice is to factorize the matrix into two compact\nlow-rank factors, and then optimize these factors directly via simple iterative\nmethods such as gradient descent and alternating minimization. Despite\nnonconvexity, recent literatures have shown that these simple heuristics in\nfact achieve linear convergence when initialized properly for a growing number\nof problems of interest. However, upon closer examination, existing approaches\ncan still be computationally expensive especially for ill-conditioned matrices:\nthe convergence rate of gradient descent depends linearly on the condition\nnumber of the low-rank matrix, while the per-iteration cost of alternating\nminimization is often prohibitive for large matrices. The goal of this paper is\nto set forth a competitive algorithmic approach dubbed Scaled Gradient Descent\n(ScaledGD) which can be viewed as pre-conditioned or diagonally-scaled gradient\ndescent, where the pre-conditioners are adaptive and iteration-varying with a\nminimal computational overhead. With tailored variants for low-rank matrix\nsensing, robust principal component analysis and matrix completion, we\ntheoretically show that ScaledGD achieves the best of both worlds: it converges\nlinearly at a rate independent of the condition number of the low-rank matrix\nsimilar as alternating minimization, while maintaining the low per-iteration\ncost of gradient descent. Our analysis is also applicable to general loss\nfunctions that are restricted strongly convex and smooth over low-rank\nmatrices. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first algorithm that\nprovably has such properties over a wide range of low-rank matrix estimation\ntasks.",

          "description": "Many meta-learning methods are proposed for few-shot detection. However,\nprevious most methods have two main problems, poor detection APs, and strong\nbias because of imbalance and insufficient datasets. Previous works mainly\nalleviate these issues by additional datasets, multi-relation attention\nmechanisms and sub-modules. However, they require more cost. In this work, for\nmeta-learning, we find that the main challenges focus on related or irrelevant\nsemantic features between categories. Therefore, based on semantic features, we\npropose a Top-C classification loss (i.e., TCL-C) for classification task and a\ncategory-based grouping mechanism for category-based meta-features obtained by\nthe meta-model. The TCL-C exploits the true-label prediction and the most\nlikely C-1 false classification predictions to improve detection performance on\nfew-shot classes. According to similar appearance (i.e., visual appearance,\nshape, and limbs etc.) and environment in which objects often appear, the\ncategory-based grouping mechanism splits categories into disjoint groups to\nmake similar semantic features more compact between categories within a group\nand obtain more significant difference between groups, alleviating the strong\nbias problem and further improving detection APs. The whole training consists\nof the base model and the fine-tuning phases. According to grouping mechanism,\nwe group the meta-features vectors obtained by meta-model, so that the\ndistribution difference between groups is obvious, and the one within each\ngroup is less. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC dataset demonstrate that\nours which combines the TCL-C with category-based grouping significantly\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for few-shot detection. Compared\nwith previous competitive baseline, ours improves detection APs by almost 4%\nfor few-shot detection.",

As an endeavor in this direction,\nsubstantial recent research efforts have been focused on teaching machines \"how\nto paint\", in a manner similar to a human painter. However, the applicability\nof previous methods has been limited to datasets with little variation in\nposition, scale and saliency of the foreground object. As a consequence, we\nfind that these methods struggle to cover the granularity and diversity\npossessed by real world images. To this end, we propose a Semantic Guidance\npipeline with 1) a bi-level painting procedure for learning the distinction\nbetween foreground and background brush strokes at training time. 2) We also\nintroduce invariance to the position and scale of the foreground object through\na neural alignment model, which combines object localization and spatial\ntransformer networks in an end to end manner, to zoom into a particular\nsemantic instance. 3) The distinguishing features of the in-focus object are\nthen amplified by maximizing a novel guided backpropagation based focus reward.\nThe proposed agent does not require any supervision on human stroke-data and\nsuccessfully handles variations in foreground object attributes, thus,\nproducing much higher quality canvases for the CUB-200 Birds and Stanford\nCars-196 datasets.

          "description": "Recently, Musco and Woodruff (FOCS, 2017) showed that given an $n \\times n$\npositive semidefinite (PSD) matrix $A$, it is possible to compute a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate relative-error low-rank approximation to $A$ by\nquerying $O(nk/\\epsilon^{2.5})$ entries of $A$ in time $O(nk/\\epsilon^{2.5} +n\nk^{\\omega-1}/\\epsilon^{2(\\omega-1)})$. They also showed that any relative-error\nlow-rank approximation algorithm must query $\\Omega(nk/\\epsilon)$ entries of\n$A$, this gap has since remained open. Our main result is to resolve this\nquestion by obtaining an optimal algorithm that queries $O(nk/\\epsilon)$\nentries of $A$ and outputs a relative-error low-rank approximation in\n$O(n(k/\\epsilon)^{\\omega-1})$ time. Note, our running time improves that of\nMusco and Woodruff, and matches the information-theoretic lower bound if the\nmatrix-multiplication exponent $\\omega$ is $2$.\n\nWe then extend our techniques to negative-type distance matrices. Bakshi and\nWoodruff (NeurIPS, 2018) showed a bi-criteria, relative-error low-rank\napproximation which queries $O(nk/\\epsilon^{2.5})$ entries and outputs a\nrank-$(k+4)$ matrix. We show that the bi-criteria guarantee is not necessary\nand obtain an $O(nk/\\epsilon)$ query algorithm, which is optimal. Our algorithm\napplies to all distance matrices that arise from metrics satisfying\nnegative-type inequalities, including $\\ell_1, \\ell_2,$ spherical metrics and\nhypermetrics.\n\nNext, we introduce a new robust low-rank approximation model which captures\nPSD matrices that have been corrupted with noise. While a sample complexity\nlower bound precludes sublinear algorithms for arbitrary PSD matrices, we\nprovide the first sublinear time and query algorithms when the corruption on\nthe diagonal entries is bounded. As a special case, we show sample-optimal\nsublinear time algorithms for low-rank approximation of correlation matrices\ncorrupted by noise.",

          "description": "On-device machine learning (ML) is quickly gaining popularity among mobile\napps. It allows offline model inference while preserving user privacy. However,\nML models, considered as core intellectual properties of model owners, are now\nstored on billions of untrusted devices and subject to potential thefts. Leaked\nmodels can cause both severe financial loss and security consequences. This\npaper presents the first empirical study of ML model protection on mobile\ndevices. Our study aims to answer three open questions with quantitative\nevidence: How widely is model protection used in apps? How robust are existing\nmodel protection techniques? What impacts can (stolen) models incur? To that\nend, we built a simple app analysis pipeline and analyzed 46,753 popular apps\ncollected from the US and Chinese app markets. We identified 1,468 ML apps\nspanning all popular app categories. We found that, alarmingly, 41% of ML apps\ndo not protect their models at all, which can be trivially stolen from app\npackages. Even for those apps that use model protection or encryption, we were\nable to extract the models from 66% of them via unsophisticated dynamic\nanalysis techniques. The extracted models are mostly commercial products and\nused for face recognition, liveness detection, ID/bank card recognition, and\nmalware detection. We quantitatively estimated the potential financial and\nsecurity impact of a leaked model, which can amount to millions of dollars for\ndifferent stakeholders. Our study reveals that on-device models are currently\nat high risk of being leaked; attackers are highly motivated to steal such\nmodels. Drawn from our large-scale study, we report our insights into this\nemerging security problem and discuss the technical challenges, hoping to\ninspire future research on robust and practical model protection for mobile\ndevices.",

          "description": "The spatio-temporal graph learning is becoming an increasingly important\nobject of graph study. Many application domains involve highly dynamic graphs\nwhere temporal information is crucial, e.g. traffic networks and financial\ntransaction graphs. Despite the constant progress made on learning structured\ndata, there is still a lack of effective means to extract dynamic complex\nfeatures from spatio-temporal structures. Particularly, conventional models\nsuch as convolutional networks or recurrent neural networks are incapable of\nrevealing the temporal patterns in short or long terms and exploring the\nspatial properties in local or global scope from spatio-temporal graphs\nsimultaneously. To tackle this problem, we design a novel multi-scale\narchitecture, Spatio-Temporal U-Net (ST-UNet), for graph-structured time series\nmodeling. In this U-shaped network, a paired sampling operation is proposed in\nspacetime domain accordingly: the pooling (ST-Pool) coarsens the input graph in\nspatial from its deterministic partition while abstracts multi-resolution\ntemporal dependencies through dilated recurrent skip connections; based on\nprevious settings in the downsampling, the unpooling (ST-Unpool) restores the\noriginal structure of spatio-temporal graphs and resumes regular intervals\nwithin graph sequences. Experiments on spatio-temporal prediction tasks\ndemonstrate that our model effectively captures comprehensive features in\nmultiple scales and achieves substantial improvements over mainstream methods\non several real-world datasets.",

An important and timely special case is when the regressors are\noverparameterized and perfectly interpolate their training data. We examine a\nparameter transfer mechanism whereby a subset of the parameters of the target\ntask solution are constrained to the values learned for a related source task.\nWe analytically characterize the generalization error of the target task in\nterms of the salient factors in the transfer learning architecture, i.e., the\nnumber of examples available, the number of (free) parameters in each of the\ntasks, the number of parameters transferred from the source to target task, and\nthe correlation between the two tasks. Our non-asymptotic analysis shows that\nthe generalization error of the target task follows a two-dimensional double\ndescent trend (with respect to the number of free parameters in each of the\ntasks) that is controlled by the transfer learning factors. Our analysis points\nto specific cases where the transfer of parameters is beneficial. Specifically,\nwe show that transferring a specific set of parameters that generalizes well on\nthe respective part of the source task can soften the demand on the task\ncorrelation level that is required for successful transfer learning. Moreover,\nwe show that the usefulness of a transfer learning setting is fragile and\ndepends on a delicate interplay among the set of transferred parameters, the\nrelation between the tasks, and the true solution.",

Despite recent interest in machine agents that reason\nabout other agents, it is not clear if such agents learn or hold the core\npsychology principles that drive human reasoning. Inspired by cognitive\ndevelopment studies on intuitive psychology, we present a benchmark consisting\nof a large dataset of procedurally generated 3D animations, AGENT (Action,\nGoal, Efficiency, coNstraint, uTility), structured around four scenarios (goal\npreferences, action efficiency, unobserved constraints, and cost-reward\ntrade-offs) that probe key concepts of core intuitive psychology. We validate\nAGENT with human-ratings, propose an evaluation protocol emphasizing\ngeneralization, and compare two strong baselines built on Bayesian inverse\nplanning and a Theory of Mind neural network.

Specifically, SEM inserts an encoder before the input\nlayer of the target model to map each cluster of synonyms to a unique encoding\nand trains the model to eliminate possible adversarial perturbations without\nmodifying the network architecture or adding extra data. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SEM can effectively defend the current synonym substitution\nbased attacks and block the transferability of adversarial examples. SEM is\nalso easy and efficient to scale to large models and big datasets.",

          "description": "How can neural networks be trained on large-volume temporal data efficiently?\nTo compute the gradients required to update parameters, backpropagation blocks\ncomputations until the forward and backward passes are completed. For temporal\nsignals, this introduces high latency and hinders real-time learning. It also\ncreates a coupling between consecutive layers, which limits model parallelism\nand increases memory consumption. In this paper, we build upon Sideways, which\navoids blocking by propagating approximate gradients forward in time, and we\npropose mechanisms for temporal integration of information based on different\nvariants of skip connections. We also show how to decouple computation and\ndelegate individual neural modules to different devices, allowing distributed\nand parallel training. The proposed Skip-Sideways achieves low latency\ntraining, model parallelism, and, importantly, is capable of extracting\ntemporal features, leading to more stable training and improved performance on\nreal-world action recognition video datasets such as HMDB51, UCF101, and the\nlarge-scale Kinetics-600.

Because data distributions can\nchange dynamically in real-life applications once a learned model is deployed,\nin this paper we are interested in single-source domain generalization (SDG)\nwhich aims to develop deep learning algorithms able to generalize from a single\ntraining domain where no information about the test domain is available at\ntraining time. Firstly, we design two simple MNISTbased SDG benchmarks, namely\nMNIST Color SDG-MP and MNIST Color SDG-UP, which highlight the two different\nfundamental SDG issues of increasing difficulties: 1) a class-correlated\npattern in the training domain is missing (SDG-MP), or 2) uncorrelated with the\nclass (SDG-UP), in the testing data domain. This is in sharp contrast with the\ncurrent domain generalization (DG) benchmarks which mix up different\ncorrelation and variation factors and thereby make hard to disentangle success\nor failure factors when benchmarking DG algorithms. We further evaluate several\nstate-of-the-art SDG algorithms through our simple benchmark, namely MNIST\nColor SDG-MP, and show that the issue SDG-MP is largely unsolved despite of a\ndecade of efforts in developing DG algorithms. Finally, we also propose a\npartially reversed contrastive loss to encourage intra-class diversity and find\nless strongly correlated patterns, to deal with SDG-MP and show that the\nproposed approach is very effective on our MNIST Color SDG-MP benchmark.",

To overcome\nthese challenges, we explore continual edge learning capable of leveraging the\nknowledge transfer from previous tasks. Aiming to achieve fast and continual\nedge learning, we propose a platform-aided federated meta-learning architecture\nwhere edge nodes collaboratively learn a meta-model, aided by the knowledge\ntransfer from prior tasks. The edge learning problem is cast as a regularized\noptimization problem, where the valuable knowledge learned from previous tasks\nis extracted as regularization. Then, we devise an ADMM based federated\nmeta-learning algorithm, namely ADMM-FedMeta, where ADMM offers a natural\nmechanism to decompose the original problem into many subproblems which can be\nsolved in parallel across edge nodes and the platform. Further, a variant of\ninexact-ADMM method is employed where the subproblems are `solved' via linear\napproximation as well as Hessian estimation to reduce the computational cost\nper round to $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. We provide a comprehensive analysis of\nADMM-FedMeta, in terms of the convergence properties, the rapid adaptation\nperformance, and the forgetting effect of prior knowledge transfer, for the\ngeneral non-convex case.

          "description": "Speaker identification in the household scenario (e.g., for smart speakers)\nis typically based on only a few enrollment utterances but a much larger set of\nunlabeled data, suggesting semisupervised learning to improve speaker profiles.\nWe propose a graph-based semi-supervised learning approach for speaker\nidentification in the household scenario, to leverage the unlabeled speech\nsamples. In contrast to most of the works in speaker recognition that focus on\nspeaker-discriminative embeddings, this work focuses on speaker label inference\n(scoring). Given a pre-trained embedding extractor, graph-based learning allows\nus to integrate information about both labeled and unlabeled utterances.\nConsidering each utterance as a graph node, we represent pairwise utterance\nsimilarity scores as edge weights. Graphs are constructed per household, and\nspeaker identities are propagated to unlabeled nodes to optimize a global\nconsistency criterion. We show in experiments on the VoxCeleb dataset that this\napproach makes effective use of unlabeled data and improves speaker\nidentification accuracy compared to two state-of-the-art scoring methods as\nwell as their semi-supervised variants based on pseudo-labels.",

NMNs are a promising strategy to\nachieve systematic generalization, i.e. overcoming biasing factors in the\ntraining distribution. However, the aspects of NMNs that facilitate systematic\ngeneralization are not fully understood. In this paper, we demonstrate that the\nstage and the degree at which modularity is defined has large influence on\nsystematic generalization. In a series of experiments on three VQA datasets\n(MNIST with multiple attributes, SQOOP, and CLEVR-CoGenT), our results reveal\nthat tuning the degree of modularity in the network, especially at the image\nencoder stage, reaches substantially higher systematic generalization.

          "description": "Many advances that have improved the robustness and efficiency of deep\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can, in one way or another, be\nunderstood as introducing additional objectives, or constraints, in the policy\noptimization step. This includes ideas as far ranging as exploration bonuses,\nentropy regularization, and regularization toward teachers or data priors when\nlearning from experts or in offline RL. Often, task reward and auxiliary\nobjectives are in conflict with each other and it is therefore natural to treat\nthese examples as instances of multi-objective (MO) optimization problems. We\nstudy the principles underlying MORL and introduce a new algorithm,\nDistillation of a Mixture of Experts (DiME), that is intuitive and\nscale-invariant under some conditions. We highlight its strengths on standard\nMO benchmark problems and consider case studies in which we recast offline RL\nand learning from experts as MO problems. This leads to a natural algorithmic\nformulation that sheds light on the connection between existing approaches. For\noffline RL, we use the MO perspective to derive a simple algorithm, that\noptimizes for the standard RL objective plus a behavioral cloning term.

          "description": "In recent years the ubiquitous deployment of AI has posed great concerns in\nregards to algorithmic bias, discrimination, and fairness. Compared to\ntraditional forms of bias or discrimination caused by humans, algorithmic bias\ngenerated by AI is more abstract and unintuitive therefore more difficult to\nexplain and mitigate. A clear gap exists in the current literature on\nevaluating and mitigating bias in pruned neural networks. In this work, we\nstrive to tackle the challenging issues of evaluating, mitigating, and\nexplaining induced bias in pruned neural networks. Our paper makes three\ncontributions. First, we propose two simple yet effective metrics, Combined\nError Variance (CEV) and Symmetric Distance Error (SDE), to quantitatively\nevaluate the induced bias prevention quality of pruned models. Second, we\ndemonstrate that knowledge distillation can mitigate induced bias in pruned\nneural networks, even with unbalanced datasets. Third, we reveal that model\nsimilarity has strong correlations with pruning induced bias, which provides a\npowerful method to explain why bias occurs in pruned neural networks.

          "description": "Federated Learning (FL) as a distributed learning paradigm that aggregates\ninformation from diverse clients to train a shared global model, has\ndemonstrated great success. However, malicious clients can perform poisoning\nattacks and model replacement to introduce backdoors into the trained global\nmodel. Although there have been intensive studies designing robust aggregation\nmethods and empirical robust federated training protocols against backdoors,\nexisting approaches lack robustness certification. This paper provides the\nfirst general framework, Certifiably Robust Federated Learning (CRFL), to train\ncertifiably robust FL models against backdoors. Our method exploits clipping\nand smoothing on model parameters to control the global model smoothness, which\nyields a sample-wise robustness certification on backdoors with limited\nmagnitude. Our certification also specifies the relation to federated learning\nparameters, such as poisoning ratio on instance level, number of attackers, and\ntraining iterations. Practically, we conduct comprehensive experiments across a\nrange of federated datasets, and provide the first benchmark for certified\nrobustness against backdoor attacks in federated learning.

Existing machine learning approaches\ntypically produce a reaction product by sequentially forming its subparts or\nintermediate molecules. Such autoregressive methods, however, not only require\na pre-defined order for the incremental construction but preclude the use of\nparallel decoding for efficient computation. To address these issues, we devise\na non-autoregressive learning paradigm that predicts reaction in one shot.\nLeveraging the fact that chemical reactions can be described as a\nredistribution of electrons in molecules, we formulate a reaction as an\narbitrary electron flow and predict it with a novel multi-pointer decoding\nnetwork. Experiments on the USPTO-MIT dataset show that our approach has\nestablished a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy and achieves at least 27\ntimes inference speedup over the state-of-the-art methods.

          "description": "Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is the predominant algorithm for training\ntext generation models. This paradigm relies on direct supervision examples,\nwhich is not applicable to many applications, such as generating adversarial\nattacks or generating prompts to control language models. Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) on the other hand offers a more flexible solution by allowing\nusers to plug in arbitrary task metrics as reward. Yet previous RL algorithms\nfor text generation, such as policy gradient (on-policy RL) and Q-learning\n(off-policy RL), are often notoriously inefficient or unstable to train due to\nthe large sequence space and the sparse reward received only at the end of\nsequences. In this paper, we introduce a new RL formulation for text generation\nfrom the soft Q-learning perspective. It further enables us to draw from the\nlatest RL advances, such as path consistency learning, to combine the best of\non-/off-policy updates, and learn effectively from sparse reward. We apply the\napproach to a wide range of tasks, including learning from noisy/negative\nexamples, adversarial attacks, and prompt generation. Experiments show our\napproach consistently outperforms both task-specialized algorithms and the\nprevious RL methods. On standard supervised tasks where MLE prevails, our\napproach also achieves competitive performance and stability by training text\ngeneration from scratch.",

          "description": "In deep learning with differential privacy (DP), the neural network achieves\nthe privacy usually at the cost of slower convergence (and thus lower\nperformance) than its non-private counterpart. This work gives the first\nconvergence analysis of the DP deep learning, through the lens of training\ndynamics and the neural tangent kernel (NTK). Our convergence theory\nsuccessfully characterizes the effects of two key components in the DP\ntraining: the per-sample clipping (flat or layerwise) and the noise addition.\nOur analysis not only initiates a general principled framework to understand\nthe DP deep learning with any network architecture and loss function, but also\nmotivates a new clipping method -- the global clipping, that significantly\nimproves the convergence while preserving the same privacy guarantee as the\nexisting local clipping.\n\nIn terms of theoretical results, we establish the precise connection between\nthe per-sample clipping and NTK matrix. We show that in the gradient flow,\ni.e., with infinitesimal learning rate, the noise level of DP optimizers does\nnot affect the convergence. We prove that DP gradient descent (GD) with global\nclipping guarantees the monotone convergence to zero loss, which can be\nviolated by the existing DP-GD with local clipping. Notably, our analysis\nframework easily extends to other optimizers, e.g., DP-Adam. Empirically\nspeaking, DP optimizers equipped with global clipping perform strongly on a\nwide range of classification and regression tasks. In particular, our global\nclipping is surprisingly effective at learning calibrated classifiers, in\ncontrast to the existing DP classifiers which are oftentimes over-confident and\nunreliable. Implementation-wise, the new clipping can be realized by adding one\nline of code into the Opacus library.",

          "description": "Recent studies have exposed that many graph neural networks (GNNs) are\nsensitive to adversarial attacks, and can suffer from performance loss if the\ngraph structure is intentionally perturbed. A different line of research has\nshown that many GNN architectures implicitly assume that the underlying graph\ndisplays homophily, i.e., connected nodes are more likely to have similar\nfeatures and class labels, and perform poorly if this assumption is not\nfulfilled. In this work, we formalize the relation between these two seemingly\ndifferent issues. We theoretically show that in the standard scenario in which\nnode features exhibit homophily, impactful structural attacks always lead to\nincreased levels of heterophily. Then, inspired by GNN architectures that\ntarget heterophily, we present two designs -- (i) separate aggregators for ego-\nand neighbor-embeddings, and (ii) a reduced scope of aggregation -- that can\nsignificantly improve the robustness of GNNs. Our extensive empirical\nevaluations show that GNNs featuring merely these two designs can achieve\nsignificantly improved robustness compared to the best-performing unvaccinated\nmodel with 24.99% gain in average performance under targeted attacks, while\nhaving smaller computational overhead than existing defense mechanisms.\nFurthermore, these designs can be readily combined with explicit defense\nmechanisms to yield state-of-the-art robustness with up to 18.33% increase in\nperformance under attacks compared to the best-performing vaccinated model.",

In this problem, instead of i.i.d. datapoints, we assume that the\nsource (training) data and the target (testing) data have different\ndistributions. With that setting, the empirical risk minimization training\nprocedure often does not perform well, since it does not account for the change\nin the distribution. A common approach in the domain adaptation literature is\nto learn a representation of the input that has the same distributions over the\nsource and the target domain. However, these approaches often require\nadditional networks and/or optimizing an adversarial (minimax) objective, which\ncan be very expensive or unstable in practice. To tackle this problem, we first\nderive a generalization bound for the target loss based on the training loss\nand the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the source and the\ntarget representation distributions. Based on this bound, we derive an\nalgorithm that minimizes the KL term to obtain a better generalization to the\ntarget domain. We show that with a probabilistic representation network, the KL\nterm can be estimated efficiently via minibatch samples without any additional\nnetwork or a minimax objective. This leads to a theoretically sound alignment\nmethod which is also very efficient and stable in practice.

Last, how can we design federated learning methods that effectively\nutilize larger cohort sizes? We give partial answers to these questions based\non extensive empirical evaluation. Our work highlights a number of challenges\nstemming from the use of larger cohorts. While some of these (such as\ngeneralization issues and diminishing returns) are analogs of large-batch\ntraining challenges, others (including training failures and fairness concerns)\nare unique to federated learning.",

          "description": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important task in machine learning\nsystems for ensuring their reliability and safety. Deep probabilistic\ngenerative models facilitate OOD detection by estimating the likelihood of a\ndata sample. However, such models frequently assign a suspiciously high\nlikelihood to a specific outlier. Several recent works have addressed this\nissue by training a neural network with auxiliary outliers, which are generated\nby perturbing the input data. In this paper, we discover that these approaches\nfail for certain OOD datasets. Thus, we suggest a new detection metric that\noperates without outlier exposure. We observe that our metric is robust to\ndiverse variations of an image compared to the previous outlier-exposing\nmethods. Furthermore, our proposed score requires neither auxiliary models nor\nadditional training. Instead, this paper utilizes the likelihood ratio\nstatistic in a new perspective to extract genuine properties from the given\nsingle deep probabilistic generative model. We also apply a novel numerical\napproximation to enable fast implementation. Finally, we demonstrate\ncomprehensive experiments on various probabilistic generative models and show\nthat our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Although capable of reducing a reasonable amount\nof model parameters, previous unstructured or structured weight pruning methods\ncan hardly truly accelerate inference, either due to the poor hardware\ncompatibility of the unstructured sparsity or due to the low sparse rate of the\nstructurally pruned network. Aiming at reducing both storage and computation,\nas well as preserving the original task performance, we propose a generalized\nweight unification framework at a hardware compatible micro-structured level to\nachieve high amount of compression and acceleration. Weight coefficients of a\nselected micro-structured block are unified to reduce the storage and\ncomputation of the block without changing the neuron connections, which turns\nto a micro-structured pruning special case when all unified coefficients are\nset to zero, where neuron connections (hence storage and computation) are\ncompletely removed. In addition, we developed an effective training framework\nbased on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which converts\nour complex constrained optimization into separately solvable subproblems.\nThrough iteratively optimizing the subproblems, the desired micro-structure can\nbe ensured with high compression ratio and low performance degradation.

          "description": "Music emotion recognition is an important task in MIR (Music Information\nRetrieval) research. Owing to factors like the subjective nature of the task\nand the variation of emotional cues between musical genres, there are still\nsignificant challenges in developing reliable and generalizable models. One\nimportant step towards better models would be to understand what a model is\nactually learning from the data and how the prediction for a particular input\nis made. In previous work, we have shown how to derive explanations of model\npredictions in terms of spectrogram image segments that connect to the\nhigh-level emotion prediction via a layer of easily interpretable perceptual\nfeatures. However, that scheme lacks intuitive musical comprehensibility at the\nspectrogram level. In the present work, we bridge this gap by merging audioLIME\n-- a source-separation based explainer -- with mid-level perceptual features,\nthus forming an intuitive connection chain between the input audio and the\noutput emotion predictions. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method by\napplying it to debug a biased emotion prediction model.",

          "description": "Tensor decompositions are powerful tools for dimensionality reduction and\nfeature interpretation of multidimensional data such as signals. Existing\ntensor decomposition objectives (e.g., Frobenius norm) are designed for fitting\nraw data under statistical assumptions, which may not align with downstream\nclassification tasks. Also, real-world tensor data are usually high-ordered and\nhave large dimensions with millions or billions of entries. Thus, it is\nexpensive to decompose the whole tensor with traditional algorithms. In\npractice, raw tensor data also contains redundant information while data\naugmentation techniques may be used to smooth out noise in samples. This paper\naddresses the above challenges by proposing augmented tensor decomposition\n(ATD), which effectively incorporates data augmentations to boost downstream\nclassification. To reduce the memory footprint of the decomposition, we propose\na stochastic algorithm that updates the factor matrices in a batch fashion. We\nevaluate ATD on multiple signal datasets. It shows comparable or better\nperformance (e.g., up to 15% in accuracy) over self-supervised and autoencoder\nbaselines with less than 5% of model parameters, achieves 0.6% ~ 1.3% accuracy\ngain over other tensor-based baselines, and reduces the memory footprint by 9X\nwhen compared to standard tensor decomposition algorithms.",

To tackle this problem, we propose a framework\nwith two components: a Fingerprint Estimation Network (FEN), which estimates a\nGM fingerprint from a generated image by training with four constraints to\nencourage the fingerprint to have desired properties, and a Parsing Network\n(PN), which predicts network architecture and loss functions from the estimated\nfingerprints. To evaluate our approach, we collect a fake image dataset with\n$100$K images generated by $100$ GMs. Extensive experiments show encouraging\nresults in parsing the hyperparameters of the unseen models.

We show that\nthe transducer's encoder outputs naturally have a high entropy and contain rich\ninformation about acoustically similar word-piece confusions. This rich\ninformation is suppressed when combined with the lower entropy decoder outputs\nto produce the joint network logits. Consequently, we introduce an auxiliary\nloss to distill the encoder logits from a teacher transducer's encoder, and\nexplore training strategies where this encoder distillation works effectively.\nWe find that tandem training of teacher and student encoders with an inplace\nencoder distillation outperforms the use of a pre-trained and static teacher\ntransducer. We also report an interesting phenomenon we refer to as implicit\ndistillation, that occurs when the teacher and student encoders share the same\ndecoder.

          "description": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of adult death in the\nUnited States and worldwide, and for which the coronary angiography procedure\nis the primary gateway for diagnosis and clinical management decisions. The\nstandard-of-care for interpretation of coronary angiograms depends upon ad-hoc\nvisual assessment by the physician operator. However, ad-hoc visual\ninterpretation of angiograms is poorly reproducible, highly variable and bias\nprone. Here we show for the first time that fully-automated angiogram\ninterpretation to estimate coronary artery stenosis is possible using a\nsequence of deep neural network algorithms. The algorithmic pipeline we\ndeveloped--called CathAI--achieves state-of-the art performance across the\nsequence of tasks required to accomplish automated interpretation of\nunselected, real-world angiograms. CathAI (Algorithms 1-2) demonstrated\npositive predictive value, sensitivity and F1 score of >=90% to identify the\nprojection angle overall and >=93% for left or right coronary artery angiogram\ndetection, the primary anatomic structures of interest. To predict obstructive\ncoronary artery stenosis (>=70% stenosis), CathAI (Algorithm 4) exhibited an\narea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.862 (95% CI:\n0.843-0.880). When externally validated in a healthcare system in another\ncountry, CathAI AUC was 0.869 (95% CI: 0.830-0.907) to predict obstructive\ncoronary artery stenosis. Our results demonstrate that multiple purpose-built\nneural networks can function in sequence to accomplish the complex series of\ntasks required for automated analysis of real-world angiograms. Deployment of\nCathAI may serve to increase standardization and reproducibility in coronary\nstenosis assessment, while providing a robust foundation to accomplish future\ntasks for algorithmic angiographic interpretation.",

          "description": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have had great success in recent\nyears in limited labeled data regimes. However, the current state-of-the-art\nSSL algorithms are computationally expensive and entail significant compute\ntime and energy requirements. This can prove to be a huge limitation for many\nsmaller companies and academic groups. Our main insight is that training on a\nsubset of unlabeled data instead of entire unlabeled data enables the current\nSSL algorithms to converge faster, thereby reducing the computational costs\nsignificantly. In this work, we propose RETRIEVE, a coreset selection framework\nfor efficient and robust semi-supervised learning. RETRIEVE selects the coreset\nby solving a mixed discrete-continuous bi-level optimization problem such that\nthe selected coreset minimizes the labeled set loss. We use a one-step gradient\napproximation and show that the discrete optimization problem is approximately\nsubmodular, thereby enabling simple greedy algorithms to obtain the coreset. We\nempirically demonstrate on several real-world datasets that existing SSL\nalgorithms like VAT, Mean-Teacher, FixMatch, when used with RETRIEVE, achieve\na) faster training times, b) better performance when unlabeled data consists of\nOut-of-Distribution(OOD) data and imbalance. More specifically, we show that\nwith minimal accuracy degradation, RETRIEVE achieves a speedup of around 3X in\nthe traditional SSL setting and achieves a speedup of 5X compared to\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) robust SSL algorithms in the case of imbalance and OOD\ndata.",

          "description": "While MCMC methods have become a main work-horse for Bayesian inference,\nscaling them to large distributed datasets is still a challenge. Embarrassingly\nparallel MCMC strategies take a divide-and-conquer stance to achieve this by\nwriting the target posterior as a product of subposteriors, running MCMC for\neach of them in parallel and subsequently combining the results. The challenge\nthen lies in devising efficient aggregation strategies. Current strategies\ntrade-off between approximation quality, and costs of communication and\ncomputation. In this work, we introduce a novel method that addresses these\nissues simultaneously. Our key insight is to introduce a deep invertible\ntransformation to approximate each of the subposteriors. These approximations\ncan be made accurate even for complex distributions and serve as intermediate\nrepresentations, keeping the total communication cost limited. Moreover, they\nenable us to sample from the product of the subposteriors using an efficient\nand stable importance sampling scheme. We demonstrate the approach outperforms\navailable state-of-the-art methods in a range of challenging scenarios,\nincluding high-dimensional and heterogeneous subposteriors.",

          "description": "Among the most successful methods for sparsifying deep (neural) networks are\nthose that adaptively mask the network weights throughout training. By\nexamining this masking, or dropout, in the linear case, we uncover a duality\nbetween such adaptive methods and regularization through the so-called\n\"$\\eta$-trick\" that casts both as iteratively reweighted optimizations. We show\nthat any dropout strategy that adapts to the weights in a monotonic way\ncorresponds to an effective subquadratic regularization penalty, and therefore\nleads to sparse solutions. We obtain the effective penalties for several\npopular sparsification strategies, which are remarkably similar to classical\npenalties commonly used in sparse optimization. Considering variational dropout\nas a case study, we demonstrate similar empirical behavior between the adaptive\ndropout method and classical methods on the task of deep network\nsparsification, validating our theory.",

          "description": "Recently, the \\textit{Tensor Nuclear Norm~(TNN)} regularization based on\nt-SVD has been widely used in various low tubal-rank tensor recovery tasks.\nHowever, these models usually require smooth change of data along the third\ndimension to ensure their low rank structures. In this paper, we propose a new\ndefinition of data dependent tensor rank named \\textit{tensor Q-rank} by a\nlearnable orthogonal matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$, and further introduce a unified data\ndependent low rank tensor recovery model. According to the low rank hypothesis,\nwe introduce two explainable selection method of $\\mathbf{Q}$, under which the\ndata tensor may have a more significant low tensor Q-rank structure than that\nof low tubal-rank structure. Specifically, maximizing the variance of singular\nvalue distribution leads to Variance Maximization Tensor Q-Nuclear\nnorm~(VMTQN), while minimizing the value of nuclear norm through manifold\noptimization leads to Manifold Optimization Tensor Q-Nuclear norm~(MOTQN).\nMoreover, we apply these two models to the low rank tensor completion problem,\nand then give an effective algorithm and briefly analyze why our method works\nbetter than TNN based methods in the case of complex data with low sampling\nrate. Finally, experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed model in the tensor completion problem with respect\nto other tensor rank regularization models.",

Divergence frontiers have\nrecently been proposed as an evaluation framework for generative models, due to\ntheir ability to measure the quality-diversity trade-off inherent to deep\ngenerative modeling. However, the statistical behavior of divergence frontiers\nestimated from data remains unknown to this day. In this paper, we establish\nnon-asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity of the plug-in estimator of\ndivergence frontiers. Along the way, we introduce a novel integral summary of\ndivergence frontiers.

          "description": "Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable robots to acquire new\nskills much more quickly, by leveraging prior experience to learn how to learn.\nHowever, much of the current research on meta-reinforcement learning focuses on\ntask distributions that are very narrow. For example, a commonly used\nmeta-reinforcement learning benchmark uses different running velocities for a\nsimulated robot as different tasks. When policies are meta-trained on such\nnarrow task distributions, they cannot possibly generalize to more quickly\nacquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the aim of these methods is to enable\nfaster acquisition of entirely new behaviors, we must evaluate them on task\ndistributions that are sufficiently broad to enable generalization to new\nbehaviors. In this paper, we propose an open-source simulated benchmark for\nmeta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning consisting of 50 distinct\nrobotic manipulation tasks. Our aim is to make it possible to develop\nalgorithms that generalize to accelerate the acquisition of entirely new,\nheld-out tasks. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning and\nmulti-task learning algorithms on these tasks. Surprisingly, while each task\nand its variations (e.g., with different object positions) can be learned with\nreasonable success, these algorithms struggle to learn with multiple tasks at\nthe same time, even with as few as ten distinct training tasks. Our analysis\nand open-source environments pave the way for future research in multi-task\nlearning and meta-learning that can enable meaningful generalization, thereby\nunlocking the full potential of these methods.",

PTQ requires no\nre-training or labelled data and is thus a lightweight push-button approach to\nquantization. In most cases, PTQ is sufficient for achieving 8-bit quantization\nwith close to floating-point accuracy. QAT requires fine-tuning and access to\nlabeled training data but enables lower bit quantization with competitive\nresults.

          "description": "Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques help analysts to understand patterns\nin high-dimensional spaces. These techniques, often represented by scatter\nplots, are employed in diverse science domains and facilitate similarity\nanalysis among clusters and data samples. For datasets containing many\ngranularities or when analysis follows the information visualization mantra,\nhierarchical DR techniques are the most suitable approach since they present\nmajor structures beforehand and details on demand. However, current\nhierarchical DR techniques are not fully capable of addressing literature\nproblems because they do not preserve the projection mental map across\nhierarchical levels or are not suitable for most data types. This work presents\nHUMAP, a novel hierarchical dimensionality reduction technique designed to be\nflexible on preserving local and global structures and preserve the mental map\nthroughout hierarchical exploration. We provide empirical evidence of our\ntechnique's superiority compared with current hierarchical approaches and show\ntwo case studies to demonstrate its strengths.",

          "description": "Recognition of anomalous events is a challenging but critical task in many\nscientific and industrial fields, especially when the properties of anomalies\nare unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new anomaly concept called \"unicorn\"\nor unique event and present a new, model-free, unsupervised detection algorithm\nto detect unicorns. The key component of the new algorithm is the Temporal\nOutlier Factor (TOF) to measure the uniqueness of events in continuous data\nsets from dynamic systems. The concept of unique events differs significantly\nfrom traditional outliers in many aspects: while repetitive outliers are no\nlonger unique events, a unique event is not necessarily an outlier; it does not\nnecessarily fall out from the distribution of normal activity. The performance\nof our algorithm was examined in recognizing unique events on different types\nof simulated data sets with anomalies and it was compared with the Local\nOutlier Factor (LOF) and discord discovery algorithms. TOF had superior\nperformance compared to LOF and discord algorithms even in recognizing\ntraditional outliers and it also recognized unique events that those did not.\nThe benefits of the unicorn concept and the new detection method were\nillustrated by example data sets from very different scientific fields. Our\nalgorithm successfully recognized unique events in those cases where they were\nalready known such as the gravitational waves of a binary black hole merger on\nLIGO detector data and the signs of respiratory failure on ECG data series.\nFurthermore, unique events were found on the LIBOR data set of the last 30\nyears.",

          "description": "Nowadays, subsurface salt body localization and delineation, also called\nsemantic segmentation of salt bodies, are among the most challenging\ngeophysicist tasks. Thus, identifying large salt bodies is notoriously tricky\nand is crucial for identifying hydrocarbon reservoirs and drill path planning.\nThis work proposes a Data Augmentation method based on training two generative\nmodels to augment the number of samples in a seismic image dataset for the\nsemantic segmentation of salt bodies. Our method uses deep learning models to\ngenerate pairs of seismic image patches and their respective salt masks for the\nData Augmentation. The first model is a Variational Autoencoder and is\nresponsible for generating patches of salt body masks. The second is a\nConditional Normalizing Flow model, which receives the generated masks as\ninputs and generates the associated seismic image patches. We evaluate the\nproposed method by comparing the performance of ten distinct state-of-the-art\nmodels for semantic segmentation, trained with and without the generated\naugmentations, in a dataset from two synthetic seismic images. The proposed\nmethodology yields an average improvement of 8.57% in the IoU metric across all\ncompared models. The best result is achieved by a DeeplabV3+ model variant,\nwhich presents an IoU score of 95.17% when trained with our augmentations.\nAdditionally, our proposal outperformed six selected data augmentation methods,\nand the most significant improvement in the comparison, of 9.77%, is achieved\nby composing our DA with augmentations from an elastic transformation. At last,\nwe show that the proposed method is adaptable for a larger context size by\nachieving results comparable to the obtained on the smaller context size.",

          "description": "Learning meaningful representations of data is an important aspect of machine\nlearning and has recently been successfully applied to many domains like\nlanguage understanding or computer vision. Instead of training a model for one\nspecific task, representation learning is about training a model to capture all\nuseful information in the underlying data and make it accessible for a\npredictor. For predictive process analytics, it is essential to have all\nexplanatory characteristics of a process instance available when making\npredictions about the future, as well as for clustering and anomaly detection.\nDue to the large variety of perspectives and types within business process\ndata, generating a good representation is a challenging task. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach for representation learning of business process\ninstances which can process and combine most perspectives in an event log. In\nconjunction with a self-supervised pre-training method, we show the\ncapabilities of the approach through a visualization of the representation\nspace and case retrieval. Furthermore, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned to\nmultiple process prediction tasks and demonstrates its effectiveness in\ncomparison with existing approaches.",

However, to ensure that such CPath solutions are robust and safe for\nuse in a clinical setting, a critical analysis of their predictive performance\nand vulnerability to adversarial attacks is required, which is the focus of\nthis paper. Specifically, we show that a highly accurate model for\nclassification of tumour patches in pathology images (AUC > 0.95) can easily be\nattacked with minimal perturbations which are imperceptible to lay humans and\ntrained pathologists alike. Our analytical results show that it is possible to\ngenerate single-instance white-box attacks on specific input images with high\nsuccess rate and low perturbation energy. Furthermore, we have also generated a\nsingle universal perturbation matrix using the training dataset only which,\nwhen added to unseen test images, results in forcing the trained neural network\nto flip its prediction labels with high confidence at a success rate of > 84%.\nWe systematically analyze the relationship between perturbation energy of an\nadversarial attack, its impact on morphological constructs of clinical\nsignificance, their perceptibility by a trained pathologist and saliency maps\nobtained using deep learning models.

For this study,\nfull configuration interaction (FCI) one--electron density functions within\npredefined limits of accuracy were used to train the QPNN. The obtained results\nsuggest that this new neural network is capable of learning the effective\npotential functions of many electron atoms in a completely unsupervised manner,\nand using only limited information from the probability density. Using the\neffective potential functions learned for each of the studied systems the QPNN\nwas able to estimate the total energies of each of the systems (with a maximum\nof 10 trials) with a remarkable accuracy when compared to the FCI energies.",

RL is uniquely well suited to\nconservation and global change challenges for three reasons: (1) RL explicitly\nfocuses on designing an agent who _interacts_ with an environment which is\ndynamic and uncertain, (2) RL approaches do not require massive amounts of\ndata, (3) RL approaches would utilize rather than replace existing models,\nsimulations, and the knowledge they contain. We provide a conceptual and\ntechnical introduction to RL and its relevance to ecological and conservation\nchallenges, including examples of a problem in setting fisheries quotas and in\nmanaging ecological tipping points.

In terms of creating training data, we contribute the\nlargest publicly available dataset of real-life factual claims for the purpose\nof automatic claim verification (MultiFC), and we present a novel inference\nmodel composed of multi-scale CNNs with different kernel sizes that learn from\nexternal sources to infer fact checking labels. In terms of improving semantic\nrepresentations, we contribute a novel model that captures non-compositional\nsemantic indicators. By definition, the meaning of a non-compositional phrase\ncannot be inferred from the individual meanings of its composing words (e.g.,\nhot dog). Motivated by this, we operationalize the compositionality of a phrase\ncontextually by enriching the phrase representation with external word\nembeddings and knowledge graphs. Finally, in terms of inference learning, we\npropose a series of novel deep learning architectures that improve inference by\nusing syntactic dependencies, by ensembling role guided attention heads,\nincorporating gating layers, and concatenating multiple heads in novel and\neffective ways.

          "description": "Principled decision making in emergency response management necessitates the\nuse of statistical models that predict the spatial-temporal likelihood of\nincident occurrence. These statistical models are then used for proactive\nstationing which allocates first responders across the spatial area in order to\nreduce overall response time. Traditional methods that simply aggregate past\nincidents over space and time fail to make useful short-term predictions when\nthe spatial region is large and focused on fine-grained spatial entities like\ninterstate highway networks. This is partially due to the sparsity of incidents\nwith respect to the area in consideration. Further, accidents are affected by\nseveral covariates, and collecting, cleaning, and managing multiple streams of\ndata from various sources is challenging for large spatial areas. In this\npaper, we highlight how this problem is being solved for the state of\nTennessee, a state in the USA with a total area of over 100,000 sq. km. Our\npipeline, based on a combination of synthetic resampling, non-spatial\nclustering, and learning from data can efficiently forecast the spatial and\ntemporal dynamics of accident occurrence, even under sparse conditions. In the\npaper, we describe our pipeline that uses data related to roadway geometry,\nweather, historical accidents, and real-time traffic congestion to aid accident\nforecasting. To understand how our forecasting model can affect allocation and\ndispatch, we improve upon a classical resource allocation approach.\nExperimental results show that our approach can significantly reduce response\ntimes in the field in comparison with current approaches followed by first\nresponders.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved remarkable performance in various\nfields. However, training a DNN model from scratch requires a lot of computing\nresources and training data. It is difficult for most individual users to\nobtain such computing resources and training data. Model copyright infringement\nis an emerging problem in recent years. For instance, pre-trained models may be\nstolen or abuse by illegal users without the authorization of the model owner.\nRecently, many works on protecting the intellectual property of DNN models have\nbeen proposed. In these works, embedding watermarks into DNN based on backdoor\nis one of the widely used methods. However, when the DNN model is stolen, the\nbackdoor-based watermark may face the risk of being detected and removed by an\nadversary. In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect and remove watermark in\ndeep neural networks via generative adversarial networks (GAN). We demonstrate\nthat the backdoor-based DNN watermarks are vulnerable to the proposed GAN-based\nwatermark removal attack. The proposed attack method includes two phases. In\nthe first phase, we use the GAN and few clean images to detect and reverse the\nwatermark in the DNN model. In the second phase, we fine-tune the watermarked\nDNN based on the reversed backdoor images. Experimental evaluations on the\nMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method can\neffectively remove about 98% of the watermark in DNN models, as the watermark\nretention rate reduces from 100% to less than 2% after applying the proposed\nattack. In the meantime, the proposed attack hardly affects the model's\nperformance. The test accuracy of the watermarked DNN on the MNIST and the\nCIFAR10 datasets drops by less than 1% and 3%, respectively.",

          "description": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have gained significant popularity in the\nlast decade for solving narrow AI problems in domains such as healthcare,\ntransportation, and defense. As ANNs become more ubiquitous, it is imperative\nto understand their associated safety, security, and privacy vulnerabilities.\nRecently, it has been shown that ANNs are susceptible to a number of\nadversarial evasion attacks--inputs that cause the ANN to make high-confidence\nmisclassifications despite being almost indistinguishable from the data used to\ntrain and test the network. This work explores to what degree finding these\nexamples maybe aided by using side-channel information, specifically switching\npower consumption, of hardware implementations of ANNs. A black-box threat\nscenario is assumed, where an attacker has access to the ANN hardware's input,\noutputs, and topology, but the trained model parameters are unknown. Then, a\nsurrogate model is trained to have similar functional (i.e. input-output\nmapping) and switching power characteristics as the oracle (black-box) model.\nOur results indicate that the inclusion of power consumption data increases the\nfidelity of the model extraction by up to 30 percent based on a mean square\nerror comparison of the oracle and surrogate weights. However, transferability\nof adversarial examples from the surrogate to the oracle model was not\nsignificantly affected.",

          "description": "Explaining the surprising generalization performance of deep neural networks\nis an active and important line of research in theoretical machine learning.\nInfluential work by Arora et al. (ICML'18) showed that, noise stability\nproperties of deep nets occurring in practice can be used to provably compress\nmodel representations. They then argued that the small representations of\ncompressed networks imply good generalization performance albeit only of the\ncompressed nets. Extending their compression framework to yield generalization\nbounds for the original uncompressed networks remains elusive.\n\nOur main contribution is the establishment of a compression-based framework\nfor proving generalization bounds. The framework is simple and powerful enough\nto extend the generalization bounds by Arora et al. to also hold for the\noriginal network. To demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we also show\nthat it allows us to give simple proofs of the strongest known generalization\nbounds for other popular machine learning models, namely Support Vector\nMachines and Boosting.",

          "description": "Biological agents are known to learn many different tasks over the course of\ntheir lives, and to be able to revisit previous tasks and behaviors with little\nto no loss in performance. In contrast, artificial agents are prone to\n'catastrophic forgetting' whereby performance on previous tasks deteriorates\nrapidly as new ones are acquired. This shortcoming has recently been addressed\nusing methods that encourage parameters to stay close to those used for\nprevious tasks. This can be done by (i) using specific parameter regularizers\nthat map out suitable destinations in parameter space, or (ii) guiding the\noptimization journey by projecting gradients into subspaces that do not\ninterfere with previous tasks. However, parameter regularization has been shown\nto be relatively ineffective in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a setting\nrelevant to the study of neural dynamics supporting biological continual\nlearning. Similarly, projection based methods can reach capacity and fail to\nlearn any further as the number of tasks increases. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Natural Continual Learning (NCL), a new method that\nunifies weight regularization and projected gradient descent. NCL uses Bayesian\nweight regularization to encourage good performance on all tasks at convergence\nand combines this with gradient projections designed to prevent catastrophic\nforgetting during optimization. NCL formalizes gradient projection as a trust\nregion algorithm based on the Fisher information metric, and achieves\nscalability via a novel Kronecker-factored approximation strategy. Our method\noutperforms both standard weight regularization techniques and projection based\napproaches when applied to continual learning problems in RNNs. The trained\nnetworks evolve task-specific dynamics that are strongly preserved as new tasks\nare learned, similar to experimental findings in biological circuits.",

Contrasting a given instance with a structurally similar\nexample which does not belong to the concept highlights what characteristics\nare necessary for concept membership. Such near misses have been proposed by\nWinston (1970) as efficient guidance for learning in relational domains. We\nintroduce an explanation generation algorithm for relational concepts learned\nwith Inductive Logic Programming (\\textsc{GeNME}). The algorithm identifies\nnear miss examples from a given set of instances and ranks these examples by\ntheir degree of closeness to a specific positive instance. A modified rule\nwhich covers the near miss but not the original instance is given as an\nexplanation.

          "description": "In recent years, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has achieved notable\nresults in various translation tasks. However, the word-by-word generation\nmanner determined by the autoregressive mechanism leads to high translation\nlatency of the NMT and restricts its low-latency applications.\nNon-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation (NAT) removes the autoregressive\nmechanism and achieves significant decoding speedup through generating target\nwords independently and simultaneously. Nevertheless, NAT still takes the\nword-level cross-entropy loss as the training objective, which is not optimal\nbecause the output of NAT cannot be properly evaluated due to the multimodality\nproblem. In this paper, we propose using sequence-level training objectives to\ntrain NAT models, which evaluate the NAT outputs as a whole and correlates well\nwith the real translation quality. Firstly, we propose training NAT models to\noptimize sequence-level evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU) based on several novel\nreinforcement algorithms customized for NAT, which outperforms the conventional\nmethod by reducing the variance of gradient estimation. Secondly, we introduce\na novel training objective for NAT models, which aims to minimize the\nBag-of-Ngrams (BoN) difference between the model output and the reference\nsentence. The BoN training objective is differentiable and can be calculated\nefficiently without doing any approximations. Finally, we apply a three-stage\ntraining strategy to combine these two methods to train the NAT model. We\nvalidate our approach on four translation tasks (WMT14 En$\\leftrightarrow$De,\nWMT16 En$\\leftrightarrow$Ro), which shows that our approach largely outperforms\nNAT baselines and achieves remarkable performance on all translation tasks.",

          "description": "Spatial resolution adaptation is a technique which has often been employed in\nvideo compression to enhance coding efficiency. This approach encodes a lower\nresolution version of the input video and reconstructs the original resolution\nduring decoding. Instead of using conventional up-sampling filters, recent work\nhas employed advanced super-resolution methods based on convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) to further improve reconstruction quality. These approaches are\nusually trained to minimise pixel-based losses such as Mean-Squared Error\n(MSE), despite the fact that this type of loss metric does not correlate well\nwith subjective opinions. In this paper, a perceptually-inspired\nsuper-resolution approach (M-SRGAN) is proposed for spatial up-sampling of\ncompressed video using a modified CNN model, which has been trained using a\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) on compressed content with perceptual loss\nfunctions. The proposed method was integrated with HEVC HM 16.20, and has been\nevaluated on the JVET Common Test Conditions (UHD test sequences) using the\nRandom Access configuration. The results show evident perceptual quality\nimprovement over the original HM 16.20, with an average bitrate saving of 35.6%\n(Bj{\\o}ntegaard Delta measurement) based on a perceptual quality metric, VMAF.",

While the basic variational autoencoder-based models assume\na unimodal Gaussian prior for the latent code of sentences, we alternate it\nwith a recursive Gaussian mixture, where each mixture component corresponds to\nthe latent code of a topic sentence and is mixed by a tree-structured topic\ndistribution. By decoding each Gaussian component, we generate sentences with\ntree-structured topic guidance, where the root sentence conveys generic\ncontent, and the leaf sentences describe specific topics. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the generated topic sentences are appropriate as a summary of\nopinionated texts, which are more informative and cover more input contents\nthan those generated by the recent unsupervised summarization model\n(Bra\\v{z}inskas et al., 2020). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the variance of\nlatent Gaussians represents the granularity of sentences, analogous to Gaussian\nword embedding (Vilnis and McCallum, 2015).",

While low-variance reparameterization\ngradients of a continuous relaxation can provide an effective solution, a\ncontinuous relaxation is not always available or tractable. Dong et al. (2020)\nand Yin et al. (2020) introduced a performant estimator that does not rely on\ncontinuous relaxations; however, it is limited to binary random variables. We\nintroduce a novel derivation of their estimator based on importance sampling\nand statistical couplings, which we extend to the categorical setting.\nMotivated by the construction of a stick-breaking coupling, we introduce\ngradient estimators based on reparameterizing categorical variables as\nsequences of binary variables and Rao-Blackwellization. In systematic\nexperiments, we show that our proposed categorical gradient estimators provide\nstate-of-the-art performance, whereas even with additional\nRao-Blackwellization, previous estimators (Yin et al., 2019) underperform a\nsimpler REINFORCE with a leave-one-out-baseline estimator (Kool et al., 2019).",

Due to the witnessed efficiency in\nsolving bi-level programs, gradient-based methods have gained popularity in the\nmachine learning community. In this work, we propose a new gradient-based\nsolution scheme, namely, the Bi-level Value-Function-based Interior-point\nMethod (BVFIM). Following the main idea of the log-barrier interior-point\nscheme, we penalize the regularized value function of the lower level problem\ninto the upper level objective. By further solving a sequence of differentiable\nunconstrained approximation problems, we consequently derive a sequential\nprogramming scheme. The numerical advantage of our scheme relies on the fact\nthat, when gradient methods are applied to solve the approximation problem, we\nsuccessfully avoid computing any expensive Hessian-vector or Jacobian-vector\nproduct. We prove the convergence without requiring any convexity assumption on\neither the upper level or the lower level objective. Experiments demonstrate\nthe efficiency of the proposed BVFIM on non-convex bi-level problems.",

          "description": "Recent advances in deep learning renewed the research interests in machine\nlearning for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Specifically,\nattention has been given to sequential learning models, due to their ability to\nextract the temporal characteristics of Network traffic Flows (NetFlows), and\nuse them for NIDS tasks. However, the applications of these sequential models\noften consist of transferring and adapting methodologies directly from other\nfields, without an in-depth investigation on how to leverage the specific\ncircumstances of cybersecurity scenarios; moreover, there is a lack of\ncomprehensive studies on sequential models that rely on NetFlow data, which\npresents significant advantages over traditional full packet captures. We\ntackle this problem in this paper. We propose a detailed methodology to extract\ntemporal sequences of NetFlows that denote patterns of malicious activities.\nThen, we apply this methodology to compare the efficacy of sequential learning\nmodels against traditional static learning models. In particular, we perform a\nfair comparison of a `sequential' Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) against a\n`static' Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) in distinct environments represented\nby two well-known datasets for NIDS: the CICIDS2017 and the CTU13. Our results\nhighlight that LSTM achieves comparable performance to FNN in the CICIDS2017\nwith over 99.5\\% F1-score; while obtaining superior performance in the CTU13,\nwith 95.7\\% F1-score against 91.5\\%.

          "description": "Recent advances in AIoT technologies have led to an increasing popularity of\nutilizing machine learning algorithms to detect operational failures for\ncyber-physical systems (CPS). In its basic form, an anomaly detection module\nmonitors the sensor measurements and actuator states from the physical plant,\nand detects anomalies in these measurements to identify abnormal operation\nstatus. Nevertheless, building effective anomaly detection models for CPS is\nrather challenging as the model has to accurately detect anomalies in presence\nof highly complicated system dynamics and unknown amount of sensor noise. In\nthis work, we propose a novel time series anomaly detection method called\nNeural System Identification and Bayesian Filtering (NSIBF) in which a\nspecially crafted neural network architecture is posed for system\nidentification, i.e., capturing the dynamics of CPS in a dynamical state-space\nmodel; then a Bayesian filtering algorithm is naturally applied on top of the\n\"identified\" state-space model for robust anomaly detection by tracking the\nuncertainty of the hidden state of the system recursively over time. We provide\nqualitative as well as quantitative experiments with the proposed method on a\nsynthetic and three real-world CPS datasets, showing that NSIBF compares\nfavorably to the state-of-the-art methods with considerable improvements on\nanomaly detection in CPS.",

          "description": "One of the key challenges when developing a predictive model is the\ncapability to describe the domain knowledge and the cause-effect relationships\nin a simple way. Decision rules are a useful and important methodology in this\ncontext, justifying their application in several areas, in particular in\nclinical practice. Several machine-learning classifiers have exploited the\nadvantageous properties of decision rules to build intelligent prediction\nmodels, namely decision trees and ensembles of trees (ETs). However, such\nmethodologies usually suffer from a trade-off between interpretability and\npredictive performance. Some procedures consider a simplification of ETs, using\nheuristic approaches to select an optimal reduced set of decision rules. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel step to those methodologies. We create a new\ncomponent to predict if a given rule will be correct or not for a particular\npatient, which introduces personalization into the procedure. Furthermore, the\nvalidation results using three public clinical datasets show that it also\nallows to increase the predictive performance of the selected set of rules,\nimproving the mentioned trade-off.",

          "description": "Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are widespread in critical domains, and\nsignificant damage can be caused if an attacker is able to modify the code of\ntheir programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Unfortunately, traditional\ntechniques for attesting code integrity (i.e. verifying that it has not been\nmodified) rely on firmware access or roots-of-trust, neither of which\nproprietary or legacy PLCs are likely to provide. In this paper, we propose a\npractical code integrity checking solution based on privacy-preserving black\nbox models that instead attest the input/output behaviour of PLC programs.\nUsing faithful offline copies of the PLC programs, we identify their most\nimportant inputs through an information flow analysis, execute them on multiple\ncombinations to collect data, then train neural networks able to predict PLC\noutputs (i.e. actuator commands) from their inputs. By exploiting the black box\nnature of the model, our solution maintains the privacy of the original PLC\ncode and does not assume that attackers are unaware of its presence. The trust\ninstead comes from the fact that it is extremely hard to attack the PLC code\nand neural networks at the same time and with consistent outcomes. We evaluated\nour approach on a modern six-stage water treatment plant testbed, finding that\nit could predict actuator states from PLC inputs with near-100% accuracy, and\nthus could detect all 120 effective code mutations that we subjected the PLCs\nto. Finally, we found that it is not practically possible to simultaneously\nmodify the PLC code and apply discreet adversarial noise to our attesters in a\nway that leads to consistent (mis-)predictions.",

          "description": "Conventional unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) methods\nassume all source domains can be accessed directly. This neglects the\nprivacy-preserving policy, that is, all the data and computations must be kept\ndecentralized. There exists three problems in this scenario: (1) Minimizing the\ndomain distance requires the pairwise calculation of the data from source and\ntarget domains, which is not accessible. (2) The communication cost and privacy\nsecurity limit the application of UMDA methods (e.g., the domain adversarial\ntraining). (3) Since users have no authority to check the data quality, the\nirrelevant or malicious source domains are more likely to appear, which causes\nnegative transfer. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving UMDA paradigm\nnamed Knowledge Distillation based Decentralized Domain Adaptation (KD3A),\nwhich performs domain adaptation through the knowledge distillation on models\nfrom different source domains. KD3A solves the above problems with three\ncomponents: (1) A multi-source knowledge distillation method named Knowledge\nVote to learn high-quality domain consensus knowledge. (2) A dynamic weighting\nstrategy named Consensus Focus to identify both the malicious and irrelevant\ndomains. (3) A decentralized optimization strategy for domain distance named\nBatchNorm MMD. The extensive experiments on DomainNet demonstrate that KD3A is\nrobust to the negative transfer and brings a 100x reduction of communication\ncost compared with other decentralized UMDA methods. Moreover, our KD3A\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art UMDA approaches.",

          "description": "In this paper, we present a multi-lingual sentence encoder that can be used\nin search engines as a query and document encoder. This embedding enables a\nsemantic similarity score between queries and documents that can be an\nimportant feature in document ranking and relevancy. To train such a customized\nsentence encoder, it is beneficial to leverage users search data in the form of\nquery-document clicked pairs however, we must avoid relying too much on search\nclick data as it is biased and does not cover many unseen cases. The search\ndata is heavily skewed towards short queries and for long queries is small and\noften noisy. The goal is to design a universal multi-lingual encoder that works\nfor all cases and covers both short and long queries. We select a number of\npublic NLI datasets in different languages and translation data and together\nwith user search data we train a language model using a multi-task approach. A\nchallenge is that these datasets are not homogeneous in terms of content, size\nand the balance ratio. While the public NLI datasets are usually two-sentence\nbased with the same portion of positive and negative pairs, the user search\ndata can contain multi-sentence documents and only positive pairs. We show how\nmulti-task training enables us to leverage all these datasets and exploit\nknowledge sharing across these tasks.",

In this work, we observe this\nlimitation with respect to the task of native language identification. We find\nthat standard text classifiers which perform well on the test set end up\nlearning topical features which are confounds of the prediction task (e.g., if\nthe input text mentions Sweden, the classifier predicts that the author's\nnative language is Swedish). We propose a method that represents the latent\ntopical confounds and a model which \"unlearns\" confounding features by\npredicting both the label of the input text and the confound; but we train the\ntwo predictors adversarially in an alternating fashion to learn a text\nrepresentation that predicts the correct label but is less prone to using\ninformation about the confound.

          "description": "In humans and animals, curriculum learning -- presenting data in a curated\norder - is critical to rapid learning and effective pedagogy. Yet in machine\nlearning, curricula are not widely used and empirically often yield only\nmoderate benefits. This stark difference in the importance of curriculum raises\na fundamental theoretical question: when and why does curriculum learning help?\n\nIn this work, we analyse a prototypical neural network model of curriculum\nlearning in the high-dimensional limit, employing statistical physics methods.\nCurricula could in principle change both the learning speed and asymptotic\nperformance of a model. To study the former, we provide an exact description of\nthe online learning setting, confirming the long-standing experimental\nobservation that curricula can modestly speed up learning. To study the latter,\nwe derive performance in a batch learning setting, in which a network trains to\nconvergence in successive phases of learning on dataset slices of varying\ndifficulty. With standard training losses, curriculum does not provide\ngeneralisation benefit, in line with empirical observations. However, we show\nthat by connecting different learning phases through simple Gaussian priors,\ncurriculum can yield a large improvement in test performance. Taken together,\nour reduced analytical descriptions help reconcile apparently conflicting\nempirical results and trace regimes where curriculum learning yields the\nlargest gains. More broadly, our results suggest that fully exploiting a\ncurriculum may require explicit changes to the loss function at curriculum\nboundaries.",

However,\nexisting methods measuring the closeness are not very reliable: they are\ndiscrete and can take only a few values, and they are path-dependent, i.e.,\nthey may change given the same start and end points with different attack\npaths. In this paper, we propose three types of probabilistic margin (PM),\nwhich are continuous and path-independent, for measuring the aforementioned\ncloseness and reweighting adversarial data. Specifically, a PM is defined as\nthe difference between two estimated class-posterior probabilities, e.g., such\nthe probability of the true label minus the probability of the most confusing\nlabel given some natural data. Though different PMs capture different geometric\nproperties, all three PMs share a negative correlation with the vulnerability\nof data: data with larger/smaller PMs are safer/riskier and should have\nsmaller/larger weights.

Enhancing the\nadversarial robustness of DNNs has gained considerable interest in recent\nyears. Although image transformation-based defenses were widely considered at\nan earlier time, most of them have been defeated by adaptive attacks. In this\npaper, we propose a new image transformation defense based on error diffusion\nhalftoning, and combine it with adversarial training to defend against\nadversarial examples. Error diffusion halftoning projects an image into a 1-bit\nspace and diffuses quantization error to neighboring pixels. This process can\nremove adversarial perturbations from a given image while maintaining\nacceptable image quality in the meantime in favor of recognition. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method is able to improve adversarial\nrobustness even under advanced adaptive attacks, while most of the other image\ntransformation-based defenses do not.

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be useful for many different\npractical applications. However, many existing GNN models have implicitly\nassumed homophily among the nodes connected in the graph, and therefore have\nlargely overlooked the important setting of heterophily, where most connected\nnodes are from different classes. In this work, we propose a novel framework\ncalled CPGNN that generalizes GNNs for graphs with either homophily or\nheterophily. The proposed framework incorporates an interpretable compatibility\nmatrix for modeling the heterophily or homophily level in the graph, which can\nbe learned in an end-to-end fashion, enabling it to go beyond the assumption of\nstrong homophily. Theoretically, we show that replacing the compatibility\nmatrix in our framework with the identity (which represents pure homophily)\nreduces to GCN. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach in more realistic and challenging experimental settings with\nsignificantly less training data compared to previous works: CPGNN variants\nachieve state-of-the-art results in heterophily settings with or without\ncontextual node features, while maintaining comparable performance in homophily\nsettings.",

          "description": "Neural SDEs combine many of the best qualities of both RNNs and SDEs: memory\nefficient training, high-capacity function approximation, and strong priors on\nmodel space. This makes them a natural choice for modelling many types of\ntemporal dynamics. Training a Neural SDE (either as a VAE or as a GAN) requires\nbackpropagating through an SDE solve. This may be done by solving a\nbackwards-in-time SDE whose solution is the desired parameter gradients.\nHowever, this has previously suffered from severe speed and accuracy issues,\ndue to high computational cost and numerical truncation errors. Here, we\novercome these issues through several technical innovations. First, we\nintroduce the \\textit{reversible Heun method}. This is a new SDE solver that is\n\\textit{algebraically reversible}: eliminating numerical gradient errors, and\nthe first such solver of which we are aware. Moreover it requires half as many\nfunction evaluations as comparable solvers, giving up to a $1.98\\times$\nspeedup. Second, we introduce the \\textit{Brownian Interval}: a new, fast,\nmemory efficient, and exact way of sampling \\textit{and reconstructing}\nBrownian motion. With this we obtain up to a $10.6\\times$ speed improvement\nover previous techniques, which in contrast are both approximate and relatively\nslow. Third, when specifically training Neural SDEs as GANs (Kidger et al.\n2021), we demonstrate how SDE-GANs may be trained through careful weight\nclipping and choice of activation function. This reduces computational cost\n(giving up to a $1.87\\times$ speedup) and removes the numerical truncation\nerrors associated with gradient penalty. Altogether, we outperform the\nstate-of-the-art by substantial margins, with respect to training speed, and\nwith respect to classification, prediction, and MMD test metrics. We have\ncontributed implementations of all of our techniques to the torchsde library to\nhelp facilitate their adoption.",

For\ninference acceleration, methods that discover a sparse network from a\npre-trained dense network (dense-to-sparse training) work effectively.\nRecently, dynamic sparse training (DST) has been proposed to train sparse\nneural networks without pre-training a dense model (sparse-to-sparse training),\nso that the training process can also be accelerated. However, previous\nsparse-to-sparse methods mainly focus on Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLPs)\nand Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), failing to match the performance of\ndense-to-sparse methods in the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) setting. In\nthis paper, we propose an approach to train intrinsically sparse RNNs with a\nfixed parameter count in one single run, without compromising performance.\nDuring training, we allow RNN layers to have a non-uniform redistribution\nacross cell gates for better regularization. Further, we propose SNT-ASGD, a\nnovel variant of the averaged stochastic gradient optimizer, which\nsignificantly improves the performance of all sparse training methods for RNNs.\nUsing these strategies, we achieve state-of-the-art sparse training results,\nbetter than the dense-to-sparse methods, with various types of RNNs on Penn\nTreeBank and Wikitext-2 datasets.

To address the issues, I develop a new approximate\nspectral clustering using the network generated by growing neural gas (GNG),\ncalled ASC with GNG in this study.

Using the network generated from a dataset by\nGNG, ASC with GNG achieves to reduce the computational and space complexities\nand improve clustering quality.

          "description": "There are applications that may require removing the trace of a sample from\nthe system, e.g., a user requests their data to be deleted, or corrupted data\nis discovered. Simply removing a sample from storage units does not necessarily\nremove its entire trace since downstream machine learning models may store some\ninformation about the samples used to train them. A sample can be perfectly\nunlearned if we retrain all models that used it from scratch with that sample\nremoved from their training dataset. When multiple such unlearning requests are\nexpected to be served, unlearning by retraining becomes prohibitively\nexpensive. Ensemble learning enables the training data to be split into smaller\ndisjoint shards that are assigned to non-communicating weak learners. Each\nshard is used to produce a weak model. These models are then aggregated to\nproduce the final central model. This setup introduces an inherent trade-off\nbetween performance and unlearning cost, as reducing the shard size reduces the\nunlearning cost but may cause degradation in performance. In this paper, we\npropose a coded learning protocol where we utilize linear encoders to encode\nthe training data into shards prior to the learning phase. We also present the\ncorresponding unlearning protocol and show that it satisfies the perfect\nunlearning criterion. Our experimental results show that the proposed coded\nmachine unlearning provides a better performance versus unlearning cost\ntrade-off compared to the uncoded baseline.",

          "description": "The recent emergence of contrastive learning approaches facilitates the\nresearch on graph representation learning (GRL), introducing graph contrastive\nlearning (GCL) into the literature. These methods contrast semantically similar\nand dissimilar sample pairs to encode the semantics into node or graph\nembeddings. However, most existing works only performed model-level evaluation,\nand did not explore the combination space of modules for more comprehensive and\nsystematic studies. For effective module-level evaluation, we propose a\nframework that decomposes GCL models into four modules: (1) a sampler to\ngenerate anchor, positive and negative data samples (nodes or graphs); (2) an\nencoder and a readout function to get sample embeddings; (3) a discriminator to\nscore each sample pair (anchor-positive and anchor-negative); and (4) an\nestimator to define the loss function. Based on this framework, we conduct\ncontrolled experiments over a wide range of architectural designs and\nhyperparameter settings on node and graph classification tasks. Specifically,\nwe manage to quantify the impact of a single module, investigate the\ninteraction between modules, and compare the overall performance with current\nmodel architectures. Our key findings include a set of module-level guidelines\nfor GCL, e.g., simple samplers from LINE and DeepWalk are strong and robust; an\nMLP encoder associated with Sum readout could achieve competitive performance\non graph classification.

By starting from a random\nsparse network and continuously exploring sparse connectivities during\ntraining, we can perform an Over-Parameterization in the space-time manifold,\nclosing the gap in the expressibility between sparse training and dense\ntraining. We further use ITOP to understand the underlying mechanism of Dynamic\nSparse Training (DST) and indicate that the benefits of DST come from its\nability to consider across time all possible parameters when searching for the\noptimal sparse connectivity. As long as there are sufficient parameters that\nhave been reliably explored during training, DST can outperform the dense\nneural network by a large margin.

          "description": "While multitask representation learning has become a popular approach in\nreinforcement learning (RL), theoretical understanding of why and when it works\nremains limited. This paper presents analyses for the statistical benefit of\nmultitask representation learning in linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) under\na generative model. In this paper, we consider an agent to learn a\nrepresentation function $\\phi$ out of a function class $\\Phi$ from $T$ source\ntasks with $N$ data per task, and then use the learned $\\hat{\\phi}$ to reduce\nthe required number of sample for a new task. We first discover a\n\\emph{Least-Activated-Feature-Abundance} (LAFA) criterion, denoted as $\\kappa$,\nwith which we prove that a straightforward least-square algorithm learns a\npolicy which is $\\tilde{O}(H^2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)^2 \\kappa\nd}{NT}+\\frac{\\kappa d}{n}})$ sub-optimal. Here $H$ is the planning horizon,\n$\\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)$ is $\\Phi$'s complexity measure, $d$ is the dimension of the\nrepresentation (usually $d\\ll \\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)$) and $n$ is the number of\nsamples for the new task. Thus the required $n$ is $O(\\kappa d H^4)$ for the\nsub-optimality to be close to zero, which is much smaller than\n$O(\\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)^2\\kappa d H^4)$ in the setting without multitask\nrepresentation learning, whose sub-optimality gap is\n$\\tilde{O}(H^2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa \\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)^2d}{n}})$. This\ntheoretically explains the power of multitask representation learning in\nreducing sample complexity. Further, we note that to ensure high sample\nefficiency, the LAFA criterion $\\kappa$ should be small. In fact, $\\kappa$\nvaries widely in magnitude depending on the different sampling distribution for\nnew task. This indicates adaptive sampling technique is important to make\n$\\kappa$ solely depend on $d$.

These extracted examples include\n(public) personally identifiable information (names, phone numbers, and email\naddresses), IRC conversations, code, and 128-bit UUIDs. Our attack is possible\neven though each of the above sequences are included in just one document in\nthe training data.\n\nWe comprehensively evaluate our extraction attack to understand the factors\nthat contribute to its success. Worryingly, we find that larger models are more\nvulnerable than smaller models. We conclude by drawing lessons and discussing\npossible safeguards for training large language models.",

          "description": "We revisit and extend model stitching (Lenc & Vedaldi 2015) as a methodology\nto study the internal representations of neural networks. Given two trained and\nfrozen models $A$ and $B$, we consider a \"stitched model'' formed by connecting\nthe bottom-layers of $A$ to the top-layers of $B$, with a simple trainable\nlayer between them. We argue that model stitching is a powerful and perhaps\nunder-appreciated tool, which reveals aspects of representations that measures\nsuch as centered kernel alignment (CKA) cannot. Through extensive experiments,\nwe use model stitching to obtain quantitative verifications for intuitive\nstatements such as \"good networks learn similar representations'', by\ndemonstrating that good networks of the same architecture, but trained in very\ndifferent ways (e.g.: supervised vs. self-supervised learning), can be stitched\nto each other without drop in performance. We also give evidence for the\nintuition that \"more is better'' by showing that representations learnt with\n(1) more data, (2) bigger width, or (3) more training time can be \"plugged in''\nto weaker models to improve performance. Finally, our experiments reveal a new\nstructural property of SGD which we call \"stitching connectivity'', akin to\nmode-connectivity: typical minima reached by SGD can all be stitched to each\nother with minimal change in accuracy.",

As state-of-the-art deep learning\narchitectures have continued to grow in parameter count so have the compute\nbudgets and times required to train them, increasing the need for\ncompute-efficient methods that parallelize training. Two common approaches to\nparallelize the training of deep networks have been data and model parallelism.\nWhile useful, data and model parallelism suffer from diminishing returns in\nterms of compute efficiency for large batch sizes. In this paper, we\ninvestigate how to continue scaling compute efficiently beyond the point of\ndiminishing returns for large batches through local parallelism, a framework\nwhich parallelizes training of individual layers in deep networks by replacing\nglobal backpropagation with truncated layer-wise backpropagation. Local\nparallelism enables fully asynchronous layer-wise parallelism with a low memory\nfootprint, and requires little communication overhead compared with model\nparallelism. We show results in both vision and language domains across a\ndiverse set of architectures, and find that local parallelism is particularly\neffective in the high-compute regime.",

Since classical statistical\nlearning theory struggles to explain this behavior, much effort has recently\nbeen focused on uncovering the mechanisms behind it, in the hope of developing\na more adequate theoretical framework and having a better control over the\ntrained models. In this work, we adopt an alternate perspective, viewing the\nneural network as a dynamical system displacing input particles over time. We\nconduct a series of experiments and, by analyzing the network's behavior\nthrough its displacements, we show the presence of a low kinetic energy\ndisplacement bias in the transport map of the network, and link this bias with\ngeneralization performance. From this observation, we reformulate the learning\nproblem as follows: finding neural networks which solve the task while\ntransporting the data as efficiently as possible. This offers a novel\nformulation of the learning problem which allows us to provide regularity\nresults for the solution network, based on Optimal Transport theory. From a\npractical viewpoint, this allows us to propose a new learning algorithm, which\nautomatically adapts to the complexity of the given task, and leads to networks\nwith a high generalization ability even in low data regimes.",

We show that GT-SARAH, with appropriate algorithmic parameters, finds\nan $\\epsilon$-accurate first-order stationary point with\n$O\\big(\\max\\big\\{N^{\\frac{1}{2}},n(1-\\lambda)^{-2},n^{\\frac{2}{3}}m^{\\frac{1}{3}}(1-\\lambda)^{-1}\\big\\}L\\epsilon^{-2}\\big)$\ngradient complexity, where ${(1-\\lambda)\\in(0,1]}$ is the spectral gap of the\nnetwork weight matrix and $L$ is the smoothness parameter of the cost\nfunctions. This gradient complexity outperforms that of the existing\ndecentralized stochastic gradient methods. In particular, in a big-data regime\nsuch that ${n = O(N^{\\frac{1}{2}}(1-\\lambda)^{3})}$, this gradient complexity\nfurthers reduces to ${O(N^{\\frac{1}{2}}L\\epsilon^{-2})}$, independent of the\nnetwork topology, and matches that of the centralized near-optimal\nvariance-reduced methods. Moreover, in this regime GT-SARAH achieves a\nnon-asymptotic linear speedup, in that, the total number of gradient\ncomputations at each node is reduced by a factor of $1/n$ compared to the\ncentralized near-optimal algorithms that perform all gradient computations at a\nsingle node. To the best of our knowledge, GT-SARAH is the first algorithm that\nachieves this property. In addition, we show that appropriate choices of local\nminibatch size balance the trade-offs between the gradient and communication\ncomplexity of GT-SARAH. Over infinite time horizon, we establish that all nodes\nin GT-SARAH asymptotically achieve consensus and converge to a first-order\nstationary point in the almost sure and mean-squared sense.",

Prior work\nattempts to remove reverberation based on the audio modality only. Our idea is\nto learn to dereverberate speech from audio-visual observations. The visual\nenvironment surrounding a human speaker reveals important cues about the room\ngeometry, materials, and speaker location, all of which influence the precise\nreverberation effects in the audio stream. We introduce Visually-Informed\nDereverberation of Audio (VIDA), an end-to-end approach that learns to remove\nreverberation based on both the observed sounds and visual scene. In support of\nthis new task, we develop a large-scale dataset that uses realistic acoustic\nrenderings of speech in real-world 3D scans of homes offering a variety of room\nacoustics. Demonstrating our approach on both simulated and real imagery for\nspeech enhancement, speech recognition, and speaker identification, we show it\nachieves state-of-the-art performance and substantially improves over\ntraditional audio-only methods.

          "description": "Context: Advancements in machine learning (ML) lead to a shift from the\ntraditional view of software development, where algorithms are hard-coded by\nhumans, to ML systems materialized through learning from data. Therefore, we\nneed to revisit our ways of developing software systems and consider the\nparticularities required by these new types of systems. Objective: The purpose\nof this study is to systematically identify, analyze, summarize, and synthesize\nthe current state of software engineering (SE) research for engineering ML\nsystems. Method: I performed a systematic literature review (SLR). I\nsystematically selected a pool of 141 studies from SE venues and then conducted\na quantitative and qualitative analysis using the data extracted from these\nstudies. Results: The non-deterministic nature of ML systems complicates all SE\naspects of engineering ML systems. Despite increasing interest from 2018\nonwards, the results reveal that none of the SE aspects have a mature set of\ntools and techniques. Testing is by far the most popular area among\nresearchers. Even for testing ML systems, engineers have only some tool\nprototypes and solution proposals with weak experimental proof. Many of the\nchallenges of ML systems engineering were identified through surveys and\ninterviews. Researchers should conduct experiments and case studies, ideally in\nindustrial environments, to further understand these challenges and propose\nsolutions. Conclusion: The results may benefit (1) practitioners in foreseeing\nthe challenges of ML systems engineering; (2) researchers and academicians in\nidentifying potential research questions; and (3) educators in designing or\nupdating SE courses to cover ML systems engineering.",

          "description": "With the popularity of Machine Learning (ML) solutions, algorithms and data\nhave been released faster than the capacity of processing them. In this\ncontext, the problem of Algorithm Recommendation (AR) is receiving a\nsignificant deal of attention recently. This problem has been addressed in the\nliterature as a learning task, often as a Meta-Learning problem where the aim\nis to recommend the best alternative for a specific dataset. For such, datasets\nencoded by meta-features are explored by ML algorithms that try to learn the\nmapping between meta-representations and the best technique to be used. One of\nthe challenges for the successful use of ML is to define which features are the\nmost valuable for a specific dataset since several meta-features can be used,\nwhich increases the meta-feature dimension. This paper presents an empirical\nanalysis of Feature Selection and Feature Extraction in the meta-level for the\nAR problem. The present study was focused on three criteria: predictive\nperformance, dimensionality reduction, and pipeline runtime. As we verified,\napplying Dimensionality Reduction (DR) methods did not improve predictive\nperformances in general. However, DR solutions reduced about 80% of the\nmeta-features, obtaining pretty much the same performance as the original setup\nbut with lower runtimes. The only exception was PCA, which presented about the\nsame runtime as the original meta-features. Experimental results also showed\nthat various datasets have many non-informative meta-features and that it is\npossible to obtain high predictive performance using around 20% of the original\nmeta-features. Therefore, due to their natural trend for high dimensionality,\nDR methods should be used for Meta-Feature Selection and Meta-Feature\nExtraction.",

Recent extensions in AT have focused on defending\nagainst the union of multiple perturbations but this benefit is obtained at the\nexpense of a significant (up to $10\\times$) increase in training complexity\nover single-attack $\\ell_\\infty$ AT. In this work, we expand the capabilities\nof widely popular single-attack $\\ell_\\infty$ AT frameworks to provide\nrobustness to the union of ($\\ell_\\infty, \\ell_2, \\ell_1$) perturbations while\npreserving their training efficiency. Our technique, referred to as Shaped\nNoise Augmented Processing (SNAP), exploits a well-established byproduct of\nsingle-attack AT frameworks -- the reduction in the curvature of the decision\nboundary of networks. SNAP prepends a given deep net with a shaped noise\naugmentation layer whose distribution is learned along with network parameters\nusing any standard single-attack AT. As a result, SNAP enhances adversarial\naccuracy of ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 against the union of ($\\ell_\\infty, \\ell_2,\n\\ell_1$) perturbations by 14%-to-20% for four state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nsingle-attack $\\ell_\\infty$ AT frameworks, and, for the first time, establishes\na benchmark for ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 on ImageNet.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have been shown as a class of useful tools for\naddressing signal recognition issues in recent years, especially for\nidentifying the nonlinear feature structures of signals. However, this power of\nmost deep learning techniques heavily relies on an abundant amount of training\ndata, so the performance of classic neural nets decreases sharply when the\nnumber of training data samples is small or unseen data are presented in the\ntesting phase. This calls for an advanced strategy, i.e., model-agnostic\nmeta-learning (MAML), which is able to capture the invariant representation of\nthe data samples or signals. In this paper, inspired by the special structure\nof the signal, i.e., real and imaginary parts consisted in practical\ntime-series signals, we propose a Complex-valued Attentional MEta Learner\n(CAMEL) for the problem of few-shot signal recognition by leveraging attention\nand meta-learning in the complex domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nalso the first complex-valued MAML that can find the first-order stationary\npoints of general nonconvex problems with theoretical convergence guarantees.\nExtensive experiments results showcase the superiority of the proposed CAMEL\ncompared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, or domain generalization,\nis one of the central problems in modern machine learning. Recently, there is a\nsurge of attempts to propose algorithms for OOD that mainly build upon the idea\nof extracting invariant features. Although intuitively reasonable, theoretical\nunderstanding of what kind of invariance can guarantee OOD generalization is\nstill limited, and generalization to arbitrary out-of-distribution is clearly\nimpossible. In this work, we take the first step towards rigorous and\nquantitative definitions of 1) what is OOD; and 2) what does it mean by saying\nan OOD problem is learnable. We also introduce a new concept of expansion\nfunction, which characterizes to what extent the variance is amplified in the\ntest domains over the training domains, and therefore give a quantitative\nmeaning of invariant features. Based on these, we prove OOD generalization\nerror bounds. It turns out that OOD generalization largely depends on the\nexpansion function. As recently pointed out by Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz (2020),\nany OOD learning algorithm without a model selection module is incomplete. Our\ntheory naturally induces a model selection criterion. Extensive experiments on\nbenchmark OOD datasets demonstrate that our model selection criterion has a\nsignificant advantage over baselines.",

In this\npaper, we generalize the challenges of GNN in representing higher-order data in\nprinciple, which are edge- and node-level ambiguities. To overcome the\nchallenges, we present SNALS that utilizes bipartite graph neural network with\nstructural features to collectively tackle the two ambiguity issues. SNALS\ncaptures the joint interactions of a hyperedge by its local environment, which\nis retrieved by collecting the spectrum information of their connections. As a\nresult, SNALS achieves nearly 30% performance increase compared with most\nrecent GNN-based models. In addition, we applied SNALS to predict genetic\nhigher-order interactions on 3D genome organization data.

          "description": "In recent years, various notions of capacity and complexity have been\nproposed for characterizing the generalization properties of stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) in deep learning. Some of the popular notions that\ncorrelate well with the performance on unseen data are (i) the `flatness' of\nthe local minimum found by SGD, which is related to the eigenvalues of the\nHessian, (ii) the ratio of the stepsize $\\eta$ to the batch-size $b$, which\nessentially controls the magnitude of the stochastic gradient noise, and (iii)\nthe `tail-index', which measures the heaviness of the tails of the network\nweights at convergence. In this paper, we argue that these three seemingly\nunrelated perspectives for generalization are deeply linked to each other. We\nclaim that depending on the structure of the Hessian of the loss at the\nminimum, and the choices of the algorithm parameters $\\eta$ and $b$, the SGD\niterates will converge to a \\emph{heavy-tailed} stationary distribution. We\nrigorously prove this claim in the setting of quadratic optimization: we show\nthat even in a simple linear regression problem with independent and\nidentically distributed data whose distribution has finite moments of all\norder, the iterates can be heavy-tailed with infinite variance. We further\ncharacterize the behavior of the tails with respect to algorithm parameters,\nthe dimension, and the curvature. We then translate our results into insights\nabout the behavior of SGD in deep learning. We support our theory with\nexperiments conducted on synthetic data, fully connected, and convolutional\nneural networks.",

          "description": "As Artificial Intelligence as a Service gains popularity, protecting\nwell-trained models as intellectual property is becoming increasingly\nimportant. Generally speaking, there are two common protection methods:\nownership verification and usage authorization. In this paper, we propose\nNon-Transferable Learning (NTL), a novel approach that captures the exclusive\ndata representation in the learned model and restricts the model generalization\nability to certain domains. This approach provides effective solutions to both\nmodel verification and authorization. For ownership verification, watermarking\ntechniques are commonly used but are often vulnerable to sophisticated\nwatermark removal methods. Our NTL-based model verification approach instead\nprovides robust resistance to state-of-the-art watermark removal methods, as\nshown in extensive experiments for four of such methods over the digits,\nCIFAR10 & STL10, and VisDA datasets. For usage authorization, prior solutions\nfocus on authorizing specific users to use the model, but authorized users can\nstill apply the model to any data without restriction. Our NTL-based\nauthorization approach instead provides data-centric usage protection by\nsignificantly degrading the performance of usage on unauthorized data. Its\neffectiveness is also shown through experiments on a variety of datasets.",

Automated\nand accurate dose prediction for radiation therapy planning is in high demand.\nIn this study, we propose a novel learning-based ensemble approach, named\nLE-NAS, which integrates neural architecture search (NAS) with knowledge\ndistillation for 3D radiotherapy dose prediction. Specifically, the prediction\nnetwork first exhaustively searches each block from enormous architecture\nspace. Then, multiple architectures are selected with promising performance and\ndiversity. To reduce the inference time, we adopt the teacher-student paradigm\nby treating the combination of diverse outputs from multiple searched networks\nas supervisions to guide the student network training. In addition, we apply\nadversarial learning to optimize the student network to recover the knowledge\nin teacher networks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\ninvestigate the combination of NAS and knowledge distillation.

          "description": "Working memory (WM) is a basic part of human cognition, which plays an\nimportant role in the study of human cognitive load. Among various brain\nimaging techniques, electroencephalography has shown its advantage on easy\naccess and reliability. However, one of the critical challenges is that\nindividual difference may cause the ineffective results, especially when the\nestablished model meets an unfamiliar subject. In this work, we propose a\ncross-subject deep adaptation model with spatial attention (CS-DASA) to\ngeneralize the workload classifications across subjects. First, we transform\ntime-series EEG data into multi-frame EEG images incorporating more\nspatio-temporal information. First, the subject-shared module in CS-DASA\nreceives multi-frame EEG image data from both source and target subjects and\nlearns the common feature representations. Then, in subject-specific module,\nthe maximum mean discrepancy is implemented to measure the domain distribution\ndivergence in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which can add an effective\npenalty loss for domain adaptation. Additionally, the subject-to-subject\nspatial attention mechanism is employed to focus on the most discriminative\nspatial feature in EEG image data. Experiments conducted on a public WM EEG\ndataset containing 13 subjects show that the proposed model is capable of\nachieve better performance than existing state-of-the art methods.",

          "description": "Recent works have presented promising results from the application of machine\nlearning (ML) to the modeling of flow rates in oil and gas wells. Encouraging\nresults and advantageous properties of ML models, such as computationally cheap\nevaluation and ease of calibration to new data, have sparked optimism for the\ndevelopment of data-driven virtual flow meters (VFMs). Data-driven VFMs are\ndeveloped in the small data regime, where it is important to question the\nuncertainty and robustness of models. The modeling of uncertainty may help to\nbuild trust in models, which is a prerequisite for industrial applications. The\ncontribution of this paper is the introduction of a probabilistic VFM based on\nBayesian neural networks. Uncertainty in the model and measurements is\ndescribed, and the paper shows how to perform approximate Bayesian inference\nusing variational inference. The method is studied by modeling on a large and\nheterogeneous dataset, consisting of 60 wells across five different oil and gas\nassets. The predictive performance is analyzed on historical and future test\ndata, where an average error of 4-6% and 8-13% is achieved for the 50% best\nperforming models, respectively. Variational inference appears to provide more\nrobust predictions than the reference approach on future data. Prediction\nperformance and uncertainty calibration is explored in detail and discussed in\nlight of four data challenges. The findings motivate the development of\nalternative strategies to improve the robustness of data-driven VFMs.",

While labeled input-output pairs are expensive to obtain,\n\"unlabeled\" outputs, i.e. outputs without corresponding inputs, are freely\navailable (e.g. code on GitHub) and provide information about output validity.\nPre-training captures this structure by training a denoiser to denoise\ncorrupted versions of unlabeled outputs. We first show that standard\nfine-tuning after pre-training destroys some of this structure. We then propose\ncomposed fine-tuning, which trains a predictor composed with the pre-trained\ndenoiser. Importantly, the denoiser is fixed to preserve output structure. Like\nstandard fine-tuning, the predictor is also initialized with the pre-trained\ndenoiser. We prove for two-layer ReLU networks that composed fine-tuning\nsignificantly reduces the complexity of the predictor, thus improving\ngeneralization. Empirically, we show that composed fine-tuning improves over\nstandard fine-tuning on two pseudocode-to-code translation datasets (3% and 6%\nrelative).

          "description": "This manuscript is aimed at addressing several long standing limitations of\ndynamic mode decompositions in the application of Koopman analysis. Principle\namong these limitations are the convergence of associated Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition algorithms and the existence of Koopman modes. To address these\nlimitations, two major modifications are made, where Koopman operators are\nremoved from the analysis in light of Liouville operators (known as Koopman\ngenerators in special cases), and these operators are shown to be compact for\ncertain pairs of Hilbert spaces selected separately as the domain and range of\nthe operator. While eigenfunctions are discarded in the general analysis, a\nviable reconstruction algorithm is still demonstrated, and the sacrifice of\neigenfunctions realizes the theoretical goals of DMD analysis that have yet to\nbe achieved in other contexts. However, in the case where the domain is\nembedded in the range, an eigenfunction approach is still achievable, where a\nmore typical DMD routine is established, but that leverages a finite rank\nrepresentation that converges in norm. The manuscript concludes with the\ndescription of two Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithms that converges when a\ndense collection of occupation kernels, arising from the data, are leveraged in\nthe analysis.",

Furthermore, by viewing the AC method\nas a two-player Stackelberg game between the actor and critic, we show that the\nStackelberg policy gradient can be recovered as a special case of our more\ngeneral analysis. Based on these results, we develop practical algorithms,\nResidual Actor-Critic and Stackelberg Actor-Critic, for estimating the\ncorrection between AC and PG and use these to modify the standard AC algorithm.\nExperiments on popular tabular and continuous environments show the proposed\ncorrections can improve both the sample efficiency and final performance of\nexisting AC methods.",

          "description": "As a research community, we are still lacking a systematic understanding of\nthe progress on adversarial robustness, which often makes it hard to identify\nthe most promising ideas in training robust models. A key challenge in\nbenchmarking robustness is that its evaluation is often error-prone, leading to\noverestimation of the true robustness of models. While adaptive attacks\ndesigned for a particular defense are a potential solution, they have to be\nhighly customized for particular models, which makes it difficult to compare\ndifferent methods. Our goal is to instead establish a standardized benchmark of\nadversarial robustness, which as accurately as possible reflects the robustness\nof the considered models within a reasonable computational budget. To evaluate\nthe robustness of models for our benchmark, we consider AutoAttack, an ensemble\nof white- and black-box attacks which was recently shown in a large-scale study\nto improve almost all robustness evaluations compared to the original\npublications. We also impose some restrictions on the admitted models to rule\nout defenses that only make gradient-based attacks ineffective without\nimproving actual robustness. Our leaderboard, hosted at\nhttps://robustbench.github.io/, contains evaluations of 90+ models and aims at\nreflecting the current state of the art on a set of well-defined tasks in\n$\\ell_\\infty$- and $\\ell_2$-threat models and on common corruptions, with\npossible extensions in the future. Additionally, we open-source the library\nhttps://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench that provides unified access to 60+\nrobust models to facilitate their downstream applications. Finally, based on\nthe collected models, we analyze the impact of robustness on the performance on\ndistribution shifts, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, fairness,\nprivacy leakage, smoothness, and transferability.",

          "description": "Order-agnostic autoregressive distribution estimation (OADE), i.e.,\nautoregressive distribution estimation where the features can occur in an\narbitrary order, is a challenging problem in generative machine learning. Prior\nwork on OADE has encoded feature identity (e.g., pixel location) by assigning\neach feature to a distinct fixed position in an input vector. As a result,\narchitectures built for these inputs must strategically mask either the input\nor model weights to learn the various conditional distributions necessary for\ninferring the full joint distribution of the dataset in an order-agnostic way.\nIn this paper, we propose an alternative approach for encoding feature\nidentities, where each feature's identity is included alongside its value in\nthe input. This feature identity encoding strategy allows neural architectures\ndesigned for sequential data to be applied to the OADE task without\nmodification. As a proof of concept, we show that a Transformer trained on this\ninput (which we refer to as \"the DEformer\", i.e., the distribution estimating\nTransformer) can effectively model binarized-MNIST, approaching the average\nnegative log-likelihood of fixed order autoregressive distribution estimating\nalgorithms while still being entirely order-agnostic.",

          "description": "In many coordination problems, independently reasoning humans are able to\ndiscover mutually compatible policies. In contrast, independently trained\nself-play policies are often mutually incompatible. Zero-shot coordination\n(ZSC) has recently been proposed as a new frontier in multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning to address this fundamental issue. Prior work approaches the ZSC\nproblem by assuming players can agree on a shared learning algorithm but not on\nlabels for actions and observations, and proposes other-play as an optimal\nsolution. However, until now, this \"label-free\" problem has only been\ninformally defined. We formalize this setting as the label-free coordination\n(LFC) problem by defining the label-free coordination game. We show that\nother-play is not an optimal solution to the LFC problem as it fails to\nconsistently break ties between incompatible maximizers of the other-play\nobjective. We introduce an extension of the algorithm, other-play with\ntie-breaking, and prove that it is optimal in the LFC problem and an\nequilibrium in the LFC game. Since arbitrary tie-breaking is precisely what the\nZSC setting aims to prevent, we conclude that the LFC problem does not reflect\nthe aims of ZSC. To address this, we introduce an alternative informal\noperationalization of ZSC as a starting point for future work.",

          "description": "Personalized ubiquitous healthcare solutions require energy-efficient\nwearable platforms that provide an accurate classification of bio-signals while\nconsuming low average power for long-term battery-operated use. Single lead\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide the ability to detect, classify, and\neven predict cardiac arrhythmia. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal\nconvolutional network (TCN) that achieves high accuracy while still being\nfeasible for wearable platform use. Experimental results on the ECG5000 dataset\nshow that the TCN has a similar accuracy (94.2%) score as the state-of-the-art\n(SoA) network while achieving an improvement of 16.5% in the balanced accuracy\nscore. This accurate classification is done with 27 times fewer parameters and\n37 times less multiply-accumulate operations. We test our implementation on two\npublicly available platforms, the STM32L475, which is based on ARM Cortex M4F,\nand the GreenWaves Technologies GAP8 on the GAPuino board, based on 1+8 RISC-V\nCV32E40P cores.

In this work, we argue that\nby not using any labelled data, data programming based approaches can yield\nsub-optimal performances, particularly when the labelling functions are noisy.\nThe first contribution of this work is an introduction of a framework, \\model\nwhich is a semi-supervised data programming paradigm that learns a \\emph{joint\nmodel} that effectively uses the rules/labelling functions along with\nsemi-supervised loss functions on the feature space. Next, we also study\n\\modelss which additionally does subset selection on top of the joint\nsemi-supervised data programming objective and \\emph{selects} a set of examples\nthat can be used as the labelled set by \\model. The goal of \\modelss is to\nensure that the labelled data can \\emph{complement} the labelling functions,\nthereby benefiting from both data-programming as well as appropriately selected\ndata for human labelling. We demonstrate that by effectively combining\nsemi-supervision, data-programming, and subset selection paradigms, we\nsignificantly outperform the current state-of-the-art on seven publicly\navailable datasets. \\footnote{The source code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/ayushbits/Semi-Supervised-LFs-Subset-Selection}}",

          "description": "(Artificial) neural networks have become increasingly popular in mechanics as\nmeans to accelerate computations with model order reduction techniques and as\nuniversal models for a wide variety of materials. However, the major\ndisadvantage of neural networks remains: their numerous parameters are\nchallenging to interpret and explain. Thus, neural networks are often labeled\nas black boxes, and their results often elude human interpretation. In\nmechanics, the new and active field of physics-informed neural networks\nattempts to mitigate this disadvantage by designing deep neural networks on the\nbasis of mechanical knowledge. By using this a priori knowledge, deeper and\nmore complex neural networks became feasible, since the mechanical assumptions\ncould be explained. However, the internal reasoning and explanation of neural\nnetwork parameters remain mysterious.\n\nComplementary to the physics-informed approach, we propose a first step\ntowards a physics-informing approach, which explains neural networks trained on\nmechanical data a posteriori. This novel explainable artificial intelligence\napproach aims at elucidating the black box of neural networks and their\nhigh-dimensional representations. Therein, the principal component analysis\ndecorrelates the distributed representations in cell states of RNNs and allows\nthe comparison to known and fundamental functions. The novel approach is\nsupported by a systematic hyperparameter search strategy that identifies the\nbest neural network architectures and training parameters. The findings of\nthree case studies on fundamental constitutive models (hyperelasticity,\nelastoplasticity, and viscoelasticity) imply that the proposed strategy can\nhelp identify numerical and analytical closed-form solutions to characterize\nnew materials.",

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) allows a set of agents to collaboratively train a\nmodel without sharing their potentially sensitive data. This makes FL suitable\nfor privacy-preserving applications. At the same time, FL is susceptible to\nadversarial attacks due to decentralized and unvetted data. One important line\nof attacks against FL is the backdoor attacks. In a backdoor attack, an\nadversary tries to embed a backdoor functionality to the model during training\nthat can later be activated to cause a desired misclassification. To prevent\nbackdoor attacks, we propose a lightweight defense that requires minimal change\nto the FL protocol. At a high level, our defense is based on carefully\nadjusting the aggregation server's learning rate, per dimension and per round,\nbased on the sign information of agents' updates. We first conjecture the\nnecessary steps to carry a successful backdoor attack in FL setting, and then,\nexplicitly formulate the defense based on our conjecture. Through experiments,\nwe provide empirical evidence that supports our conjecture, and we test our\ndefense against backdoor attacks under different settings. We observe that\neither backdoor is completely eliminated, or its accuracy is significantly\nreduced. Overall, our experiments suggest that our defense significantly\noutperforms some of the recently proposed defenses in the literature.

However, it remains challenging to control the\ngeneration results. Previous approaches such as prompting are far from\nsufficient, which limits the usage of language models. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose an innovative method, inverse prompting, to better\ncontrol text generation. The core idea of inverse prompting is to use generated\ntext to inversely predict the prompt during beam search, which enhances the\nrelevance between the prompt and the generated text and provides better\ncontrollability. Empirically, we pre-train a large-scale Chinese language model\nto perform a systematic study using human evaluation on the tasks of\nopen-domain poem generation and open-domain long-form question answering.

          "description": "In the predict-then-optimize framework, the objective is to train a\npredictive model, mapping from environment features to parameters of an\noptimization problem, which maximizes decision quality when the optimization is\nsubsequently solved. Recent work on decision-focused learning shows that\nembedding the optimization problem in the training pipeline can improve\ndecision quality and help generalize better to unseen tasks compared to relying\non an intermediate loss function for evaluating prediction quality. We study\nthe predict-then-optimize framework in the context of sequential decision\nproblems (formulated as MDPs) that are solved via reinforcement learning. In\nparticular, we are given environment features and a set of trajectories from\ntraining MDPs, which we use to train a predictive model that generalizes to\nunseen test MDPs without trajectories. Two significant computational challenges\narise in applying decision-focused learning to MDPs: (i) large state and action\nspaces make it infeasible for existing techniques to differentiate through MDP\nproblems, and (ii) the high-dimensional policy space, as parameterized by a\nneural network, makes differentiating through a policy expensive. We resolve\nthe first challenge by sampling provably unbiased derivatives to approximate\nand differentiate through optimality conditions, and the second challenge by\nusing a low-rank approximation to the high-dimensional sample-based\nderivatives. We implement both Bellman--based and policy gradient--based\ndecision-focused learning on three different MDP problems with missing\nparameters, and show that decision-focused learning performs better in\ngeneralization to unseen tasks.",

          "description": "Recent research has used deep learning to develop partial differential\nequation (PDE) models in science and engineering. The functional form of the\nPDE is determined by a neural network, and the neural network parameters are\ncalibrated to available data. Calibration of the embedded neural network can be\nperformed by optimizing over the PDE. Motivated by these applications, we\nrigorously study the optimization of a class of linear elliptic PDEs with\nneural network terms. The neural network parameters in the PDE are optimized\nusing gradient descent, where the gradient is evaluated using an adjoint PDE.\nAs the number of parameters become large, the PDE and adjoint PDE converge to a\nnon-local PDE system. Using this limit PDE system, we are able to prove\nconvergence of the neural network-PDE to a global minimum during the\noptimization. The limit PDE system contains a non-local linear operator whose\neigenvalues are positive but become arbitrarily small. The lack of a spectral\ngap for the eigenvalues poses the main challenge for the global convergence\nproof. Careful analysis of the spectral decomposition of the coupled PDE and\nadjoint PDE system is required. Finally, we use this adjoint method to train a\nneural network model for an application in fluid mechanics, in which the neural\nnetwork functions as a closure model for the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes\n(RANS) equations. The RANS neural network model is trained on several datasets\nfor turbulent channel flow and is evaluated out-of-sample at different Reynolds\nnumbers.",

          "description": "In this paper, we consider non-convex stochastic bilevel optimization (SBO)\nproblems that have many applications in machine learning. Although numerous\nstudies have proposed stochastic algorithms for solving these problems, they\nare limited in two perspectives: (i) their sample complexities are high, which\ndo not match the state-of-the-art result for non-convex stochastic\noptimization; (ii) their algorithms are tailored to problems with only one\nlower-level problem. When there are many lower-level problems, it could be\nprohibitive to process all these lower-level problems at each iteration. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes fast randomized stochastic\nalgorithms for non-convex SBO problems. First, we present a stochastic method\nfor non-convex SBO with only one lower problem and establish its sample\ncomplexity of $O(1/\\epsilon^3)$ for finding an $\\epsilon$-stationary point\nunder Lipschitz continuous conditions of stochastic oracles, matching the lower\nbound for stochastic smooth non-convex optimization. Second, we present a\nrandomized stochastic method for non-convex SBO with $m>1$ lower level problems\n(multi-task SBO) by processing a constant number of lower problems at each\niteration, and establish its sample complexity no worse than $O(m/\\epsilon^3)$,\nwhich could be a better complexity than that of simply processing all $m$ lower\nproblems at each iteration. Lastly, we establish even faster convergence\nresults for gradient-dominant functions.

However, as dynamic network literature\nstems from diverse fields and makes use of inconsistent terminology, it is\nchallenging to navigate. Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained a\nlot of attention in recent years for their ability to perform well on a range\nof network science tasks, such as link prediction and node classification.\nDespite the popularity of graph neural networks and the proven benefits of\ndynamic network models, there has been little focus on graph neural networks\nfor dynamic networks. To address the challenges resulting from the fact that\nthis research crosses diverse fields as well as to survey dynamic graph neural\nnetworks, this work is split into two main parts. First, to address the\nambiguity of the dynamic network terminology we establish a foundation of\ndynamic networks with consistent, detailed terminology and notation. Second, we\npresent a comprehensive survey of dynamic graph neural network models using the\nproposed terminology",

However, existing GNP convolutions suffer from slow training,\nlead to significant reduction in accuracy and provide no guarantees on their\napproximations. In this work, we propose a GNP convolution layer called Skew\nOrthogonal Convolution (SOC) that uses the following mathematical property:\nwhen a matrix is {\\it Skew-Symmetric}, its exponential function is an {\\it\northogonal} matrix. To use this property, we first construct a convolution\nfilter whose Jacobian is Skew-Symmetric. Then, we use the Taylor series\nexpansion of the Jacobian exponential to construct the SOC layer that is\northogonal. To efficiently implement SOC, we keep a finite number of terms from\nthe Taylor series and provide a provable guarantee on the approximation error.\nOur experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that SOC allows us to train\nprovably Lipschitz, large convolutional neural networks significantly faster\nthan prior works while achieving significant improvements for both standard and\ncertified robust accuracies.",

          "description": "In deep neural networks, the spectral norm of the Jacobian of a layer bounds\nthe factor by which the norm of a signal changes during forward/backward\npropagation. Spectral norm regularizations have been shown to improve\ngeneralization, robustness and optimization of deep learning methods. Existing\nmethods to compute the spectral norm of convolution layers either rely on\nheuristics that are efficient in computation but lack guarantees or are\ntheoretically-sound but computationally expensive. In this work, we obtain the\nbest of both worlds by deriving {\\it four} provable upper bounds on the\nspectral norm of a standard 2D multi-channel convolution layer. These bounds\nare differentiable and can be computed efficiently during training with\nnegligible overhead. One of these bounds is in fact the popular heuristic\nmethod of Miyato et al.

Thus, we propose to use the minimum of these four bounds\nas a tight, differentiable and efficient upper bound on the spectral norm of\nconvolution layers. We show that our spectral bound is an effective regularizer\nand can be used to bound either the lipschitz constant or curvature values\n(eigenvalues of the Hessian) of neural networks.

          "description": "Recent works on Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have made promising progress in\nnarrowing the accuracy gap of BNNs to their 32-bit counterparts. However, the\naccuracy gains are often based on specialized model designs using additional\n32-bit components. Furthermore, almost all previous BNNs use 32-bit for feature\nmaps and the shortcuts enclosing the corresponding binary convolution blocks,\nwhich helps to effectively maintain the accuracy, but is not friendly to\nhardware accelerators with limited memory, energy, and computing resources.\nThus, we raise the following question: How can accuracy and energy consumption\nbe balanced in a BNN network design? We extensively study this fundamental\nproblem in this work and propose a novel BNN architecture without most commonly\nused 32-bit components: \\textit{BoolNet}. Experimental results on ImageNet\ndemonstrate that BoolNet can achieve 4.6x energy reduction coupled with 1.2\\%\nhigher accuracy than the commonly used BNN architecture Bi-RealNet.

          "description": "We present a machine learning based COVID-19 cough classifier which can\ndiscriminate COVID-19 positive coughs from both COVID-19 negative and healthy\ncoughs recorded on a smartphone. This type of screening is non-contact, easy to\napply, and can reduce the workload in testing centres as well as limit\ntransmission by recommending early self-isolation to those who have a cough\nsuggestive of COVID-19. The datasets used in this study include subjects from\nall six continents and contain both forced and natural coughs, indicating that\nthe approach is widely applicable. The publicly available Coswara dataset\ncontains 92 COVID-19 positive and 1079 healthy subjects, while the second\nsmaller dataset was collected mostly in South Africa and contains 18 COVID-19\npositive and 26 COVID-19 negative subjects who have undergone a SARS-CoV\nlaboratory test. Both datasets indicate that COVID-19 positive coughs are\n15\\%-20\\% shorter than non-COVID coughs. Dataset skew was addressed by applying\nthe synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). A leave-$p$-out\ncross-validation scheme was used to train and evaluate seven machine learning\nclassifiers: LR, KNN, SVM, MLP, CNN, LSTM and Resnet50. Our results show that\nalthough all classifiers were able to identify COVID-19 coughs, the best\nperformance was exhibited by the Resnet50 classifier, which was best able to\ndiscriminate between the COVID-19 positive and the healthy coughs with an area\nunder the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.98. An LSTM classifier was best able to\ndiscriminate between the COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative coughs, with\nan AUC of 0.94 after selecting the best 13 features from a sequential forward\nselection (SFS). Since this type of cough audio classification is\ncost-effective and easy to deploy, it is potentially a useful and viable means\nof non-contact COVID-19 screening.",

          "description": "There has been a surge of interest in continual learning and federated\nlearning, both of which are important in deep neural networks in real-world\nscenarios. Yet little research has been done regarding the scenario where each\nclient learns on a sequence of tasks from a private local data stream. This\nproblem of federated continual learning poses new challenges to continual\nlearning, such as utilizing knowledge from other clients, while preventing\ninterference from irrelevant knowledge. To resolve these issues, we propose a\nnovel federated continual learning framework, Federated Weighted Inter-client\nTransfer (FedWeIT), which decomposes the network weights into global federated\nparameters and sparse task-specific parameters, and each client receives\nselective knowledge from other clients by taking a weighted combination of\ntheir task-specific parameters. FedWeIT minimizes interference between\nincompatible tasks, and also allows positive knowledge transfer across clients\nduring learning. We validate our FedWeIT against existing federated learning\nand continual learning methods under varying degrees of task similarity across\nclients, and our model significantly outperforms them with a large reduction in\nthe communication cost.

While approaches like active learning reduce the number of\nlabels needed for model training, existing literature largely ignores the cost\nof labeling test data, typically unrealistically assuming large test sets for\nmodel evaluation. This creates a disconnect to real applications, where test\nlabels are important and just as expensive, e.g. for optimizing\nhyperparameters. Active testing addresses this by carefully selecting the test\npoints to label, ensuring model evaluation is sample-efficient. To this end, we\nderive theoretically-grounded and intuitive acquisition strategies that are\nspecifically tailored to the goals of active testing, noting these are distinct\nto those of active learning. As actively selecting labels introduces a bias; we\nfurther show how to remove this bias while reducing the variance of the\nestimator at the same time. Active testing is easy to implement and can be\napplied to any supervised machine learning method. We demonstrate its\neffectiveness on models including WideResNets and Gaussian processes on\ndatasets including Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-100.",

As we show, when the support size is 3 or\nmore, the structure of the leaf clusters may be partially or fully\nidentifiable. We provide a precise characterization of this phenomenon and show\nthat the extent of recoverability is dictated by the joint PMF of the random\nvariables. In particular, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for\nexact recoverability. Furthermore, we present a polynomial time, sample\nefficient algorithm that recovers the exact tree when this is possible, or up\nto the unidentifiability as promised by our characterization, when full\nrecoverability is impossible.

We introduce Model-based IL from Offline data\n(MILO): an algorithmic framework that utilizes the static dataset to solve the\noffline IL problem efficiently both in theory and in practice. In theory, even\nif the behavior policy is highly sub-optimal compared to the expert, we show\nthat as long as the data from the behavior policy provides sufficient coverage\non the expert state-action traces (and with no necessity for a global coverage\nover the entire state-action space), MILO can provably combat the covariate\nshift issue in IL.

However, little attention has been paid\nto potentially changing dynamics when transferring a policy to the online\nsetting, where performance can be up to 90% reduced for existing methods. In\nthis paper we address this problem with Augmented World Models (AugWM). We\naugment a learned dynamics model with simple transformations that seek to\ncapture potential changes in physical properties of the robot, leading to more\nrobust policies. We not only train our policy in this new setting, but also\nprovide it with the sampled augmentation as a context, allowing it to adapt to\nchanges in the environment. At test time we learn the context in a\nself-supervised fashion by approximating the augmentation which corresponds to\nthe new environment. We rigorously evaluate our approach on over 100 different\nchanged dynamics settings, and show that this simple approach can significantly\nimprove the zero-shot generalization of a recent state-of-the-art baseline,\noften achieving successful policies where the baseline fails.",

          "description": "Mini-batch optimal transport (m-OT) has been successfully used in practical\napplications that involve probability measures with intractable density, or\nprobability measures with a very high number of supports. The m-OT solves\nseveral sparser optimal transport problems and then returns the average of\ntheir costs and transportation plans. Despite its scalability advantage, the\nm-OT does not consider the relationship between mini-batches which leads to\nundesirable estimation. Moreover, the m-OT does not approximate a proper metric\nbetween probability measures since the identity property is not satisfied. To\naddress these problems, we propose a novel mini-batching scheme for optimal\ntransport, named Batch of Mini-batches Optimal Transport (BoMb-OT), that finds\nthe optimal coupling between mini-batches and it can be seen as an\napproximation to a well-defined distance on the space of probability measures.\nFurthermore, we show that the m-OT is a limit of the entropic regularized\nversion of the BoMb-OT when the regularized parameter goes to infinity.\nFinally, we carry out extensive experiments to show that the BoMb-OT can\nestimate a better transportation plan between two original measures than the\nm-OT. It leads to a favorable performance of the BoMb-OT in the matching and\ncolor transfer tasks. Furthermore, we observe that the BoMb-OT also provides a\nbetter objective loss than the m-OT for doing approximate Bayesian computation,\nestimating parameters of interest in parametric generative models, and learning\nnon-parametric generative models with gradient flow.",

Despite its great success, as with many other models, GNNs\nhave the risk to inherit the bias from the training data. In addition, the bias\nof GNN can be magnified by the graph structures and message-passing mechanism\nof GNNs. The risk of discrimination limits the adoption of GNNs in sensitive\ndomains such as credit score estimation. Though extensive studies of fair\nclassification have been conducted on i.i.d data, methods to address the\nproblem of discrimination on non-i.i.d data are rather limited. Furthermore,\nthe practical scenario of sparse annotations in sensitive attributes is rarely\nconsidered in existing works. Therefore, we study the novel and important\nproblem of learning fair GNNs with limited sensitive information. We propose a\nnovel framework called FairGNN, which is able to reduce the bias of GNNs and\nmaintain high node classification accuracy by leveraging graph structured data\nand sensitive information. Theoretical analysis is conducted to show that\nFairGNN can ensure fairness under mild conditions given limited nodes with\nknown sensitive attributes. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrated the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework in eliminating discrimination while\nmaintaining high node classification accuracy.",

          "description": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) defines the task of learning from a fixed\nbatch of data. Due to errors in value estimation from out-of-distribution\nactions, most offline RL algorithms take the approach of constraining or\nregularizing the policy with the actions contained in the dataset. Built on\npre-existing RL algorithms, modifications to make an RL algorithm work offline\ncomes at the cost of additional complexity. Offline RL algorithms introduce new\nhyperparameters and often leverage secondary components such as generative\nmodels, while adjusting the underlying RL algorithm. In this paper we aim to\nmake a deep RL algorithm work while making minimal changes. We find that we can\nmatch the performance of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms by simply\nadding a behavior cloning term to the policy update of an online RL algorithm\nand normalizing the data.

          "description": "Recent years have witnessed deep neural networks gaining increasing\npopularity in the field of time series forecasting. A primary reason of their\nsuccess is their ability to effectively capture complex temporal dynamics\nacross multiple related time series. However, the advantages of these deep\nforecasters only start to emerge in the presence of a sufficient amount of\ndata. This poses a challenge for typical forecasting problems in practice,\nwhere one either has a small number of time series, or limited observations per\ntime series, or both. To cope with the issue of data scarcity, we propose a\nnovel domain adaptation framework, Domain Adaptation Forecaster (DAF), that\nleverages the statistical strengths from another relevant domain with abundant\ndata samples (source) to improve the performance on the domain of interest with\nlimited data (target). In particular, we propose an attention-based shared\nmodule with a domain discriminator across domains as well as private modules\nfor individual domains. This allows us to jointly train the source and target\ndomains by generating domain-invariant latent features while retraining\ndomain-specific features. Extensive experiments on various domains demonstrate\nthat our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic\nand real-world datasets.",

Our experiments used the Collision task, a small\nidealized off-policy problem analogous to that of an autonomous car trying to\npredict whether it will collide with an obstacle. We assessed the performance\nof the algorithms according to their learning rate, asymptotic error level, and\nsensitivity to step-size and bootstrapping parameters. By these measures, the\neleven algorithms can be partially ordered on the Collision task. In the top\ntier, the two Emphatic-TD algorithms learned the fastest, reached the lowest\nerrors, and were robust to parameter settings. In the middle tier, the five\nGradient-TD algorithms and Off-policy TD($\\lambda$) were more sensitive to the\nbootstrapping parameter. The bottom tier comprised Vtrace, Tree Backup, and\nABQ; these algorithms were no faster and had higher asymptotic error than the\nothers.

Prior methods typically approach this problem by preprocessing\nraw waveform into time-frequency representations, which is more amenable to\nprocess with well-established image processing pipelines. Prior methods also\ndetect in segment-wise manner, leading to incomplete and partial detections.\nSoundDet takes a novel approach and directly consumes the raw, multichannel\nwaveform and treats the spatio-temporal sound event as a complete\n``sound-object\" to be detected. Specifically, SoundDet consists of a backbone\nneural network and two parallel heads for temporal detection and spatial\nlocalization, respectively. Given the large sampling rate of raw waveform, the\nbackbone network first learns a set of phase-sensitive and frequency-selective\nbank of filters to explicitly retain direction-of-arrival information, whilst\nbeing highly computationally and parametrically efficient than standard 1D/2D\nconvolution. A dense sound event proposal map is then constructed to handle the\nchallenges of predicting events with large varying temporal duration.\nAccompanying the dense proposal map are a temporal overlapness map and a motion\nsmoothness map that measure a proposal's confidence to be an event from\ntemporal detection accuracy and movement consistency perspective. Involving the\ntwo maps guarantees SoundDet to be trained in a spatio-temporally unified\nmanner. Experimental results on the public DCASE dataset show the advantage of\nSoundDet on both segment-based and our newly proposed event-based evaluation\nsystem.",

Despite\nits success, DARTS lacks robustness in certain cases, e.g. it may degenerate to\ntrivial architectures with excessive parametric-free operations such as skip\nconnection or random noise, leading to inferior performance. In particular,\noperation selection based on the magnitude of architectural parameters was\nrecently proven to be fundamentally wrong showcasing the need to rethink this\naspect. On the other hand, zero-cost proxies have been recently studied in the\ncontext of sample-based NAS showing promising results -- speeding up the search\nprocess drastically in some cases but also failing on some of the large search\nspaces typical for differentiable NAS. In this work we propose a novel\noperation selection paradigm in the context of differentiable NAS which\nutilises zero-cost proxies.

          "description": "We study the adversarial robustness in offline reinforcement learning. Given\na batch dataset consisting of tuples $(s, a, r, s')$, an adversary is allowed\nto arbitrarily modify $\\epsilon$ fraction of the tuples. From the corrupted\ndataset the learner aims to robustly identify a near-optimal policy. We first\nshow that a worst-case $\\Omega(d\\epsilon)$ optimality gap is unavoidable in\nlinear MDP of dimension $d$, even if the adversary only corrupts the reward\nelement in a tuple. This contrasts with dimension-free results in robust\nsupervised learning and best-known lower-bound in the online RL setting with\ncorruption. Next, we propose robust variants of the Least-Square Value\nIteration (LSVI) algorithm utilizing robust supervised learning oracles, which\nachieve near-matching performances in cases both with and without full data\ncoverage. The algorithm requires the knowledge of $\\epsilon$ to design the\npessimism bonus in the no-coverage case. Surprisingly, in this case, the\nknowledge of $\\epsilon$ is necessary, as we show that being adaptive to unknown\n$\\epsilon$ is impossible.This again contrasts with recent results on\ncorruption-robust online RL and implies that robust offline RL is a strictly\nharder problem.",

Machine learning systems, on the\nother hand, usually leverage spurious correlations in the training data, and\nwhile such correlations can help recognize objects in context, they hurt\ngeneralization. To be able to deal with underspecified datasets while still\nleveraging contextual clues during classification, we propose ProtoProp, a\nnovel prototype propagation graph method. First we learn prototypical\nrepresentations of objects (e.g., zebra) that are conditionally independent\nw.r.t. their attribute labels (e.g., stripes) and vice versa. Next we propagate\nthe independent prototypes through a compositional graph, to learn\ncompositional prototypes of novel attribute-object combinations that reflect\nthe dependencies of the target distribution.

          "description": "Saliency methods can make deep neural network predictions more interpretable\nby identifying a set of critical features in an input sample, such as pixels\nthat contribute most strongly to a prediction made by an image classifier.\nUnfortunately, recent evidence suggests that many saliency methods poorly\nperform, especially in situations where gradients are saturated, inputs contain\nadversarial perturbations, or predictions rely upon inter-feature dependence.\nTo address these issues, we propose a framework that improves the robustness of\nsaliency methods by following a two-step procedure. First, we introduce a\nperturbation mechanism that subtly varies the input sample without changing its\nintermediate representations. Using this approach, we can gather a corpus of\nperturbed data samples while ensuring that the perturbed and original input\nsamples follow the same distribution. Second, we compute saliency maps for the\nperturbed samples and propose a new method to aggregate saliency maps. With\nthis design, we offset the gradient saturation influence upon interpretation.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, we show the aggregated saliency map could not\nonly capture inter-feature dependence but, more importantly, robustify\ninterpretation against previously described adversarial perturbation methods.\nFollowing our theoretical analysis, we present experimental results suggesting\nthat, both qualitatively and quantitatively, our saliency method outperforms\nexisting methods.",

Being based on the\ncross-platform and cross-language API to be applicable in any computerised\ndevice, it offers the benefits of modern programming languages and the\nopportunities to develop more complex and advanced systems. However, the DDS\ncomplexity equally increases its vulnerability, while the existing security\nmeasures are limited to plug-ins and static rules, with the rest of the\nsecurity provided by third-party applications and operating system.\nSpecifically, traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) do not detect any\nanomalies in the publish/subscribe method. With the exponentially growing\nglobal communication exchange, securing DDS is of the utmost importance to\nfutureproofing industrial, public, and even personal devices and systems. This\nreport presents an experimental work on the simulation of several specific\nattacks against DDS, and the application of Deep Learning for their detection.\nThe findings show that even though Deep Learning allows to detect all simulated\nattacks using only metadata analysis, their detection level varies, with some\nof the advanced attacks being harder to detect. The limitations imposed by the\nattempts to preserve privacy significantly decrease the detection rate. The\nreport also reviews the drawbacks and limitations of the Deep Learning approach\nand proposes a set of selected solutions and configurations, that can further\nimprove the DDS security.",

In general, the computation of the protein design\ninvolves a double loop: a loop for amino acid sequence changes and a loop for\nan exhaustive conformational search for each amino acid sequence. Herein, we\npropose a novel statistical mechanical design method using Bayesian learning,\nwhich can design lattice proteins without the exhaustive conformational search.\nWe consider a thermodynamic hypothesis of the evolution of proteins and apply\nit to the prior distribution of amino acid sequences. Furthermore, we take the\nwater effect into account in view of the grand canonical picture. As a result,\non applying the 2D lattice hydrophobic-polar (HP) model, our design method\nsuccessfully finds an amino acid sequence for which the target conformation has\na unique ground state. However, the performance was not as good for the 3D\nlattice HP models compared to the 2D models. The performance of the 3D model\nimproves on using a 20-letter lattice proteins. Furthermore, we find a strong\nlinearity between the chemical potential of water and the number of surface\nresidues, thereby revealing the relationship between protein structure and the\neffect of water molecules. The advantage of our method is that it greatly\nreduces computation time, because it does not require long calculations for the\npartition function corresponding to an exhaustive conformational search.

Its prediction performance has been shown to be\nstrongly bounded by assortative mixing in the graph, a key property wherein\nnodes with similar attributes mix/connect with each other. We observe that real\nworld networks exhibit heterogeneous or diverse mixing patterns and the\nconventional global measurement of assortativity, such as global assortativity\ncoefficient, may not be a representative statistic in quantifying this mixing.\nWe adopt a generalized concept, node-level assortativity, one that is based at\nthe node level to better represent the diverse patterns and accurately quantify\nthe learnability of GNNs. We find that the prediction performance of a wide\nrange of GNN models is highly correlated with the node level assortativity. To\nbreak this limit, in this work, we focus on transforming the input graph into a\ncomputation graph which contains both proximity and structural information as\ndistinct type of edges.

Lifelong\nlearning (LLL), however, aims at solving multiple tasks sequentially by\nefficiently transferring and using knowledge between tasks.

Multi-agent RL (MARL), on the\nother hand, can be seen as a natural scenario for lifelong RL due to its\ninherent non-stationarity, since the agents' policies change over time. In this\nwork, we introduce a multi-agent lifelong learning testbed that supports both\nzero-shot and few-shot settings. Our setup is based on Hanabi -- a\npartially-observable, fully cooperative multi-agent game that has been shown to\nbe challenging for zero-shot coordination. Its large strategy space makes it a\ndesirable environment for lifelong RL tasks. We evaluate several recent MARL\nmethods, and benchmark state-of-the-art LLL algorithms in limited memory and\ncomputation regimes to shed light on their strengths and weaknesses. This\ncontinual learning paradigm also provides us with a pragmatic way of going\nbeyond centralized training which is the most commonly used training protocol\nin MARL. We empirically show that the agents trained in our setup are able to\ncoordinate well with unseen agents, without any additional assumptions made by\nprevious works.

In this work, we are the\nfirst to systematically study the security of state-of-the-art deep learning\nbased ALC systems in their designed operational domains under physical-world\nadversarial attacks. We formulate the problem with a safety-critical attack\ngoal, and a novel and domain-specific attack vector: dirty road patches. To\nsystematically generate the attack, we adopt an optimization-based approach and\novercome domain-specific design challenges such as camera frame\ninter-dependencies due to attack-influenced vehicle control, and the lack of\nobjective function design for lane detection models.\n\nWe evaluate our attack on a production ALC using 80 scenarios from real-world\ndriving traces. The results show that our attack is highly effective with over\n97.5% success rates and less than 0.903 sec average success time, which is\nsubstantially lower than the average driver reaction time. This attack is also\nfound (1) robust to various real-world factors such as lighting conditions and\nview angles, (2) general to different model designs, and (3) stealthy from the\ndriver's view. To understand the safety impacts, we conduct experiments using\nsoftware-in-the-loop simulation and attack trace injection in a real vehicle.\nThe results show that our attack can cause a 100% collision rate in different\nscenarios, including when tested with common safety features such as automatic\nemergency braking.

          "description": "Studies on manufacturing cost prediction based on deep learning have begun in\nrecent years, but the cost prediction rationale cannot be explained because the\nmodels are still used as a black box. This study aims to propose a\nmanufacturing cost prediction process for 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models\nusing explainable artificial intelligence. The proposed process can visualize\nthe machining features of the 3D CAD model that are influencing the increase in\nmanufacturing costs. The proposed process consists of (1) data collection and\npre-processing, (2) 3D deep learning architecture exploration, and (3)\nvisualization to explain the prediction results. The proposed deep learning\nmodel shows high predictability of manufacturing cost for the computer\nnumerical control (CNC) machined parts. In particular, using 3D\ngradient-weighted class activation mapping proves that the proposed model not\nonly can detect the CNC machining features but also can differentiate the\nmachining difficulty for the same feature. Using the proposed process, we can\nprovide a design guidance to engineering designers in reducing manufacturing\ncosts during the conceptual design phase. We can also provide real-time\nquotations and redesign proposals to online manufacturing platform customers.",

          "description": "In biological learning, data are used to improve performance not only on the\ncurrent task, but also on previously encountered and as yet unencountered\ntasks. In contrast, classical machine learning starts from a blank slate, or\ntabula rasa, using data only for the single task at hand. While typical\ntransfer learning algorithms can improve performance on future tasks, their\nperformance on prior tasks degrades upon learning new tasks (called\ncatastrophic forgetting). Many recent approaches for continual or lifelong\nlearning have attempted to maintain performance given new tasks. But striving\nto avoid forgetting sets the goal unnecessarily low: the goal of lifelong\nlearning, whether biological or artificial, should be to improve performance on\nall tasks (including past and future) with any new data. We propose\nomnidirectional transfer learning algorithms, which includes two special cases\nof interest: decision forests and deep networks. Our key insight is the\ndevelopment of the omni-voter layer, which ensembles representations learned\nindependently on all tasks to jointly decide how to proceed on any given new\ndata point, thereby improving performance on both past and future tasks.

In particular, 5G networks need to\nsupport three typical usage scenarios, namely, enhanced mobile broadband\n(eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and massive\nmachine-type communications (mMTC). On the one hand, UAVs can be leveraged as\ncost-effective aerial platforms to provide ground users with enhanced\ncommunication services by exploiting their high cruising altitude and\ncontrollable maneuverability in three-dimensional (3D) space. On the other\nhand, providing such communication services simultaneously for both UAV and\nground users poses new challenges due to the need for ubiquitous 3D signal\ncoverage as well as the strong air-ground network interference. Besides the\nrequirement of high-performance wireless communications, the ability to support\neffective and efficient sensing as well as network intelligence is also\nessential for 5G-and-beyond 3D heterogeneous wireless networks with coexisting\naerial and ground users.

          "description": "Recent research in adversarially robust classifiers suggests their\nrepresentations tend to be aligned with human perception, which makes them\nattractive for image synthesis and restoration applications. Despite favorable\nempirical results on a few downstream tasks, their advantages are limited to\nslow and sensitive optimization-based techniques. Moreover, their use on\ngenerative models remains unexplored. This work proposes the use of robust\nrepresentations as a perceptual primitive for feature inversion models, and\nshow its benefits with respect to standard non-robust image features. We\nempirically show that adopting robust representations as an image prior\nsignificantly improves the reconstruction accuracy of CNN-based feature\ninversion models. Furthermore, it allows reconstructing images at multiple\nscales out-of-the-box. Following these findings, we propose an\nencoding-decoding network based on robust representations and show its\nadvantages for applications such as anomaly detection, style transfer and image\ndenoising.",

          "description": "The high computation, memory, and power budgets of inferring convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) are major bottlenecks of model deployment to edge\ncomputing platforms, e.g., mobile devices and IoT. Moreover, training CNNs is\ntime and energy-intensive even on high-grade servers. Convolution layers and\nfully connected layers, because of their intense use of multiplications, are\nthe dominant contributor to this computation budget.\n\nWe propose to alleviate this problem by introducing two new operations:\nconvolutional shifts and fully-connected shifts which replace multiplications\nwith bitwise shift and sign flipping during both training and inference. During\ninference, both approaches require only 5 bits (or less) to represent the\nweights. This family of neural network architectures (that use convolutional\nshifts and fully connected shifts) is referred to as DeepShift models. We\npropose two methods to train DeepShift models: DeepShift-Q which trains regular\nweights constrained to powers of 2, and DeepShift-PS that trains the values of\nthe shifts and sign flips directly.\n\nVery close accuracy, and in some cases higher accuracy, to baselines are\nachieved. Converting pre-trained 32-bit floating-point baseline models of\nResNet18, ResNet50, VGG16, and GoogleNet to DeepShift and training them for 15\nto 30 epochs, resulted in Top-1/Top-5 accuracies higher than that of the\noriginal model.\n\nLast but not least, we implemented the convolutional shifts and fully\nconnected shift GPU kernels and showed a reduction in latency time of 25% when\ninferring ResNet18 compared to unoptimized multiplication-based GPU kernels.\nThe code can be found at https://github.com/mostafaelhoushi/DeepShift.",

In recent years, although the deep convolutional network brings\npowerful visual modeling capabilities to the ZSL task, its visual features have\nsevere pattern inertia and lack of representation of semantic relationships,\nwhich leads to severe bias and ambiguity. In response to this, we propose the\nGraph-based Visual-Semantic Entanglement Network to conduct graph modeling of\nvisual features, which is mapped to semantic attributes by using a knowledge\ngraph, it contains several novel designs: 1. it establishes a multi-path\nentangled network with the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the graph\nconvolutional network (GCN), which input the visual features from CNN to GCN to\nmodel the implicit semantic relations, then GCN feedback the graph modeled\ninformation to CNN features; 2. it uses attribute word vectors as the target\nfor the graph semantic modeling of GCN, which forms a self-consistent\nregression for graph modeling and supervise GCN to learn more personalized\nattribute relations; 3. it fuses and supplements the hierarchical\nvisual-semantic features refined by graph modeling into visual embedding.

We can infer the posterior of exogenous variables,\nintervene on observations, and draw samples from the resultant SCM to obtain\ncounterfactuals. We evaluate on multiple, large, real-world medical datasets to\nobserve that this method leads to better cross-domain generalization compared\nto state-of-the-art algorithms.

To address this challenge, we\npropose TRIM (TRansformation IMportance), a novel approach which attributes\nimportances to features in a transformed space and can be applied post-hoc to a\nfully trained model.

          "description": "Labelled data often comes at a high cost as it may require recruiting human\nlabelers or running costly experiments. At the same time, in many practical\nscenarios, one already has access to a partially labelled, potentially biased\ndataset that can help with the learning task at hand. Motivated by such\nsettings, we formally initiate a study of $semi-supervised$ $active$ $learning$\nthrough the frame of linear regression. In this setting, the learner has access\nto a dataset $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(n_1+n_2) \\times d}$ which is composed of $n_1$\nunlabelled examples that an algorithm can actively query, and $n_2$ examples\nlabelled a-priori. Concretely, denoting the true labels by $Y \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^{n_1 + n_2}$, the learner's objective is to find $\\widehat{\\beta}\n\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ such that, \\begin{equation}\n\n\\| X \\widehat{\\beta} - Y \\|_2^2 \\le (1 + \\epsilon) \\min_{\\beta \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d} \\| X \\beta - Y \\|_2^2 \\end{equation} while making as few\nadditional label queries as possible. In order to bound the label queries, we\nintroduce an instance dependent parameter called the reduced rank, denoted by\n$R_X$, and propose an efficient algorithm with query complexity\n$O(R_X/\\epsilon)$. This result directly implies improved upper bounds for two\nimportant special cases: (i) active ridge regression, and (ii) active kernel\nridge regression, where the reduced-rank equates to the statistical dimension,\n$sd_\\lambda$ and effective dimension, $d_\\lambda$ of the problem respectively,\nwhere $\\lambda \\ge 0$ denotes the regularization parameter. For active ridge\nregression we also prove a matching lower bound of $O(sd_\\lambda / \\epsilon)$\non the query complexity of any algorithm.

This adversarial loss guarantees the map is diverse -- a very wide\nrange of anime can be produced from a single content code. Under plausible\nassumptions, the map is not just diverse, but also correctly represents the\nprobability of an anime, conditioned on an input face.

          "description": "We study the applicability of tools developed by the computer vision\ncommunity for features learning and semantic image inpainting to perform data\nreconstruction of fluid turbulence configurations. The aim is twofold. First,\nwe explore on a quantitative basis, the capability of Convolutional Neural\nNetworks embedded in a Deep Generative Adversarial Model (Deep-GAN) to generate\nmissing data in turbulence, a paradigmatic high dimensional chaotic system. In\nparticular, we investigate their use in reconstructing two-dimensional damaged\nsnapshots extracted from a large database of numerical configurations of 3d\nturbulence in the presence of rotation, a case with multi-scale random features\nwhere both large-scale organised structures and small-scale highly intermittent\nand non-Gaussian fluctuations are present. Second, following a reverse\nengineering approach, we aim to rank the input flow properties (features) in\nterms of their qualitative and quantitative importance to obtain a better set\nof reconstructed fields. We present two approaches both based on Context\nEncoders. The first one infers the missing data via a minimization of the L2\npixel-wise reconstruction loss, plus a small adversarial penalisation. The\nsecond searches for the closest encoding of the corrupted flow configuration\nfrom a previously trained generator. Finally, we present a comparison with a\ndifferent data assimilation tool, based on Nudging, an equation-informed\nunbiased protocol, well known in the numerical weather prediction community.\nThe TURB-Rot database, this http URL, of roughly 300K 2d\nturbulent images is released and details on how to download it are given.",

The proposed DAFD can transfer knowledge from the source\ndomain to the target domain by minimizing the domain discrepancy to avoid\nmismatch problems. The experimental results show that the average F1-score\nimprovement when using DAFD ranges from 1.5% to 7% in the cross-position\nscenario, and from 3.5% to 12% in the cross-configuration scenario, compared to\nusing the conventional FD model without domain adaptation training.

A major research project has been to make\nthese historical documents accessible and understandable. An increasing amount\nof research has focused on the character recognition task and the location of\ncharacters on image, yet less research has focused on how to predict the\nsequential ordering of the characters. This is because sequence in classical\nJapanese is very different from modern Japanese. Ordering characters into a\nsequence is important for making the document text easily readable and\nsearchable. Additionally, it is a necessary step for any kind of natural\nlanguage processing on the data (e.g. machine translation, language modeling,\nand word embeddings). We explore a few approaches to the task of predicting the\nsequential ordering of the characters: one using simple hand-crafted rules,\nanother using hand-crafted rules with adaptive thresholds, and another using a\ndeep recurrent sequence model trained with teacher forcing. We provide a\nquantitative and qualitative comparison of these techniques as well as their\ndistinct trade-offs. Our best-performing system has an accuracy of 98.65\\% and\nhas a perfect accuracy on 49\\% of the books in our dataset, suggesting that the\ntechnique is able to predict the order of the characters well enough for many\ntasks.",

Despite the promising\ntheory, invariance principle-based approaches fail in common classification\ntasks, where invariant (causal) features capture all the information about the\nlabel. Are these failures due to the methods failing to capture the invariance?\nOr is the invariance principle itself insufficient? To answer these questions,\nwe revisit the fundamental assumptions in linear regression tasks, where\ninvariance-based approaches were shown to provably generalize OOD. In contrast\nto the linear regression tasks, we show that for linear classification tasks we\nneed much stronger restrictions on the distribution shifts, or otherwise OOD\ngeneralization is impossible. Furthermore, even with appropriate restrictions\non distribution shifts in place, we show that the invariance principle alone is\ninsufficient. We prove that a form of the information bottleneck constraint\nalong with invariance helps address key failures when invariant features\ncapture all the information about the label and also retains the existing\nsuccess when they do not.

In practice, the technique of in-batch negative is\nused, where for each example in a batch, other batch examples' positives will\nbe taken as its negatives, avoiding encoding extra negatives. This, however,\nstill conditions each example's loss on all batch examples and requires fitting\nthe entire large batch into GPU memory. This paper introduces a gradient\ncaching technique that decouples backpropagation between contrastive loss and\nthe encoder, removing encoder backward pass data dependency along the batch\ndimension.

          "description": "A generalist robot equipped with learned skills must be able to perform many\ntasks in many different environments. However, zero-shot generalization to new\nsettings is not always possible. When the robot encounters a new environment or\nobject, it may need to finetune some of its previously learned skills to\naccommodate this change. But crucially, previously learned behaviors and models\nshould still be suitable to accelerate this relearning. In this paper, we aim\nto study how generative models of possible outcomes can allow a robot to learn\nvisual representations of affordances, so that the robot can sample potentially\npossible outcomes in new situations, and then further train its policy to\nachieve those outcomes. In effect, prior data is used to learn what kinds of\noutcomes may be possible, such that when the robot encounters an unfamiliar\nsetting, it can sample potential outcomes from its model, attempt to reach\nthem, and thereby update both its skills and its outcome model. This approach,\nvisuomotor affordance learning (VAL), can be used to train goal-conditioned\npolicies that operate on raw image inputs, and can rapidly learn to manipulate\nnew objects via our proposed affordance-directed exploration scheme. We show\nthat VAL can utilize prior data to solve real-world tasks such drawer opening,\ngrasping, and placing objects in new scenes with only five minutes of online\nexperience in the new scene.",

To investigate this gap, we decompose the\ntest risk into its bias and variance components and study their behavior as a\nfunction of adversarial training perturbation radii ($\\varepsilon$). We find\nthat the bias increases monotonically with $\\varepsilon$ and is the dominant\nterm in the risk. Meanwhile, the variance is unimodal as a function of\n$\\varepsilon$, peaking near the interpolation threshold for the training set.\nThis characteristic behavior occurs robustly across different datasets and also\nfor other robust training procedures such as randomized smoothing. It thus\nprovides a test for proposed explanations of the generalization gap. We find\nthat some existing explanations fail this test--for instance, by predicting a\nmonotonically increasing variance curve. This underscores the power of\nbias-variance decompositions in modern settings-by providing two measurements\ninstead of one, they can rule out more explanations than test accuracy alone.\nWe also show that bias and variance can provide useful guidance for scalably\nreducing the generalization gap, highlighting pre-training and unlabeled data\nas promising routes.",

          "description": "Significant development of ride-sharing services presents a plethora of\nopportunities to transform urban mobility by providing personalized and\nconvenient transportation while ensuring efficiency of large-scale ride\npooling. However, a core problem for such services is route planning for each\ndriver to fulfill the dynamically arriving requests while satisfying given\nconstraints. Current models are mostly limited to static routes with only two\nrides per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics). In this paper, we\npresent a dynamic, demand aware, and pricing-based vehicle-passenger matching\nand route planning framework that (1) dynamically generates optimal routes for\neach vehicle based on online demand, pricing associated with each ride, vehicle\ncapacities and locations. This matching algorithm starts greedily and optimizes\nover time using an insertion operation, (2) involves drivers in the\ndecision-making process by allowing them to propose a different price based on\nthe expected reward for a particular ride as well as the destination locations\nfor future rides, which is influenced by supply-and demand computed by the Deep\nQ-network, (3) allows customers to accept or reject rides based on their set of\npreferences with respect to pricing and delay windows, vehicle type and\ncarpooling preferences, and (4) based on demand prediction, our approach\nre-balances idle vehicles by dispatching them to the areas of anticipated high\ndemand using deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our framework is validated using\nthe New York City Taxi public dataset; however, we consider different vehicle\ntypes and designed customer utility functions to validate the setup and study\ndifferent settings. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach\nin real-time and large scale settings.",

          "description": "Various recent proposals increase the distinguishing power of Graph Neural\nNetworks GNNs by propagating features between $k$-tuples of vertices. The\ndistinguishing power of these \"higher-order'' GNNs is known to be bounded by\nthe $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test, yet their $\\mathcal O(n^k)$\nmemory requirements limit their applicability. Other proposals infuse GNNs with\nlocal higher-order graph structural information from the start, hereby\ninheriting the desirable $\\mathcal O(n)$ memory requirement from GNNs at the\ncost of a one-time, possibly non-linear, preprocessing step. We propose local\ngraph parameter enabled GNNs as a framework for studying the latter kind of\napproaches and precisely characterize their distinguishing power, in terms of a\nvariant of the WL test, and in terms of the graph structural properties that\nthey can take into account. Local graph parameters can be added to any GNN\narchitecture, and are cheap to compute. In terms of expressive power, our\nproposal lies in the middle of GNNs and their higher-order counterparts.\nFurther, we propose several techniques to aide in choosing the right local\ngraph parameters.

          "description": "For certain infinitely-wide neural networks, the neural tangent kernel (NTK)\ntheory fully characterizes generalization. However, for the networks used in\npractice, the empirical NTK represents only a rough first-order approximation\nof these architectures. Still, a growing body of work keeps leveraging this\napproximation to successfully analyze important deep learning phenomena and\nderive algorithms for new applications. In our work, we provide strong\nempirical evidence to determine the practical validity of such approximation by\nconducting a systematic comparison of the behaviour of different neural\nnetworks and their linear approximations on different tasks. We show that the\nlinear approximations can indeed rank the learning complexity of certain tasks\nfor neural networks, albeit with important nuances. Specifically, we discover\nthat, in contrast to what was previously observed, neural networks do not\nalways perform better than their kernel approximations, and reveal that their\nperformance gap heavily depends on architecture, number of samples and training\ntask. In fact, we show that during training, deep networks increase the\nalignment of their empirical NTK with the target task, which explains why\nlinear approximations at the end of training can better explain the dynamics of\ndeep networks. Overall, our work provides concrete examples of novel deep\nlearning phenomena which can inspire future theoretical research, as well as\nprovides a new perspective on the use of the NTK approximation in deep\nlearning.",

          "description": "While maximizing deep neural networks' (DNNs') acceleration efficiency\nrequires a joint search/design of three different yet highly coupled aspects,\nincluding the networks, bitwidths, and accelerators, the challenges associated\nwith such a joint search have not yet been fully understood and addressed. The\nkey challenges include (1) the dilemma of whether to explode the memory\nconsumption due to the huge joint space or achieve sub-optimal designs, (2) the\ndiscrete nature of the accelerator design space that is coupled yet different\nfrom that of the networks and bitwidths, and (3) the chicken and egg problem\nassociated with network-accelerator co-search, i.e., co-search requires\noperation-wise hardware cost, which is lacking during search as the optimal\naccelerator depending on the whole network is still unknown during search. To\ntackle these daunting challenges towards optimal and fast development of DNN\naccelerators, we propose a framework dubbed Auto-NBA to enable jointly\nsearching for the Networks, Bitwidths, and Accelerators, by efficiently\nlocalizing the optimal design within the huge joint design space for each\ntarget dataset and acceleration specification. Our Auto-NBA integrates a\nheterogeneous sampling strategy to achieve unbiased search with constant memory\nconsumption, and a novel joint-search pipeline equipped with a generic\ndifferentiable accelerator search engine. Extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies validate that both Auto-NBA generated networks and accelerators\nconsistently outperform state-of-the-art designs (including\nco-search/exploration techniques, hardware-aware NAS methods, and DNN\naccelerators), in terms of search time, task accuracy, and accelerator\nefficiency.

          "description": "Certifiable local robustness, which rigorously precludes small-norm\nadversarial examples, has received significant attention as a means of\naddressing security concerns in deep learning. However, for some classification\nproblems, local robustness is not a natural objective, even in the presence of\nadversaries; for example, if an image contains two classes of subjects, the\ncorrect label for the image may be considered arbitrary between the two, and\nthus enforcing strict separation between them is unnecessary. In this work, we\nintroduce two relaxed safety properties for classifiers that address this\nobservation: (1) relaxed top-k robustness, which serves as the analogue of\ntop-k accuracy; and (2) affinity robustness, which specifies which sets of\nlabels must be separated by a robustness margin, and which can be\n$\\epsilon$-close in $\\ell_p$ space. We show how to construct models that can be\nefficiently certified against each relaxed robustness property, and trained\nwith very little overhead relative to standard gradient descent. Finally, we\ndemonstrate experimentally that these relaxed variants of robustness are\nwell-suited to several significant classification problems, leading to lower\nrejection rates and higher certified accuracies than can be obtained when\ncertifying \"standard\" local robustness.",

This paper presents a new robust GP regression\nalgorithm that iteratively trims the most extreme data points. While the new\nalgorithm retains the attractive properties of the standard GP as a\nnonparametric and flexible regression method, it can greatly improve the model\naccuracy for contaminated data even in the presence of extreme or abundant\noutliers. It is also easier to implement compared with previous robust GP\nvariants that rely on approximate inference. Applied to a wide range of\nexperiments with different contamination levels, the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms the standard GP and the popular robust GP variant\nwith the Student-t likelihood in most test cases.

How polyubiquitylated substrate interactions regulate\nproteasome activity is not understood. Here we introduce a deep manifold\nlearning framework, named AlphaCryo4D, which enables atomic-level cryogenic\nelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions of nonequilibrium conformational\ncontinuum and reconstitutes hidden dynamics of proteasome autoregulation in the\nact of substrate degradation. AlphaCryo4D integrates 3D deep residual learning\nwith manifold embedding of free-energy landscapes, which directs 3D clustering\nvia an energy-based particle-voting algorithm. In blind assessments using\nsimulated heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets, AlphaCryo4D achieved 3D\nclassification accuracy three times that of conventional method and\nreconstructed continuous conformational changes of a 130-kDa protein at\nsub-3-angstrom resolution. By using AlphaCryo4D to analyze a single\nexperimental cryo-EM dataset, we identified 64 conformers of the\nsubstrate-bound human 26S proteasome, revealing conformational entanglement of\ntwo regulatory particles in the doubly capped holoenzymes and their energetic\ndifferences with singly capped ones. Novel ubiquitin-binding sites are\ndiscovered on the RPN2, RPN10 and Alpha5 subunits to remodel polyubiquitin\nchains for deubiquitylation and recycle. Importantly, AlphaCryo4D choreographs\nsingle-nucleotide-exchange dynamics of proteasomal AAA-ATPase motor during\ntranslocation initiation, which upregulates proteolytic activity by\nallosterically promoting nucleophilic attack.

          "description": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown impressive performance in\ncomputer vision, natural language processing, and many other applications, but\nthey exhibit high computations and substantial memory requirements. To address\nthese limitations, especially in resource-constrained devices, the use of cloud\ncomputing for CNNs is becoming more popular. This comes with privacy and\nlatency concerns that have motivated the designers to develop embedded hardware\naccelerators for CNNs. However, designing a specialized accelerator increases\nthe time-to-market and cost of production. Therefore, to reduce the\ntime-to-market and access to state-of-the-art techniques, CNN hardware mapping\nand deployment on embedded accelerators are often outsourced to untrusted third\nparties, which is going to be more prevalent in futuristic artificial\nintelligence of things (AIoT) systems. These AIoT systems anticipate horizontal\ncollaboration among different resource-constrained AIoT node devices, where CNN\nlayers are partitioned and these devices collaboratively compute complex CNN\ntasks Therefore, there is a dire need to explore this attack surface for\ndesigning secure embedded hardware accelerators for CNNs. Towards this goal, in\nthis paper, we exploited this attack surface to propose an HT-based attack\ncalled FeSHI. This attack exploits the statistical distribution i.e., Gaussian\ndistribution, of the layer-by-layer feature maps of the CNN to design two\ntriggers for stealthy HT with a very low probability of triggering. To\nillustrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack, we deployed the LeNet and\nLeNet-3D on PYNQ to classify the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, and\ntested FeSHI. The experimental results show that FeSHI utilizes up to 2% extra\nLUTs, and the overall resource overhead is less than 1% compared to the\noriginal designs",

The CPE is problematic in theory\nand practice and since the effect was identified many researchers have proposed\nhypotheses to explain the phenomenon. However, despite this intensive research\neffort the effect remains poorly understood. In this work we provide novel and\nnuanced evidence relevant to existing explanations for the cold posterior\neffect, disentangling three hypotheses: 1. The dataset curation hypothesis of\nAitchison (2020): we show empirically that the CPE does not arise in a real\ncurated data set but can be produced in a controlled experiment with varying\ncuration strength. 2. The data augmentation hypothesis of Izmailov et al.\n(2021) and Fortuin et al. (2021): we show empirically that data augmentation is\nsufficient but not necessary for the CPE to be present. 3. The bad prior\nhypothesis of Wenzel et al. (2020): we use a simple experiment evaluating the\nrelative importance of the prior and the likelihood, strongly linking the CPE\nto the prior. Our results demonstrate how the CPE can arise in isolation from\nsynthetic curation, data augmentation, and bad priors. Cold posteriors observed\n\"in the wild\" are therefore unlikely to arise from a single simple cause; as a\nresult, we do not expect a simple \"fix\" for cold posteriors.",

While most\nexisting works on actor-critic employ bi-level or two-timescale updates, we\nfocus on the more practical single-timescale setting, where the actor and\ncritic are updated simultaneously. Specifically, in each iteration, the critic\nupdate is obtained by applying the Bellman evaluation operator only once while\nthe actor is updated in the policy gradient direction computed using the\ncritic. Moreover, we consider two function approximation settings where both\nthe actor and critic are represented by linear or deep neural networks.

          "description": "Dynamic graphs arise in a plethora of practical scenarios such as social\nnetworks, communication networks, and financial transaction networks. Given a\ndynamic graph, it is fundamental and essential to learn a graph representation\nthat is expected not only to preserve structural proximity but also jointly\ncapture the time-evolving patterns. Recently, graph convolutional network (GCN)\nhas been widely explored and used in non-Euclidean application domains. The\nmain success of GCN, especially in handling dependencies and passing messages\nwithin nodes, lies in its approximation to Laplacian smoothing. As a matter of\nfact, this smoothing technique can not only encourage must-link node pairs to\nget closer but also push cannot-link pairs to shrink together, which\npotentially cause serious feature shrink or oversmoothing problem, especially\nwhen stacking graph convolution in multiple layers or steps. For learning\ntime-evolving patterns, a natural solution is to preserve historical state and\ncombine it with the current interactions to obtain the most recent\nrepresentation. Then the serious feature shrink or oversmoothing problem could\nhappen when stacking graph convolution explicitly or implicitly according to\ncurrent prevalent methods, which would make nodes too similar to distinguish\neach other. To solve this problem in dynamic graph embedding, we analyze the\nshrinking properties in the node embedding space at first, and then design a\nsimple yet versatile method, which exploits L2 feature normalization constraint\nto rescale all nodes to hypersphere of a unit ball so that nodes would not\nshrink together, and yet similar nodes can still get closer. Extensive\nexperiments on four real-world dynamic graph datasets compared with competitive\nbaseline models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

          "description": "Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a framework for Bayesian inference that can\noffer principled uncertainty estimates for a large range of problems. For\nexample, if we consider regression problems with Gaussian likelihoods, a GP\nmodel enjoys a posterior in closed form. However, identifying the posterior GP\nscales cubically with the number of training examples and requires to store all\nexamples in memory. In order to overcome these obstacles, sparse GPs have been\nproposed that approximate the true posterior GP with pseudo-training examples.\nImportantly, the number of pseudo-training examples is user-defined and enables\ncontrol over computational and memory complexity. In the general case, sparse\nGPs do not enjoy closed-form solutions and one has to resort to approximate\ninference. In this context, a convenient choice for approximate inference is\nvariational inference (VI), where the problem of Bayesian inference is cast as\nan optimization problem -- namely, to maximize a lower bound of the log\nmarginal likelihood. This paves the way for a powerful and versatile framework,\nwhere pseudo-training examples are treated as optimization arguments of the\napproximate posterior that are jointly identified together with hyperparameters\nof the generative model (i.e. prior and likelihood). The framework can\nnaturally handle a wide scope of supervised learning problems, ranging from\nregression with heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian likelihoods to classification\nproblems with discrete labels, but also multilabel problems. The purpose of\nthis tutorial is to provide access to the basic matter for readers without\nprior knowledge in both GPs and VI. A proper exposition to the subject enables\nalso access to more recent advances (like importance-weighted VI as well as\ninterdomain, multioutput and deep GPs) that can serve as an inspiration for new\nresearch ideas.",

In contrast, biological systems can overcome the\nabove difficulties very well. Individuals inherit an innate gene from\ncollective creatures that have evolved over hundreds of millions of years, and\ncan learn new skills through a few examples. Inspired by this, we propose a\npractical collective-individual paradigm where open-world tasks are trained in\nsequence using an evolution (expandable) network. To be specific, we\ninnovatively introduce learngene that inherits the meta-knowledge from the\ncollective model and reconstructs a new lightweight individual model for the\ntarget task, to realize the collective-individual paradigm. Particularly, we\npresent a novel criterion that can discover the learngene in the collective\nmodel, according to the gradient information. Finally, the individual model is\ntrained only with a few samples in the absence of the source data.

On the latter, we\nachieve a state-of-the-art ACR of 1.11. We release all code and models required\nto reproduce our results upon publication.",

          "description": "How can neural networks trained by contrastive learning extract features from\nthe unlabeled data? Why does contrastive learning usually need much stronger\ndata augmentations than supervised learning to ensure good representations?\nThese questions involve both the optimization and statistical aspects of deep\nlearning, but can hardly be answered by analyzing supervised learning, where\nthe target functions are the highest pursuit. Indeed, in self-supervised\nlearning, it is inevitable to relate to the optimization/generalization of\nneural networks to how they can encode the latent structures in the data, which\nwe refer to as the feature learning process.\n\nIn this work, we formally study how contrastive learning learns the feature\nrepresentations for neural networks by analyzing its feature learning process.\nWe consider the case where our data are comprised of two types of features: the\nmore semantically aligned sparse features which we want to learn from, and the\nother dense features we want to avoid. Theoretically, we prove that contrastive\nlearning using $\\mathbf{ReLU}$ networks provably learns the desired sparse\nfeatures if proper augmentations are adopted. We present an underlying\nprinciple called $\\textbf{feature decoupling}$ to explain the effects of\naugmentations, where we theoretically characterize how augmentations can reduce\nthe correlations of dense features between positive samples while keeping the\ncorrelations of sparse features intact, thereby forcing the neural networks to\nlearn from the self-supervision of sparse features.

          "description": "Chaotic systems are notoriously challenging to predict because of their\ninstability. Small errors accumulate in the simulation of each time step,\nresulting in completely different trajectories. However, the trajectories of\nmany prominent chaotic systems live in a low-dimensional subspace (attractor).\nIf the system is Markovian, the attractor is uniquely determined by the Markov\noperator that maps the evolution of infinitesimal time steps. This makes it\npossible to predict the behavior of the chaotic system by learning the Markov\noperator even if we cannot predict the exact trajectory. Recently, a new\nframework for learning resolution-invariant solution operators for PDEs was\nproposed, known as neural operators. In this work, we train a Markov neural\noperator (MNO) with only the local one-step evolution information. We then\ncompose the learned operator to obtain the global attractor and invariant\nmeasure. Such a Markov neural operator forms a discrete semigroup and we\nempirically observe that does not collapse or blow up. Experiments show neural\noperators are more accurate and stable compared to previous methods on chaotic\nsystems such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Navier-Stokes equations.",

We then use this characterization to prove refinement bounds on\nmanifold learning loss functions and construct a hierarchy of manifold learning\nalgorithms based on their invariants. We express several popular manifold\nlearning algorithms as functors at different levels of this hierarchy,\nincluding Metric Multidimensional Scaling, IsoMap, and UMAP. Next, we use\ninterleaving distance to study the stability of a broad class of manifold\nlearning algorithms. We present bounds on how closely the embeddings these\nalgorithms produce from noisy data approximate the embeddings they would learn\nfrom noiseless data. Finally, we use our framework to derive a set of novel\nmanifold learning algorithms, which we experimentally demonstrate are\ncompetitive with the state of the art.",

However, the subsequent work has failed to\nreplicate this on large-scale models and required rewinding to an early stable\nstate instead of initialization. We show that by using a training method that\nis stable with respect to linear mode connectivity, large networks can also be\nentirely rewound to initialization. Our subsequent experiments on common vision\ntasks give strong credence to the hypothesis in Evci et al.

These results imply that existing lottery tickets could not\nhave been found without the preceding dense training by iterative magnitude\npruning, raising doubts about the use of the lottery ticket hypothesis.",

          "description": "A fundamental challenge in multiagent reinforcement learning is to learn\nbeneficial behaviors in a shared environment with other simultaneously learning\nagents. In particular, each agent perceives the environment as effectively\nnon-stationary due to the changing policies of other agents. Moreover, each\nagent is itself constantly learning, leading to natural non-stationarity in the\ndistribution of experiences encountered. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmeta-multiagent policy gradient theorem that directly accounts for the\nnon-stationary policy dynamics inherent to multiagent learning settings. This\nis achieved by modeling our gradient updates to consider both an agent's own\nnon-stationary policy dynamics and the non-stationary policy dynamics of other\nagents in the environment. We show that our theoretically grounded approach\nprovides a general solution to the multiagent learning problem, which\ninherently comprises all key aspects of previous state of the art approaches on\nthis topic. We test our method on a diverse suite of multiagent benchmarks and\ndemonstrate a more efficient ability to adapt to new agents as they learn than\nbaseline methods across the full spectrum of mixed incentive, competitive, and\ncooperative domains.",

Weak supervision may leverage existing medical\ndata to classify multiple diseases and organ systems. Purpose: To design\nmulti-disease classifiers for body computed tomography (CT) scans using\nautomatically extracted labels from radiology text reports. Materials &\nMethods: This retrospective study deployed rule-based algorithms to extract\n19,255 disease labels from reports of 13,667 body CT scans of 12,092 subjects\nfor training. Using a 3D DenseVNet, three organ systems were segmented:\nlungs/pleura, liver/gallbladder, and kidneys/ureters. For each organ, a 3D\nconvolutional neural network classified normality versus four common diseases.\nTesting was performed on an additional 2,158 CT volumes relative to 2,875\nmanually derived reference labels. Results: Manual validation of the extracted\nlabels confirmed 91 to 99% accuracy. Performance using the receiver operating\ncharacteristic area under the curve (AUC) for lungs/pleura labels were as\nfollows: atelectasis 0.77 (95% CI: 0.74 to 0.81), nodule 0.65 (0.61 to 0.69),\nemphysema 0.89 (0.86 to 0.92), effusion 0.97 (0.96 to 0.98), and normal 0.89\n(0.87 to 0.91). For liver/gallbladder: stone 0.62 (0.56 to 0.67), lesion 0.73\n(0.69 to 0.77), dilation 0.87 (0.84 to 0.90), fatty 0.89 (0.86 to 0.92), and\nnormal 0.82 (0.78 to 0.85). For kidneys/ureters: stone 0.83 (0.79 to 0.87),\natrophy 0.92 (0.89 to 0.94), lesion 0.68 (0.64 to 0.72), cyst 0.70 (0.66 to\n0.73), and normal 0.79 (0.75 to 0.83).

          "description": "Trust region methods are widely applied in single-agent reinforcement\nlearning problems due to their monotonic performance-improvement guarantee at\nevery iteration. Nonetheless, when applied in multi-agent settings, the\nguarantee of trust region methods no longer holds because an agent's payoff is\nalso affected by other agents' adaptive behaviors. To tackle this problem, we\nconduct a game-theoretical analysis in the policy space, and propose a\nmulti-agent trust region learning method (MATRL), which enables trust region\noptimization for multi-agent learning. Specifically, MATRL finds a stable\nimprovement direction that is guided by the solution concept of Nash\nequilibrium at the meta-game level. We derive the monotonic improvement\nguarantee in multi-agent settings and empirically show the local convergence of\nMATRL to stable fixed points in the two-player rotational differential game. To\ntest our method, we evaluate MATRL in both discrete and continuous multiplayer\ngeneral-sum games including checker and switch grid worlds, multi-agent MuJoCo,\nand Atari games. Results suggest that MATRL significantly outperforms strong\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning baselines.",

In this paper, we propose making a\npiecewise-constant approximation to Neural ODEs to mitigate these issues. Our\nmodel can be integrated exactly via Euler integration and can generate\nautoregressive samples in 3-20 times fewer steps than comparable RNN and\nODE-RNN models.

          "description": "Responding to user data deletion requests, removing noisy examples, or\ndeleting corrupted training data are just a few reasons for wanting to delete\ninstances from a machine learning (ML) model. However, efficiently removing\nthis data from an ML model is generally difficult. In this paper, we introduce\ndata removal-enabled (DaRE) forests, a variant of random forests that enables\nthe removal of training data with minimal retraining. Model updates for each\nDaRE tree in the forest are exact, meaning that removing instances from a DaRE\nmodel yields exactly the same model as retraining from scratch on updated data.\n\nDaRE trees use randomness and caching to make data deletion efficient. The\nupper levels of DaRE trees use random nodes, which choose split attributes and\nthresholds uniformly at random. These nodes rarely require updates because they\nonly minimally depend on the data. At the lower levels, splits are chosen to\ngreedily optimize a split criterion such as Gini index or mutual information.\nDaRE trees cache statistics at each node and training data at each leaf, so\nthat only the necessary subtrees are updated as data is removed. For numerical\nattributes, greedy nodes optimize over a random subset of thresholds, so that\nthey can maintain statistics while approximating the optimal threshold. By\nadjusting the number of thresholds considered for greedy nodes, and the number\nof random nodes, DaRE trees can trade off between more accurate predictions and\nmore efficient updates.\n\nIn experiments on 13 real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset, we find\nDaRE forests delete data orders of magnitude faster than retraining from\nscratch while sacrificing little to no predictive power.",

We focus on uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) for classification problems via two avenues -- prediction\nsets using conformal prediction and calibration of probabilistic predictors by\npost-hoc binning -- since these possess distribution-free guarantees for i.i.d.\ndata. Two common ways of generalizing beyond the i.i.d. setting include\nhandling covariate and label shift. Within the context of distribution-free UQ,\nthe former has already received attention, but not the latter. It is known that\nlabel shift hurts prediction, and we first argue that it also hurts UQ, by\nshowing degradation in coverage and calibration. Piggybacking on recent\nprogress in addressing label shift (for better prediction), we examine the\nright way to achieve UQ by reweighting the aforementioned conformal and\ncalibration procedures whenever some unlabeled data from the target\ndistribution is available.

As social distancing and stay-at-home orders came\ninto effect, many turned to social media for socializing. This increase in\nsocial media usage has made it a prime vehicle for the spreading of\nmisinformation. This paper presents a mechanism to detect COVID-19\nhealth-related misinformation in social media following an interdisciplinary\napproach. Leveraging social psychology as a foundation and existing\nmisinformation frameworks, we defined misinformation themes and associated\nkeywords incorporated into the misinformation detection mechanism using applied\nmachine learning techniques. Next, using the Twitter dataset, we explored the\nperformance of the proposed methodology using multiple state-of-the-art machine\nlearning classifiers. Our method shows promising results with at most 78%\naccuracy in classifying health-related misinformation versus true information\nusing uni-gram-based NLP feature generations from tweets and the Decision Tree\nclassifier. We also provide suggestions on alternatives for countering\nmisinformation and ethical consideration for the study.",

We realize this new\ncrowdsourcing model by an end-to-end learning solution with two types of noise\nadaptation layers: one is shared across annotators to capture their commonly\nshared confusions, and the other one is pertaining to each annotator to realize\nindividual confusion. To recognize the source of noise in each annotation, we\nuse an auxiliary network to choose the two noise adaptation layers with respect\nto both instances and annotators.

          "description": "As neural networks get widespread adoption in resource-constrained embedded\ndevices, there is a growing need for low-power neural systems. Spiking Neural\nNetworks (SNNs)are emerging to be an energy-efficient alternative to the\ntraditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which are known to be\ncomputationally intensive. From an application perspective, as federated\nlearning involves multiple energy-constrained devices, there is a huge scope to\nleverage energy efficiency provided by SNNs. Despite its importance, there has\nbeen little attention on training SNNs on a large-scale distributed system like\nfederated learning. In this paper, we bring SNNs to a more realistic federated\nlearning scenario. Specifically, we propose a federated learning framework for\ndecentralized and privacy-preserving training of SNNs. To validate the proposed\nfederated learning framework, we experimentally evaluate the advantages of SNNs\non various aspects of federated learning with CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 benchmarks.\nWe observe that SNNs outperform ANNs in terms of overall accuracy by over 15%\nwhen the data is distributed across a large number of clients in the federation\nwhile providing up to5.3x energy efficiency. In addition to efficiency, we also\nanalyze the sensitivity of the proposed federated SNN framework to data\ndistribution among the clients, stragglers, and gradient noise and perform a\ncomprehensive comparison with ANNs.",

          "description": "Several Convolutional Deep Learning models have been proposed to classify the\ncognitive states utilizing several neuro-imaging domains.

The first stage is to generate the 2D\nspectral images from neural time series signals in a particular frequency band.\nImages are generated to preserve the relationship between the neighboring\nelectrodes and the spectral property of the cognitive events. The second is to\ndevelop a time-efficient, computationally less loaded, and high-performing\nmodel. We design a network containing 4 blocks and major components include\nstandard and depth-wise convolution for increasing the performance and followed\nby separable convolution to decrease the number of parameters which maintains\nthe tradeoff between time and performance. We experiment on open access EEG\nmeditation dataset comprising expert, nonexpert meditative, and control states.\nWe compare performance with six commonly used machine learning classifiers and\nfour state of the art deep learning models.

          "description": "A major focus of recent research in spoken language understanding (SLU) has\nbeen on the end-to-end approach where a single model can predict intents\ndirectly from speech inputs without intermediate transcripts. However, this\napproach presents some challenges. First, since speech can be considered as\npersonally identifiable information, in some cases only automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) transcripts are accessible. Second, intent-labeled speech\ndata is scarce. To address the first challenge, we propose a novel system that\ncan predict intents from flexible types of inputs: speech, ASR transcripts, or\nboth. We demonstrate strong performance for either modality separately, and\nwhen both speech and ASR transcripts are available, through system combination,\nwe achieve better results than using a single input modality. To address the\nsecond challenge, we leverage a semantically robust pre-trained BERT model and\nadopt a cross-modal system that co-trains text embeddings and acoustic\nembeddings in a shared latent space. We further enhance this system by\nutilizing an acoustic module pre-trained on LibriSpeech and domain-adapting the\ntext module on our target datasets.

          "description": "Despite the empirical success of neural architecture search (NAS) in deep\nlearning applications, the optimality, reproducibility and cost of NAS schemes\nremain hard to assess. In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS\n(GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting\nstability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by\nimportance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously\ndiscovered top architectures, thus increasingly focusing on important parts of\na large search space. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adversarial learning\napproach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on\nrewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search\nspace without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments\nshow that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three\npublic NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search\nconstraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve\nalready optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet\nand ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in\ntheir original search space.",

          "description": "We consider the learning and prediction of nonlinear time series generated by\na latent symplectic map. A special case is (not necessarily separable)\nHamiltonian systems, whose solution flows give such symplectic maps. For this\nspecial case, both generic approaches based on learning the vector field of the\nlatent ODE and specialized approaches based on learning the Hamiltonian that\ngenerates the vector field exist. Our method, however, is different as it does\nnot rely on the vector field nor assume its existence; instead, it directly\nlearns the symplectic evolution map in discrete time. Moreover, we do so by\nrepresenting the symplectic map via a generating function, which we approximate\nby a neural network (hence the name GFNN). This way, our approximation of the\nevolution map is always \\emph{exactly} symplectic. This additional geometric\nstructure allows the local prediction error at each step to accumulate in a\ncontrolled fashion, and we will prove, under reasonable assumptions, that the\nglobal prediction error grows at most \\emph{linearly} with long prediction\ntime, which significantly improves an otherwise exponential growth. In\naddition, as a map-based and thus purely data-driven method, GFNN avoids two\nadditional sources of inaccuracies common in vector-field based approaches,\nnamely the error in approximating the vector field by finite difference of the\ndata, and the error in numerical integration of the vector field for making\npredictions. Numerical experiments further demonstrate our claims.",

          "description": "Generative modeling has evolved to a notable field of machine learning. Deep\npolynomial neural networks (PNNs) have demonstrated impressive results in\nunsupervised image generation, where the task is to map an input vector (i.e.,\nnoise) to a synthesized image. However, the success of PNNs has not been\nreplicated in conditional generation tasks, such as super-resolution. Existing\nPNNs focus on single-variable polynomial expansions which do not fare well to\ntwo-variable inputs, i.e., the noise variable and the conditional variable. In\nthis work, we introduce a general framework, called CoPE, that enables a\npolynomial expansion of two input variables and captures their auto- and\ncross-correlations. We exhibit how CoPE can be trivially augmented to accept an\narbitrary number of input variables. CoPE is evaluated in five tasks\n(class-conditional generation, inverse problems, edges-to-image translation,\nimage-to-image translation, attribute-guided generation) involving eight\ndatasets. The thorough evaluation suggests that CoPE can be useful for tackling\ndiverse conditional generation tasks.",

          "description": "Recent works (White et al., 2020a; Yan et al., 2020) demonstrate the\nimportance of architecture encodings in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). These\nencodings encode either structure or computation information of the neural\narchitectures. Compared to structure-aware encodings, computation-aware\nencodings map architectures with similar accuracies to the same region, which\nimproves the downstream architecture search performance (Zhang et al., 2019;\nWhite et al., 2020a). In this work, we introduce a Computation-Aware\nTransformer-based Encoding method called CATE. Different from existing\ncomputation-aware encodings based on fixed transformation (e.g. path encoding),\nCATE employs a pairwise pre-training scheme to learn computation-aware\nencodings using Transformers with cross-attention. Such learned encodings\ncontain dense and contextualized computation information of neural\narchitectures. We compare CATE with eleven encodings under three major\nencoding-dependent NAS subroutines in both small and large search spaces. Our\nexperiments show that CATE is beneficial to the downstream search, especially\nin the large search space. Moreover, the outside search space experiment\ndemonstrates its superior generalization ability beyond the search space on\nwhich it was trained.

In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded method that\ncan estimate the noise transition matrix and learn a classifier simultaneously,\nwithout relying on the error-prone noisy class-posterior estimation.\nConcretely, inspired by the characteristics of the stochastic label corruption\nprocess, we propose total variation regularization, which encourages the\npredicted probabilities to be more distinguishable from each other.

In exchange economies, which are used to model\nsuch situations, agents begin with an initial endowment of resources and\nexchange them in a way that is mutually beneficial until they reach a\ncompetitive equilibrium (CE). CE allocations are Pareto efficient and fair.\nConsequently, they are used widely in designing mechanisms for fair division.\nHowever, computing CEs requires the knowledge of agent preferences which are\nunknown in several applications of interest. In this work, we explore a new\nonline learning mechanism, which, on each round, allocates resources to the\nagents and collects stochastic feedback on their experience in using that\nallocation. Its goal is to learn the agent utilities via this feedback and\nimitate the allocations at a CE in the long run. We quantify CE behavior via\ntwo losses and propose a randomized algorithm which achieves\n$\\bigOtilde(\\sqrt{T})$ loss after $T$ rounds under both criteria.

          "description": "Generative Adversarial Network, as a promising research direction in the AI\ncommunity, recently attracts considerable attention due to its ability to\ngenerating high-quality realistic data. GANs are a competing game between two\nneural networks trained in an adversarial manner to reach a Nash equilibrium.\nDespite the improvement accomplished in GANs in the last years, there remain\nseveral issues to solve. In this way, how to tackle these issues and make\nadvances leads to rising research interests. This paper reviews literature that\nleverages the game theory in GANs and addresses how game models can relieve\nspecific generative models' challenges and improve the GAN's performance. In\nparticular, we firstly review some preliminaries, including the basic GAN model\nand some game theory backgrounds. After that, we present our taxonomy to\nsummarize the state-of-the-art solutions into three significant categories:\nmodified game model, modified architecture, and modified learning method. The\nclassification is based on the modifications made in the basic model by the\nproposed approaches from the game-theoretic perspective. We further classify\neach category into several subcategories. Following the proposed taxonomy, we\nexplore the main objective of each class and review the recent work in each\ngroup. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges in this field and present\nthe potential future research topics.",

          "description": "The central objective function of a variational autoencoder (VAE) is its\nvariational lower bound. Here we show that for standard VAEs the variational\nbound converges to a value given by the sum of three entropies: the (negative)\nentropy of the latent distribution, the expected (negative) entropy of the\nobservable distribution, and the average entropy of the variational\ndistributions. Our derived analytical results are exact and apply for small as\nwell as complex neural networks for decoder and encoder. Furthermore, they\napply for finitely and infinitely many data points and at any stationary point\n(including local and global maxima). As a consequence, we show that the\nvariance parameters of encoder and decoder play the key role in determining the\nvalues of variational bounds at stationary points. Furthermore, the obtained\nresults can allow for closed-form analytical expressions at points of\nconvergence, which may be unexpected as neither variational lower bounds of\nVAEs nor log-likelihoods of VAEs are closed-form during learning. As our main\ncontribution, we provide the proofs for convergence of standard VAEs to sums of\nentropies. Furthermore, we numerically verify our analytical results and\ndiscuss some potential applications. The obtained equality to entropy sums\nprovides novel information on those points in parameter space that variational\nlearning converges to. As such, we believe, they can contribute to our\nunderstanding of established as well as novel VAE approaches.",

Perhaps surprisingly, in this work we show that\na proper way to calibrate the parameters during the conversion of ANN to SNN\ncan bring significant improvements. We introduce SNN Calibration, a cheap but\nextraordinarily effective method by leveraging the knowledge within a\npre-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Starting by analyzing the\nconversion error and its propagation through layers theoretically, we propose\nthe calibration algorithm that can correct the error layer-by-layer. The\ncalibration only takes a handful number of training data and several minutes to\nfinish. Moreover, our calibration algorithm can produce SNN with\nstate-of-the-art architecture on the large-scale ImageNet dataset, including\nMobileNet and RegNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of our algorithm. For example, our advanced pipeline can increase up\nto 69% top-1 accuracy when converting MobileNet on ImageNet compared to\nbaselines.

The PDE solver is\nformulated as a supervised learning task to solve a least-squares regression\nproblem that imposes an algebraic equation approximating a PDE (and boundary\nconditions if applicable). This algebraic equation involves a graph-Laplacian\ntype matrix obtained via DM asymptotic expansion, which is a consistent\nestimator of second-order elliptic differential operators. The resulting\nnumerical method is to solve a highly non-convex empirical risk minimization\nproblem subjected to a solution from a hypothesis space of neural-network type\nfunctions. In a well-posed elliptic PDE setting, when the hypothesis space\nconsists of feedforward neural networks with either infinite width or depth, we\nshow that the global minimizer of the empirical loss function is a consistent\nsolution in the limit of large training data. When the hypothesis space is a\ntwo-layer neural network, we show that for a sufficiently large width, the\ngradient descent method can identify a global minimizer of the empirical loss\nfunction. Supporting numerical examples demonstrate the convergence of the\nsolutions and the effectiveness of the proposed solver in avoiding numerical\nissues that hampers the traditional approach when a large data set becomes\navailable, e.g., large matrix inversion.",

First,\nwe analytically derive the gap between the training losses of FL with clients\nscheduling and a centralized training method for a given training duration.\nThen, we formulate the gap of the training loss minimization over client\nscheduling and RB allocation as a stochastic optimization problem and solve it\nusing Lyapunov optimization.

Using an extensive set of simulations, we validate the\nrobustness of the proposed method under both perfect and imperfect CSI over an\narray of diverse data distributions.

          "description": "While contrastive approaches of self-supervised learning (SSL) learn\nrepresentations by minimizing the distance between two augmented views of the\nsame data point (positive pairs) and maximizing views from different data\npoints (negative pairs), recent \\emph{non-contrastive} SSL (e.g., BYOL and\nSimSiam) show remarkable performance {\\it without} negative pairs, with an\nextra learnable predictor and a stop-gradient operation. A fundamental question\narises: why do these methods not collapse into trivial representations? We\nanswer this question via a simple theoretical study and propose a novel\napproach, DirectPred, that \\emph{directly} sets the linear predictor based on\nthe statistics of its inputs, without gradient training. On ImageNet, it\nperforms comparably with more complex two-layer non-linear predictors that\nemploy BatchNorm and outperforms a linear predictor by $2.5\\%$ in 300-epoch\ntraining (and $5\\%$ in 60-epoch). DirectPred is motivated by our theoretical\nstudy of the nonlinear learning dynamics of non-contrastive SSL in simple\nlinear networks. Our study yields conceptual insights into how non-contrastive\nSSL methods learn, how they avoid representational collapse, and how multiple\nfactors, like predictor networks, stop-gradients, exponential moving averages,\nand weight decay all come into play. Our simple theory recapitulates the\nresults of real-world ablation studies in both STL-10 and ImageNet.

          "description": "Large scale machine learning and deep models are extremely data-hungry.\nUnfortunately, obtaining large amounts of labeled data is expensive, and\ntraining state-of-the-art models (with hyperparameter tuning) requires\nsignificant computing resources and time. Secondly, real-world data is noisy\nand imbalanced. As a result, several recent papers try to make the training\nprocess more efficient and robust. However, most existing work either focuses\non robustness or efficiency, but not both. In this work, we introduce Glister,\na GeneraLIzation based data Subset selecTion for Efficient and Robust learning\nframework. We formulate Glister as a mixed discrete-continuous bi-level\noptimization problem to select a subset of the training data, which maximizes\nthe log-likelihood on a held-out validation set. Next, we propose an iterative\nonline algorithm Glister-Online, which performs data selection iteratively\nalong with the parameter updates and can be applied to any loss-based learning\nalgorithm. We then show that for a rich class of loss functions including\ncross-entropy, hinge-loss, squared-loss, and logistic-loss, the inner discrete\ndata selection is an instance of (weakly) submodular optimization, and we\nanalyze conditions for which Glister-Online reduces the validation loss and\nconverges. Finally, we propose Glister-Active, an extension to batch active\nlearning, and we empirically demonstrate the performance of Glister on a wide\nrange of tasks including, (a) data selection to reduce training time, (b)\nrobust learning under label noise and imbalance settings, and (c) batch-active\nlearning with several deep and shallow models. We show that our framework\nimproves upon state of the art both in efficiency and accuracy (in cases (a)\nand (c)) and is more efficient compared to other state-of-the-art robust\nlearning algorithms in case (b).",

          "description": "Machine learning algorithms with empirical risk minimization usually suffer\nfrom poor generalization performance due to the greedy exploitation of\ncorrelations among the training data, which are not stable under distributional\nshifts. Recently, some invariant learning methods for out-of-distribution (OOD)\ngeneralization have been proposed by leveraging multiple training environments\nto find invariant relationships. However, modern datasets are frequently\nassembled by merging data from multiple sources without explicit source labels.\nThe resultant unobserved heterogeneity renders many invariant learning methods\ninapplicable. In this paper, we propose Heterogeneous Risk Minimization (HRM)\nframework to achieve joint learning of latent heterogeneity among the data and\ninvariant relationship, which leads to stable prediction despite distributional\nshifts.

In this paper, we introduce the feasible actor-critic\n(FAC) algorithm, which is the first model-free constrained RL method that\nconsiders statewise safety, e.g, safety for each initial state. We claim that\nsome states are inherently unsafe no matter what policy we choose, while for\nother states there exist policies ensuring safety, where we say such states and\npolicies are feasible. By constructing a statewise Lagrange function available\non RL sampling and adopting an additional neural network to approximate the\nstatewise Lagrange multiplier, we manage to obtain the optimal feasible policy\nwhich ensures safety for each feasible state and the safest possible policy for\ninfeasible states. Furthermore, the trained multiplier net can indicate whether\na given state is feasible or not through the statewise complementary slackness\ncondition. We provide theoretical guarantees that FAC outperforms previous\nexpectation-based constrained RL methods in terms of both constraint\nsatisfaction and reward optimization.

          "description": "In recent years, the availability of digitized Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has\nenabled the use of deep learning-based computer vision techniques for automated\ndisease diagnosis. However, WSIs present unique computational and algorithmic\nchallenges. WSIs are gigapixel-sized ($\\sim$100K pixels), making them\ninfeasible to be used directly for training deep neural networks. Also, often\nonly slide-level labels are available for training as detailed annotations are\ntedious and can be time-consuming for experts. Approaches using\nmultiple-instance learning (MIL) frameworks have been shown to overcome these\nchallenges. Current state-of-the-art approaches divide the learning framework\ninto two decoupled parts: a convolutional neural network (CNN) for encoding the\npatches followed by an independent aggregation approach for slide-level\nprediction. In this approach, the aggregation step has no bearing on the\nrepresentations learned by the CNN encoder. We have proposed an end-to-end\nframework that clusters the patches from a WSI into ${k}$-groups, samples\n${k}'$ patches from each group for training, and uses an adaptive attention\nmechanism for slide level prediction; Cluster-to-Conquer (C2C). We have\ndemonstrated that dividing a WSI into clusters can improve the model training\nby exposing it to diverse discriminative features extracted from the patches.\nWe regularized the clustering mechanism by introducing a KL-divergence loss\nbetween the attention weights of patches in a cluster and the uniform\ndistribution. The framework is optimized end-to-end on slide-level\ncross-entropy, patch-level cross-entropy, and KL-divergence loss\n(Implementation: https://github.com/YashSharma/C2C).",

          "description": "Federated Learning (FL) trains a shared model across distributed devices\nwhile keeping the training data on the devices. Most FL schemes are\nsynchronous: they perform a synchronized aggregation of model updates from\nindividual devices. Synchronous training can be slow because of late-arriving\ndevices (stragglers). On the other hand, completely asynchronous training makes\nFL less private because of incompatibility with secure aggregation. In this\nwork, we propose a model aggregation scheme, FedBuff, that combines the best\nproperties of synchronous and asynchronous FL. Similar to synchronous FL,\nFedBuff is compatible with secure aggregation. Similar to asynchronous FL,\nFedBuff is robust to stragglers. In FedBuff, clients trains asynchronously and\nsend updates to the server. The server aggregates client updates in a private\nbuffer until updates have been received, at which point a server model update\nis immediately performed. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for\nFedBuff in a non-convex setting. Empirically, FedBuff converges up to 3.8x\nfaster than previous proposals for synchronous FL (e.g., FedAvgM), and up to\n2.5x faster than previous proposals for asynchronous FL (e.g., FedAsync).

          "description": "We address the problem of learning binary decision trees that partition data\nfor some downstream task. We propose to learn discrete parameters (i.e., for\ntree traversals and node pruning) and continuous parameters (i.e., for tree\nsplit functions and prediction functions) simultaneously using argmin\ndifferentiation. We do so by sparsely relaxing a mixed-integer program for the\ndiscrete parameters, to allow gradients to pass through the program to\ncontinuous parameters. We derive customized algorithms to efficiently compute\nthe forward and backward passes. This means that our tree learning procedure\ncan be used as an (implicit) layer in arbitrary deep networks, and can be\noptimized with arbitrary loss functions. We demonstrate that our approach\nproduces binary trees that are competitive with existing single tree and\nensemble approaches, in both supervised and unsupervised settings. Further,\napart from greedy approaches (which do not have competitive accuracies), our\nmethod is faster to train than all other tree-learning baselines we compare\nwith.

          "description": "Quantized or low-bit neural networks are attractive due to their inference\nefficiency. However, training deep neural networks with quantized activations\ninvolves minimizing a discontinuous and piecewise constant loss function. Such\na loss function has zero gradients almost everywhere (a.e.), which makes the\nconventional gradient-based algorithms inapplicable. To this end, we study a\nnovel class of \\emph{biased} first-order oracle, termed coarse gradient, for\novercoming the vanished gradient issue. A coarse gradient is generated by\nreplacing the a.e. zero derivatives of quantized (i.e., stair-case) ReLU\nactivation composited in the chain rule with some heuristic proxy derivative\ncalled straight-through estimator (STE). Although having been widely used in\ntraining quantized networks empirically, fundamental questions like when and\nwhy the ad-hoc STE trick works, still lacks theoretical understanding. In this\npaper, we propose a class of STEs with certain monotonicity, and consider their\napplications to the training of a two-linear-layer network with quantized\nactivation functions for non-linear multi-category classification. We establish\nperformance guarantees for the proposed STEs by showing that the corresponding\ncoarse gradient methods converge to the global minimum, which leads to a\nperfect classification. Lastly, we present experimental results on synthetic\ndata as well as MNIST dataset to verify our theoretical findings and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed STEs.",

          "description": "In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic gradient estimator --\nProbAbilistic Gradient Estimator (PAGE) -- for nonconvex optimization. PAGE is\neasy to implement as it is designed via a small adjustment to vanilla SGD: in\neach iteration, PAGE uses the vanilla minibatch SGD update with probability\n$p_t$ or reuses the previous gradient with a small adjustment, at a much lower\ncomputational cost, with probability $1-p_t$. We give a simple formula for the\noptimal choice of $p_t$. Moreover, we prove the first tight lower bound\n$\\Omega(n+\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\epsilon^2})$ for nonconvex finite-sum problems,\nwhich also leads to a tight lower bound $\\Omega(b+\\frac{\\sqrt{b}}{\\epsilon^2})$\nfor nonconvex online problems, where $b:= \\min\\{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\epsilon^2},\nn\\}$.

Besides, we also show that for\nnonconvex functions satisfying the Polyak-\\L{}ojasiewicz (PL) condition, PAGE\ncan automatically switch to a faster linear convergence rate $O(\\cdot\\log\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$. Finally, we conduct several deep learning experiments\n(e.g., LeNet, VGG, ResNet) on real datasets in PyTorch showing that PAGE not\nonly converges much faster than SGD in training but also achieves the higher\ntest accuracy, validating the optimal theoretical results and confirming the\npractical superiority of PAGE.",

Training on a\nprespecified subset of levels allows for testing generalization to unseen\nlevels. What can be learned from a level depends on the current policy, yet\nprior work defaults to uniform sampling of training levels independently of the\npolicy. We introduce Prioritized Level Replay (PLR), a general framework for\nselectively sampling the next training level by prioritizing those with higher\nestimated learning potential when revisited in the future. We show TD-errors\neffectively estimate a level's future learning potential and, when used to\nguide the sampling procedure, induce an emergent curriculum of increasingly\ndifficult levels. By adapting the sampling of training levels, PLR\nsignificantly improves sample efficiency and generalization on Procgen\nBenchmark--matching the previous state-of-the-art in test return--and readily\ncombines with other methods. Combined with the previous leading method, PLR\nraises the state-of-the-art to over 76% improvement in test return relative to\nstandard RL baselines.",

However,\nfixers trained on this synthetically-generated data do not extrapolate well to\nthe real distribution of bad inputs. To bridge this gap, we propose a new\ntraining approach, Break-It-Fix-It (BIFI), which has two key ideas: (i) we use\nthe critic to check a fixer's output on real bad inputs and add good (fixed)\noutputs to the training data, and (ii) we train a breaker to generate realistic\nbad code from good code. Based on these ideas, we iteratively update the\nbreaker and the fixer while using them in conjunction to generate more paired\ndata. We evaluate BIFI on two code repair datasets: GitHub-Python, a new\ndataset we introduce where the goal is to repair Python code with AST parse\nerrors; and DeepFix, where the goal is to repair C code with compiler errors.\nBIFI outperforms existing methods, obtaining 90.5% repair accuracy on\nGitHub-Python (+28.5%) and 71.7% on DeepFix (+5.6%).

We present an\nanalysis on the topological vulnerability of GNNs under GIA setting, based on\nwhich we propose the Topological Defective Graph Injection Attack (TDGIA) for\neffective injection attacks. TDGIA first introduces the topological defective\nedge selection strategy to choose the original nodes for connecting with the\ninjected ones. It then designs the smooth feature optimization objective to\ngenerate the features for the injected nodes. Extensive experiments on\nlarge-scale datasets show that TDGIA can consistently and significantly\noutperform various attack baselines in attacking dozens of defense GNN models.\nNotably, the performance drop on target GNNs resultant from TDGIA is more than\ndouble the damage brought by the best attack solution among hundreds of\nsubmissions on KDD-CUP 2020.",

          "description": "Previous works have shown that automatic speaker verification (ASV) is\nseriously vulnerable to malicious spoofing attacks, such as replay, synthetic\nspeech, and recently emerged adversarial attacks. Great efforts have been\ndedicated to defending ASV against replay and synthetic speech; however, only a\nfew approaches have been explored to deal with adversarial attacks. All the\nexisting approaches to tackle adversarial attacks for ASV require the knowledge\nfor adversarial samples generation, but it is impractical for defenders to know\nthe exact attack algorithms that are applied by the in-the-wild attackers. This\nwork is among the first to perform adversarial defense for ASV without knowing\nthe specific attack algorithms. Inspired by self-supervised learning models\n(SSLMs) that possess the merits of alleviating the superficial noise in the\ninputs and reconstructing clean samples from the interrupted ones, this work\nregards adversarial perturbations as one kind of noise and conducts adversarial\ndefense for ASV by SSLMs. Specifically, we propose to perform adversarial\ndefense from two perspectives: 1) adversarial perturbation purification and 2)\nadversarial perturbation detection. Experimental results show that our\ndetection module effectively shields the ASV by detecting adversarial samples\nwith an accuracy of around 80%. Moreover, since there is no common metric for\nevaluating the adversarial defense performance for ASV, this work also\nformalizes evaluation metrics for adversarial defense considering both\npurification and detection based approaches into account. We sincerely\nencourage future works to benchmark their approaches based on the proposed\nevaluation framework.",

          "description": "Strategic classification studies the interaction between a classification\nrule and the strategic agents it governs. Under the assumption that the\nclassifier is known, rational agents respond to it by manipulating their\nfeatures. However, in many real-life scenarios of high-stake classification\n(e.g., credit scoring), the classifier is not revealed to the agents, which\nleads agents to attempt to learn the classifier and game it too. In this paper\nwe generalize the strategic classification model to such scenarios. We define\nthe price of opacity as the difference in prediction error between opaque and\ntransparent strategy-robust classifiers, characterize it, and give a sufficient\ncondition for this price to be strictly positive, in which case transparency is\nthe recommended policy. Our experiments show how Hardt et al.'s robust\nclassifier is affected by keeping agents in the dark.",

While it is generally understood that class imbalance harms the\nperformance of supervised methods, limited research examines the impact of\nimbalance on the FSL evaluation task. Our analysis compares 10 state-of-the-art\nmeta-learning and FSL methods on different imbalance distributions and\nrebalancing techniques. Our results reveal that 1) some FSL methods display a\nnatural disposition against imbalance while most other approaches produce a\nperformance drop by up to 17\\% compared to the balanced task without the\nappropriate mitigation; 2) contrary to popular belief, many meta-learning\nalgorithms will not automatically learn to balance from exposure to imbalanced\ntraining tasks; 3) classical rebalancing strategies, such as random\noversampling, can still be very effective, leading to state-of-the-art\nperformances and should not be overlooked; 4) FSL methods are more robust\nagainst meta-dataset imbalance than imbalance at the task-level with a similar\nimbalance ratio ($\\rho<20$), with the effect holding even in long-tail datasets\nunder a larger imbalance ($\\rho=65$).",

          "description": "In lifelong learning systems, especially those based on artificial neural\nnetworks, one of the biggest obstacles is the severe inability to retain old\nknowledge as new information is encountered.

In this article, we propose a new kind of\nconnectionist architecture, the Sequential Neural Coding Network, that is\nrobust to forgetting when learning from streams of data points and, unlike\nnetworks of today, does not learn via the immensely popular back-propagation of\nerrors. Grounded in the neurocognitive theory of predictive processing, our\nmodel adapts its synapses in a biologically-plausible fashion, while another,\ncomplementary neural system rapidly learns to direct and control this\ncortex-like structure by mimicking the task-executive control functionality of\nthe basal ganglia. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our self-organizing\nsystem experiences significantly less forgetting as compared to standard neural\nmodels and outperforms a wide swath of previously proposed methods even though\nit is trained across task datasets in a stream-like fashion. The promising\nperformance of our complementary system on benchmarks, e.g., SplitMNIST, Split\nFashion MNIST, and Split NotMNIST, offers evidence that by incorporating\nmechanisms prominent in real neuronal systems, such as competition, sparse\nactivation patterns, and iterative input processing, a new possibility for\ntackling the grand challenge of lifelong machine learning opens up.",

However, despite the\npromising results, these approaches do not scale well to large data tensors. In\nthis paper, we focus on addressing the missing data imputation problem for\nlarge-scale spatiotemporal traffic data. To achieve both high accuracy and\nefficiency, we develop a scalable tensor learning model -- Low-Tubal-Rank\nSmoothing Tensor Completion (LSTC-Tubal) -- based on the existing framework of\nLow-Rank Tensor Completion, which is well-suited for spatiotemporal traffic\ndata that is characterized by multidimensional structure of location$\\times$\ntime of day $\\times$ day. In particular, the proposed LSTC-Tubal model involves\na scalable tensor nuclear norm minimization scheme by integrating linear\nunitary transformation. Therefore, tensor nuclear norm minimization can be\nsolved by singular value thresholding on the transformed matrix of each day\nwhile the day-to-day correlation can be effectively preserved by the unitary\ntransform matrix. We compare LSTC-Tubal with state-of-the-art baseline models,\nand find that LSTC-Tubal can achieve competitive accuracy with a significantly\nlower computational cost. In addition, the LSTC-Tubal will also benefit other\ntasks in modeling large-scale spatiotemporal traffic data, such as\nnetwork-level traffic forecasting.",

This design can\neffectively operate in the challenging and restricted condition of a FSFGIC\ntask for making the distance between the samples within the same class smaller\nand the distance between samples from different classes larger and for reducing\nthe coupling relationship between samples from different categories.\nFurthermore, a novel similarity measure based on the proposed non-linear data\nproject is presented for evaluating the relationships of feature information\nbetween a query image and a support set. It is worth to note that our proposed\narchitecture can be easily embedded into any episodic training mechanisms for\nend-to-end training from scratch. Extensive experiments on FSFGIC tasks\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks.",

There are $\\ell$ groups: $P_1,\\dotsc,P_{\\ell} \\subseteq P$.\nWe are also given a set $F$ of feasible centers in $\\mathcal{X}$. The goal of\nthe socially fair $k$-median problem is to find a set $C \\subseteq F$ of $k$\ncenters that minimizes the maximum average cost over all the groups. That is,\nfind $C$ that minimizes the objective function $\\Phi(C,P) \\equiv \\max_{j}\n\\sum_{x \\in P_j} d(C,x)/|P_j|$, where $d(C,x)$ is the distance of $x$ to the\nclosest center in $C$. The socially fair $k$-means problem is defined similarly\nby using squared distances, i.e., $d^{2}(.,.)$ instead of $d(.,.)$. In this\nwork, we design $(5+\\varepsilon)$ and $(33 + \\varepsilon)$ approximation\nalgorithms for the socially fair $k$-median and $k$-means problems,\nrespectively. For the parameters: $k$ and $\\ell$, the algorithms have an FPT\n(fixed parameter tractable) running time of $f(k,\\ell,\\varepsilon) \\cdot n$ for\n$f(k,\\ell,\\varepsilon) = 2^{{O}(k \\, \\ell/\\varepsilon)}$ and $n = |P \\cup F|$.\nWe also study a special case of the problem where the centers are allowed to be\nchosen from the point set $P$, i.e., $P \\subseteq F$. For this special case,\nour algorithms give better approximation guarantees of $(4+\\varepsilon)$ and\n$(18+\\varepsilon)$ for the socially fair $k$-median and $k$-means problems,\nrespectively. Furthermore, we convert these algorithms to constant pass\nlog-space streaming algorithms.

A deep neural network (DNN) with ReLU activations\nhas many gates, and the on/off status of each gate changes across input\nexamples as well as network weights. For a given input example, only a subset\nof gates are 'active', i.e., on, and the sub-network of weights connected to\nthese active gates is responsible for producing the output. At randomised\ninitialisation, the active sub-network corresponding to a given input example\nis random. During training, as the weights are learnt, the active sub-networks\nare also learnt, and potentially hold very valuable information. In this paper,\nwe analytically characterise the role of active sub-networks in deep learning.\nTo this end, we encode the on/off state of the gates of a given input in a\nnovel 'neural path feature' (NPF), and the weights of the DNN are encoded in a\nnovel 'neural path value' (NPV). Further, we show that the output of network is\nindeed the inner product of NPF and NPV. The main result of the paper shows\nthat the 'neural path kernel' associated with the NPF is a fundamental quantity\nthat characterises the information stored in the gates of a DNN. We show via\nexperiments (on MNIST and CIFAR-10) that in standard DNNs with ReLU activations\nNPFs are learnt during training and such learning is key for generalisation.\nFurthermore, NPFs and NPVs can be learnt in two separate networks and such\nlearning also generalises well in experiments.",

          "description": "Learning with feature evolution studies the scenario where the features of\nthe data streams can evolve, i.e., old features vanish and new features emerge.\nIts goal is to keep the model always performing well even when the features\nhappen to evolve. To tackle this problem, canonical methods assume that the old\nfeatures will vanish simultaneously and the new features themselves will emerge\nsimultaneously as well. They also assume there is an overlapping period where\nold and new features both exist when the feature space starts to change.\nHowever, in reality, the feature evolution could be unpredictable, which means\nthe features can vanish or emerge arbitrarily, causing the overlapping period\nincomplete. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: Prediction with\nUnpredictable Feature Evolution (PUFE) where the feature evolution is\nunpredictable. To address this problem, we fill the incomplete overlapping\nperiod and formulate it as a new matrix completion problem. We give a\ntheoretical bound on the least number of observed entries to make the\noverlapping period intact. With this intact overlapping period, we leverage an\nensemble method to take the advantage of both the old and new feature spaces\nwithout manually deciding which base models should be incorporated.

          "description": "This paper focuses on spectral graph convolutional neural networks\n(ConvNets), where filters are defined as elementwise multiplication in the\nfrequency domain of a graph. In machine learning settings where the dataset\nconsists of signals defined on many different graphs, the trained ConvNet\nshould generalize to signals on graphs unseen in the training set. It is thus\nimportant to transfer ConvNets between graphs. Transferability, which is a\ncertain type of generalization capability, can be loosely defined as follows:\nif two graphs describe the same phenomenon, then a single filter or ConvNet\nshould have similar repercussions on both graphs. This paper aims at debunking\nthe common misconception that spectral filters are not transferable. We show\nthat if two graphs discretize the same \"continuous\" space, then a spectral\nfilter or ConvNet has approximately the same repercussion on both graphs. Our\nanalysis is more permissive than the standard analysis. Transferability is\ntypically described as the robustness of the filter to small graph\nperturbations and re-indexing of the vertices. Our analysis accounts also for\nlarge graph perturbations. We prove transferability between graphs that can\nhave completely different dimensions and topologies, only requiring that both\ngraphs discretize the same underlying space in some generic sense.",

          "description": "There has been enormous progress in the last few years in designing\nconceivable (though not always practical) neural networks that respect the\ngauge symmetries -- or coordinate freedom -- of physical law. Some of these\nframeworks make use of irreducible representations, some make use of higher\norder tensor objects, and some apply symmetry-enforcing constraints. Different\nphysical laws obey different combinations of fundamental symmetries, but a\nlarge fraction (possibly all) of classical physics is equivariant to\ntranslation, rotation, reflection (parity), boost (relativity), and\npermutations. Here we show that it is simple to parameterize universally\napproximating polynomial functions that are equivariant under these symmetries,\nor under the Euclidean, Lorentz, and Poincar\\'e groups, at any dimensionality\n$d$. The key observation is that nonlinear O($d$)-equivariant (and\nrelated-group-equivariant) functions can be expressed in terms of a lightweight\ncollection of scalars -- scalar products and scalar contractions of the scalar,\nvector, and tensor inputs. These results demonstrate theoretically that\ngauge-invariant deep learning models for classical physics with good scaling\nfor large problems are feasible right now.",

          "description": "We first introduce a novel profile-based alignment algorithm, the multiple\ncontinuous Signal Alignment algorithm with Gaussian Process Regression profiles\n(SA-GPR). SA-GPR addresses the limitations of currently available signal\nalignment methods by adopting a hybrid of the particle smoothing and\nMarkov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to align signals, and by applying\nthe Gaussian process regression to construct profiles to be aligned\ncontinuously. SA-GPR shares all the strengths of the existing alignment\nalgorithms that depend on profiles but is more exact in the sense that profiles\ndo not need to be discretized as sequential bins. The uncertainty of\nperformance over the resolution of such bins is thereby eliminated. This\nmethodology produces alignments that are consistent, that regularize extreme\ncases, and that properly reflect the inherent uncertainty.\n\nThen we extend SA-GPR to a specific problem in the field of paleoceanography\nwith a method called Bayesian Inference Gaussian Process Multiproxy Alignment\nof Continuous Signals (BIGMACS). The goal of BIGMACS is to infer continuous\nages for ocean sediment cores using two classes of age proxies: proxies that\nexplicitly return calendar ages (e.g., radiocarbon) and those used to\nsynchronize ages in multiple marine records (e.g., an oxygen isotope based\nmarine proxy known as benthic ${\\delta}^{18}{\\rm O}$). BIGMACS integrates these\ntwo proxies by iteratively performing two steps: profile construction from\nbenthic ${\\delta}^{18}{\\rm O}$ age models and alignment of each core to the\nprofile also reflecting radiocarbon dates. We use BIGMACS to construct a new\nDeep Northeastern Atlantic stack (i.e., a profile from a particular benthic\n${\\delta}^{18}{\\rm O}$ records) of five ocean sediment cores. We conclude by\nconstructing multiproxy age models for two additional cores from the same\nregion by aligning them to the stack.",

          "description": "Transfer learning eases the burden of training a well-performed model from\nscratch, especially when training data is scarce and computation power is\nlimited. In deep learning, a typical strategy for transfer learning is to\nfreeze the early layers of a pre-trained model and fine-tune the rest of its\nlayers on the target domain. Previous work focuses on the accuracy of the\ntransferred model but neglects the transfer of adversarial robustness. In this\nwork, we first show that transfer learning improves the accuracy on the target\ndomain but degrades the inherited robustness of the target model. To address\nsuch a problem, we propose a novel cooperative adversarially-robust transfer\nlearning (CARTL) by pre-training the model via feature distance minimization\nand fine-tuning the pre-trained model with non-expansive fine-tuning for target\ndomain tasks. Empirical results show that CARTL improves the inherited\nrobustness by about 28% at most compared with the baseline with the same degree\nof accuracy. Furthermore, we study the relationship between the batch\nnormalization (BN) layers and the robustness in the context of transfer\nlearning, and we reveal that freezing BN layers can further boost the\nrobustness transfer.",

          "description": "Recently pre-trained multimodal models, such as CLIP, have received a surge\nof attention for their exceptional capabilities towards connecting images and\nnatural language. The textual representations in English can be desirably\ntransferred to multilingualism and support promising downstream multimodal\ntasks for different languages. Nevertheless, previous fairness discourse in\nvision-and-language learning mainly focuses on monolingual representational\nbiases, and rarely scrutinizes the principles of multilingual fairness in this\nmultimodal setting, where one language is equated to a group of individuals and\nimages provide the universal grounding for bridging different languages.\n\nIn this paper, we provide a nuanced understanding of individual fairness and\ngroup fairness by viewing language as the recipient of fairness notions. We\ndefine new fairness notions within multilingual context and analytically\narticulate that, pre-trained vision-and-language representations are\nindividually fair across languages but not guaranteed to group fairness.\nFurthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to explore the prevalent group\ndisparity across languages and protected groups including race, gender and age.",

          "description": "Adversarial attacks expose important vulnerabilities of deep learning models,\nyet little attention has been paid to settings where data arrives as a stream.\nIn this paper, we formalize the online adversarial attack problem, emphasizing\ntwo key elements found in real-world use-cases: attackers must operate under\npartial knowledge of the target model, and the decisions made by the attacker\nare irrevocable since they operate on a transient data stream. We first\nrigorously analyze a deterministic variant of the online threat model by\ndrawing parallels to the well-studied $k$-secretary problem in theoretical\ncomputer science and propose Virtual+, a simple yet practical online algorithm.\nOur main theoretical result show Virtual+ yields provably the best competitive\nratio over all single-threshold algorithms for $k<5$ -- extending previous\nanalysis of the $k$-secretary problem. We also introduce the \\textit{stochastic\n$k$-secretary} -- effectively reducing online blackbox transfer attacks to a\n$k$-secretary problem under noise -- and prove theoretical bounds on the\nperformance of \\textit{any} online algorithms adapted to this setting. Finally,\nwe complement our theoretical results by conducting experiments on both MNIST\nand CIFAR-10 with both vanilla and robust classifiers, revealing not only the\nnecessity of online algorithms in achieving near-optimal performance but also\nthe rich interplay of a given attack strategy towards online attack selection,\nenabling simple strategies like FGSM to outperform classically strong whitebox\nadversaries.",

          "description": "We give a simple proof for the global convergence of gradient descent in\ntraining deep ReLU networks with the standard square loss, and show some of its\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art. In particular, while prior works\nrequire all the hidden layers to be wide with width at least $\\Omega(N^8)$ ($N$\nbeing the number of training samples), we require a single wide layer of\nlinear, quadratic or cubic width depending on the type of initialization.\nUnlike many recent proofs based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), our proof\nneed not track the evolution of the entire NTK matrix, or more generally, any\nquantities related to the changes of activation patterns during training.\nInstead, we only need to track the evolution of the output at the last hidden\nlayer, which can be done much more easily thanks to the Lipschitz property of\nReLU. Some highlights of our setting: (i) all the layers are trained with\nstandard gradient descent, (ii) the network has standard parameterization as\nopposed to the NTK one, and (iii) the network has a single wide layer as\nopposed to having all wide hidden layers as in most of NTK-related results.",

          "description": "Stochastic simulations such as large-scale, spatiotemporal, age-structured\nepidemic models are computationally expensive at fine-grained resolution. We\npropose Interactive Neural Process (INP), an interactive framework to\ncontinuously learn a deep learning surrogate model and accelerate simulation.\nOur framework is based on the novel integration of Bayesian active learning,\nstochastic simulation and deep sequence modeling. In particular, we develop a\nnovel spatiotemporal neural process model to mimic the underlying process\ndynamics. Our model automatically infers the latent process which describes the\nintrinsic uncertainty of the simulator. This also gives rise to a new\nacquisition function that can quantify the uncertainty of deep learning\npredictions. We design Bayesian active learning algorithms to iteratively query\nthe simulator, gather more data, and continuously improve the model. We perform\ntheoretical analysis and demonstrate that our approach reduces sample\ncomplexity compared with random sampling in high dimension. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate our framework can faithfully imitate the behavior of a complex\ninfectious disease simulator with a small number of examples, enabling rapid\nsimulation and scenario exploration.",

          "description": "We introduce three new generative models for time series. Based on Euler\ndiscretization and Wasserstein metrics, they are able to capture time marginal\ndistributions and temporal dynamics. Two of these methods rely on the\nadaptation of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to time series. Both of\nthem outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks by capturing the underlying\ntemporal structure on synthetic time series. The third algorithm, called\nConditional Euler Generator (CEGEN), minimizes a dedicated distance between the\ntransition probability distributions over all time steps. In the context of Ito\nprocesses, we provide theoretical guarantees that minimizing this criterion\nimplies accurate estimations of the drift and volatility parameters. We\ndemonstrate empirically that CEGEN outperforms state-of-the-art and GAN\ngenerators on both marginal and temporal dynamics metrics. Besides, it\nidentifies accurate correlation structures in high dimension. When few data\npoints are available, we verify the effectiveness of CEGEN, when combined with\ntransfer learning methods on Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we illustrate\nthe robustness of our method on various real-world datasets.",

          "description": "Incorporating a so-called \"momentum\" dynamic in gradient descent methods is\nwidely used in neural net training as it has been broadly observed that, at\nleast empirically, it often leads to significantly faster convergence. At the\nsame time, there are very few theoretical guarantees in the literature to\nexplain this apparent acceleration effect. Even for the classical strongly\nconvex quadratic problems, several existing results only show Polyak's momentum\nhas an accelerated linear rate asymptotically. In this paper, we first revisit\nthe quadratic problems and show a non-asymptotic accelerated linear rate of\nPolyak's momentum. Then, we provably show that Polyak's momentum achieves\nacceleration for training a one-layer wide ReLU network and a deep linear\nnetwork, which are perhaps the two most popular canonical models for studying\noptimization and deep learning in the literature. Prior work Du at al. 2019 and\nWu et al. 2019 showed that using vanilla gradient descent, and with an use of\nover-parameterization, the error decays as $(1- \\Theta(\\frac{1}{ \\kappa'}))^t$\nafter $t$ iterations, where $\\kappa'$ is the condition number of a Gram Matrix.\nOur result shows that with the appropriate choice of parameters Polyak's\nmomentum has a rate of $(1-\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\kappa'}}))^t$. For the deep\nlinear network, prior work Hu et al. 2020 showed that vanilla gradient descent\nhas a rate of $(1-\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\kappa}))^t$, where $\\kappa$ is the condition\nnumber of a data matrix. Our result shows an acceleration rate $(1-\n\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}))^t$ is achievable by Polyak's momentum. All the\nresults in this work are obtained from a modular analysis, which can be of\nindependent interest. This work establishes that momentum does indeed speed up\nneural net training.",
