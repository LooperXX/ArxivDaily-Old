          "description": "We study the pre-train + fine-tune strategy for data-to-text tasks. Our\nexperiments indicate that text-to-text pre-training in the form of T5, enables\nsimple, end-to-end transformer based models to outperform pipelined neural\narchitectures tailored for data-to-text generation, as well as alternative\nlanguage model based pre-training techniques such as BERT and GPT-2.\nImportantly, T5 pre-training leads to better generalization, as evidenced by\nlarge improvements on out-of-domain test sets. We hope our work serves as a\nuseful baseline for future research, as transfer learning becomes ever more\nprevalent for data-to-text tasks.",

          "description": "Recognition and classification of Figurative Language (FL) is an open problem\nof Sentiment Analysis in the broader field of Natural Language Processing (NLP)\ndue to the contradictory meaning contained in phrases with metaphorical\ncontent. The problem itself contains three interrelated FL recognition tasks:\nsarcasm, irony and metaphor which, in the present paper, are dealt with\nadvanced Deep Learning (DL) techniques. First, we introduce a data\nprepossessing framework towards efficient data representation formats so that\nto optimize the respective inputs to the DL models. In addition, special\nfeatures are extracted in order to characterize the syntactic, expressive,\nemotional and temper content reflected in the respective social media text\nreferences. These features aim to capture aspects of the social network user's\nwriting method. Finally, features are fed to a robust, Deep Ensemble Soft\nClassifier (DESC) which is based on the combination of different DL techniques.\nUsing three different benchmark datasets (one of them containing various FL\nforms) we conclude that the DESC model achieves a very good performance, worthy\nof comparison with relevant methodologies and state-of-the-art technologies in\nthe challenging field of FL recognition.",

We aim to produce self-explanatory\nquestions that focus on main document topics and are answerable with variable\nlength passages as appropriate. We satisfy these requirements by using a\nBERT-based Pointer-Generator Network trained on the Natural Questions (NQ)\ndataset. Our model shows SOTA performance of SQ generation on the NQ dataset\n(20.1 BLEU-4). We further apply our model on out-of-domain news articles,\nevaluating with a QA system due to the lack of gold questions and demonstrate\nthat our model produces better SQs for news articles -- with further\nconfirmation via a human evaluation.",

Based on CAAT architecture and data augmentation, we build S2T and\nT2T simultaneous translation systems in this evaluation campaign.

          "description": "Topic models have been widely used to learn text representations and gain\ninsight into document corpora. To perform topic discovery, most existing neural\nmodels either take document bag-of-words (BoW) or sequence of tokens as input\nfollowed by variational inference and BoW reconstruction to learn topic-word\ndistribution. However, leveraging topic-word distribution for learning better\nfeatures during document encoding has not been explored much. To this end, we\ndevelop a framework TAN-NTM, which processes document as a sequence of tokens\nthrough a LSTM whose contextual outputs are attended in a topic-aware manner.\nWe propose a novel attention mechanism which factors in topic-word distribution\nto enable the model to attend on relevant words that convey topic related cues.\nThe output of topic attention module is then used to carry out variational\ninference. We perform extensive ablations and experiments resulting in ~9-15\npercentage improvement over score of existing SOTA topic models in NPMI\ncoherence on several benchmark datasets - 20Newsgroups, Yelp Review Polarity\nand AGNews. Further, we show that our method learns better latent\ndocument-topic features compared to existing topic models through improvement\non two downstream tasks: document classification and topic guided keyphrase\ngeneration.",

          "description": "Deep learning models for natural language processing (NLP) are inherently\ncomplex and often viewed as black box in nature. This paper develops an\napproach for interpreting convolutional neural networks for text classification\nproblems by exploiting the local-linear models inherent in ReLU-DNNs. The CNN\nmodel combines the word embedding through convolutional layers, filters them\nusing max-pooling, and optimizes using a ReLU-DNN for classification. To get an\noverall self-interpretable model, the system of local linear models from the\nReLU DNN are mapped back through the max-pool filter to the appropriate\nn-grams. Our results on experimental datasets demonstrate that our proposed\ntechnique produce parsimonious models that are self-interpretable and have\ncomparable performance with respect to a more complex CNN model.

          "description": "Data-to-Text Generation (DTG) is a subfield of Natural Language Generation\naiming at transcribing structured data in natural language descriptions. The\nfield has been recently boosted by the use of neural-based generators which\nexhibit on one side great syntactic skills without the need of hand-crafted\npipelines; on the other side, the quality of the generated text reflects the\nquality of the training data, which in realistic settings only offer\nimperfectly aligned structure-text pairs. Consequently, state-of-art neural\nmodels include misleading statements - usually called hallucinations - in their\noutputs. The control of this phenomenon is today a major challenge for DTG, and\nis the problem addressed in the paper.\n\nPrevious work deal with this issue at the instance level: using an alignment\nscore for each table-reference pair. In contrast, we propose a finer-grained\napproach, arguing that hallucinations should rather be treated at the word\nlevel. Specifically, we propose a Multi-Branch Decoder which is able to\nleverage word-level labels to learn the relevant parts of each training\ninstance. These labels are obtained following a simple and efficient scoring\nprocedure based on co-occurrence analysis and dependency parsing. Extensive\nevaluations, via automated metrics and human judgment on the standard WikiBio\nbenchmark, show the accuracy of our alignment labels and the effectiveness of\nthe proposed Multi-Branch Decoder. Our model is able to reduce and control\nhallucinations, while keeping fluency and coherence in generated texts. Further\nexperiments on a degraded version of ToTTo show that our model could be\nsuccessfully used on very noisy settings.",

          "description": "An important research direction in automatic speech recognition (ASR) has\ncentered around the development of effective methods to rerank the output\nhypotheses of an ASR system with more sophisticated language models (LMs) for\nfurther gains. A current mainstream school of thoughts for ASR N-best\nhypothesis reranking is to employ a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based LM or\nits variants, with performance superiority over the conventional n-gram LMs\nacross a range of ASR tasks. In real scenarios such as a long conversation, a\nsequence of consecutive sentences may jointly contain ample cues of\nconversation-level information such as topical coherence, lexical entrainment\nand adjacency pairs, which however remains to be underexplored. In view of\nthis, we first formulate ASR N-best reranking as a prediction problem, putting\nforward an effective cross-sentence neural LM approach that reranks the ASR\nN-best hypotheses of an upcoming sentence by taking into consideration the word\nusage in its precedent sentences. Furthermore, we also explore to extract\ntask-specific global topical information of the cross-sentence history in an\nunsupervised manner for better ASR performance.

The samples are generated from 3,539 multiple-choice questions\nwith the least amount of annotator interventions in a way similar to the\nSciTail dataset. A carefully designed multi-step process is adopted to ensure\nthe quality of the dataset. We also present the results of traditional and\nstate-of-the-art methods on FarsTail including di erent embedding methods such\nas word2vec, fastText, ELMo, BERT, and LASER, as well as di erent modeling\napproaches such as DecompAtt, ESIM, HBMP, and ULMFiT to provide a solid\nbaseline for the future research. The best obtained test accuracy is 83.38%\nwhich shows that there is a big room for improving the current methods to be\nuseful for real-world NLP applications in di erent languages. We also\ninvestigate the extent to which the models exploit super cial clues, also known\nas dataset biases, in FarsTail, and partition the test set into easy and hard\nsubsets according to the success of biased models. The dataset is available at\nhttps://github.com/dml-qom/ FarsTail.",

          "description": "Automatic evaluation metrics are a crucial component of dialog systems\nresearch. Standard language evaluation metrics are known to be ineffective for\nevaluating dialog. As such, recent research has proposed a number of novel,\ndialog-specific metrics that correlate better with human judgements. Due to the\nfast pace of research, many of these metrics have been assessed on different\ndatasets and there has as yet been no time for a systematic comparison between\nthem. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of recently\nproposed dialog evaluation metrics on a number of datasets. In this paper, 23\ndifferent automatic evaluation metrics are evaluated on 10 different datasets.\nFurthermore, the metrics are assessed in different settings, to better qualify\ntheir respective strengths and weaknesses. Metrics are assessed (1) on both the\nturn level and the dialog level, (2) for different dialog lengths, (3) for\ndifferent dialog qualities (e.g., coherence, engaging), (4) for different types\nof response generation models (i.e., generative, retrieval, simple models and\nstate-of-the-art models), (5) taking into account the similarity of different\nmetrics and (6) exploring combinations of different metrics. This comprehensive\nassessment offers several takeaways pertaining to dialog evaluation metrics in\ngeneral. It also suggests how to best assess evaluation metrics and indicates\npromising directions for future work.",

          "description": "Natural language is perhaps the most flexible and intuitive way for humans to\ncommunicate tasks to a robot. Prior work in imitation learning typically\nrequires each task be specified with a task id or goal image -- something that\nis often impractical in open-world environments. On the other hand, previous\napproaches in instruction following allow agent behavior to be guided by\nlanguage, but typically assume structure in the observations, actuators, or\nlanguage that limit their applicability to complex settings like robotics. In\nthis work, we present a method for incorporating free-form natural language\nconditioning into imitation learning. Our approach learns perception from\npixels, natural language understanding, and multitask continuous control\nend-to-end as a single neural network. Unlike prior work in imitation learning,\nour method is able to incorporate unlabeled and unstructured demonstration data\n(i.e. no task or language labels). We show this dramatically improves language\nconditioned performance, while reducing the cost of language annotation to less\nthan 1% of total data. At test time, a single language conditioned visuomotor\npolicy trained with our method can perform a wide variety of robotic\nmanipulation skills in a 3D environment, specified only with natural language\ndescriptions of each task (e.g. \"open the drawer...now pick up the block...now\npress the green button...\"). To scale up the number of instructions an agent\ncan follow, we propose combining text conditioned policies with large\npretrained neural language models. We find this allows a policy to be robust to\nmany out-of-distribution synonym instructions, without requiring new\ndemonstrations.

A growing body of research directs this goal towards augmenting the\ncreative writing abilities of human authors. In this paper, we pursue this\nobjective by analyzing how observing examples of automatically generated text\ninfluences writing. In particular, we examine a task referred to as sentence\ninfilling, which involves transforming a list of words into a complete\nsentence. We emphasize \"storiability\" as a desirable feature of the resulting\nsentences, where \"storiable\" sentences are those that suggest a story a reader\nwould be curious to hear about. Both humans and an automated system (based on a\nneural language model) performed this sentence infilling task. In one setting,\npeople wrote sentences on their own; in a different setting, people observed\nthe sentences produced by the model while writing their own sentences. Readers\nthen assigned storiability preferences to the resulting sentences in a\nsubsequent evaluation. We find that human-authored sentences were judged as\nmore storiable when authors observed the generated examples, and that\nstoriability increased as authors derived more semantic content from the\nexamples. This result gives evidence of an \"inspiration through observation\"\nparadigm for human-computer collaborative writing, through which human writing\ncan be enhanced by text generation models without directly copying their\noutput.",

Yet abbreviations\npresent particular challenges to computational approaches such as handwritten\ntext recognition and natural language processing tasks. Often, pre-processing\nultimately aims to lead from a digitised image of the source to a normalised\ntext, which includes expansion of the abbreviations. We explore different\nsetups to obtain such a normalised text, either directly, by training HTR\nengines on normalised (i.e., expanded, disabbreviated) text, or by decomposing\nthe process into discrete steps, each making use of specialist models for\nrecognition, word segmentation and normalisation. The case studies considered\nhere are drawn from the medieval Latin tradition.",

Most recent work uses direct supervision on the\ntask; we show that by simply finetuning a RoBERTa model, we can achieve a near\nperfect accuracy of 97.8%, a state-of-the-art. We argue that this outstanding\nperformance is unlikely to lead to a good model of text coherence, and suggest\nthat the Shuffle Test should be approached in a Zero-Shot setting: models\nshould be evaluated without being trained on the task itself. We evaluate\ncommon models in this setting, such as Generative and Bi-directional\nTransformers, and find that larger architectures achieve high-performance\nout-of-the-box. Finally, we suggest the k-Block Shuffle Test, a modification of\nthe original by increasing the size of blocks shuffled. Even though human\nreader performance remains high (around 95% accuracy), model performance drops\nfrom 94% to 78% as block size increases, creating a conceptually simple\nchallenge to benchmark NLP models.

The conventional\nmethod of source code generation tries to generate source code directly, which\nis impractical for creating complex software. We overcome this limitation by\ntransforming natural language into an abstract intermediate formal language\nrepresenting an application with a substantially smaller number of tokens. The\nintermediate formal representation is then compiled into target source codes.\nThis abstraction of programming details allows seq2seq networks to learn\ncomplex application structures with less overhead. In order to train sequence\nmodels, we introduce a data synthesis method grounded in a human survey. We\ndemonstrate that Text2App generalizes well to unseen combination of app\ncomponents and it is capable of handling noisy natural language instructions.\nWe explore the possibility of creating applications from highly abstract\ninstructions by coupling our system with GPT-3 -- a large pretrained language\nmodel. We perform an extensive human evaluation and identify the capabilities\nand limitations of our system.

          "description": "The syntactic structure of a sentence is often represented using syntactic\ndependency trees. The sum of the distances between syntactically related words\nhas been in the limelight for the past decades. Research on dependency\ndistances led to the formulation of the principle of dependency distance\nminimization whereby words in sentences are ordered so as to minimize that sum.\nNumerous random baselines have been defined to carry out related quantitative\nstudies on languages. The simplest random baseline is the expected value of the\nsum in unconstrained random permutations of the words in the sentence, namely\nwhen all the shufflings of the words of a sentence are allowed and equally\nlikely. Here we focus on a popular baseline: random projective permutations of\nthe words of the sentence, that is, permutations where the syntactic dependency\nstructure is projective, a formal constraint that sentences satisfy often in\nlanguages. Thus far, the expectation of the sum of dependency distances in\nrandom projective shufflings of a sentence has been estimated approximately\nwith a Monte Carlo procedure whose cost is of the order of $Zn$, where $n$ is\nthe number of words of the sentence and $Z$ is the number of samples; the\nlarger $Z$, the lower the error of the estimation but the larger the time cost.\nHere we present formulae to compute that expectation without error in time of\nthe order of $n$. Furthermore, we show that star trees maximize it, and devise\na dynamic programming algorithm to retrieve the trees that minimize it.",

Secondly, we\nexplore to use the encoder structure of Transformer to model the global context\ninterdependence features at an utterance level which can capture better long\nterm temporal characteristics. Before the pooling layer, we aggregate the\noutputs of SE-Res2Blocks and Transformer encoder to leverage the complementary\nchannel and context interdependence features learned by themself respectively.\nFinally, instead of performing a single attentive statistics pooling, we also\nfind it beneficial to extend the pooling method in a multi-head way which can\ndiscriminate features from multiple aspect. The proposed MACCIF-TDNN\narchitecture can outperform most of the state-of-the-art TDNN-based systems on\nVoxCeleb1 test sets.",

          "description": "Digital text is increasing day by day on the internet. It is very challenging\nto classify a large and heterogeneous collection of data, which require\nimproved information processing methods to organize text. To classify large\nsize of corpus, one common approach is to use hierarchical text classification,\nwhich aims to classify textual data in a hierarchical structure. Several\napproaches have been proposed to tackle classification of text but most of the\nresearch has been done on English language. This paper proposes a deep learning\nmodel for hierarchical text classification of news in Urdu language -\nconsisting of 51,325 sentences from 8 online news websites belonging to the\nfollowing genres: Sports; Technology; and Entertainment. The objectives of this\npaper are twofold: (1) to develop a large human-annotated dataset of news in\nUrdu language for hierarchical text classification; and (2) to classify Urdu\nnews hierarchically using our proposed model based on LSTM mechanism named as\nHierarchical Multi-layer LSTMs (HMLSTM). Our model consists of two modules:\nText Representing Layer, for obtaining text representation in which we use\nWord2vec embedding to transform the words to vector and Urdu Hierarchical LSTM\nLayer (UHLSTML) an end-to-end fully connected deep LSTMs network to perform\nautomatic feature learning, we train one LSTM layer for each level of the class\nhierarchy. We have performed extensive experiments on our self created dataset\nnamed as Urdu News Dataset for Hierarchical Text Classification (UNDHTC). The\nresult shows that our proposed method is very effective for hierarchical text\nclassification and it outperforms baseline methods significantly and also\nachieved good results as compare to deep neural model.",

          "description": "Android is among the most targeted platform by attackers. While attackers are\nimproving their techniques, traditional solutions based on static and dynamic\nanalysis have been also evolving. In addition to the application code, Android\napplications have some metadata that could be useful for security analysis of\napplications. Unlike traditional application distribution mechanisms, Android\napplications are distributed centrally in mobile markets. Therefore, beside\napplication packages, such markets contain app information provided by app\ndevelopers and app users. The availability of such useful textual data together\nwith the advancement in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that is used to\nprocess and understand textual data has encouraged researchers to investigate\nthe use of NLP techniques in Android security. Especially, security solutions\nbased on NLP have accelerated in the last 5 years and proven to be useful. This\nstudy reviews these proposals and aim to explore possible research directions\nfor future studies by presenting state-of-the-art in this domain. We mainly\nfocus on NLP-based solutions under four categories: description-to-behaviour\nfidelity, description generation, privacy and malware detection.",

          "description": "Entity alignment (EA) is to discover entities referring to the same object in\nthe real world from different knowledge graphs (KGs). It plays an important\nrole in automatically integrating KGs from multiple sources.\n\nExisting knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods based on Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) have achieved promising results, which enhance entity\nrepresentation with relation information unidirectionally. Besides, more and\nmore methods introduce semi-supervision to ask for more labeled training data.\n\nHowever, two challenges still exist in these methods: (1) Insufficient\ninteraction: The interaction between entities and relations is insufficiently\nutilized. (2) Low-quality bootstrapping: The generated semi-supervised data is\nof low quality.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel framework, Echo Entity Alignment (EchoEA),\nwhich leverages self-attention mechanism to spread entity information to\nrelations and echo back to entities. The relation representation is dynamically\ncomputed from entity representation. Symmetrically, the next entity\nrepresentation is dynamically calculated from relation representation, which\nshows sufficient interaction.\n\nFurthermore, we propose attribute-combined bi-directional global-filtered\nstrategy (ABGS) to improve bootstrapping, reduce false samples and generate\nhigh-quality training data.\n\nThe experimental results on three real-world cross-lingual datasets are\nstable at around 96\\% at hits@1 on average, showing that our approach not only\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, but also is universal\nand transferable for existing KGE methods.",

          "description": "The goal of Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) is to find\nanswers for natural language questions over a knowledge graph. Recent KGQA\napproaches adopt a neural machine translation (NMT) approach, where the natural\nlanguage question is translated into a structured query language. However, NMT\nsuffers from the out-of-vocabulary problem, where terms in a question may not\nhave been seen during training, impeding their translation. This issue is\nparticularly problematic for the millions of entities that large knowledge\ngraphs describe. We rather propose a KGQA approach that delegates the\nprocessing of entities to entity linking (EL) systems. NMT is then used to\ncreate a query template with placeholders that are filled by entities\nidentified in an EL phase. Slot filling is used to decide which entity fills\nwhich placeholder. Experiments for QA over Wikidata show that our approach\noutperforms pure NMT: while there remains a strong dependence on having seen\nsimilar query templates during training, errors relating to entities are\ngreatly reduced.",

          "description": "Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) is a task to\nrecognize \"who spoke what\" from multi-talker recordings. An SA-ASR system\nusually consists of multiple modules such as speech separation, speaker\ndiarization and ASR. On the other hand, considering the joint optimization, an\nend-to-end (E2E) SA-ASR model has recently been proposed with promising results\non simulation data. In this paper, we present our recent study on the\ncomparison of such modular and joint approaches towards SA-ASR on real monaural\nrecordings. We develop state-of-the-art SA-ASR systems for both modular and\njoint approaches by leveraging large-scale training data, including 75 thousand\nhours of ASR training data and the VoxCeleb corpus for speaker representation\nlearning. We also propose a new pipeline that performs the E2E SA-ASR model\nafter speaker clustering. Our evaluation on the AMI meeting corpus reveals that\nafter fine-tuning with a small real data, the joint system performs 9.2--29.4%\nbetter in accuracy compared to the best modular system while the modular system\nperforms better before such fine-tuning. We also conduct various error analyses\nto show the remaining issues for the monaural SA-ASR.",

          "description": "While self-supervised learning has made rapid advances in natural language\nprocessing, it remains unclear when researchers should engage in\nresource-intensive domain-specific pretraining (domain pretraining). The law,\npuzzlingly, has yielded few documented instances of substantial gains to domain\npretraining in spite of the fact that legal language is widely seen to be\nunique. We hypothesize that these existing results stem from the fact that\nexisting legal NLP tasks are too easy and fail to meet conditions for when\ndomain pretraining can help. To address this, we first present CaseHOLD (Case\nHoldings On Legal Decisions), a new dataset comprised of over 53,000+ multiple\nchoice questions to identify the relevant holding of a cited case. This dataset\npresents a fundamental task to lawyers and is both legally meaningful and\ndifficult from an NLP perspective (F1 of 0.4 with a BiLSTM baseline). Second,\nwe assess performance gains on CaseHOLD and existing legal NLP datasets. While\na Transformer architecture (BERT) pretrained on a general corpus (Google Books\nand Wikipedia) improves performance, domain pretraining (using corpus of\napproximately 3.5M decisions across all courts in the U.S. that is larger than\nBERT's) with a custom legal vocabulary exhibits the most substantial\nperformance gains with CaseHOLD (gain of 7.2% on F1, representing a 12%\nimprovement on BERT) and consistent performance gains across two other legal\ntasks. Third, we show that domain pretraining may be warranted when the task\nexhibits sufficient similarity to the pretraining corpus: the level of\nperformance increase in three legal tasks was directly tied to the domain\nspecificity of the task. Our findings inform when researchers should engage\nresource-intensive pretraining and show that Transformer-based architectures,\ntoo, learn embeddings suggestive of distinct legal language.",

          "description": "Neural networks have achieved success in a wide array of perceptual tasks but\noften fail at tasks involving both perception and higher-level reasoning. On\nthese more challenging tasks, bespoke approaches (such as modular symbolic\ncomponents, independent dynamics models or semantic parsers) targeted towards\nthat specific type of task have typically performed better. The downside to\nthese targeted approaches, however, is that they can be more brittle than\ngeneral-purpose neural networks, requiring significant modification or even\nredesign according to the particular task at hand. Here, we propose a more\ngeneral neural-network-based approach to dynamic visual reasoning problems that\nobtains state-of-the-art performance on three different domains, in each case\noutperforming bespoke modular approaches tailored specifically to the task. Our\nmethod relies on learned object-centric representations, self-attention and\nself-supervised dynamics learning, and all three elements together are required\nfor strong performance to emerge. The success of this combination suggests that\nthere may be no need to trade off flexibility for performance on problems\ninvolving spatio-temporal or causal-style reasoning. With the right soft biases\nand learning objectives in a neural network we may be able to attain the best\nof both worlds.",

          "description": "Since visual perception can give rich information beyond text descriptions\nfor world understanding, there has been increasing interest in leveraging\nvisual grounding for language learning. Recently, vokenization has attracted\nattention by using the predictions of a text-to-image retrieval model as labels\nfor language model supervision. Despite its success, the method suffers from\napproximation error of using finite image labels and the lack of vocabulary\ndiversity of a small image-text dataset. To overcome these limitations, we\npresent VidLanKD, a video-language knowledge distillation method for improving\nlanguage understanding. We train a multi-modal teacher model on a video-text\ndataset, and then transfer its knowledge to a student language model with a\ntext dataset. To avoid approximation error, we propose to use different\nknowledge distillation objectives. In addition, the use of a large-scale\nvideo-text dataset helps learn diverse and richer vocabularies. In our\nexperiments, VidLanKD achieves consistent improvements over text-only language\nmodels and vokenization models, on several downstream language understanding\ntasks including GLUE, SQuAD, and SWAG. We also demonstrate the improved world\nknowledge, physical reasoning, and temporal reasoning capabilities of our model\nby evaluating on the GLUE-diagnostics, PIQA, and TRACIE datasets. Lastly, we\npresent comprehensive ablation studies as well as visualizations of the learned\ntext-to-video grounding results of our teacher and student language models.

          "description": "While recent text to speech (TTS) models perform very well in synthesizing\nreading-style (e.g., audiobook) speech, it is still challenging to synthesize\nspontaneous-style speech (e.g., podcast or conversation), mainly because of two\nreasons: 1) the lack of training data for spontaneous speech; 2) the difficulty\nin modeling the filled pauses (um and uh) and diverse rhythms in spontaneous\nspeech. In this paper, we develop AdaSpeech 3, an adaptive TTS system that\nfine-tunes a well-trained reading-style TTS model for spontaneous-style speech.\nSpecifically, 1) to insert filled pauses (FP) in the text sequence\nappropriately, we introduce an FP predictor to the TTS model; 2) to model the\nvarying rhythms, we introduce a duration predictor based on mixture of experts\n(MoE), which contains three experts responsible for the generation of fast,\nmedium and slow speech respectively, and fine-tune it as well as the pitch\npredictor for rhythm adaptation; 3) to adapt to other speaker timbre, we\nfine-tune some parameters in the decoder with few speech data. To address the\nchallenge of lack of training data, we mine a spontaneous speech dataset to\nsupport our research this work and facilitate future research on spontaneous\nTTS. Experiments show that AdaSpeech 3 synthesizes speech with natural FP and\nrhythms in spontaneous styles, and achieves much better MOS and SMOS scores\nthan previous adaptive TTS systems.",

          "description": "Text-to-Speech synthesis systems are generally evaluated using Mean Opinion\nScore (MOS) tests, where listeners score samples of synthetic speech on a\nLikert scale. A major drawback of MOS tests is that they only offer a general\nmeasure of overall quality-i.e., the naturalness of an utterance-and so cannot\ntell us where exactly synthesis errors occur. This can make evaluation of the\nappropriateness of prosodic variation within utterances inconclusive. To\naddress this, we propose a novel evaluation method based on the Rapid Prosody\nTranscription paradigm. This allows listeners to mark the locations of errors\nin an utterance in real-time, providing a probabilistic representation of the\nperceptual errors that occur in the synthetic signal. We conduct experiments\nthat confirm that the fine-grained evaluation can be mapped to system rankings\nof standard MOS tests, but the error marking gives a much more comprehensive\nassessment of synthesized prosody. In particular, for standard audiobook test\nset samples, we see that error marks consistently cluster around words at major\nprosodic boundaries indicated by punctuation. However, for question-answer\nbased stimuli, where we control information structure, we see differences\nemerge in the ability of neural TTS systems to generate context-appropriate\nprosodic prominence.",

          "description": "Modelling the process that a listener actuates in deriving the words intended\nby a speaker requires setting a hypothesis on how lexical items are stored in\nmemory. This work aims at developing a system that imitates humans when\nidentifying words in running speech and, in this way, provide a framework to\nbetter understand human speech processing. We build a speech recognizer for\nItalian based on the principles of Stevens' model of Lexical Access in which\nwords are stored as hierarchical arrangements of distinctive features (Stevens,\nK. N. (2002). \"Toward a model for lexical access based on acoustic landmarks\nand distinctive features,\" J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 111(4):1872-1891). Over the\npast few decades, the Speech Communication Group at the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology (MIT) developed a speech recognition system for English based on\nthis approach. Italian will be the first language beyond English to be\nexplored; the extension to another language provides the opportunity to test\nthe hypothesis that words are represented in memory as a set of\nhierarchically-arranged distinctive features, and reveal which of the\nunderlying mechanisms may have a language-independent nature. This paper also\nintroduces a new Lexical Access corpus, the LaMIT database, created and labeled\nspecifically for this work, that will be provided freely to the speech research\ncommunity. Future developments will test the hypothesis that specific acoustic\ndiscontinuities - called landmarks - that serve as cues to features, are\nlanguage independent, while other cues may be language-dependent, with powerful\nimplications for understanding how the human brain recognizes speech.",

          "description": "Hierarchical topic models such as the gamma belief network (GBN) have\ndelivered promising results in mining multi-layer document representations and\ndiscovering interpretable topic taxonomies. However, they often assume in the\nprior that the topics at each layer are independently drawn from the Dirichlet\ndistribution, ignoring the dependencies between the topics both at the same\nlayer and across different layers. To relax this assumption, we propose\nsawtooth factorial topic embedding guided GBN, a deep generative model of\ndocuments that captures the dependencies and semantic similarities between the\ntopics in the embedding space. Specifically, both the words and topics are\nrepresented as embedding vectors of the same dimension. The topic matrix at a\nlayer is factorized into the product of a factor loading matrix and a topic\nembedding matrix, the transpose of which is set as the factor loading matrix of\nthe layer above. Repeating this particular type of factorization, which shares\ncomponents between adjacent layers, leads to a structure referred to as\nsawtooth factorization. An auto-encoding variational inference network is\nconstructed to optimize the model parameter via stochastic gradient descent.\nExperiments on big corpora show that our models outperform other neural topic\nmodels on extracting deeper interpretable topics and deriving better document\nrepresentations.",

          "description": "Human reasoning can often be understood as an interplay between two systems:\nthe intuitive and associative (\"System 1\") and the deliberative and logical\n(\"System 2\"). Neural sequence models -- which have been increasingly successful\nat performing complex, structured tasks -- exhibit the advantages and failure\nmodes of System 1: they are fast and learn patterns from data, but are often\ninconsistent and incoherent. In this work, we seek a lightweight, training-free\nmeans of improving existing System 1-like sequence models by adding System\n2-inspired logical reasoning. We explore several variations on this theme in\nwhich candidate generations from a neural sequence model are examined for\nlogical consistency by a symbolic reasoning module, which can either accept or\nreject the generations. Our approach uses neural inference to mediate between\nthe neural System 1 and the logical System 2.

          "description": "Dialog acts can be interpreted as the atomic units of a conversation, more\nfine-grained than utterances, characterized by a specific communicative\nfunction. The ability to structure a conversational transcript as a sequence of\ndialog acts -- dialog act recognition, including the segmentation -- is\ncritical for understanding dialog. We apply two pre-trained transformer models,\nXLNet and Longformer, to this task in English and achieve strong results on\nSwitchboard Dialog Act and Meeting Recorder Dialog Act corpora with dialog act\nsegmentation error rates (DSER) of 8.4% and 14.2%. To understand the key\nfactors affecting dialog act recognition, we perform a comparative analysis of\nmodels trained under different conditions. We find that the inclusion of a\nbroader conversational context helps disambiguate many dialog act classes,\nespecially those infrequent in the training data. The presence of punctuation\nin the transcripts has a massive effect on the models' performance, and a\ndetailed analysis reveals specific segmentation patterns observed in its\nabsence. Finally, we find that the label set specificity does not affect dialog\nact segmentation performance. These findings have significant practical\nimplications for spoken language understanding applications that depend heavily\non a good-quality segmentation being available.",

          "description": "Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains.\nHowever, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as\nlong documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has\nquadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence\nlength. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an\nefficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear\ncomplexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range\nattention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a\nshort-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a\ndual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two\nattention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and\nbidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains,\nincluding the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and\nImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on\nenwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being\nfaster and is able to handle 3$\\times$ as long sequences compared to its\nfull-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the\nstate-of-the-art results~(e.g., Top-1 accuracy 84.1% trained on 224$\\times$224\nImageNet-1K only), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

However, we uncover a striking contrast to this promise: across 5\nmodels and 4 datasets on the task of visual question answering, a wide variety\nof active learning approaches fail to outperform random selection. To\nunderstand this discrepancy, we profile 8 active learning methods on a\nper-example basis, and identify the problem as collective outliers -- groups of\nexamples that active learning methods prefer to acquire but models fail to\nlearn (e.g., questions that ask about text in images or require external\nknowledge). Through systematic ablation experiments and qualitative\nvisualizations, we verify that collective outliers are a general phenomenon\nresponsible for degrading pool-based active learning. Notably, we show that\nactive learning sample efficiency increases significantly as the number of\ncollective outliers in the active learning pool decreases.

A related\nprobelm concerns topical biases in the training corpus, for example, the\nprevalence of words on a specific topic in a specific genre can trick the genre\nclassifier to recognise any text on this topic in this genre. In order to\nmitigate the reliability problem, this paper investigates techniques for\nattacking genre classifiers to understand the limitations of the transformer\nmodels and to improve their performance. While simple text attacks, such as\nthose based on word replacement using keywords extracted by tf-idf, are not\ncapable of deceiving powerful models like XLM-RoBERTa, we show that\nembedding-based algorithms which can replace some of the most ``significant''\nwords with words similar to them, for example, TextFooler, have the ability to\ninfluence model predictions in a significant proportion of cases.",

          "description": "State-of-the-art music recommender systems are based on collaborative\nfiltering, which builds upon learning similarities between users and songs from\nthe available listening data. These approaches inherently face the cold-start\nproblem, as they cannot recommend novel songs with no listening history.\nContent-aware recommendation addresses this issue by incorporating content\ninformation about the songs on top of collaborative filtering. However, methods\nfalling in this category rely on a shallow user/item interaction that\noriginates from a matrix factorization framework. In this work, we introduce\nneural content-aware collaborative filtering, a unified framework which\nalleviates these limits, and extends the recently introduced neural\ncollaborative filtering to its content-aware counterpart. We propose a\ngenerative model which leverages deep learning for both extracting content\ninformation from low-level acoustic features and for modeling the interaction\nbetween users and songs embeddings. The deep content feature extractor can\neither directly predict the item embedding, or serve as a regularization prior,\nyielding two variants (strict} and relaxed) of our model. Experimental results\nshow that the proposed method reaches state-of-the-art results for a cold-start\nmusic recommendation task. We notably observe that exploiting deep neural\nnetworks for learning refined user/item interactions outperforms approaches\nusing a more simple interaction model in a content-aware framework.",

          "description": "For present e-commerce platforms, session-based recommender systems are\ndeveloped to predict users' preference for next-item recommendation. Although a\nsession can usually reflect a user's current preference, a local shift of the\nuser's intention within the session may still exist. Specifically, the\ninteractions that take place in the early positions within a session generally\nindicate the user's initial intention, while later interactions are more likely\nto represent the latest intention. Such positional information has been rarely\nconsidered in existing methods, which restricts their ability to capture the\nsignificance of interactions at different positions. To thoroughly exploit the\npositional information within a session, a theoretical framework is developed\nin this paper to provide an in-depth analysis of the positional information. We\nformally define the properties of forward-awareness and backward-awareness to\nevaluate the ability of positional encoding schemes in capturing the initial\nand the latest intention. According to our analysis, existing positional\nencoding schemes are generally forward-aware only, which can hardly represent\nthe dynamics of the intention in a session. To enhance the positional encoding\nscheme for the session-based recommendation, a dual positional encoding (DPE)\nis proposed to account for both forward-awareness and backward-awareness. Based\non DPE, we propose a novel Positional Recommender (PosRec) model with a\nwell-designed Position-aware Gated Graph Neural Network module to fully exploit\nthe positional information for session-based recommendation tasks. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets, Yoochoose and\nDiginetica and the experimental results show the superiority of the PosRec by\ncomparing it with the state-of-the-art session-based recommender models.",

          "description": "Different from the traditional recommender system, the session-based\nrecommender system introduces the concept of the session, i.e., a sequence of\ninteractions between a user and multiple items within a period, to preserve the\nuser's recent interest. The existing work on the session-based recommender\nsystem mainly relies on mining sequential patterns within individual sessions,\nwhich are not expressive enough to capture more complicated dependency\nrelationships among items. In addition, it does not consider the cross-session\ninformation due to the anonymity of the session data, where the linkage between\ndifferent sessions is prevented. In this paper, we solve these problems with\nthe graph neural networks technique. First, each session is represented as a\ngraph rather than a linear sequence structure, based on which a novel Full\nGraph Neural Network (FGNN) is proposed to learn complicated item dependency.\nTo exploit and incorporate cross-session information in the individual\nsession's representation learning, we further construct a Broadly Connected\nSession (BCS) graph to link different sessions and a novel Mask-Readout\nfunction to improve session embedding based on the BCS graph. Extensive\nexperiments have been conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets, i.e.,\nYoochoose and Diginetica, and the experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposal through comparisons with state-of-the-art\nsession-based recommender models.",

          "description": "Streaming session-based recommendation (SSR) is a challenging task that\nrequires the recommender system to do the session-based recommendation (SR) in\nthe streaming scenario. In the real-world applications of e-commerce and social\nmedia, a sequence of user-item interactions generated within a certain period\nare grouped as a session, and these sessions consecutively arrive in the form\nof streams. Most of the recent SR research has focused on the static setting\nwhere the training data is first acquired and then used to train a\nsession-based recommender model. They need several epochs of training over the\nwhole dataset, which is infeasible in the streaming setting. Besides, they can\nhardly well capture long-term user interests because of the neglect or the\nsimple usage of the user information. Although some streaming recommendation\nstrategies have been proposed recently, they are designed for streams of\nindividual interactions rather than streams of sessions. In this paper, we\npropose a Global Attributed Graph (GAG) neural network model with a Wasserstein\nreservoir for the SSR problem. On one hand, when a new session arrives, a\nsession graph with a global attribute is constructed based on the current\nsession and its associate user. Thus, the GAG can take both the global\nattribute and the current session into consideration to learn more\ncomprehensive representations of the session and the user, yielding a better\nperformance in the recommendation. On the other hand, for the adaptation to the\nstreaming session scenario, a Wasserstein reservoir is proposed to help\npreserve a representative sketch of the historical data. Extensive experiments\non two real-world datasets have been conducted to verify the superiority of the\nGAG model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Recent studies have shown that providing personalized explanations alongside\nrecommendations increases trust and perceived quality. Furthermore, it gives\nusers an opportunity to refine the recommendations by critiquing parts of the\nexplanations. On one hand, current recommender systems model the\nrecommendation, explanation, and critiquing objectives jointly, but this\ncreates an inherent trade-off between their respective performance. On the\nother hand, although recent latent linear critiquing approaches are built upon\nan existing recommender system, they suffer from computational inefficiency at\ninference due to the objective optimized at each conversation's turn. We\naddress these deficiencies with M&Ms-VAE, a novel variational autoencoder for\nrecommendation and explanation that is based on multimodal modeling\nassumptions. We train the model under a weak supervision scheme to simulate\nboth fully and partially observed variables. Then, we leverage the\ngeneralization ability of a trained M&Ms-VAE model to embed the user preference\nand the critique separately. Our work's most important innovation is our\ncritiquing module, which is built upon and trained in a self-supervised manner\nwith a simple ranking objective. Experiments on four real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that among state-of-the-art models, our system is the first to\ndominate or match the performance in terms of recommendation, explanation, and\nmulti-step critiquing. Moreover, M&Ms-VAE processes the critiques up to 25.6x\nfaster than the best baselines.

Specifically, with the weak correlation assumption over image-text pairs,\nwe propose a two-tower pre-training model called BriVL within the cross-modal\ncontrastive learning framework. Unlike OpenAI CLIP that adopts a simple\ncontrastive learning method, we devise a more advanced algorithm by adapting\nthe latest method MoCo into the cross-modal scenario. By building a large\nqueue-based dictionary, our BriVL can incorporate more negative samples in\nlimited GPU resources. We further construct a large Chinese multi-source\nimage-text dataset called RUC-CAS-WenLan for pre-training our BriVL model.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the pre-trained BriVL model outperforms\nboth UNITER and OpenAI CLIP on various downstream tasks.",

          "description": "Personalized news recommendation is an important technique to help users find\ntheir interested news information and alleviate their information overload. It\nhas been extensively studied over decades and has achieved notable success in\nimproving users' news reading experience. However, there are still many\nunsolved problems and challenges that need to be further studied. To help\nresearchers master the advances in personalized news recommendation over the\npast years, in this paper we present a comprehensive overview of personalized\nnews recommendation. Instead of following the conventional taxonomy of news\nrecommendation methods, in this paper we propose a novel perspective to\nunderstand personalized news recommendation based on its core problems and the\nassociated techniques and challenges. We first review the techniques for\ntackling each core problem in a personalized news recommender system and the\nchallenges they face. Next, we introduce the public datasets and evaluation\nmethods for personalized news recommendation. We then discuss the key points on\nimproving the responsibility of personalized news recommender systems. Finally,\nwe raise several research directions that are worth investigating in the\nfuture. This paper can provide up-to-date and comprehensive views to help\nreaders understand the personalized news recommendation field. We hope this\npaper can facilitate research on personalized news recommendation and as well\nas related fields in natural language processing and data mining.",

          "description": "Fairness is a critical system-level objective in recommender systems that has\nbeen the subject of extensive recent research. A specific form of fairness is\nsupplier exposure fairness where the objective is to ensure equitable coverage\nof items across all suppliers in recommendations provided to users. This is\nespecially important in multistakeholder recommendation scenarios where it may\nbe important to optimize utilities not just for the end-user, but also for\nother stakeholders such as item sellers or producers who desire a fair\nrepresentation of their items. This type of supplier fairness is sometimes\naccomplished by attempting to increasing aggregate diversity in order to\nmitigate popularity bias and to improve the coverage of long-tail items in\nrecommendations. In this paper, we introduce FairMatch, a general graph-based\nalgorithm that works as a post processing approach after recommendation\ngeneration to improve exposure fairness for items and suppliers. The algorithm\niteratively adds high quality items that have low visibility or items from\nsuppliers with low exposure to the users' final recommendation lists. A\ncomprehensive set of experiments on two datasets and comparison with\nstate-of-the-art baselines show that FairMatch, while significantly improves\nexposure fairness and aggregate diversity, maintains an acceptable level of\nrelevance of the recommendations.",

          "description": "Leveraging the side information associated with entities (i.e.\\ users and\nitems) to enhance the performance of recommendation systems has been widely\nrecognized as an important modelling dimension. While many existing approaches\nfocus on the \\emph{integration scheme} to incorporate entity side information\n-- by combining the recommendation loss function with an extra side\ninformation-aware loss -- in this paper, we propose instead a novel\n\\emph{pre-training scheme} for leveraging the side information. In particular,\nwe first pre-train a representation model using the side information of the\nentities, and then fine-tune it using an existing general representation-based\nrecommendation model. Specifically, we propose two pre-training models, named\n\\gcn{} and \\com{}, by considering the entities and their relations constructed\nfrom side information as two different types of graphs respectively, to\npre-train entity embeddings. For the \\gcn{} model, two single-relational graphs\nare constructed from all the users' and items' side information respectively,\nto pre-train entity representations by using the Graph Convolutional Networks.\nFor the \\com{} model, two multi-relational graphs are constructed to pre-train\nthe entity representations by using the Composition-based Graph Convolutional\nNetworks. An extensive evaluation of our pre-training models fine-tuned under\nfour general representation-based recommender models, i.e.\\ MF, NCF, NGCF and\nLightGCN, shows that effectively pre-training embeddings with both the user's\nand item's side information can significantly improve these original models in\nterms of both effectiveness and stability.",

          "description": "Session-based Recommender Systems (SRSs) have been actively developed to\nrecommend the next item of an anonymous short item sequence (i.e., session).\nUnlike sequence-aware recommender systems where the whole interaction sequence\nof each user can be used to model both the short-term interest and the general\ninterest of the user, the absence of user-dependent information in SRSs makes\nit difficult to directly derive the user's general interest from data.\nTherefore, existing SRSs have focused on how to effectively model the\ninformation about short-term interest within the sessions, but they are\ninsufficient to capture the general interest of users. To this end, we propose\na novel framework to overcome the limitation of SRSs, named ProxySR, which\nimitates the missing information in SRSs (i.e., general interest of users) by\nmodeling proxies of sessions. ProxySR selects a proxy for the input session in\nan unsupervised manner, and combines it with the encoded short-term interest of\nthe session. As a proxy is jointly learned with the short-term interest and\nselected by multiple sessions, a proxy learns to play the role of the general\ninterest of a user and ProxySR learns how to select a suitable proxy for an\ninput session. Moreover, we propose another real-world situation of SRSs where\na few users are logged-in and leave their identifiers in sessions, and a\nrevision of ProxySR for the situation. Our experiments on real-world datasets\nshow that ProxySR considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors,\nand the proxies successfully imitate the general interest of the users without\nany user-dependent information.",

With three decades of research, Bangla NLP\n(BNLP) is still lagging behind mainly due to the scarcity of resources and the\nchallenges that come with it. There is sparse work in different areas of BNLP;\nhowever, a thorough survey reporting previous work and recent advances is yet\nto be done. In this study, we first provide a review of Bangla NLP tasks,\nresources, and tools available to the research community; we benchmark datasets\ncollected from various platforms for nine NLP tasks using current\nstate-of-the-art algorithms (i.e., transformer-based models). We provide\ncomparative results for the studied NLP tasks by comparing monolingual vs.\nmultilingual models of varying sizes. We report our results using both\nindividual and consolidated datasets and provide data splits for future\nresearch. We reviewed a total of 108 papers and conducted 175 sets of\nexperiments.

          "description": "Predicting the next interaction of a short-term interaction session is a\nchallenging task in session-based recommendation. Almost all existing works\nrely on item transition patterns, and neglect the impact of user historical\nsessions while modeling user preference, which often leads to non-personalized\nrecommendation. Additionally, existing personalized session-based recommenders\ncapture user preference only based on the sessions of the current user, but\nignore the useful item-transition patterns from other user's historical\nsessions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Global\nGraph Neural Networks (HG-GNN) to exploit the item transitions over all\nsessions in a subtle manner for better inferring user preference from the\ncurrent and historical sessions. To effectively exploit the item transitions\nover all sessions from users, we propose a novel heterogeneous global graph\nthat contains item transitions of sessions, user-item interactions and global\nco-occurrence items. Moreover, to capture user preference from sessions\ncomprehensively, we propose to learn two levels of user representations from\nthe global graph via two graph augmented preference encoders. Specifically, we\ndesign a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) on the heterogeneous\nglobal graph to learn the long-term user preference and item representations\nwith rich semantics. Based on the HGNN, we propose the Current Preference\nEncoder and the Historical Preference Encoder to capture the different levels\nof user preference from the current and historical sessions, respectively. To\nachieve personalized recommendation, we integrate the representations of the\nuser current preference and historical interests to generate the final user\npreference representation. Extensive experimental results on three real-world\ndatasets show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used to learn an informative latent\nrepresentation of a user or item from observed interactions. Existing CF-based\nmethods commonly adopt negative sampling to discriminate different items. That\nis, observed user-item pairs are treated as positive instances; unobserved\npairs are considered as negative instances and are sampled under a defined\ndistribution for training. Training with negative sampling on large datasets is\ncomputationally expensive. Further, negative items should be carefully sampled\nunder the defined distribution, in order to avoid selecting an observed\npositive item in the training dataset. Unavoidably, some negative items sampled\nfrom the training dataset could be positive in the test set. Recently,\nself-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful tool to learn a model\nwithout negative samples. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised\ncollaborative filtering framework (SelfCF), that is specially designed for\nrecommender scenario with implicit feedback. The main idea of SelfCF is to\naugment the output embeddings generated by backbone networks, because it is\ninfeasible to augment raw input of user/item ids. We propose and study three\noutput perturbation techniques that can be applied to different types of\nbackbone networks including both traditional CF models and graph-based models.\nBy encapsulating two popular recommendation models into the framework, our\nexperiments on three datasets show that the best performance of our framework\nis comparable or better than the supervised counterpart. We also show that\nSelfCF can boost up the performance by up to 8.93\\% on average, compared with\nanother self-supervised framework as the baseline.

          "description": "Recommender systems rely on user behavior data like ratings and clicks to\nbuild personalization model. However, the collected data is observational\nrather than experimental, causing various biases in the data which\nsignificantly affect the learned model. Most existing work for recommendation\ndebiasing, such as the inverse propensity scoring and imputation approaches,\nfocuses on one or two specific biases, lacking the universal capacity that can\naccount for mixed or even unknown biases in the data.\n\nTowards this research gap, we first analyze the origin of biases from the\nperspective of \\textit{risk discrepancy} that represents the difference between\nthe expectation empirical risk and the true risk. Remarkably, we derive a\ngeneral learning framework that well summarizes most existing debiasing\nstrategies by specifying some parameters of the general framework. This\nprovides a valuable opportunity to develop a universal solution for debiasing,\ne.g., by learning the debiasing parameters from data. However, the training\ndata lacks important signal of how the data is biased and what the unbiased\ndata looks like. To move this idea forward, we propose \\textit{AotoDebias} that\nleverages another (small) set of uniform data to optimize the debiasing\nparameters by solving the bi-level optimization problem with meta-learning.\nThrough theoretical analyses, we derive the generalization bound for AutoDebias\nand prove its ability to acquire the appropriate debiasing strategy.

          "description": "Recent work has proposed stochastic Plackett-Luce (PL) ranking models as a\nrobust choice for optimizing relevance and fairness metrics. Unlike their\ndeterministic counterparts that require heuristic optimization algorithms, PL\nmodels are fully differentiable. Theoretically, they can be used to optimize\nranking metrics via stochastic gradient descent. However, in practice, the\ncomputation of the gradient is infeasible because it requires one to iterate\nover all possible permutations of items. Consequently, actual applications rely\non approximating the gradient via sampling techniques. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel algorithm: PL-Rank, that estimates the gradient of a PL\nranking model w.r.t. both relevance and fairness metrics. Unlike existing\napproaches that are based on policy gradients, PL-Rank makes use of the\nspecific structure of PL models and ranking metrics. Our experimental analysis\nshows that PL-Rank has a greater sample-efficiency and is computationally less\ncostly than existing policy gradients, resulting in faster convergence at\nhigher performance. PL-Rank further enables the industry to apply PL models for\nmore relevant and fairer real-world ranking systems.",

          "description": "Various non-trivial spaces are becoming popular for embedding structured data\nsuch as graphs, texts, or images. Following spherical and hyperbolic spaces,\nmore general product spaces have been proposed. However, searching for the best\nconfiguration of product space is a resource-intensive procedure, which reduces\nthe practical applicability of the idea. We generalize the concept of product\nspace and introduce an overlapping space that does not have the configuration\nsearch problem. The main idea is to allow subsets of coordinates to be shared\nbetween spaces of different types (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical). As a\nresult, parameter optimization automatically learns the optimal configuration.\nAdditionally, overlapping spaces allow for more compact representations since\ntheir geometry is more complex. Our experiments confirm that overlapping spaces\noutperform the competitors in graph embedding tasks. Here, we consider both\ndistortion setup, where the aim is to preserve distances, and ranking setup,\nwhere the relative order should be preserved. The proposed method effectively\nsolves the problem and outperforms the competitors in both settings. We also\nperform an empirical analysis in a realistic information retrieval task, where\nwe compare all spaces by incorporating them into DSSM. In this case, the\nproposed overlapping space consistently achieves nearly optimal results without\nany configuration tuning. This allows for reducing training time, which can be\nsignificant in large-scale applications.",

The sentence-level annotations comprised the few sentences\nabout the article's contribution. The phrase-level annotations were scientific\nterm and predicate phrases from the contribution sentences. Finally, the\ntriples constituted the research overview KG.

          "description": "Visually-aware recommendation on E-commerce platforms aims to leverage visual\ninformation of items to predict a user's preference. It is commonly observed\nthat user's attention to visual features does not always reflect the real\npreference. Although a user may click and view an item in light of a visual\nsatisfaction of their expectations, a real purchase does not always occur due\nto the unsatisfaction of other essential features (e.g., brand, material,\nprice). We refer to the reason for such a visually related interaction\ndeviating from the real preference as a visual bias. Existing visually-aware\nmodels make use of the visual features as a separate collaborative signal\nsimilarly to other features to directly predict the user's preference without\nconsidering a potential bias, which gives rise to a visually biased\nrecommendation. In this paper, we derive a causal graph to identify and analyze\nthe visual bias of these existing methods. In this causal graph, the visual\nfeature of an item acts as a mediator, which could introduce a spurious\nrelationship between the user and the item. To eliminate this spurious\nrelationship that misleads the prediction of the user's real preference, an\nintervention and a counterfactual inference are developed over the mediator.\nParticularly, the Total Indirect Effect is applied for a debiased prediction\nduring the testing phase of the model. This causal inference framework is model\nagnostic such that it can be integrated into the existing methods. Furthermore,\nwe propose a debiased visually-aware recommender system, denoted as CausalRec\nto effectively retain the supportive significance of the visual information and\nremove the visual bias. Extensive experiments are conducted on eight benchmark\ndatasets, which shows the state-of-the-art performance of CausalRec and the\nefficacy of debiasing.",

          "description": "Hierarchical topic models such as the gamma belief network (GBN) have\ndelivered promising results in mining multi-layer document representations and\ndiscovering interpretable topic taxonomies. However, they often assume in the\nprior that the topics at each layer are independently drawn from the Dirichlet\ndistribution, ignoring the dependencies between the topics both at the same\nlayer and across different layers. To relax this assumption, we propose\nsawtooth factorial topic embedding guided GBN, a deep generative model of\ndocuments that captures the dependencies and semantic similarities between the\ntopics in the embedding space. Specifically, both the words and topics are\nrepresented as embedding vectors of the same dimension. The topic matrix at a\nlayer is factorized into the product of a factor loading matrix and a topic\nembedding matrix, the transpose of which is set as the factor loading matrix of\nthe layer above. Repeating this particular type of factorization, which shares\ncomponents between adjacent layers, leads to a structure referred to as\nsawtooth factorization. An auto-encoding variational inference network is\nconstructed to optimize the model parameter via stochastic gradient descent.\nExperiments on big corpora show that our models outperform other neural topic\nmodels on extracting deeper interpretable topics and deriving better document\nrepresentations.",

          "description": "Long-range and short-range temporal modeling are two complementary and\ncrucial aspects of video recognition. Most of the state-of-the-arts focus on\nshort-range spatio-temporal modeling and then average multiple snippet-level\npredictions to yield the final video-level prediction. Thus, their video-level\nprediction does not consider spatio-temporal features of how video evolves\nalong the temporal dimension. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dynamic\nSegment Aggregation (DSA) module to capture relationship among snippets. To be\nmore specific, we attempt to generate a dynamic kernel for a convolutional\noperation to aggregate long-range temporal information among adjacent snippets\nadaptively. The DSA module is an efficient plug-and-play module and can be\ncombined with the off-the-shelf clip-based models (i.e., TSM, I3D) to perform\npowerful long-range modeling with minimal overhead. The final video\narchitecture, coined as DSANet. We conduct extensive experiments on several\nvideo recognition benchmarks (i.e., Mini-Kinetics-200, Kinetics-400,\nSomething-Something V1 and ActivityNet) to show its superiority. Our proposed\nDSA module is shown to benefit various video recognition models significantly.\nFor example, equipped with DSA modules, the top-1 accuracy of I3D ResNet-50 is\nimproved from 74.9% to 78.2% on Kinetics-400.

          "description": "This paper describes a variational auto-encoder based non-autoregressive\ntext-to-speech (VAENAR-TTS) model. The autoregressive TTS (AR-TTS) models based\non the sequence-to-sequence architecture can generate high-quality speech, but\ntheir sequential decoding process can be time-consuming. Recently,\nnon-autoregressive TTS (NAR-TTS) models have been shown to be more efficient\nwith the parallel decoding process. However, these NAR-TTS models rely on\nphoneme-level durations to generate a hard alignment between the text and the\nspectrogram. Obtaining duration labels, either through forced alignment or\nknowledge distillation, is cumbersome. Furthermore, hard alignment based on\nphoneme expansion can degrade the naturalness of the synthesized speech. In\ncontrast, the proposed model of VAENAR-TTS is an end-to-end approach that does\nnot require phoneme-level durations. The VAENAR-TTS model does not contain\nrecurrent structures and is completely non-autoregressive in both the training\nand inference phases. Based on the VAE architecture, the alignment information\nis encoded in the latent variable, and attention-based soft alignment between\nthe text and the latent variable is used in the decoder to reconstruct the\nspectrogram. Experiments show that VAENAR-TTS achieves state-of-the-art\nsynthesis quality, while the synthesis speed is comparable with other NAR-TTS\nmodels.",

In this paper, we investigate the\nexocentric (third-person) view to egocentric (first-person) view video\ngeneration task. This is challenging because egocentric view sometimes is\nremarkably different from the exocentric view. Thus, transforming the\nappearances across the two different views is a non-trivial task. Particularly,\nwe propose a novel Bi-directional Spatial Temporal Attention Fusion Generative\nAdversarial Network (STA-GAN) to learn both spatial and temporal information to\ngenerate egocentric video sequences from the exocentric view. The proposed\nSTA-GAN consists of three parts: temporal branch, spatial branch, and attention\nfusion. First, the temporal and spatial branches generate a sequence of fake\nframes and their corresponding features. The fake frames are generated in both\ndownstream and upstream directions for both temporal and spatial branches.\nNext, the generated four different fake frames and their corresponding features\n(spatial and temporal branches in two directions) are fed into a novel\nmulti-generation attention fusion module to produce the final video sequence.\nMeanwhile, we also propose a novel temporal and spatial dual-discriminator for\nmore robust network optimization.

          "description": "Compared with tedious per-pixel mask annotating, it is much easier to\nannotate data by clicks, which costs only several seconds for an image.\nHowever, applying clicks to learn video semantic segmentation model has not\nbeen explored before. In this work, we propose an effective weakly-supervised\nvideo semantic segmentation pipeline with click annotations, called WeClick,\nfor saving laborious annotating effort by segmenting an instance of the\nsemantic class with only a single click. Since detailed semantic information is\nnot captured by clicks, directly training with click labels leads to poor\nsegmentation predictions. To mitigate this problem, we design a novel memory\nflow knowledge distillation strategy to exploit temporal information (named\nmemory flow) in abundant unlabeled video frames, by distilling the neighboring\npredictions to the target frame via estimated motion. Moreover, we adopt\nvanilla knowledge distillation for model compression. In this case, WeClick\nlearns compact video semantic segmentation models with the low-cost click\nannotations during the training phase yet achieves real-time and accurate\nmodels during the inference period. Experimental results on Cityscapes and\nCamvid show that WeClick outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, increases\nperformance by 10.24% mIoU than baseline, and achieves real-time execution.",

Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines\nhow AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data\nin the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as\ndeepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current\nmultimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can\ndetect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to\ntheir reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in\nthis work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks' learning dynamics,\nemphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose\nContinual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the\nconcept of Continual Learning (CoL), Representation Learning (ReL), and\nKnowledge Distillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain\nadaptation tasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets,\nwhile effectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student\nmodel setting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method\nis efficient at domain adaptation to detect low-quality deepfakes videos and\nGAN-generated images from several datasets, outperforming the-state-of-art\nbaseline methods.",

          "description": "Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains.\nHowever, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as\nlong documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has\nquadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence\nlength. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an\nefficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear\ncomplexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range\nattention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a\nshort-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a\ndual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two\nattention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and\nbidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains,\nincluding the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and\nImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on\nenwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being\nfaster and is able to handle 3$\\times$ as long sequences compared to its\nfull-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the\nstate-of-the-art results~(e.g., Top-1 accuracy 84.1% trained on 224$\\times$224\nImageNet-1K only), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

          "description": "Image editing techniques enable people to modify the content of an image\nwithout leaving visual traces and thus may cause serious security risks. Hence\nthe detection and localization of these forgeries become quite necessary and\nchallenging. Furthermore, unlike other tasks with extensive data, there is\nusually a lack of annotated forged images for training due to annotation\ndifficulties. In this paper, we propose a self-adversarial training strategy\nand a reliable coarse-to-fine network that utilizes a self-attention mechanism\nto localize forged regions in forgery images. The self-attention module is\nbased on a Channel-Wise High Pass Filter block (CW-HPF). CW-HPF leverages\ninter-channel relationships of features and extracts noise features by high\npass filters. Based on the CW-HPF, a self-attention mechanism, called forgery\nattention, is proposed to capture rich contextual dependencies of intrinsic\ninconsistency extracted from tampered regions. Specifically, we append two\ntypes of attention modules on top of CW-HPF respectively to model internal\ninterdependencies in spatial dimension and external dependencies among\nchannels. We exploit a coarse-to-fine network to enhance the noise\ninconsistency between original and tampered regions. More importantly, to\naddress the issue of insufficient training data, we design a self-adversarial\ntraining strategy that expands training data dynamically to achieve more robust\nperformance. Specifically, in each training iteration, we perform adversarial\nattacks against our network to generate adversarial examples and train our\nmodel on them.

The key to deep\nprimitive segmentation is learning a feature representation that can separate\npoints of different primitives. Unlike utilizing a single feature\nrepresentation, HPNet leverages hybrid representations that combine one learned\nsemantic descriptor, two spectral descriptors derived from predicted geometric\nparameters, as well as an adjacency matrix that encodes sharp edges. Moreover,\ninstead of merely concatenating the descriptors, HPNet optimally combines\nhybrid representations by learning combination weights.

          "description": "Histopathology-based survival modelling has two major hurdles. Firstly, a\nwell-performing survival model has minimal clinical application if it does not\ncontribute to the stratification of a cancer patient cohort into different risk\ngroups, preferably driven by histologic morphologies. In the clinical setting,\nindividuals are not given specific prognostic predictions, but are rather\npredicted to lie within a risk group which has a general survival trend. Thus,\nIt is imperative that a survival model produces well-stratified risk groups.\nSecondly, until now, survival modelling was done in a two-stage approach\n(encoding and aggregation). The massive amount of pixels in digitized whole\nslide images were never utilized to their fullest extent due to technological\nconstraints on data processing, forcing decoupled learning. EPIC-Survival\nbridges encoding and aggregation into an end-to-end survival modelling\napproach, while introducing stratification boosting to encourage the model to\nnot only optimize ranking, but also to discriminate between risk groups. In\nthis study we show that EPIC-Survival performs better than other approaches in\nmodelling intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a historically difficult cancer to\nmodel. Further, we show that stratification boosting improves further improves\nmodel performance, resulting in a concordance-index of 0.880 on a held-out test\nset. Finally, we were able to identify specific histologic differences, not\ncommonly sought out in ICC, between low and high risk groups.",

          "description": "Graphically-rich applications such as games are ubiquitous with attractive\nvisual effects of Graphical User Interface (GUI) that offers a bridge between\nsoftware applications and end-users. However, various types of graphical\nglitches may arise from such GUI complexity and have become one of the main\ncomponent of software compatibility issues. Our study on bug reports from game\ndevelopment teams in NetEase Inc. indicates that graphical glitches frequently\noccur during the GUI rendering and severely degrade the quality of\ngraphically-rich applications such as video games. Existing automated testing\ntechniques for such applications focus mainly on generating various GUI test\nsequences and check whether the test sequences can cause crashes. These\ntechniques require constant human attention to captures non-crashing bugs such\nas bugs causing graphical glitches. In this paper, we present the first step in\nautomating the test oracle for detecting non-crashing bugs in graphically-rich\napplications. Specifically, we propose \\texttt{GLIB} based on a code-based data\naugmentation technique to detect game GUI glitches. We perform an evaluation of\n\\texttt{GLIB} on 20 real-world game apps (with bug reports available) and the\nresult shows that \\texttt{GLIB} can achieve 100\\% precision and 99.5\\% recall\nin detecting non-crashing bugs such as game GUI glitches. Practical application\nof \\texttt{GLIB} on another 14 real-world games (without bug reports) further\ndemonstrates that \\texttt{GLIB} can effectively uncover GUI glitches, with 48\nof 53 bugs reported by \\texttt{GLIB} having been confirmed and fixed so far.",

Our framework, dubbed StyleCariGAN, automatically\ncreates a realistic and detailed caricature from an input photo with optional\ncontrols on shape exaggeration degree and color stylization type. The key\ncomponent of our method is shape exaggeration blocks that are used for\nmodulating coarse layer feature maps of StyleGAN to produce desirable\ncaricature shape exaggerations. We first build a layer-mixed StyleGAN for\nphoto-to-caricature style conversion by swapping fine layers of the StyleGAN\nfor photos to the corresponding layers of the StyleGAN trained to generate\ncaricatures. Given an input photo, the layer-mixed model produces detailed\ncolor stylization for a caricature but without shape exaggerations. We then\nappend shape exaggeration blocks to the coarse layers of the layer-mixed model\nand train the blocks to create shape exaggerations while preserving the\ncharacteristic appearances of the input. Experimental results show that our\nStyleCariGAN generates realistic and detailed caricatures compared to the\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate StyleCariGAN also supports\nother StyleGAN-based image manipulations, such as facial expression control.",

Without any parameter-tuning, the same model achieves\nsuperior performance with Dice scores (0-100 scale) of over 80 for most of the\nbenchmarks, including the ones that are unseen during training.

          "description": "The process of aggregation is ubiquitous in almost all deep nets models. It\nfunctions as an important mechanism for consolidating deep features into a more\ncompact representation, whilst increasing robustness to overfitting and\nproviding spatial invariance in deep nets. In particular, the proximity of\nglobal aggregation layers to the output layers of DNNs mean that aggregated\nfeatures have a direct influence on the performance of a deep net. A better\nunderstanding of this relationship can be obtained using information theoretic\nmethods. However, this requires the knowledge of the distributions of the\nactivations of aggregation layers. To achieve this, we propose a novel\nmathematical formulation for analytically modelling the probability\ndistributions of output values of layers involved with deep feature\naggregation. An important outcome is our ability to analytically predict the\nKL-divergence of output nodes in a DNN. We also experimentally verify our\ntheoretical predictions against empirical observations across a range of\ndifferent classification tasks and datasets.",

          "description": "Randomized smoothing has recently emerged as an effective tool that enables\ncertification of deep neural network classifiers at scale. All prior art on\nrandomized smoothing has focused on isotropic $\\ell_p$ certification, which has\nthe advantage of yielding certificates that can be easily compared among\nisotropic methods via $\\ell_p$-norm radius. However, isotropic certification\nlimits the region that can be certified around an input to worst-case\nadversaries, \\ie it cannot reason about other \"close\", potentially large,\nconstant prediction safe regions. To alleviate this issue, (i) we theoretically\nextend the isotropic randomized smoothing $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ certificates to\ntheir generalized anisotropic counterparts following a simplified analysis.\nMoreover, (ii) we propose evaluation metrics allowing for the comparison of\ngeneral certificates - a certificate is superior to another if it certifies a\nsuperset region - with the quantification of each certificate through the\nvolume of the certified region.

Across the globe,\ngovernments have put mandates for the use of face masks, which have received\nboth positive and negative reaction. Online social media provides an exciting\nplatform to study the use of masks and analyze underlying mask-wearing\npatterns. In this article, we analyze 2.04 million social media images for six\nUS cities. An increase in masks worn in images is seen as the COVID-19 cases\nrose, particularly when their respective states imposed strict regulations. We\nalso found a decrease in the posting of group pictures as stay-at-home laws\nwere put into place. Furthermore, mask compliance in the Black Lives Matter\nprotest was analyzed, eliciting that 40% of the people in group photos wore\nmasks, and 45% of them wore the masks with a fit score of greater than 80%. We\nintroduce two new datasets, VAriety MAsks - Classification (VAMA-C) and VAriety\nMAsks - Segmentation (VAMA-S), for mask detection and mask fit analysis tasks,\nrespectively. For the analysis, we create two frameworks, face mask detector\n(for classifying masked and unmasked faces) and mask fit analyzer (a semantic\nsegmentation based model to calculate a mask-fit score). The face mask detector\nachieved a classification accuracy of 98%, and the semantic segmentation model\nfor the mask fit analyzer achieved an Intersection Over Union (IOU) score of\n98%. We conclude that such a framework can be used to evaluate the\neffectiveness of such public health strategies using social media platforms in\ntimes of pandemic.",

In the experimental evaluation on standard datasets,\nRGBD-Net not only outperforms the state-of-the-art by a clear margin, but it\nalso generalizes well to new scenes without per-scene optimization. Moreover,\nwe show that RGBD-Net can be optionally trained without depth supervision while\nstill retaining high-quality rendering. Thanks to the depth regression network,\nRGBD-Net can be also used for creating dense 3D point clouds that are more\naccurate than those produced by some state-of-the-art multi-view stereo\nmethods.",

          "description": "One central question for video action recognition is how to model motion. In\nthis paper, we present hierarchical contrastive motion learning, a new\nself-supervised learning framework to extract effective motion representations\nfrom raw video frames. Our approach progressively learns a hierarchy of motion\nfeatures that correspond to different abstraction levels in a network. This\nhierarchical design bridges the semantic gap between low-level motion cues and\nhigh-level recognition tasks, and promotes the fusion of appearance and motion\ninformation at multiple levels. At each level, an explicit motion\nself-supervision is provided via contrastive learning to enforce the motion\nfeatures at the current level to predict the future ones at the previous level.\nThus, the motion features at higher levels are trained to gradually capture\nsemantic dynamics and evolve more discriminative for action recognition. Our\nmotion learning module is lightweight and flexible to be embedded into various\nbackbone networks. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that the\nproposed approach consistently achieves superior results.",

          "description": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a prevalent imaging technique for\nretina. However, it is affected by multiplicative speckle noise that can\ndegrade the visibility of essential anatomical structures, including blood\nvessels and tissue layers. Although averaging repeated B-scan frames can\nsignificantly improve the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), this requires longer\nacquisition time, which can introduce motion artifacts and cause discomfort to\npatients. In this study, we propose a learning-based method that exploits\ninformation from the single-frame noisy B-scan and a pseudo-modality that is\ncreated with the aid of the self-fusion method. The pseudo-modality provides\ngood SNR for layers that are barely perceptible in the noisy B-scan but can\nover-smooth fine features such as small vessels. By using a fusion network,\ndesired features from each modality can be combined, and the weight of their\ncontribution is adjustable. Evaluated by intensity-based and structural\nmetrics, the result shows that our method can effectively suppress the speckle\nnoise and enhance the contrast between retina layers while the overall\nstructure and small blood vessels are preserved. Compared to the single\nmodality network, our method improves the structural similarity with low noise\nB-scan from 0.559 +\\- 0.033 to 0.576 +\\- 0.031.",

State-of-the-art approaches for image-based\ndetection tasks tackle this complexity by operating in a cascaded fashion: they\nfirst extract a 2D bounding box based on which additional attributes, e.g.\ninstance masks, are inferred. While these methods perform well, a key challenge\nremains the lack of accurate and cheap annotations for the growing variety of\ntasks. Synthetic data presents a promising solution but, despite the effort in\ndomain adaptation research, the gap between synthetic and real data remains an\nopen problem. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised domain adaptation\nsetting which exploits the structure of cascaded detection tasks. In\nparticular, we learn to infer the attributes solely from the source domain\nwhile leveraging 2D bounding boxes as weak labels in both domains to explain\nthe domain shift.

          "description": "Robotic visual systems operating in the wild must act in unconstrained\nscenarios, under different environmental conditions while facing a variety of\nsemantic concepts, including unknown ones. To this end, recent works tried to\nempower visual object recognition methods with the capability to i) detect\nunseen concepts and ii) extended their knowledge over time, as images of new\nsemantic classes arrive. This setting, called Open World Recognition (OWR), has\nthe goal to produce systems capable of breaking the semantic limits present in\nthe initial training set. However, this training set imposes to the system not\nonly its own semantic limits, but also environmental ones, due to its bias\ntoward certain acquisition conditions that do not necessarily reflect the high\nvariability of the real-world. This discrepancy between training and test\ndistribution is called domain-shift. This work investigates whether OWR\nalgorithms are effective under domain-shift, presenting the first benchmark\nsetup for assessing fairly the performances of OWR algorithms, with and without\ndomain-shift. We then use this benchmark to conduct analyses in various\nscenarios, showing how existing OWR algorithms indeed suffer a severe\nperformance degradation when train and test distributions differ. Our analysis\nshows that this degradation is only slightly mitigated by coupling OWR with\ndomain generalization techniques, indicating that the mere plug-and-play of\nexisting algorithms is not enough to recognize new and unknown categories in\nunseen domains. Our results clearly point toward open issues and future\nresearch directions, that need to be investigated for building robot visual\nsystems able to function reliably under these challenging yet very real\nconditions.

The learning purposes of our system are based on three distinct\nrepresentations: surface representation, structure representation, and texture\nrepresentation. The surface representation refers to the smooth surface of the\nimages. The structure representation relates to the sparse colour blocks and\ncompresses generic content. The texture representation shows the texture,\ncurves, and features in cartoon images. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\nframework decomposes the images into different representations and learns from\nthem to generate cartoon images. This decomposition makes the framework more\ncontrollable and flexible which allows users to make changes based on the\nrequired output.

          "description": "Video question answering (Video QA) presents a powerful testbed for\nhuman-like intelligent behaviors. The task demands new capabilities to\nintegrate video processing, language understanding, binding abstract linguistic\nconcepts to concrete visual artifacts, and deliberative reasoning over\nspacetime. Neural networks offer a promising approach to reach this potential\nthrough learning from examples rather than handcrafting features and rules.\nHowever, neural networks are predominantly feature-based - they map data to\nunstructured vectorial representation and thus can fall into the trap of\nexploiting shortcuts through surface statistics instead of true systematic\nreasoning seen in symbolic systems. To tackle this issue, we advocate for\nobject-centric representation as a basis for constructing spatio-temporal\nstructures from videos, essentially bridging the semantic gap between low-level\npattern recognition and high-level symbolic algebra. To this end, we propose a\nnew query-guided representation framework to turn a video into an evolving\nrelational graph of objects, whose features and interactions are dynamically\nand conditionally inferred. The object lives are then summarized into resumes,\nlending naturally for deliberative relational reasoning that produces an answer\nto the query. The framework is evaluated on major Video QA datasets,\ndemonstrating clear benefits of the object-centric approach to video reasoning.",

          "description": "In person re-identification (Re-ID), supervised methods usually need a large\namount of expensive label information, while unsupervised ones are still unable\nto deliver satisfactory identification performance. In this paper, we introduce\na novel person Re-ID task called unsupervised cross-camera person Re-ID, which\nonly needs the within-camera (intra-camera) label information but not\ncross-camera (inter-camera) labels which are more expensive to obtain. In\nreal-world applications, the intra-camera label information can be easily\ncaptured by tracking algorithms or few manual annotations. In this situation,\nthe main challenge becomes the distribution discrepancy across different camera\nviews, caused by the various body pose, occlusion, image resolution,\nillumination conditions, and background noises in different cameras. To address\nthis situation, we propose a novel Adversarial Camera Alignment Network (ACAN)\nfor unsupervised cross-camera person Re-ID. It consists of the camera-alignment\ntask and the supervised within-camera learning task. To achieve the camera\nalignment, we develop a Multi-Camera Adversarial Learning (MCAL) to map images\nof different cameras into a shared subspace. Particularly, we investigate two\ndifferent schemes, including the existing GRL (i.e., gradient reversal layer)\nscheme and the proposed scheme called \"other camera equiprobability\" (OCE), to\nconduct the multi-camera adversarial task. Based on this shared subspace, we\nthen leverage the within-camera labels to train the network. Extensive\nexperiments on five large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of ACAN\nover multiple state-of-the-art unsupervised methods that take advantage of\nlabeled source domains and generated images by GAN-based models. In particular,\nwe verify that the proposed multi-camera adversarial task does contribute to\nthe significant improvement.",

It is\nparticularly useful when the target domain has few or no labeled data, due to\nannotation expense, privacy concerns, etc. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of\nTL is not always guaranteed. Negative transfer (NT), i.e., the source domain\ndata/knowledge cause reduced learning performance in the target domain, has\nbeen a long-standing and challenging problem in TL. Various approaches to\nhandle NT have been proposed in the literature. However, this filed lacks a\nsystematic survey on the formalization of NT, their factors and the algorithms\nthat handle NT. This paper proposes to fill this gap. First, the definition of\nnegative transfer is considered and a taxonomy of the factors are discussed.\nThen, near fifty representative approaches for handling NT are categorized and\nreviewed, from four perspectives: secure transfer, domain similarity\nestimation, distant transfer and negative transfer mitigation. NT in related\nfields, e.g., multi-task learning, lifelong learning, and adversarial attacks\nare also discussed.",

Our\nenvironment contains 15 fully interactive home-sized scenes with 108 rooms\npopulated with rigid and articulated objects. The scenes are replicas of\nreal-world homes, with distribution and the layout of objects aligned to those\nof the real world. iGibson integrates several key features to facilitate the\nstudy of interactive tasks: i) generation of high-quality virtual sensor\nsignals (RGB, depth, segmentation, LiDAR, flow and so on), ii) domain\nrandomization to change the materials of the objects (both visual and physical)\nand/or their shapes, iii) integrated sampling-based motion planners to generate\ncollision-free trajectories for robot bases and arms, and iv) intuitive\nhuman-iGibson interface that enables efficient collection of human\ndemonstrations. Through experiments, we show that the full interactivity of the\nscenes enables agents to learn useful visual representations that accelerate\nthe training of downstream manipulation tasks. We also show that iGibson\nfeatures enable the generalization of navigation agents, and that the\nhuman-iGibson interface and integrated motion planners facilitate efficient\nimitation learning of human demonstrated (mobile) manipulation behaviors.\niGibson is open-source, equipped with comprehensive examples and documentation.\nFor more information, visit our project website:\nthis http URL",

In this paper, a novel method by acting\nthe gradient activation function (GAF) on the gradient is proposed to handle\nthese challenges. Intuitively, the GAF enlarges the tiny gradients and\nrestricts the large gradient. Theoretically, this paper gives conditions that\nthe GAF needs to meet, and on this basis, proves that the GAF alleviates the\nproblems mentioned above. In addition, this paper proves that the convergence\nrate of SGD with the GAF is faster than that without the GAF under some\nassumptions. Furthermore, experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet, and PASCAL visual\nobject classes confirm the GAF's effectiveness. The experimental results also\ndemonstrate that the proposed method is able to be adopted in various deep\nneural networks to improve their performance.

          "description": "Application of deep neural networks to medical imaging tasks has in some\nsense become commonplace. Still, a \"thorn in the side\" of the deep learning\nmovement is the argument that deep networks are prone to overfitting and are\nthus unable to generalize well when datasets are small (as is common in medical\nimaging tasks). One way to bolster confidence is to provide mathematical\nguarantees, or bounds, on network performance after training which explicitly\nquantify the possibility of overfitting. In this work, we explore recent\nadvances using the PAC-Bayesian framework to provide bounds on generalization\nerror for large (stochastic) networks. While previous efforts focus on\nclassification in larger natural image datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR-10), we\napply these techniques to both classification and segmentation in a smaller\nmedical imagining dataset: the ISIC 2018 challenge set. We observe the\nresultant bounds are competitive compared to a simpler baseline, while also\nbeing more explainable and alleviating the need for holdout sets.",

          "description": "Differentiable architecture search is prevalent in the field of NAS because\nof its simplicity and efficiency, where two paradigms, multi-path algorithms\nand single-path methods, are dominated. Multi-path framework (e.g. DARTS) is\nintuitive but suffers from memory usage and training collapse. Single-path\nmethods (e.g.GDAS and ProxylessNAS) mitigate the memory issue and shrink the\ngap between searching and evaluation but sacrifice the performance. In this\npaper, we propose a conceptually simple yet efficient method to bridge these\ntwo paradigms, referred as Mutually-aware Sub-Graphs Differentiable\nArchitecture Search (MSG-DAS). The core of our framework is a differentiable\nGumbel-TopK sampler that produces multiple mutually exclusive single-path\nsub-graphs. To alleviate the severer skip-connect issue brought by multiple\nsub-graphs setting, we propose a Dropblock-Identity module to stabilize the\noptimization. To make best use of the available models (super-net and\nsub-graphs), we introduce a memory-efficient super-net guidance distillation to\nimprove training. The proposed framework strikes a balance between flexible\nmemory usage and searching quality.

Many researchers tackled the\n3D multi-object tracking task by filtering out the frame-by-frame 3D\ndetections; however, their focus was mainly on finding useful features or\nproper matching metrics. Our work focuses on a neglected part of the tracking\nsystem: score refinement and tracklet termination. We show that manipulating\nthe scores depending on time consistency while terminating the tracklets\ndepending on the tracklet score improves tracking results. We do this by\nincreasing the matched tracklets' score with score update functions and\ndecreasing the unmatched tracklets' score.

          "description": "Image inpainting aims to restore the missing regions and make the recovery\nresults identical to the originally complete image, which is different from the\ncommon generative task emphasizing the naturalness of generated images.\nNevertheless, existing works usually regard it as a pure generation problem and\nemploy cutting-edge generative techniques to address it. The generative\nnetworks fill the main missing parts with realistic contents but usually\ndistort the local structures. In this paper, we formulate image inpainting as a\nmix of two problems, i.e., predictive filtering and deep generation. Predictive\nfiltering is good at preserving local structures and removing artifacts but\nfalls short to complete the large missing regions. The deep generative network\ncan fill the numerous missing pixels based on the understanding of the whole\nscene but hardly restores the details identical to the original ones. To make\nuse of their respective advantages, we propose the joint predictive filtering\nand generative network (JPGNet) that contains three branches: predictive\nfiltering & uncertainty network (PFUNet), deep generative network, and\nuncertainty-aware fusion network (UAFNet). The PFUNet can adaptively predict\npixel-wise kernels for filtering-based inpainting according to the input image\nand output an uncertainty map. This map indicates the pixels should be\nprocessed by filtering or generative networks, which is further fed to the\nUAFNet for a smart combination between filtering and generative results. Note\nthat, our method as a novel framework for the image inpainting problem can\nbenefit any existing generation-based methods. We validate our method on three\npublic datasets, i.e., Dunhuang, Places2, and CelebA, and demonstrate that our\nmethod can enhance three state-of-the-art generative methods (i.e., StructFlow,\nEdgeConnect, and RFRNet) significantly with the slightly extra time cost.",

          "description": "Video object segmentation, aiming to segment the foreground objects given the\nannotation of the first frame, has been attracting increasing attentions. Many\nstate-of-the-art approaches have achieved great performance by relying on\nonline model updating or mask-propagation techniques. However, most online\nmodels require high computational cost due to model fine-tuning during\ninference. Most mask-propagation based models are faster but with relatively\nlow performance due to failure to adapt to object appearance variation. In this\npaper, we are aiming to design a new model to make a good balance between speed\nand performance. We propose a model, called NPMCA-net, which directly localizes\nforeground objects based on mask-propagation and non-local technique by\nmatching pixels in reference and target frames. Since we bring in information\nof both first and previous frames, our network is robust to large object\nappearance variation, and can better adapt to occlusions. Extensive experiments\nshow that our approach can achieve a new state-of-the-art performance with a\nfast speed at the same time (86.5% IoU on DAVIS-2016 and 72.2% IoU on\nDAVIS-2017, with speed of 0.11s per frame) under the same level comparison.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/siyueyu/NPMCA-net.",

          "description": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a large number of parameters\nrequires huge computational resources, which has limited the application of\nCNNs on resources constrained appliances. Decomposition-based methods,\ntherefore, have been utilized to compress CNNs in recent years. However, since\nthe compression factor and performance are negatively correlated, the\nstate-of-the-art works either suffer from severe performance degradation or\nhave limited low compression factors. To overcome these problems, unlike\nprevious works compressing layers separately, we propose to compress CNNs and\nalleviate performance degradation via joint matrix decomposition. The idea is\ninspired by the fact that there are lots of repeated modules in CNNs, and by\nprojecting weights with the same structures into the same subspace, networks\ncan be further compressed and even accelerated. In particular, three joint\nmatrix decomposition schemes are developed, and the corresponding optimization\napproaches based on Singular Values Decomposition are proposed. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted across three challenging compact CNNs and 3 benchmark\ndata sets to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms.\nAs a result, our methods can compress the size of ResNet-34 by 22x with\nslighter accuracy degradation compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",

Clinicians often face issues in selecting suitable\nimage processing algorithm for medical imaging data. A strategy for the\nselection of a proper model is presented here. The training data set comprises\noptical coherence tomography (OCT) and angiography (OCT-A) images of 50 mice\neyes with more than 100 days follow-up. The data contains images from treated\nand untreated mouse eyes. Four deep learning variants are tested for automatic\n(a) differentiation of tumor region with healthy retinal layer and (b)\nsegmentation of 3D ocular tumor volumes. Exhaustive sensitivity analysis of\ndeep learning models is performed with respect to the number of training and\ntesting images using 8 eight performance indices to study accuracy,\nreliability/reproducibility, and speed. U-net with UVgg16 is best for malign\ntumor data set with treatment (having considerable variation) and U-net with\nInception backbone for benign tumor data (with minor variation). Loss value and\nroot mean square error (R.M.S.E.) are found most and least sensitive\nperformance indices, respectively. The performance (via indices) is found to be\nexponentially improving regarding a number of training images. The segmented\nOCT-Angiography data shows that neovascularization drives the tumor volume.\nImage analysis shows that photodynamic imaging-assisted tumor treatment\nprotocol is transforming an aggressively growing tumor into a cyst. An\nempirical expression is obtained to help medical professionals to choose a\nparticular model given the number of images and types of characteristics.

By analyzing and comparing the\nperformance of all the algorithms, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based\nSR technique using an external dictionary proved to be best by achieving robust\nface detection accuracy and scoring optimal quantitative metric results under\ndifferent surveillance conditions.

While it has tremendous potential to promote the image\ncolorization task, the performance is limited owing to the manifold hypothesis\nin machine learning. This study presents a novel scheme that exploiting the\nscore-based generative model in wavelet domain to address the issue. By taking\nadvantage of the multi-scale and multi-channel representation via wavelet\ntransform, the proposed model learns the priors from stacked wavelet\ncoefficient components, thus learns the image characteristics under coarse and\ndetail frequency spectrums jointly and effectively. Moreover, such a highly\nflexible generative model without adversarial optimization can execute\ncolorization tasks better under dual consistency terms in wavelet domain,\nnamely data-consistency and structure-consistency. Specifically, in the\ntraining phase, a set of multi-channel tensors consisting of wavelet\ncoefficients are used as the input to train the network by denoising score\nmatching. In the test phase, samples are iteratively generated via annealed\nLangevin dynamics with data and structure consistencies.

          "description": "Adaptation of a classifier to new domains is one of the challenging problems\nin machine learning. This has been addressed using many deep and non-deep\nlearning based methods. Among the methodologies used, that of adversarial\nlearning is widely applied to solve many deep learning problems along with\ndomain adaptation. These methods are based on a discriminator that ensures\nsource and target distributions are close. However, here we suggest that rather\nthan using a point estimate obtaining by a single discriminator, it would be\nuseful if a distribution based on ensembles of discriminators could be used to\nbridge this gap. This could be achieved using multiple classifiers or using\ntraditional ensemble methods. In contrast, we suggest that a Monte Carlo\ndropout based ensemble discriminator could suffice to obtain the distribution\nbased discriminator. Specifically, we propose a curriculum based dropout\ndiscriminator that gradually increases the variance of the sample based\ndistribution and the corresponding reverse gradients are used to align the\nsource and target feature representations. An ensemble of discriminators helps\nthe model to learn the data distribution efficiently. It also provides a better\ngradient estimates to train the feature extractor. The detailed results and\nthorough ablation analysis show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art\nresults.",

          "description": "State-of-the-art temporal action detectors to date are based on two-stream\ninput including RGB frames and optical flow. Although combining RGB frames and\noptical flow boosts performance significantly, optical flow is a hand-designed\nrepresentation which not only requires heavy computation, but also makes it\nmethodologically unsatisfactory that two-stream methods are often not learned\nend-to-end jointly with the flow. In this paper, we argue that optical flow is\ndispensable in high-accuracy temporal action detection and image level data\naugmentation (ILDA) is the key solution to avoid performance degradation when\noptical flow is removed. To evaluate the effectiveness of ILDA, we design a\nsimple yet efficient one-stage temporal action detector based on single RGB\nstream named DaoTAD. Our results show that when trained with ILDA, DaoTAD has\ncomparable accuracy with all existing state-of-the-art two-stream detectors\nwhile surpassing the inference speed of previous methods by a large margin and\nthe inference speed is astounding 6668 fps on GeForce GTX 1080 Ti.

However, these alternative normalization\nlayers have seen minimal use, partially due to a lack of guiding principles\nthat can help identify when these layers can serve as a replacement for\nBatchNorm. To address this problem, we take a theoretical approach,\ngeneralizing the known beneficial mechanisms of BatchNorm to several recently\nproposed normalization techniques. Our generalized theory leads to the\nfollowing set of principles: (i) similar to BatchNorm, activations-based\nnormalization layers can prevent exponential growth of activations in ResNets,\nbut parametric layers require explicit remedies; (ii) use of GroupNorm can\nensure informative forward propagation, with different samples being assigned\ndissimilar activations, but increasing group size results in increasingly\nindistinguishable activations for different samples, explaining slow\nconvergence speed in models with LayerNorm; (iii) small group sizes result in\nlarge gradient norm in earlier layers, hence explaining training instability\nissues in Instance Normalization and illustrating a speed-stability tradeoff in\nGroupNorm. Overall, our analysis reveals a unified set of mechanisms that\nunderpin the success of normalization methods in deep learning, providing us\nwith a compass to systematically explore the vast design space of DNN\nnormalization layers.",

          "description": "Natural language is perhaps the most flexible and intuitive way for humans to\ncommunicate tasks to a robot. Prior work in imitation learning typically\nrequires each task be specified with a task id or goal image -- something that\nis often impractical in open-world environments. On the other hand, previous\napproaches in instruction following allow agent behavior to be guided by\nlanguage, but typically assume structure in the observations, actuators, or\nlanguage that limit their applicability to complex settings like robotics. In\nthis work, we present a method for incorporating free-form natural language\nconditioning into imitation learning. Our approach learns perception from\npixels, natural language understanding, and multitask continuous control\nend-to-end as a single neural network. Unlike prior work in imitation learning,\nour method is able to incorporate unlabeled and unstructured demonstration data\n(i.e. no task or language labels). We show this dramatically improves language\nconditioned performance, while reducing the cost of language annotation to less\nthan 1% of total data. At test time, a single language conditioned visuomotor\npolicy trained with our method can perform a wide variety of robotic\nmanipulation skills in a 3D environment, specified only with natural language\ndescriptions of each task (e.g. \"open the drawer...now pick up the block...now\npress the green button...\"). To scale up the number of instructions an agent\ncan follow, we propose combining text conditioned policies with large\npretrained neural language models. We find this allows a policy to be robust to\nmany out-of-distribution synonym instructions, without requiring new\ndemonstrations.

Point cloud and mesh are the two most\nwidely used electronic representation formats of 3D models, the quality of\nwhich is quite sensitive to operations like simplification and compression.\nTherefore, many studies concerning point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) and\nmesh quality assessment (MQA) have been carried out to measure the visual\nquality degradations caused by lossy operations. However, a large part of\nprevious studies utilizes full-reference (FR) metrics, which means they may\nfail to predict the accurate quality level of 3D models when the reference 3D\nmodel is not available. Furthermore, limited numbers of 3D-QA metrics are\ncarried out to take color features into consideration, which significantly\nrestricts the effectiveness and scope of application. In many quality\nassessment studies, natural scene statistics (NSS) have shown a good ability to\nquantify the distortion of natural scenes to statistical parameters. Therefore,\nwe propose an NSS-based no-reference quality assessment metric for colored 3D\nmodels. In this paper, quality-aware features are extracted from the aspects of\ncolor and geometry directly from the 3D models. Then the statistic parameters\nare estimated using different distribution models to describe the\ncharacteristic of the 3D models. Our method is mainly validated on the colored\npoint cloud quality assessment database (SJTU-PCQA) and the colored mesh\nquality assessment database (CMDM). The experimental results show that the\nproposed method outperforms all the state-of-art NR 3D-QA metrics and obtains\nan acceptable gap with the state-of-art FR 3D-QA metrics.",

Then, we inject\na global classification head to the detection model and propose dual attention\nalignment to guide the global gradient to the local detection branch, which\nenables learning lesion detection from image-level annotations. We also impose\nintra-class compactness and inter-class separability with global prototype\nalignment to further enhance the global information learning. Moreover, we\nleverage a soft focal loss to distill the soft pseudo-labels of unlabeled data\ngenerated by a teacher model. Extensive experiments on a large-scale chest\nX-ray dataset show the proposed OXnet outperforms competitive methods with\nsignificant margins. Further, we investigate omni-supervision under various\nannotation granularities and corroborate OXnet is a promising choice to\nmitigate the plight of annotation shortage for medical image diagnosis.",

          "description": "Multi-modal pre-training models have been intensively explored to bridge\nvision and language in recent years. However, most of them explicitly model the\ncross-modal interaction between image-text pairs, by assuming that there exists\nstrong semantic correlation between the text and image modalities. Since this\nstrong assumption is often invalid in real-world scenarios, we choose to\nimplicitly model the cross-modal correlation for large-scale multi-modal\npre-training, which is the focus of the Chinese project `WenLan' led by our\nteam. Specifically, with the weak correlation assumption over image-text pairs,\nwe propose a two-tower pre-training model called BriVL within the cross-modal\ncontrastive learning framework. Unlike OpenAI CLIP that adopts a simple\ncontrastive learning method, we devise a more advanced algorithm by adapting\nthe latest method MoCo into the cross-modal scenario. By building a large\nqueue-based dictionary, our BriVL can incorporate more negative samples in\nlimited GPU resources. We further construct a large Chinese multi-source\nimage-text dataset called RUC-CAS-WenLan for pre-training our BriVL model.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the pre-trained BriVL model outperforms\nboth UNITER and OpenAI CLIP on various downstream tasks.",

Meta learning studies how learning systems can increase in\nefficiency through experience and could thus evolve as an important concept to\novercome data sparsity. However, the core capability of meta learning-based\napproaches is the identification of similar previous tasks given a new task - a\nchallenge largely unexplored in the biomedical imaging domain. In this paper,\nwe address the problem of quantifying task similarity with a concept that we\nrefer to as task fingerprinting. The concept involves converting a given task,\nrepresented by imaging data and corresponding labels, to a fixed-length vector\nrepresentation. In fingerprint space, different tasks can be directly compared\nirrespective of their data set sizes, types of labels or specific resolutions.\nAn initial feasibility study in the field of surgical data science (SDS) with\n26 classification tasks from various medical and non-medical domains suggests\nthat task fingerprinting could be leveraged for both (1) selecting appropriate\ndata sets for pretraining and (2) selecting appropriate architectures for a new\ntask.

Although synthesis of visually pleasant texture can be achieved by deep\nneural networks, the associated models are large in size, difficult to explain\nin theory, and computationally expensive in training. In contrast, TGHop is\nsmall in its model size, mathematically transparent, efficient in training and\ninference, and able to generate high quality texture. Given an exemplary\ntexture, TGHop first crops many sample patches out of it to form a collection\nof sample patches called the source. Then, it analyzes pixel statistics of\nsamples from the source and obtains a sequence of fine-to-coarse subspaces for\nthese patches by using the PixelHop++ framework. To generate texture patches\nwith TGHop, we begin with the coarsest subspace, which is called the core, and\nattempt to generate samples in each subspace by following the distribution of\nreal samples. Finally, texture patches are stitched to form texture images of a\nlarge size.

          "description": "Probabilistic finite mixture models are widely used for unsupervised\nclustering. These models can often be improved by adapting them to the topology\nof the data. For instance, in order to classify spatially adjacent data points\nsimilarly, it is common to introduce a Laplacian constraint on the posterior\nprobability that each data point belongs to a class. Alternatively, the mixing\nprobabilities can be treated as free parameters, while assuming Gauss-Markov or\nmore complex priors to regularize those mixing probabilities. However, these\napproaches are constrained by the shape of the prior and often lead to\ncomplicated or intractable inference. Here, we propose a new parametrization of\nthe Dirichlet distribution to flexibly regularize the mixing probabilities of\nover-parametrized mixture distributions. Using the Expectation-Maximization\nalgorithm, we show that our approach allows us to define any linear update rule\nfor the mixing probabilities, including spatial smoothing regularization as a\nspecial case. We then show that this flexible design can be extended to share\nclass information between multiple mixture models. We apply our algorithm to\nartificial and natural image segmentation tasks, and we provide quantitative\nand qualitative comparison of the performance of Gaussian and Student-t\nmixtures on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. We also demonstrate how to\npropagate class information across the layers of deep convolutional neural\nnetworks in a probabilistically optimal way, suggesting a new interpretation\nfor feedback signals in biological visual systems. Our flexible approach can be\neasily generalized to adapt probabilistic mixture models to arbitrary data\ntopologies.",

          "description": "In large studies involving multi protocol Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),\nit can occur to miss one or more sub-modalities for a given patient owing to\npoor quality (e.g. imaging artifacts), failed acquisitions, or hallway\ninterrupted imaging examinations. In some cases, certain protocols are\nunavailable due to limited scan time or to retrospectively harmonise the\nimaging protocols of two independent studies. Missing image modalities pose a\nchallenge to segmentation frameworks as complementary information contributed\nby the missing scans is then lost. In this paper, we propose a novel model,\nMulti-modal Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoder (MGP-VAE), to impute\none or more missing sub-modalities for a patient scan. MGP-VAE can leverage the\nGaussian Process (GP) prior on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to utilize the\nsubjects/patients and sub-modalities correlations. Instead of designing one\nnetwork for each possible subset of present sub-modalities or using frameworks\nto mix feature maps, missing data can be generated from a single model based on\nall the available samples. We show the applicability of MGP-VAE on brain tumor\nsegmentation where either, two, or three of four sub-modalities may be missing.\nOur experiments against competitive segmentation baselines with missing\nsub-modality on BraTS'19 dataset indicate the effectiveness of the MGP-VAE\nmodel for segmentation tasks.",

          "description": "This paper tackles video prediction from a new dimension of predicting\nspacetime-varying motions that are incessantly changing across both space and\ntime. Prior methods mainly capture the temporal state transitions but overlook\nthe complex spatiotemporal variations of the motion itself, making them\ndifficult to adapt to ever-changing motions. We observe that physical world\nmotions can be decomposed into transient variation and motion trend, while the\nlatter can be regarded as the accumulation of previous motions. Thus,\nsimultaneously capturing the transient variation and the motion trend is the\nkey to make spacetime-varying motions more predictable. Based on these\nobservations, we propose the MotionRNN framework, which can capture the complex\nvariations within motions and adapt to spacetime-varying scenarios. MotionRNN\nhas two main contributions. The first is that we design the MotionGRU unit,\nwhich can model the transient variation and motion trend in a unified way. The\nsecond is that we apply the MotionGRU to RNN-based predictive models and\nindicate a new flexible video prediction architecture with a Motion Highway\nthat can significantly improve the ability to predict changeable motions and\navoid motion vanishing for stacked multiple-layer predictive models. With high\nflexibility, this framework can adapt to a series of models for deterministic\nspatiotemporal prediction.

However, recent studies show that deep\nmodels for thoracic disease classification usually show degraded performance\nwhen applied to external data. Such phenomena can be categorized into shortcut\nlearning, where the deep models learn unintended decision rules that can fit\nthe identically distributed training and test set but fail to generalize to\nother distributions. A natural way to alleviate this defect is explicitly\nindicating the lesions and focusing the model on learning the intended\nfeatures. In this paper, we conduct extensive retrospective experiments to\ncompare a popular thoracic disease classification model, CheXNet, and a\nthoracic lesion detection model, CheXDet. We first showed that the two models\nachieved similar image-level classification performance on the internal test\nset with no significant differences under many scenarios. Meanwhile, we found\nincorporating external training data even led to performance degradation for\nCheXNet. Then, we compared the models' internal performance on the lesion\nlocalization task and showed that CheXDet achieved significantly better\nperformance than CheXNet even when given 80% less training data. By further\nvisualizing the models' decision-making regions, we revealed that CheXNet\nlearned patterns other than the target lesions, demonstrating its shortcut\nlearning defect. Moreover, CheXDet achieved significantly better external\nperformance than CheXNet on both the image-level classification task and the\nlesion localization task. Our findings suggest improving annotation granularity\nfor training deep learning systems as a promising way to elevate future deep\nlearning-based diagnosis systems for clinical usage.",

          "description": "Many current neural networks for medical imaging generalise poorly to data\nunseen during training. Such behaviour can be caused by networks overfitting\neasy-to-learn, or statistically dominant, features while disregarding other\npotentially informative features. For example, indistinguishable differences in\nthe sharpness of the images from two different scanners can degrade the\nperformance of the network significantly. All neural networks intended for\nclinical practice need to be robust to variation in data caused by differences\nin imaging equipment, sample preparation and patient populations.\n\nTo address these challenges, we evaluate the utility of spectral decoupling\nas an implicit bias mitigation method. Spectral decoupling encourages the\nneural network to learn more features by simply regularising the networks'\nunnormalised prediction scores with an L2 penalty, thus having no added\ncomputational costs.\n\nWe show that spectral decoupling allows training neural networks on datasets\nwith strong spurious correlations. Networks trained without spectral decoupling\ndo not learn the original task and appear to make false predictions based on\nthe spurious correlations. Spectral decoupling also increases networks'\nrobustness for data distribution shifts. To validate our findings, we train\nnetworks with and without spectral decoupling to detect prostate cancer tissue\nslides and COVID-19 in chest radiographs. Networks trained with spectral\ndecoupling achieve substantially higher performance on all evaluation datasets.\n\nOur results show that spectral decoupling helps with generalisation issues\nassociated with neural networks. We recommend using spectral decoupling as an\nimplicit bias mitigation method in any neural network intended for clinical\nuse.",

          "description": "With the rapid development of social websites, recent years have witnessed an\nexplosive growth of social images with user-provided tags which continuously\narrive in a streaming fashion. Due to the fast query speed and low storage\ncost, hashing-based methods for image search have attracted increasing\nattention. However, existing hashing methods for social image retrieval are\nbased on batch mode which violates the nature of social images, i.e., social\nimages are usually generated periodically or collected in a stream fashion.\nAlthough there exist many online image hashing methods, they either adopt\nunsupervised learning which ignore the relevant tags, or are designed in the\nsupervised manner which needs high-quality labels. In this paper, to overcome\nthe above limitations, we propose a new method named Weakly-supervised Online\nHashing (WOH). In order to learn high-quality hash codes, WOH exploits the weak\nsupervision by considering the semantics of tags and removing the noise.\nBesides, We develop a discrete online optimization algorithm for WOH, which is\nefficient and scalable. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of WOH compared with several\nstate-of-the-art hashing baselines.",

          "description": "Autonomous vehicles rely heavily upon their perception subsystems to see the\nenvironment in which they operate. Unfortunately, the effect of variable\nweather conditions presents a significant challenge to object detection\nalgorithms, and thus it is imperative to test the vehicle extensively in all\nconditions which it may experience. However, development of robust autonomous\nvehicle subsystems requires repeatable, controlled testing - while real weather\nis unpredictable and cannot be scheduled. Real-world testing in adverse\nconditions is an expensive and time-consuming task, often requiring access to\nspecialist facilities. Simulation is commonly relied upon as a substitute, with\nincreasingly visually realistic representations of the real-world being\ndeveloped. In the context of the complete autonomous vehicle control pipeline,\nsubsystems downstream of perception need to be tested with accurate recreations\nof the perception system output, rather than focusing on subjective visual\nrealism of the input - whether in simulation or the real world. This study\ndevelops the untapped potential of a lightweight weather augmentation method in\nan autonomous racing vehicle - focusing not on visual accuracy, but rather the\neffect upon perception subsystem performance in real time. With minimal\nadjustment, the prototype developed in this study can replicate the effects of\nwater droplets on the camera lens, and fading light conditions. This approach\nintroduces a latency of less than 8 ms using compute hardware well suited to\nbeing carried in the vehicle - rendering it ideal for real-time implementation\nthat can be run during experiments in simulation, and augmented reality testing\nin the real world.",

          "description": "To safely navigate unknown environments, robots must accurately perceive\ndynamic obstacles. Instead of directly measuring the scene depth with a LiDAR\nsensor, we explore the use of a much cheaper and higher resolution sensor:\nprogrammable light curtains. Light curtains are controllable depth sensors that\nsense only along a surface that a user selects. We use light curtains to\nestimate the safety envelope of a scene: a hypothetical surface that separates\nthe robot from all obstacles. We show that generating light curtains that sense\nrandom locations (from a particular distribution) can quickly discover the\nsafety envelope for scenes with unknown objects. Importantly, we produce\ntheoretical safety guarantees on the probability of detecting an obstacle using\nrandom curtains. We combine random curtains with a machine learning based model\nthat forecasts and tracks the motion of the safety envelope efficiently. Our\nmethod accurately estimates safety envelopes while providing probabilistic\nsafety guarantees that can be used to certify the efficacy of a robot\nperception system to detect and avoid dynamic obstacles. We evaluate our\napproach in a simulated urban driving environment and a real-world environment\nwith moving pedestrians using a light curtain device and show that we can\nestimate safety envelopes efficiently and effectively.

          "description": "Precise localization of polyp is crucial for early cancer screening in\ngastrointestinal endoscopy. Videos given by endoscopy bring both richer\ncontextual information as well as more challenges than still images. The\ncamera-moving situation, instead of the common camera-fixed-object-moving one,\nleads to significant background variation between frames. Severe internal\nartifacts (e.g. water flow in the human body, specular reflection by tissues)\ncan make the quality of adjacent frames vary considerately. These factors\nhinder a video-based model to effectively aggregate features from neighborhood\nframes and give better predictions. In this paper, we present Spatial-Temporal\nFeature Transformation (STFT), a multi-frame collaborative framework to address\nthese issues. Spatially, STFT mitigates inter-frame variations in the\ncamera-moving situation with feature alignment by proposal-guided deformable\nconvolutions. Temporally, STFT proposes a channel-aware attention module to\nsimultaneously estimate the quality and correlation of adjacent frames for\nadaptive feature aggregation. Empirical studies and superior results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method. For example, STFT\nimproves the still image baseline FCOS by 10.6% and 20.6% on the comprehensive\nF1-score of the polyp localization task in CVC-Clinic and ASUMayo datasets,\nrespectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art video-based method by 3.6%\nand 8.0%, respectively.

          "description": "Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems on pixel domain use low-level\nfeatures, such as colour, texture and shape, to retrieve images. In this\ncontext, two types of image representations i.e. local and global image\nfeatures have been studied in the literature. Extracting these features from\npixel images and comparing them with images from the database is very\ntime-consuming. Therefore, in recent years, there has been some effort to\naccomplish image analysis directly in the compressed domain with lesser\ncomputations. Furthermore, most of the images in our daily transactions are\nstored in the JPEG compressed format. Therefore, it would be ideal if we could\nretrieve features directly from the partially decoded or compressed data and\nuse them for retrieval. Here, we propose a unified model for image retrieval\nwhich takes DCT coefficients as input and efficiently extracts global and local\nfeatures directly in the JPEG compressed domain for accurate image retrieval.\nThe experimental findings indicate that our proposed model performed similarly\nto the current DELG model which takes RGB features as an input with reference\nto mean average precision while having a faster training and retrieval speed.",

          "description": "Complex sensors like video cameras include tens of configurable parameters,\nwhich can be set by end-users to customize the sensors to specific application\nscenarios. Although parameter settings significantly affect the quality of the\nsensor output and the accuracy of insights derived from sensor data, most\nend-users use a fixed parameter setting because they lack the skill or\nunderstanding to appropriately configure these parameters. We propose CamTuner,\nwhich is a system to automatically, and dynamically adapt the complex sensor to\nchanging environments. CamTuner includes two key components. First, a bespoke\nanalytics quality estimator, which is a deep-learning model to automatically\nand continuously estimate the quality of insights from an analytics unit as the\nenvironment around a sensor change. Second, a reinforcement learning (RL)\nmodule, which reacts to the changes in quality, and automatically adjusts the\ncamera parameters to enhance the accuracy of insights. We improve the training\ntime of the RL module by an order of magnitude by designing virtual models to\nmimic essential behavior of the camera: we design virtual knobs that can be set\nto different values to mimic the effects of assigning different values to the\ncamera's configurable parameters, and we design a virtual camera model that\nmimics the output from a video camera at different times of the day. These\nvirtual models significantly accelerate training because (a) frame rates from a\nreal camera are limited to 25-30 fps while the virtual models enable processing\nat 300 fps, (b) we do not have to wait until the real camera sees different\nenvironments, which could take weeks or months, and (c) virtual knobs can be\nupdated instantly, while it can take 200-500 ms to change the camera parameter\nsettings. Our dynamic tuning approach results in up to 12% improvement in the\naccuracy of insights from several video analytics tasks.",

          "description": "This paper presents a new insight into improving the performance of\nStochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) by using Isolation kernel instead of\nGaussian kernel. Isolation kernel outperforms Gaussian kernel in two aspects.\nFirst, the use of Isolation kernel in t-SNE overcomes the drawback of\nmisrepresenting some structures in the data, which often occurs when Gaussian\nkernel is applied in t-SNE. This is because Gaussian kernel determines each\nlocal bandwidth based on one local point only, while Isolation kernel is\nderived directly from the data based on space partitioning. Second, the use of\nIsolation kernel yields a more efficient similarity computation because\ndata-dependent Isolation kernel has only one parameter that needs to be tuned.\nIn contrast, the use of data-independent Gaussian kernel increases the\ncomputational cost by determining n bandwidths for a dataset of n points. As\nthe root cause of these deficiencies in t-SNE is Gaussian kernel, we show that\nsimply replacing Gaussian kernel with Isolation kernel in t-SNE significantly\nimproves the quality of the final visualisation output (without creating\nmisrepresented structures) and removes one key obstacle that prevents t-SNE\nfrom processing large datasets. Moreover, Isolation kernel enables t-SNE to\ndeal with large-scale datasets in less runtime without trading off accuracy,\nunlike existing methods in speeding up t-SNE.",

          "description": "PSNR and SSIM are the most widely used metrics in super-resolution problems,\nbecause they are easy to use and can evaluate the similarities between\ngenerated images and reference images. However, single image super-resolution\nis an ill-posed problem, there are multiple corresponding high-resolution\nimages for the same low-resolution image. The similarities can't totally\nreflect the restoration effect. The perceptual quality of generated images is\nalso important, but PSNR and SSIM do not reflect perceptual quality well. To\nsolve the problem, we proposed a method called regional differential\ninformation entropy to measure both of the similarities and perceptual quality.\nTo overcome the problem that traditional image information entropy can't\nreflect the structure information, we proposed to measure every region's\ninformation entropy with sliding window. Considering that the human visual\nsystem is more sensitive to the brightness difference at low brightness, we\ntake $\\gamma$ quantization rather than linear quantization. To accelerate the\nmethod, we reorganized the calculation procedure of information entropy with a\nneural network.

          "description": "Anticipating human motion in crowded scenarios is essential for developing\nintelligent transportation systems, social-aware robots and advanced video\nsurveillance applications. A key component of this task is represented by the\ninherently multi-modal nature of human paths which makes socially acceptable\nmultiple futures when human interactions are involved. To this end, we propose\na generative architecture for multi-future trajectory predictions based on\nConditional Variational Recurrent Neural Networks (C-VRNNs). Conditioning\nmainly relies on prior belief maps, representing most likely moving directions\nand forcing the model to consider past observed dynamics in generating future\npositions. Human interactions are modeled with a graph-based attention\nmechanism enabling an online attentive hidden state refinement of the recurrent\nestimation. To corroborate our model, we perform extensive experiments on\npublicly-available datasets (e.g., ETH/UCY, Stanford Drone Dataset, STATS\nSportVU NBA, Intersection Drone Dataset and TrajNet++) and demonstrate its\neffectiveness in crowded scenes compared to several state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Face recognition approaches often rely on equal image resolution for\nverification faces on two images. However, in practical applications, those\nimage resolutions are usually not in the same range due to different image\ncapture mechanisms or sources. In this work, we first analyze the impact of\nimage resolutions on the face verification performance with a state-of-the-art\nface recognition model. For images, synthetically reduced to $5\\, \\times 5\\,\n\\mathrm{px}$ resolution, the verification performance drops from $99.23\\%$\nincreasingly down to almost $55\\%$. Especially, for cross-resolution image\npairs (one high- and one low-resolution image), the verification accuracy\ndecreases even further. We investigate this behavior more in-depth by looking\nat the feature distances for every 2-image test pair. To tackle this problem,\nwe propose the following two methods: 1) Train a state-of-the-art\nface-recognition model straightforward with $50\\%$ low-resolution images\ndirectly within each batch. \\\\ 2) Train a siamese-network structure and adding\na cosine distance feature loss between high- and low-resolution features. Both\nmethods show an improvement for cross-resolution scenarios and can increase the\naccuracy at very low resolution to approximately $70\\%$. However, a\ndisadvantage is that a specific model needs to be trained for every\nresolution-pair ...",

          "description": "We propose an atlas-based method to segment the intracochlear anatomy (ICA)\nin the post-implantation CT (Post-CT) images of cochlear implant (CI)\nrecipients that preserves the point-to-point correspondence between the meshes\nin the atlas and the segmented volumes. To solve this problem, which is\nchallenging because of the strong artifacts produced by the implant, we use a\npair of co-trained deep networks that generate dense deformation fields (DDFs)\nin opposite directions. One network is tasked with registering an atlas image\nto the Post-CT images and the other network is tasked with registering the\nPost-CT images to the atlas image. The networks are trained using loss\nfunctions based on voxel-wise labels, image content, fiducial registration\nerror, and cycle-consistency constraint. The segmentation of the ICA in the\nPost-CT images is subsequently obtained by transferring the predefined\nsegmentation meshes of the ICA in the atlas image to the Post-CT images using\nthe corresponding DDFs generated by the trained registration networks. Our\nmodel can learn the underlying geometric features of the ICA even though they\nare obscured by the metal artifacts. We show that our end-to-end network\nproduces results that are comparable to the current state of the art (SOTA)\nthat relies on a two-steps approach that first uses conditional generative\nadversarial networks to synthesize artifact-free images from the Post-CT images\nand then uses an active shape model-based method to segment the ICA in the\nsynthetic images. Our method requires a fraction of the time needed by the\nSOTA, which is important for end-user acceptance.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have increased the accuracy of automatic segmentation,\nhowever, their accuracy depends on the availability of a large number of fully\nsegmented images. Methods to train deep neural networks using images for which\nsome, but not all, regions of interest are segmented are necessary to make\nbetter use of partially annotated datasets. In this paper, we propose the first\naxiomatic definition of label-set loss functions that are the loss functions\nthat can handle partially segmented images. We prove that there is one and only\none method to convert a classical loss function for fully segmented images into\na proper label-set loss function.

Using the leaf-Dice loss, we\nset a new state of the art in partially supervised learning for fetal brain 3D\nMRI segmentation.

          "description": "Online continual learning aims to learn from a non-IID stream of data from a\nnumber of different tasks, where the learner is only allowed to consider data\nonce. Methods are typically allowed to use a limited buffer to store some of\nthe images in the stream. Recently, it was found that feature replay, where an\nintermediate layer representation of the image is stored (or generated) leads\nto superior results than image replay, while requiring less memory. Quantized\nexemplars can further reduce the memory usage. However, a drawback of these\nmethods is that they use a fixed (or very intransigent) backbone network. This\nsignificantly limits the learning of representations that can discriminate\nbetween all tasks. To address this problem, we propose an auxiliary classifier\nauto-encoder (ACAE) module for feature replay at intermediate layers with high\ncompression rates. The reduced memory footprint per image allows us to save\nmore exemplars for replay. In our experiments, we conduct task-agnostic\nevaluation under online continual learning setting and get state-of-the-art\nperformance on ImageNet-Subset, CIFAR100 and CIFAR10 dataset.",

          "description": "Video-based human pose estimation (HPE) is a vital yet challenging task.\nWhile deep learning methods have made significant progress for the HPE, most\napproaches to this task detect each joint independently, damaging the pose\nstructural information. In this paper, unlike the prior methods, we propose a\nRelation-based Pose Semantics Transfer Network (RPSTN) to locate joints\nassociatively. Specifically, we design a lightweight joint relation extractor\n(JRE) to model the pose structural features and associatively generate heatmaps\nfor joints by modeling the relation between any two joints heuristically\ninstead of building each joint heatmap independently. Actually, the proposed\nJRE module models the spatial configuration of human poses through the\nrelationship between any two joints. Moreover, considering the temporal\nsemantic continuity of videos, the pose semantic information in the current\nframe is beneficial for guiding the location of joints in the next frame.\nTherefore, we use the idea of knowledge reuse to propagate the pose semantic\ninformation between consecutive frames. In this way, the proposed RPSTN\ncaptures temporal dynamics of poses. On the one hand, the JRE module can infer\ninvisible joints according to the relationship between the invisible joints and\nother visible joints in space. On the other hand, in the time, the propose\nmodel can transfer the pose semantic features from the non-occluded frame to\nthe occluded frame to locate occluded joints. Therefore, our method is robust\nto the occlusion and achieves state-of-the-art results on the two challenging\ndatasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness for video-based human pose\nestimation. We will release the code and models publicly.",

We review and rethink the\nrecent progress from three perspectives. First, given that there is no explicit\nand complete definition of pedestrian attribute recognition, we formally define\nand distinguish pedestrian attribute recognition from other similar tasks.\nSecond, based on the proposed definition, we expose the limitations of the\nexisting datasets, which violate the academic norm and are inconsistent with\nthe essential requirement of practical industry application. Thus, we propose\ntwo datasets, PETA\\textsubscript{$ZS$} and RAP\\textsubscript{$ZS$}, constructed\nfollowing the zero-shot settings on pedestrian identity. In addition, we also\nintroduce several realistic criteria for future pedestrian attribute dataset\nconstruction.

          "description": "Point clouds and RGB images are naturally complementary modalities for 3D\nvisual understanding - the former provides sparse but accurate locations of\npoints on objects, while the latter contains dense color and texture\ninformation. Despite this potential for close sensor fusion, many methods train\ntwo models in isolation and use simple feature concatenation to represent 3D\nsensor data. This separated training scheme results in potentially sub-optimal\nperformance and prevents 3D tasks from being used to benefit 2D tasks that are\noften useful on their own. To provide a more integrated approach, we propose a\nnovel Multi-Modality Task Cascade network (MTC-RCNN) that leverages 3D box\nproposals to improve 2D segmentation predictions, which are then used to\nfurther refine the 3D boxes. We show that including a 2D network between two\nstages of 3D modules significantly improves both 2D and 3D task performance.\nMoreover, to prevent the 3D module from over-relying on the overfitted 2D\npredictions, we propose a dual-head 2D segmentation training and inference\nscheme, allowing the 2nd 3D module to learn to interpret imperfect 2D\nsegmentation predictions. Evaluating our model on the challenging SUN RGB-D\ndataset, we improve upon state-of-the-art results of both single modality and\nfusion networks by a large margin ($\\textbf{+3.8}$ mAP@0.5).

While this problem can be mitigated by using the\ntarget domain data to align the source and target domain feature\nrepresentations, the target domain data may be unavailable due to privacy\nconcerns. Consequently, there is a need for methods that generalize well\nwithout access to target domain data during training. In this work, we propose\nan adversarial hallucination approach, which combines a class-wise\nhallucination module and a semantic segmentation module. Since the segmentation\nperformance varies across different classes, we design a semantic-conditioned\nstyle hallucination layer to adaptively stylize each class. The classwise\nstylization parameters are generated from the semantic knowledge in the\nsegmentation probability maps of the source domain image. Both modules compete\nadversarially, with the hallucination module generating increasingly\n'difficult' style images to challenge the segmentation module. In response, the\nsegmentation module improves its performance as it is trained with generated\nsamples at an appropriate class-wise difficulty level.

          "description": "In cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, a 3D high-resolution\nsegmentation of the heart is essential for detailed description of its\nanatomical structures. However, due to the limit of acquisition duration and\nrespiratory/cardiac motion, stacks of multi-slice 2D images are acquired in\nclinical routine. The segmentation of these images provides a low-resolution\nrepresentation of cardiac anatomy, which may contain artefacts caused by\nmotion. Here we propose a novel latent optimisation framework that jointly\nperforms motion correction and super resolution for cardiac image\nsegmentations. Given a low-resolution segmentation as input, the framework\naccounts for inter-slice motion in cardiac MR imaging and super-resolves the\ninput into a high-resolution segmentation consistent with input. A multi-view\nloss is incorporated to leverage information from both short-axis view and\nlong-axis view of cardiac imaging. To solve the inverse problem, iterative\noptimisation is performed in a latent space, which ensures the anatomical\nplausibility. This alleviates the need of paired low-resolution and\nhigh-resolution images for supervised learning. Experiments on two cardiac MR\ndatasets show that the proposed framework achieves high performance, comparable\nto state-of-the-art super-resolution approaches and with better cross-domain\ngeneralisability and anatomical plausibility.",

Since transformer-based\nmodels are effective at capturing dependencies over extended temporal spans, we\npropose a simple learning procedure that forces the model to match a long-term\nview to a short-term view of the same video. Our approach, named Long-Short\nTemporal Contrastive Learning (LSTCL), enables video transformers to learn an\neffective clip-level representation by predicting temporal context captured\nfrom a longer temporal extent. To demonstrate the generality of our findings,\nwe implement and validate our approach under three different self-supervised\ncontrastive learning frameworks (MoCo v3, BYOL, SimSiam) using two distinct\nvideo-transformer architectures, including an improved variant of the Swin\nTransformer augmented with space-time attention.

To date, an\nextensive variety of studies have reported on vision based traffic safety\nsystem. However, many studies required manual inspection of the volumes of\ntraffic video to reliably obtain traffic related objects behavioral factors. In\nthis paper, we propose an automated and simpler system for effectively\nextracting object behavioral features from video sensors deployed on the road.\nWe conduct basic statistical analysis on these features, and show how they can\nbe useful for monitoring the traffic behavior on the road. We confirm the\nfeasibility of the proposed system by applying our prototype to two\nunsignalized crosswalks in Osan city, South Korea. To conclude, we compare\nbehaviors of vehicles and pedestrians in those two areas by simple statistical\nanalysis.

It has become a challenge for a nations\nsurvival and hence has evolved to cyber warfare. Malware is a key component of\ncyber-crime, and its analysis is the first line of defence against attack. This\nwork proposes a novel deep boosted hybrid learning-based malware classification\nframework and named as Deep boosted Feature Space-based Malware classification\n(DFS-MC). In the proposed framework, the discrimination power is enhanced by\nfusing the feature spaces of the best performing customized CNN architectures\nmodels and its discrimination by an SVM for classification. The discrimination\ncapacity of the proposed classification framework is assessed by comparing it\nagainst the standard customized CNNs. The customized CNN models are implemented\nin two ways: softmax classifier and deep hybrid learning-based malware\nclassification. In the hybrid learning, Deep features are extracted from\ncustomized CNN architectures and fed into the conventional machine learning\nclassifier to improve the classification performance. We also introduced the\nconcept of transfer learning in a customized CNN architecture based malware\nclassification framework through fine-tuning. The performance of the proposed\nmalware classification approaches are validated on the MalImg malware dataset\nusing the hold-out cross-validation technique. Experimental comparisons were\nconducted by employing innovative, customized CNN, trained from scratch and\nfine-tuning the customized CNN using transfer learning. The proposed\nclassification framework DFS-MC showed improved results, Accuracy: 98.61%,\nF-score: 0.96, Precision: 0.96, and Recall: 0.96.",

Most existing approaches have been proposed to\nrealize motion prediction. However, they ignore an important task, the\nevaluation of the quality of the predicted result. It is far more enough for\ncurrent approaches in actual scenarios because people can't know how to\ninteract with the machine without the evaluation of prediction, and unreliable\npredictions may mislead the machine to harm the human. Hence, we propose an\nuncertainty-aware framework for human motion prediction (UA-HMP).

Then, an\nuncertainty-guided learning scheme is proposed to quantitate the uncertainty\nand reduce the negative effect of the noisy samples during optimization for\nbetter performance. Our proposed framework is easily combined with current SOTA\nbaselines to overcome their weakness in uncertainty modeling with slight\nparameters increment.

          "description": "Crowd counting is critical for numerous video surveillance scenarios. One of\nthe main issues in this task is how to handle the dramatic scale variations of\npedestrians caused by the perspective effect. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes a novel convolution neural network-based crowd counting method, termed\nPerspective-guided Fractional-Dilation Network (PFDNet). By modeling the\ncontinuous scale variations, the proposed PFDNet is able to select the proper\nfractional dilation kernels for adapting to different spatial locations. It\nsignificantly improves the flexibility of the state-of-the-arts that only\nconsider the discrete representative scales. In addition, by avoiding the\nmulti-scale or multi-column architecture that used in other methods, it is\ncomputationally more efficient. In practice, the proposed PFDNet is constructed\nby stacking multiple Perspective-guided Fractional-Dilation Convolutions (PFC)\non a VGG16-BN backbone. By introducing a novel generalized dilation convolution\noperation, the PFC can handle fractional dilation ratios in the spatial domain\nunder the guidance of perspective annotations, achieving continuous scales\nmodeling of pedestrians. To deal with the problem of unavailable perspective\ninformation in some cases, we further introduce an effective perspective\nestimation branch to the proposed PFDNet, which can be trained in either\nsupervised or weakly-supervised setting once the branch has been pre-trained.\nExtensive experiments show that the proposed PFDNet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on ShanghaiTech A, ShanghaiTech B, WorldExpo'10,\nUCF-QNRF, UCF_CC_50 and TRANCOS dataset, achieving MAE 53.8, 6.5, 6.8, 84.3,\n205.8, and 3.06 respectively.",

          "description": "Adversarial robustness of deep neural networks has been actively\ninvestigated. However, most existing defense approaches are limited to a\nspecific type of adversarial perturbations. Specifically, they often fail to\noffer resistance to multiple attack types simultaneously, i.e., they lack\nmulti-perturbation robustness. Furthermore, compared to image recognition\nproblems, the adversarial robustness of video recognition models is relatively\nunexplored. While several studies have proposed how to generate adversarial\nvideos, only a handful of approaches about the defense strategies have been\npublished in the literature. In this paper, we propose one of the first defense\nstrategies against multiple types of adversarial videos for video recognition.\nThe proposed method, referred to as MultiBN, performs adversarial training on\nmultiple adversarial video types using multiple independent batch normalization\n(BN) layers with a learning-based BN selection module. With a multiple BN\nstructure, each BN brach is responsible for learning the distribution of a\nsingle perturbation type and thus provides more precise distribution\nestimations. This mechanism benefits dealing with multiple perturbation types.\nThe BN selection module detects the attack type of an input video and sends it\nto the corresponding BN branch, making MultiBN fully automatic and allow\nend-to-end training. Compared to present adversarial training approaches, the\nproposed MultiBN exhibits stronger multi-perturbation robustness against\ndifferent and even unforeseen adversarial video types, ranging from Lp-bounded\nattacks and physically realizable attacks. This holds true on different\ndatasets and target models. Moreover, we conduct an extensive analysis to study\nthe properties of the multiple BN structure.",

Recently, two works have been proposed\nto detect saliency ranking by assigning different degrees of saliency to\ndifferent objects.

We present a novel unified model as the first end-to-end\nsolution, where an improved Mask R-CNN is first used to segment salient\ninstances and a saliency ranking branch is then added to infer the relative\nsaliency. For relative saliency ranking, we build a new graph reasoning module\nby combining four graphs to incorporate the instance interaction relation,\nlocal contrast, global contrast, and a high-level semantic prior, respectively.\nA novel loss function is also proposed to effectively train the saliency\nranking branch. Besides, a new dataset and an evaluation metric are proposed\nfor this task, aiming at pushing forward this field of research.

          "description": "There is a prevailing trend to study urban morphology quantitatively thanks\nto the growing accessibility to various forms of spatial big data, increasing\ncomputing power, and use cases benefiting from such information. The methods\ndeveloped up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing\ndensity, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent\nmorphological features from the human's visual and intuitive perspective. We\ntake the first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based\ntechnique to automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual\nbasis. The method is implemented by generating an image of the street network\n(Colored Road Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and\nclassifying it using a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model\nachieves an overall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the\nworld are selected as the study areas with their road networks acquired from\nOpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through\nclustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent\npart of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: we apply\nour method in a case study of urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based\nregression model (LightGBM) is for the first time designated to establish the\nrelationship between morphological indices and vitality indicators. The effect\nof road network classification is found to be small but positively associated\nwith urban vitality.

However, removing a whole\nstructure is a strong topological prior and recovering the accuracy, with\nfine-tuning, is highly cumbersome. In this paper, we introduce an \"end-to-end\"\nlightweight network design that achieves training and pruning simultaneously\nwithout fine-tuning. The design principle of our method relies on\nreparametrization that learns not only the weights but also the topological\nstructure of the lightweight sub-network. This reparametrization acts as a\nprior (or regularizer) that defines pruning masks implicitly from the weights\nof the underlying network, without increasing the number of training\nparameters. Sparsity is induced with a budget loss that provides an accurate\npruning.

          "description": "There is a proliferation in the number of satellites launched each year,\nresulting in downlinking of terabytes of data each day. The data received by\nground stations is often unprocessed, making this an expensive process\nconsidering the large data sizes and that not all of the data is useful. This,\ncoupled with the increasing demand for real-time data processing, has led to a\ngrowing need for on-orbit processing solutions. In this work, we investigate\nthe performance of CNN-based object detectors on constrained devices by\napplying different image compression techniques to satellite data. We examine\nthe capabilities of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier;\nlow-power, high-performance computers, with integrated GPUs, small enough to\nfit on-board a nanosatellite. We take a closer look at object detection\nnetworks, including the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Region-based\nFully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) models that are pre-trained on DOTA - a\nLarge Scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images. The performance is\nmeasured in terms of execution time, memory consumption, and accuracy, and are\ncompared against a baseline containing a server with two powerful GPUs. The\nresults show that by applying image compression techniques, we are able to\nimprove the execution time and memory consumption, achieving a fully runnable\ndataset. A lossless compression technique achieves roughly a 10% reduction in\nexecution time and about a 3% reduction in memory consumption, with no impact\non the accuracy. While a lossy compression technique improves the execution\ntime by up to 144% and the memory consumption is reduced by as much as 97%.\nHowever, it has a significant impact on accuracy, varying depending on the\ncompression ratio. Thus the application and ratio of these compression\ntechniques may differ depending on the required level of accuracy for a\nparticular task.",

          "description": "Risk assessment is relevant in any workplace, however there is a degree of\nunpredictability when dealing with flammable or hazardous materials so that\ndetection of fire accidents by itself may not be enough. An example of this is\nthe impingement of jet fires, where the heat fluxes of the flame could reach\nnearby equipment and dramatically increase the probability of a domino effect\nwith catastrophic results. Because of this, the characterization of such fire\naccidents is important from a risk management point of view. One such\ncharacterization would be the segmentation of different radiation zones within\nthe flame, so this paper presents an exploratory research regarding several\ntraditional computer vision and Deep Learning segmentation approaches to solve\nthis specific problem. A data set of propane jet fires is used to train and\nevaluate the different approaches and given the difference in the distribution\nof the zones and background of the images, different loss functions, that seek\nto alleviate data imbalance, are also explored. Additionally, different metrics\nare correlated to a manual ranking performed by experts to make an evaluation\nthat closely resembles the expert's criteria. The Hausdorff Distance and\nAdjsted Random Index were the metrics with the highest correlation and the best\nresults were obtained from the UNet architecture with a Weighted Cross-Entropy\nLoss. These results can be used in future research to extract more geometric\ninformation from the segmentation masks or could even be implemented on other\ntypes of fire accidents.",

          "description": "As the data scale grows, deep recognition models often suffer from\nlong-tailed data distributions due to the heavy imbalanced sample number across\ncategories. Indeed, real-world data usually exhibit some similarity relation\namong different categories (e.g., pigeons and sparrows), called category\nsimilarity in this work. It is doubly difficult when the imbalance occurs\nbetween such categories with similar appearances. However, existing solutions\nmainly focus on the sample number to re-balance data distribution. In this\nwork, we systematically investigate the essence of the long-tailed problem from\na unified perspective. Specifically, we demonstrate that long-tailed\nrecognition suffers from both sample number and category similarity.\nIntuitively, using a toy example, we first show that sample number is not the\nunique influence factor for performance dropping of long-tailed recognition.\nTheoretically, we demonstrate that (1) category similarity, as an inevitable\nfactor, would also influence the model learning under long-tailed distribution\nvia similar samples, (2) using more discriminative representation methods\n(e.g., self-supervised learning) for similarity reduction, the classifier bias\ncan be further alleviated with greatly improved performance. Extensive\nexperiments on several long-tailed datasets verify the rationality of our\ntheoretical analysis, and show that based on existing state-of-the-arts\n(SOTAs), the performance could be further improved by similarity reduction. Our\ninvestigations highlight the essence behind the long-tailed problem, and claim\nseveral feasible directions for future work.",

          "description": "Optical flow estimation is a fundamental problem of computer vision and has\nmany applications in the fields of robot learning and autonomous driving. This\npaper reveals novel geometric laws of optical flow based on the insight and\ndetailed definition of non-occlusion. Then, two novel loss functions are\nproposed for the unsupervised learning of optical flow based on the geometric\nlaws of non-occlusion. Specifically, after the occlusion part of the images are\nmasked, the flowing process of pixels is carefully considered and geometric\nconstraints are conducted based on the geometric laws of optical flow. First,\nneighboring pixels in the first frame will not intersect during the pixel\ndisplacement to the second frame. Secondly, when the cluster containing\nadjacent four pixels in the first frame moves to the second frame, no other\npixels will flow into the quadrilateral formed by them. According to the two\ngeometrical constraints, the optical flow non-intersection loss and the optical\nflow non-blocking loss in the non-occlusion regions are proposed. Two loss\nfunctions punish the irregular and inexact optical flows in the non-occlusion\nregions. The experiments on datasets demonstrated that the proposed\nunsupervised losses of optical flow based on the geometric laws in\nnon-occlusion regions make the estimated optical flow more refined in detail,\nand improve the performance of unsupervised learning of optical flow. In\naddition, the experiments training on synthetic data and evaluating on real\ndata show that the generalization ability of optical flow network is improved\nby our proposed unsupervised approach.",

          "description": "Transformer models have recently attracted much interest from computer vision\nresearchers and have since been successfully employed for several problems\ntraditionally addressed with convolutional neural networks. At the same time,\nimage synthesis using generative adversarial networks (GANs) has drastically\nimproved over the last few years. The recently proposed TransGAN is the first\nGAN using only transformer-based architectures and achieves competitive results\nwhen compared to convolutional GANs. However, since transformers are\ndata-hungry architectures, TransGAN requires data augmentation, an auxiliary\nsuper-resolution task during training, and a masking prior to guide the\nself-attention mechanism. In this paper, we study the combination of a\ntransformer-based generator and convolutional discriminator and successfully\nremove the need of the aforementioned required design choices. We evaluate our\napproach by conducting a benchmark of well-known CNN discriminators, ablate the\nsize of the transformer-based generator, and show that combining both\narchitectural elements into a hybrid model leads to better results.\nFurthermore, we investigate the frequency spectrum properties of generated\nimages and observe that our model retains the benefits of an attention based\ngenerator.",

Nevertheless, the uncertainty is\nusually measured by the variances between predictions in a multiple trial way.\nIt is not intuitive, and there is no exact correspondence in the image.\nInspired by image matting, we introduce matting as a soft segmentation method\nand a new perspective to deal with and represent uncertain regions into medical\nscenes, namely medical matting. More specifically, because there is no\navailable medical matting dataset, we first labeled two medical datasets with\nalpha matte. Secondly, the matting method applied to the natural image is not\nsuitable for the medical scene, so we propose a new architecture to generate\nbinary masks and alpha matte in a row. Thirdly, the uncertainty map is\nintroduced to highlight the ambiguous regions from the binary results and\nimprove the matting performance.

          "description": "Shape completion is the problem of completing partial input shapes such as\npartial scans. This problem finds important applications in computer vision and\nrobotics due to issues such as occlusion or sparsity in real-world data.\nHowever, most of the existing research related to shape completion has been\nfocused on completing shapes by learning a one-to-one mapping which limits the\ndiversity and creativity of the produced results. We propose a novel multimodal\nshape completion technique that is effectively able to learn a one-to-many\nmapping and generates diverse complete shapes. Our approach is based on the\nconditional Implicit MaximumLikelihood Estimation (IMLE) technique wherein we\ncondition our inputs on partial 3D point clouds. We extensively evaluate our\napproach by comparing it to various baselines both quantitatively and\nqualitatively. We show that our method is superior to alternatives in terms of\ncompleteness and diversity of shapes.",

          "description": "Traditionally, CNN models possess hierarchical structures and utilize the\nfeature mapping of the last layer to obtain the prediction output. However, it\ncan be difficulty to settle the optimal network depth and make the middle\nlayers learn distinguished features. This paper proposes the Interflow\nalgorithm specially for traditional CNN models. Interflow divides CNNs into\nseveral stages according to the depth and makes predictions by the feature\nmappings in each stage. Subsequently, we input these prediction branches into a\nwell-designed attention module, which learns the weights of these prediction\nbranches, aggregates them and obtains the final output. Interflow weights and\nfuses the features learned in both shallower and deeper layers, making the\nfeature information at each stage processed reasonably and effectively,\nenabling the middle layers to learn more distinguished features, and enhancing\nthe model representation ability. In addition, Interflow can alleviate gradient\nvanishing problem, lower the difficulty of network depth selection, and lighten\npossible over-fitting problem by introducing attention mechanism. Besides, it\ncan avoid network degradation as a byproduct. Compared with the original model,\nthe CNN model with Interflow achieves higher test accuracy on multiple\nbenchmark datasets.",

          "description": "Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely employed to\npromote the face hallucination due to the ability to predict high-frequency\ndetails from a large number of samples. However, most of them fail to take into\naccount the overall facial profile and fine texture details simultaneously,\nresulting in reduced naturalness and fidelity of the reconstructed face, and\nfurther impairing the performance of downstream tasks (e.g., face detection,\nfacial recognition). To tackle this issue, we propose a novel external-internal\nsplit attention group (ESAG), which encompasses two paths responsible for\nfacial structure information and facial texture details, respectively. By\nfusing the features from these two paths, the consistency of facial structure\nand the fidelity of facial details are strengthened at the same time. Then, we\npropose a split-attention in split-attention network (SISN) to reconstruct\nphotorealistic high-resolution facial images by cascading several ESAGs.\nExperimental results on face hallucination and face recognition unveil that the\nproposed method not only significantly improves the clarity of hallucinated\nfaces, but also encourages the subsequent face recognition performance\nsubstantially.

Most of the state-of-the-arts focus on\nshort-range spatio-temporal modeling and then average multiple snippet-level\npredictions to yield the final video-level prediction. Thus, their video-level\nprediction does not consider spatio-temporal features of how video evolves\nalong the temporal dimension. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dynamic\nSegment Aggregation (DSA) module to capture relationship among snippets. To be\nmore specific, we attempt to generate a dynamic kernel for a convolutional\noperation to aggregate long-range temporal information among adjacent snippets\nadaptively. The DSA module is an efficient plug-and-play module and can be\ncombined with the off-the-shelf clip-based models (i.e., TSM, I3D) to perform\npowerful long-range modeling with minimal overhead.

However, when\ntraining neural networks the loss function changes over (iteration) time due to\nthe randomized selection of a subset of the samples.

This\ninterpretation of the loss allows us to adopt Kalman filtering as an optimizer,\nas its recursive formulation is designed to estimate unknown parameters from\nnoisy measurements. Moreover, we show that the Kalman Filter dynamical model\nfor the evolution of the unknown parameters can be used to capture the gradient\ndynamics of advanced methods such as Momentum and Adam. We call this stochastic\noptimization method KaFiStO. KaFiStO is an easy to implement, scalable, and\nefficient method to train neural networks.

In practical applications, the computational cost of convolutional\nneural networks is often high with the deepening of the network and the growth\nof data volume, mostly due to a large amount of multiplication operations of\nfloating-point numbers in convolution operations. To reduce the amount of\nmultiplications, we propose a new type of CNNs called Tropical Convolutional\nNeural Networks (TCNNs) which are built on tropical convolutions in which the\nmultiplications and additions in conventional convolutional layers are replaced\nby additions and min/max operations respectively. In addition, since tropical\nconvolution operators are essentially nonlinear operators, we expect TCNNs to\nhave higher nonlinear fitting ability than conventional CNNs. In the\nexperiments, we test and analyze several different architectures of TCNNs for\nimage classification tasks in comparison with similar-sized conventional CNNs.\nThe results show that TCNN can achieve higher expressive power than ordinary\nconvolutional layers on the MNIST and CIFAR10 image data set.

          "description": "Deep learning has been successful for many computer vision tasks due to the\navailability of shared and centralised large-scale training data. However,\nincreasing awareness of privacy concerns poses new challenges to deep learning,\nespecially for human subject related recognition such as person\nre-identification (Re-ID). In this work, we solve the Re-ID problem by\ndecentralised learning from non-shared private training data distributed at\nmultiple user sites of independent multi-domain label spaces. We propose a\nnovel paradigm called Federated Person Re-Identification (FedReID) to construct\na generalisable global model (a central server) by simultaneously learning with\nmultiple privacy-preserved local models (local clients). Specifically, each\nlocal client receives global model updates from the server and trains a local\nmodel using its local data independent from all the other clients. Then, the\ncentral server aggregates transferrable local model updates to construct a\ngeneralisable global feature embedding model without accessing local data so to\npreserve local privacy. This client-server collaborative learning process is\niteratively performed under privacy control, enabling FedReID to realise\ndecentralised learning without sharing distributed data nor collecting any\ncentralised data. Extensive experiments on ten Re-ID benchmarks show that\nFedReID achieves compelling generalisation performance beyond any locally\ntrained models without using shared training data, whilst inherently protects\nthe privacy of each local client. This is uniquely advantageous over\ncontemporary Re-ID methods.",

          "description": "Multi-view clustering, a long-standing and important research problem,\nfocuses on mining complementary information from diverse views. However,\nexisting works often fuse multiple views' representations or handle clustering\nin a common feature space, which may result in their entanglement especially\nfor visual representations. To address this issue, we present a novel VAE-based\nmulti-view clustering framework (Multi-VAE) by learning disentangled visual\nrepresentations. Concretely, we define a view-common variable and multiple\nview-peculiar variables in the generative model. The prior of view-common\nvariable obeys approximately discrete Gumbel Softmax distribution, which is\nintroduced to extract the common cluster factor of multiple views. Meanwhile,\nthe prior of view-peculiar variable follows continuous Gaussian distribution,\nwhich is used to represent each view's peculiar visual factors. By controlling\nthe mutual information capacity to disentangle the view-common and\nview-peculiar representations, continuous visual information of multiple views\ncan be separated so that their common discrete cluster information can be\neffectively mined. Experimental results demonstrate that Multi-VAE enjoys the\ndisentangled and explainable visual representations, while obtaining superior\nclustering performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

Instead of producing a coarse localization\nmap that highlights the important predictive regions in the image, the proposed\nmethod outputs the specific shape that most contributes to the model output.\nThus, the proposed method improves the accuracy of saliency maps. The effect\nhas been achieved by the gradual propagation of the crude map obtained in the\ndeep layer through all preceding layers with respect to their activations. In\nvalidation tests conducted on a selected set of images, the faithfulness,\ninterpretability, and applicability of the method are evaluated.

To address this, we propose an\nimage complexity-guided network compression technique for biomedical image\nsegmentation. Given any resource constraints, our framework utilizes data\ncomplexity and network architecture to quickly estimate a compressed model\nwhich does not require network training. Specifically, we map the dataset\ncomplexity to the target network accuracy degradation caused by compression.\nSuch mapping enables us to predict the final accuracy for different network\nsizes, based on the computed dataset complexity. Thus, one may choose a\nsolution that meets both the network size and segmentation accuracy\nrequirements. Finally, the mapping is used to determine the convolutional\nlayer-wise multiplicative factor for generating a compressed network. We\nconduct experiments using 5 datasets, employing 3 commonly-used CNN\narchitectures for biomedical image segmentation as representative networks. Our\nproposed framework is shown to be effective for generating compressed\nsegmentation networks, retaining up to $\\approx 95\\%$ of the full-sized network\nsegmentation accuracy, and at the same time, utilizing $\\approx 32x$ fewer\nnetwork trainable weights (average reduction) of the full-sized networks.",

          "description": "Deepfakes pose growing challenges to the trust of information on the\nInternet. Thus, detecting deepfakes has attracted increasing attentions from\nboth academia and industry.

In this work, we aim to bridge the gap. In\nparticular, we perform a systematic measurement study to understand the\nsecurity of the state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods in adversarial\nsettings. We use two large-scale public deepfakes data sources including\nFaceForensics++ and Facebook Deepfake Detection Challenge, where the deepfakes\nare fake face images; and we train state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods.\nThese detection methods can achieve 0.94--0.99 accuracies in non-adversarial\nsettings on these datasets. However, our measurement results uncover multiple\nsecurity limitations of the deepfake detection methods in adversarial settings.\nFirst, we find that an attacker can evade a face extractor, i.e., the face\nextractor fails to extract the correct face regions, via adding small Gaussian\nnoise to its deepfake images. Second, we find that a face classifier trained\nusing deepfakes generated by one method cannot detect deepfakes generated by\nanother method, i.e., an attacker can evade detection via generating deepfakes\nusing a new method. Third, we find that an attacker can leverage backdoor\nattacks developed by the adversarial machine learning community to evade a face\nclassifier.

          "description": "Cross-view video synthesis task seeks to generate video sequences of one view\nfrom another dramatically different view. In this paper, we investigate the\nexocentric (third-person) view to egocentric (first-person) view video\ngeneration task. This is challenging because egocentric view sometimes is\nremarkably different from the exocentric view. Thus, transforming the\nappearances across the two different views is a non-trivial task. Particularly,\nwe propose a novel Bi-directional Spatial Temporal Attention Fusion Generative\nAdversarial Network (STA-GAN) to learn both spatial and temporal information to\ngenerate egocentric video sequences from the exocentric view. The proposed\nSTA-GAN consists of three parts: temporal branch, spatial branch, and attention\nfusion. First, the temporal and spatial branches generate a sequence of fake\nframes and their corresponding features. The fake frames are generated in both\ndownstream and upstream directions for both temporal and spatial branches.\nNext, the generated four different fake frames and their corresponding features\n(spatial and temporal branches in two directions) are fed into a novel\nmulti-generation attention fusion module to produce the final video sequence.\nMeanwhile, we also propose a novel temporal and spatial dual-discriminator for\nmore robust network optimization. Extensive experiments on the Side2Ego and\nTop2Ego datasets show that the proposed STA-GAN significantly outperforms the\nexisting methods.",

          "description": "Over the past decade, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have been widely\nadopted for medical image segmentation and shown to achieve adequate\nperformance. However, due to the inherent inductive biases present in the\nconvolutional architectures, they lack understanding of long-range dependencies\nin the image. Recently proposed Transformer-based architectures that leverage\nself-attention mechanism encode long-range dependencies and learn\nrepresentations that are highly expressive. This motivates us to explore\nTransformer-based solutions and study the feasibility of using\nTransformer-based network architectures for medical image segmentation tasks.\nMajority of existing Transformer-based network architectures proposed for\nvision applications require large-scale datasets to train properly. However,\ncompared to the datasets for vision applications, for medical imaging the\nnumber of data samples is relatively low, making it difficult to efficiently\ntrain transformers for medical applications. To this end, we propose a Gated\nAxial-Attention model which extends the existing architectures by introducing\nan additional control mechanism in the self-attention module. Furthermore, to\ntrain the model effectively on medical images, we propose a Local-Global\ntraining strategy (LoGo) which further improves the performance. Specifically,\nwe operate on the whole image and patches to learn global and local features,\nrespectively. The proposed Medical Transformer (MedT) is evaluated on three\ndifferent medical image segmentation datasets and it is shown that it achieves\nbetter performance than the convolutional and other related transformer-based\narchitectures.

          "description": "We introduce a method for egocentric videoconferencing that enables\nhands-free video calls, for instance by people wearing smart glasses or other\nmixed-reality devices. Videoconferencing portrays valuable non-verbal\ncommunication and face expression cues, but usually requires a front-facing\ncamera. Using a frontal camera in a hands-free setting when a person is on the\nmove is impractical. Even holding a mobile phone camera in the front of the\nface while sitting for a long duration is not convenient. To overcome these\nissues, we propose a low-cost wearable egocentric camera setup that can be\nintegrated into smart glasses. Our goal is to mimic a classical video call, and\ntherefore, we transform the egocentric perspective of this camera into a front\nfacing video. To this end, we employ a conditional generative adversarial\nneural network that learns a transition from the highly distorted egocentric\nviews to frontal views common in videoconferencing. Our approach learns to\ntransfer expression details directly from the egocentric view without using a\ncomplex intermediate parametric expressions model, as it is used by related\nface reenactment methods. We successfully handle subtle expressions, not easily\ncaptured by parametric blendshape-based solutions, e.g., tongue movement, eye\nmovements, eye blinking, strong expressions and depth varying movements. To get\ncontrol over the rigid head movements in the target view, we condition the\ngenerator on synthetic renderings of a moving neutral face. This allows us to\nsynthesis results at different head poses. Our technique produces temporally\nsmooth video-realistic renderings in real-time using a video-to-video\ntranslation network in conjunction with a temporal discriminator. We\ndemonstrate the improved capabilities of our technique by comparing against\nrelated state-of-the art approaches.",

Machine learning methods, specifically supervised learning is\ncommonly used in a variety of tasks formulated as semantic segmentation. One of\nthe major challenges in the supervised learning approaches is expressing and\ncollecting the rich knowledge that experts have with respect to the meaning\npresent in the image data. Towards this, typically a fixed set of labels is\nspecified and experts are tasked with annotating the pixels, patches or\nsegments in the images with the given labels. In general, however, the set of\nclasses does not fully capture the rich semantic information present in the\nimages. For example, in medical imaging such as histology images, the different\nparts of cells could be grouped and sub-grouped based on the expertise of the\npathologist.\n\nTo achieve such a precise semantic representation of the concepts in the\nimage, we need access to the full depth of knowledge of the annotator. In this\nwork, we develop a novel approach to collect segmentation annotations from\nexperts based on psychometric testing. Our method consists of the psychometric\ntesting procedure, active query selection, query enhancement, and a deep metric\nlearning model to achieve a patch-level image embedding that allows for\nsemantic segmentation of images.

          "description": "Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) is the task of leveraging semantic\ninformation (e.g., attributes) to recognize the seen and unseen samples, where\nunseen classes are not observable during training. It is natural to derive\ngenerative models and hallucinate training samples for unseen classes based on\nthe knowledge learned from the seen samples. However, most of these models\nsuffer from the `generation shifts', where the synthesized samples may drift\nfrom the real distribution of unseen data. In this paper, we conduct an\nin-depth analysis on this issue and propose a novel Generation Shifts\nMitigating Flow (GSMFlow) framework, which is comprised of multiple conditional\naffine coupling layers for learning unseen data synthesis efficiently and\neffectively. In particular, we identify three potential problems that trigger\nthe generation shifts, i.e., semantic inconsistency, variance decay, and\nstructural permutation and address them respectively. First, to reinforce the\ncorrelations between the generated samples and the respective attributes, we\nexplicitly embed the semantic information into the transformations in each of\nthe coupling layers. Second, to recover the intrinsic variance of the\nsynthesized unseen features, we introduce a visual perturbation strategy to\ndiversify the intra-class variance of generated data and hereby help adjust the\ndecision boundary of the classifier. Third, to avoid structural permutation in\nthe semantic space, we propose a relative positioning strategy to manipulate\nthe attribute embeddings, guiding which to fully preserve the inter-class\ngeometric structure. Experimental results demonstrate that GSMFlow achieves\nstate-of-the-art recognition performance in both conventional and generalized\nzero-shot settings.

In the Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild\n(ABAW) 2020 competition, we proposed a new automatic Action Units (AUs)\nrecognition method using a pairwise deep architecture to derive the\nPseudo-Intensities of each AU and then convert them into predicted intensities.\nThis year, we introduced a new technique to last year's framework to further\nreduce AU recognition errors due to temporary face occlusion such as temporary\nface occlusion such as face hiding or large face orientation. We obtained a\nscore of 0.65 in the validation data set for this year's competition.",

However, segmenting these safety-critical\nobjects is rarely covered by conventional assistive technologies. To tackle\nthis issue, we construct a wearable system with a novel dual-head Transformer\nfor Transparency (Trans4Trans) model, which is capable of segmenting general\nand transparent objects and performing real-time wayfinding to assist people\nwalking alone more safely. Especially, both decoders created by our proposed\nTransformer Parsing Module (TPM) enable effective joint learning from different\ndatasets. Besides, the efficient Trans4Trans model composed of symmetric\ntransformer-based encoder and decoder, requires little computational expenses\nand is readily deployed on portable GPUs. Our Trans4Trans model outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on the test sets of Stanford2D3D and Trans10K-v2\ndatasets and obtains mIoU of 45.13% and 75.14%, respectively.

However, without considering the foreground-background\ndecomposition, existing GANs tend to capture excessive content correlation\nbetween foreground and background, thus constraining the diversity in image\ngeneration. This paper presents a novel Foreground-Background Composition GAN\n(FBC-GAN) that performs image generation by generating foreground objects and\nbackground scenes concurrently and independently, followed by composing them\nwith style and geometrical consistency. With this explicit design, FBC-GAN can\ngenerate images with foregrounds and backgrounds that are mutually independent\nin contents, thus lifting the undesirably learned content correlation\nconstraint and achieving superior diversity. It also provides excellent\nflexibility by allowing the same foreground object with different background\nscenes, the same background scene with varying foreground objects, or the same\nforeground object and background scene with different object positions, sizes\nand poses. It can compose foreground objects and background scenes sampled from\ndifferent datasets as well.

As a result,\npredicting model performance on unseen distributions is an important challenge.\nOur work connects techniques from domain adaptation and predictive uncertainty\nliterature, and allows us to predict model accuracy on challenging unseen\ndistributions without access to labeled data. In the context of distribution\nshift, distributional distances are often used to adapt models and improve\ntheir performance on new domains, however accuracy estimation, or other forms\nof predictive uncertainty, are often neglected in these investigations. Through\ninvestigating a wide range of established distributional distances, such as\nFrechet distance or Maximum Mean Discrepancy, we determine that they fail to\ninduce reliable estimates of performance under distribution shift. On the other\nhand, we find that the difference of confidences (DoC) of a classifier's\npredictions successfully estimates the classifier's performance change over a\nvariety of shifts. We specifically investigate the distinction between\nsynthetic and natural distribution shifts and observe that despite its\nsimplicity DoC consistently outperforms other quantifications of distributional\ndifference. $DoC$ reduces predictive error by almost half ($46\\%$) on several\nrealistic and challenging distribution shifts, e.g., on the ImageNet-Vid-Robust\nand ImageNet-Rendition datasets.",

In this work, we propose an effective weakly-supervised\nvideo semantic segmentation pipeline with click annotations, called WeClick,\nfor saving laborious annotating effort by segmenting an instance of the\nsemantic class with only a single click. Since detailed semantic information is\nnot captured by clicks, directly training with click labels leads to poor\nsegmentation predictions. To mitigate this problem, we design a novel memory\nflow knowledge distillation strategy to exploit temporal information (named\nmemory flow) in abundant unlabeled video frames, by distilling the neighboring\npredictions to the target frame via estimated motion. Moreover, we adopt\nvanilla knowledge distillation for model compression. In this case, WeClick\nlearns compact video semantic segmentation models with the low-cost click\nannotations during the training phase yet achieves real-time and accurate\nmodels during the inference period.

          "description": "Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) aims to solve tasks in target domain\nby utilizing transferable information learned from the available source domain\nand a few labeled target data. However, source data is not always accessible in\npractical scenarios, which restricts the application of SSDA in real world\ncircumstances. In this paper, we propose a novel task named Semi-supervised\nSource Hypothesis Transfer (SSHT), which performs domain adaptation based on\nsource trained model, to generalize well in target domain with a few\nsupervisions. In SSHT, we are facing two challenges: (1) The insufficient\nlabeled target data may result in target features near the decision boundary,\nwith the increased risk of mis-classification; (2) The data are usually\nimbalanced in source domain, so the model trained with these data is biased.\nThe biased model is prone to categorize samples of minority categories into\nmajority ones, resulting in low prediction diversity. To tackle the above\nissues, we propose Consistency and Diversity Learning (CDL), a simple but\neffective framework for SSHT by facilitating prediction consistency between two\nrandomly augmented unlabeled data and maintaining the prediction diversity when\nadapting model to target domain. Encouraging consistency regularization brings\ndifficulty to memorize the few labeled target data and thus enhances the\ngeneralization ability of the learned model. We further integrate Batch\nNuclear-norm Maximization into our method to enhance the discriminability and\ndiversity. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing SSDA\nmethods and unsupervised model adaptation methods on DomainNet, Office-Home and\nOffice-31 datasets.

          "description": "The performance of human pose estimation depends on the spatial accuracy of\nkeypoint localization. Most existing methods pursue the spatial accuracy\nthrough learning the high-resolution (HR) representation from input images. By\nthe experimental analysis, we find that the HR representation leads to a sharp\nincrease of computational cost, while the accuracy improvement remains marginal\ncompared with the low-resolution (LR) representation. In this paper, we propose\na design paradigm for cost-effective network with LR representation for\nefficient pose estimation, named FasterPose. Whereas the LR design largely\nshrinks the model complexity, yet how to effectively train the network with\nrespect to the spatial accuracy is a concomitant challenge. We study the\ntraining behavior of FasterPose, and formulate a novel regressive cross-entropy\n(RCE) loss function for accelerating the convergence and promoting the\naccuracy. The RCE loss generalizes the ordinary cross-entropy loss from the\nbinary supervision to a continuous range, thus the training of pose estimation\nnetwork is able to benefit from the sigmoid function. By doing so, the output\nheatmap can be inferred from the LR features without loss of spatial accuracy,\nwhile the computational cost and model size has been significantly reduced.\nCompared with the previously dominant network of pose estimation, our method\nreduces 58% of the FLOPs and simultaneously gains 1.3% improvement of accuracy.\nExtensive experiments show that FasterPose yields promising results on the\ncommon benchmarks, i.e., COCO and MPII, consistently validating the\neffectiveness and efficiency for practical utilization, especially the\nlow-latency and low-energy-budget applications in the non-GPU scenarios.",

          "description": "Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a multi-modal challenging task\nwidely considered by research communities of the computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing. Since most current medical VQA models focus on visual\ncontent, ignoring the importance of text, this paper proposes a multi-view\nattention-based model(MuVAM) for medical visual question answering which\nintegrates the high-level semantics of medical images on the basis of text\ndescription. Firstly, different methods are utilized to extract the features of\nthe image and the question for the two modalities of vision and text. Secondly,\nthis paper proposes a multi-view attention mechanism that include\nImage-to-Question (I2Q) attention and Word-to-Text (W2T) attention. Multi-view\nattention can correlate the question with image and word in order to better\nanalyze the question and get an accurate answer. Thirdly, a composite loss is\npresented to predict the answer accurately after multi-modal feature fusion and\nimprove the similarity between visual and textual cross-modal features. It\nconsists of classification loss and image-question complementary (IQC) loss.\nFinally, for data errors and missing labels in the VQA-RAD dataset, we\ncollaborate with medical experts to correct and complete this dataset and then\nconstruct an enhanced dataset, VQA-RADPh. The experiments on these two datasets\nshow that the effectiveness of MuVAM surpasses the state-of-the-art method.",

Recent studies focus on the unbalanced\ninter-class distribution and form a equidistributed feature representations by\npenalizing the angle between identity and its nearest neighbor. But the problem\nis more than that, we also found the anisotropy of intra-class distribution.

This method, named IntraLoss,\nexplicitly performs gradient enhancement in the anisotropic region so that the\nintra-class distribution continues to shrink, resulting in isotropic and more\ncompact intra-class distribution and further margin between identities. The\nexperimental results on LFW, YTF and CFP-FP show that our outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by gradient enhancement, demonstrating the superiority\nof our method.

          "description": "This paper addresses mesh restoration problems, i.e., denoising and\ncompletion, by learning self-similarity in an unsupervised manner. For this\npurpose, the proposed method, which we refer to as Deep Mesh Prior, uses a\ngraph convolutional network on meshes to learn the self-similarity. The network\ntakes a single incomplete mesh as input data and directly outputs the\nreconstructed mesh without being trained using large-scale datasets. Our method\ndoes not use any intermediate representations such as an implicit field because\nthe whole process works on a mesh. We demonstrate that our unsupervised method\nperforms equally well or even better than the state-of-the-art methods using\nlarge-scale datasets.",

          "description": "Building vehicles capable of operating without human supervision requires the\ndetermination of the agent's pose. Visual Odometry (VO) algorithms estimate the\negomotion using only visual changes from the input images. The most recent VO\nmethods implement deep-learning techniques using convolutional neural networks\n(CNN) extensively, which add a substantial cost when dealing with\nhigh-resolution images. Furthermore, in VO tasks, more input data does not mean\na better prediction; on the contrary, the architecture may filter out useless\ninformation. Therefore, the implementation of computationally efficient and\nlightweight architectures is essential. In this work, we propose the RAM-VO, an\nextension of the Recurrent Attention Model (RAM) for visual odometry tasks.\nRAM-VO improves the visual and temporal representation of information and\nimplements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to learn robust\npolicies. The results indicate that RAM-VO can perform regressions with six\ndegrees of freedom from monocular input images using approximately 3 million\nparameters. In addition, experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that\nRAM-VO achieves competitive results using only 5.7% of the available visual\ninformation.",

However, due to\ntheir sparse occurrence in the image, until now Stixels seldomly served as\ninput for Deep Learning algorithms, restricting their utility for such\napproaches. In this work we present StixelPointNet, a novel method to perform\nfast instance segmentation directly on Stixels. By regarding the Stixel\nrepresentation as unstructured data similar to point clouds, architectures like\nPointNet are able to learn features from Stixels. We use a bounding box\ndetector to propose candidate instances, for which the relevant Stixels are\nextracted from the input image. On these Stixels, a PointNet models learns\nbinary segmentations, which we then unify throughout the whole image in a final\nselection step. StixelPointNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nStixel-level, is considerably faster than pixel-based segmentation methods, and\nshows that with our approach the Stixel domain can be introduced to many new 3D\nDeep Learning tasks.",

          "description": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) has posed a leading threat to the lives of\ncardiovascular disease patients worldwide for a long time. Therefore, automated\ndiagnosis of CAD has indispensable significance in clinical medicine. However,\nthe complexity of coronary artery plaques that cause CAD makes the automatic\ndetection of coronary artery stenosis in Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) a\ndifficult task. In this paper, we propose a Transformer network (TR-Net) for\nthe automatic detection of significant stenosis (i.e. luminal narrowing > 50%)\nwhile practically completing the computer-assisted diagnosis of CAD. The\nproposed TR-Net introduces a novel Transformer, and tightly combines\nconvolutional layers and Transformer encoders, allowing their advantages to be\ndemonstrated in the task. By analyzing semantic information sequences, TR-Net\ncan fully understand the relationship between image information in each\nposition of a multiplanar reformatted (MPR) image, and accurately detect\nsignificant stenosis based on both local and global information. We evaluate\nour TR-Net on a dataset of 76 patients from different patients annotated by\nexperienced radiologists. Experimental results illustrate that our TR-Net has\nachieved better results in ACC (0.92), Spec (0.96), PPV (0.84), F1 (0.79) and\nMCC (0.74) indicators compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

          "description": "Different types of spectroscopies, such as X-ray absorption near edge\nstructure (XANES) and Raman spectroscopy, play a very important role in\nanalyzing the characteristics of different materials. In scientific literature,\nXANES/Raman data are usually plotted in line graphs which is a visually\nappropriate way to represent the information when the end-user is a human\nreader. However, such graphs are not conducive to direct programmatic analysis\ndue to the lack of automatic tools. In this paper, we develop a plot digitizer,\nnamed Plot2Spectra, to extract data points from spectroscopy graph images in an\nautomatic fashion, which makes it possible for large scale data acquisition and\nanalysis. Specifically, the plot digitizer is a two-stage framework. In the\nfirst axis alignment stage, we adopt an anchor-free detector to detect the plot\nregion and then refine the detected bounding boxes with an edge-based\nconstraint to locate the position of two axes. We also apply scene text\ndetector to extract and interpret all tick information below the x-axis. In the\nsecond plot data extraction stage, we first employ semantic segmentation to\nseparate pixels belonging to plot lines from the background, and from there,\nincorporate optical flow constraints to the plot line pixels to assign them to\nthe appropriate line (data instance) they encode. Extensive experiments are\nconducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed plot digitizer, which\nshows that such a tool could help accelerate the discovery and machine learning\nof materials properties.",

However, the method development with in-the-wild data is not yet\naccurate enough for practical usage. In this paper, we introduce the affective\nrecognition method focusing on facial expression (EXP) and valence-arousal\ncalculation that was submitted to the Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild\n(ABAW) 2021 Contest.\n\nWhen annotating facial expressions from a video, we thought that it would be\njudged not only from the features common to all people, but also from the\nrelative changes in the time series of individuals. Therefore, after learning\nthe common features for each frame, we constructed a facial expression\nestimation model and valence-arousal model using time-series data after\ncombining the common features and the standardized features for each video.\nFurthermore, the above features were learned using multi-modal data such as\nimage features, AU, Head pose, and Gaze. In the validation set, our model\nachieved a facial expression score of 0.546. These verification results reveal\nthat our proposed framework can improve estimation accuracy and robustness\neffectively.",

But\nsensors alone are often insufficient to provide this capability, and they are\nprone to errors due to various conditions in the environment. Furthermore,\nthere is a need for robots to maintain a model of its surroundings even when\nobjects go out of view and are no longer visible. This requires anchoring\nperceptual information onto symbols that represent the objects in the\nenvironment. In this paper, we present a model for action-aware perceptual\nanchoring that enables robots to track objects in a persistent manner. Our\nrule-based approach considers inductive biases to perform high-level reasoning\nover the results from low-level object detection, and it improves the robot's\nperceptual capability for complex tasks. We evaluate our model against existing\nbaseline models for object permanence and show that it outperforms these on a\nsnitch localisation task using a dataset of 1,371 videos.

          "description": "Hyperspectral (HS) images are characterized by approximately contiguous\nspectral information, enabling the fine identification of materials by\ncapturing subtle spectral discrepancies. Owing to their excellent locally\ncontextual modeling ability, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been\nproven to be a powerful feature extractor in HS image classification. However,\nCNNs fail to mine and represent the sequence attributes of spectral signatures\nwell due to the limitations of their inherent network backbone. To solve this\nissue, we rethink HS image classification from a sequential perspective with\ntransformers, and propose a novel backbone network called \\ul{SpectralFormer}.\nBeyond band-wise representations in classic transformers, SpectralFormer is\ncapable of learning spectrally local sequence information from neighboring\nbands of HS images, yielding group-wise spectral embeddings. More\nsignificantly, to reduce the possibility of losing valuable information in the\nlayer-wise propagation process, we devise a cross-layer skip connection to\nconvey memory-like components from shallow to deep layers by adaptively\nlearning to fuse \"soft\" residuals across layers. It is worth noting that the\nproposed SpectralFormer is a highly flexible backbone network, which can be\napplicable to both pixel- and patch-wise inputs. We evaluate the classification\nperformance of the proposed SpectralFormer on three HS datasets by conducting\nextensive experiments, showing the superiority over classic transformers and\nachieving a significant improvement in comparison with state-of-the-art\nbackbone networks.

These supervised methods require a large amount of\nannotated data to train deep neural networks to ensure the generalization\nability on the unseen test set. In this paper, we introduce a\nmeta-learning-based method for few-shot 3D shape segmentation where only a few\nlabeled samples are provided for the unseen classes. To achieve this, we treat\nthe shape segmentation as a point labeling problem in the metric space.\nSpecifically, we first design a meta-metric learner to transform input shapes\ninto embedding space and our model learns to learn a proper metric space for\neach object class based on point embeddings. Then, for each class, we design a\nmetric learner to extract part-specific prototype representations from a few\nsupport shapes and our model performs per-point segmentation over the query\nshapes by matching each point to its nearest prototype in the learned metric\nspace. A metric-based loss function is used to dynamically modify distances\nbetween point embeddings thus maximizes in-part similarity while minimizing\ninter-part similarity. A dual segmentation branch is adopted to make full use\nof the support information and implicitly encourages consistency between the\nsupport and query prototypes.

Recently, transformers\nwithout CNN-based backbones are found to achieve impressive performance for\nimage recognition. However, the transformer is designed for NLP tasks and thus\ncould be sub-optimal when directly used for image recognition. In order to\nimprove the visual representation ability for transformers, we propose a new\nsearch space and searching algorithm. Specifically, we introduce a locality\nmodule that models the local correlations in images explicitly with fewer\ncomputational cost. With the locality module, our search space is defined to\nlet the search algorithm freely trade off between global and local information\nas well as optimizing the low-level design choice in each module. To tackle the\nproblem caused by huge search space, a hierarchical neural architecture search\nmethod is proposed to search the optimal vision transformer from two levels\nseparately with the evolutionary algorithm.

          "description": "Unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) remains a challenging task,\nwhere the classifier and feature representation could be easily misled by the\nnoisy pseudo labels towards deteriorated over-fitting. In this paper, we\npropose a simple yet effective approach, termed Group Sampling, to alleviate\nthe negative impact of noisy pseudo labels within unsupervised person re-ID\nmodels. The idea behind Group Sampling is that it can gather a group of samples\nfrom the same class in the same mini-batch, such that the model is trained upon\ngroup normalized samples while alleviating the effect of a single sample. Group\nsampling updates the pipeline of pseudo label generation by guaranteeing the\nsamples to be better divided into the correct classes. Group Sampling\nregularizes classifier training and representation learning, leading to the\nstatistical stability of feature representation in a progressive fashion.\nQualitative and quantitative experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and\nMSMT17 show that Grouping Sampling improves the state-of-the-arts by up to\n2.2%~6.1%.

          "description": "Based on PixelHop and PixelHop++, which are recently developed using the\nsuccessive subspace learning (SSL) framework, we propose an enhanced solution\nfor object classification, called E-PixelHop, in this work. E-PixelHop consists\nof the following steps. First, to decouple the color channels for a color\nimage, we apply principle component analysis and project RGB three color\nchannels onto two principle subspaces which are processed separately for\nclassification. Second, to address the importance of multi-scale features, we\nconduct pixel-level classification at each hop with various receptive fields.\nThird, to further improve pixel-level classification accuracy, we develop a\nsupervised label smoothing (SLS) scheme to ensure prediction consistency.\nForth, pixel-level decisions from each hop and from each color subspace are\nfused together for image-level decision. Fifth, to resolve confusing classes\nfor further performance boosting, we formulate E-PixelHop as a two-stage\npipeline. In the first stage, multi-class classification is performed to get a\nsoft decision for each class, where the top 2 classes with the highest\nprobabilities are called confusing classes. Then,we conduct a binary\nclassification in the second stage. The main contributions lie in Steps 1, 3\nand 5.We use the classification of the CIFAR-10 dataset as an example to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the above-mentioned key components of\nE-PixelHop.",

          "description": "Ki67 is a significant biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer,\nwhose index can be evaluated by quantifying its expression in Ki67\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images. However, quantitative analysis on\nmulti-source Ki67 images is yet a challenging task in practice due to\ncross-domain distribution differences, which result from imaging variation,\nstaining styles, and lesion types. Many recent studies have made some efforts\non domain generalization (DG), whereas there are still some noteworthy\nlimitations. Specifically in the case of Ki67 images, learning invariant\nrepresentation is at the mercy of the insufficient number of domains and the\ncell categories mismatching in different domains. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method to improve DG by searching the domain-agnostic subnetwork in a\ndomain merging scenario. Partial model parameters are iteratively pruned\naccording to the domain gap, which is caused by the data converting from a\nsingle domain into merged domains during training. In addition, the model is\noptimized by fine-tuning on merged domains to eliminate the interference of\nclass mismatching among various domains. Furthermore, an appropriate\nimplementation is attained by applying the pruning method to different parts of\nthe framework. Compared with known DG methods, our method yields excellent\nperformance in multiclass nucleus recognition of Ki67 IHC images, especially in\nthe lost category cases. Moreover, our competitive results are also evaluated\non the public dataset over the state-of-the-art DG methods.",

          "description": "Most deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods are not\nimage-specific: 1) They are exhaustively trained on datasets synthesized by\npredefined blur kernels (\\eg bicubic), regardless of the domain gap with test\nimages. 2) Their model weights are fixed during testing, which means that test\nimages with various degradations are super-resolved by the same set of weights.\nHowever, degradations of real images are various and unknown (\\ie blind SR). It\nis hard for a single model to perform well in all cases. To address these\nissues, we propose an online super-resolution (ONSR) method. It does not rely\non predefined blur kernels and allows the model weights to be updated according\nto the degradation of the test image. Specifically, ONSR consists of two\nbranches, namely internal branch (IB) and external branch (EB). IB could learn\nthe specific degradation of the given test LR image, and EB could learn to\nsuper resolve images degraded by the learned degradation. In this way, ONSR\ncould customize a specific model for each test image, and thus could be more\ntolerant with various degradations in real applications. Extensive experiments\non both synthesized and real-world images show that ONSR can generate more\nvisually favorable SR results and achieve state-of-the-art performance in blind\nSR.",

          "description": "The square kernel is a standard unit for contemporary Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), as it fits well on the tensor computation for the convolution\noperation. However, the receptive field in the human visual system is actually\nisotropic like a circle. Motivated by this observation, we propose using circle\nkernels with isotropic receptive fields for the convolution, and our training\ntakes approximately equivalent amount of calculation when compared with the\ncorresponding CNN with square kernels. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate\nthe rationality of circle kernels. We then propose a kernel boosting strategy\nthat integrates the circle kernels with square kernels for the training and\ninference, and we further let the kernel size/radius be learnable during the\ntraining. Note that we reparameterize the circle kernels or integrated kernels\nbefore the inference, thus taking no extra computation as well as the number of\nparameter overhead for the testing. Extensive experiments on several standard\ndatasets, ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, using the circle kernels or\nintegrated kernels on typical existing CNNs, show that our approach exhibits\nhighly competitive performance. Specifically, on ImageNet with standard data\naugmentation, our approach dramatically boosts the performance of\nMobileNetV3-Small by 5.20% top-1 accuracy and 3.39% top-5 accuracy, and boosts\nthe performance of MobileNetV3-Large by 2.16% top-1 accuracy and 1.18% top-5\naccuracy.",

To verify our hypothesis, we consider a constrained formulation\nto reveal empirical evidence on the superiority of L1/L2 over L1 when\nrecovering piecewise constant signals from low-frequency measurements.\nNumerically, we design a specific splitting scheme, under which we can prove\nsubsequential and global convergence for the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) under certain conditions.

In this work, we propose a multi-stage integration\nnetwork (i.e., MINet) for multi-contrast MRI SR, which explicitly models the\ndependencies between multi-contrast images at different stages to guide image\nSR. In particular, our MINet first learns a hierarchical feature representation\nfrom multiple convolutional stages for each of different-contrast image.\nSubsequently, we introduce a multi-stage integration module to mine the\ncomprehensive relations between the representations of the multi-contrast\nimages. Specifically, the module matches each representation with all other\nfeatures, which are integrated in terms of their similarities to obtain an\nenriched representation. Extensive experiments on fastMRI and real-world\nclinical datasets demonstrate that 1) our MINet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmulti-contrast SR methods in terms of various metrics and 2) our multi-stage\nintegration module is able to excavate complex interactions among\nmulti-contrast features at different stages, leading to improved target-image\nquality.",

          "description": "Clinical finding summaries from an orthopantomogram, or a dental panoramic\nradiograph, have significant potential to improve patient communication and\nspeed up clinical judgments. While orthopantomogram is a first-line tool for\ndental examinations, no existing work has explored the summarization of\nfindings from it. A finding summary has to find teeth in the imaging study and\nlabel the teeth with several types of past treatments. To tackle the problem,\nwe developDeepOPG that breaks the summarization process into functional\nsegmentation and tooth localization, the latter of which is further refined by\na novel dental coherence module. We also leverage weak supervision labels to\nimprove detection results in a reinforcement learning scenario. Experiments\nshow high efficacy of DeepOPG on finding summarization, achieving an overall\nAUC of 88.2% in detecting six types of findings. The proposed dental coherence\nand weak supervision both are shown to improve DeepOPG by adding 5.9% and 0.4%\nto AP@IoU=0.5.",

This\nphenomenon is mainly caused by the semantic overlap between different\npredicates as well as the long-tailed data distribution. In this paper, a\nPredicate Correlation Learning (PCL) method for SGG is proposed to address the\nabove two problems by taking the correlation between predicates into\nconsideration. To describe the semantic overlap between strong-correlated\npredicate classes, a Predicate Correlation Matrix (PCM) is defined to quantify\nthe relationship between predicate pairs, which is dynamically updated to\nremove the matrix's long-tailed bias. In addition, PCM is integrated into a\nPredicate Correlation Loss function ($L_{PC}$) to reduce discouraging gradients\nof unannotated classes.

          "description": "Person re-identification (re-ID) under various occlusions has been a\nlong-standing challenge as person images with different types of occlusions\noften suffer from misalignment in image matching and ranking. Most existing\nmethods tackle this challenge by aligning spatial features of body parts\naccording to external semantic cues or feature similarities but this alignment\napproach is complicated and sensitive to noises. We design DRL-Net, a\ndisentangled representation learning network that handles occluded re-ID\nwithout requiring strict person image alignment or any additional supervision.\nLeveraging transformer architectures, DRL-Net achieves alignment-free re-ID via\nglobal reasoning of local features of occluded person images. It measures image\nsimilarity by automatically disentangling the representation of undefined\nsemantic components, e.g., human body parts or obstacles, under the guidance of\nsemantic preference object queries in the transformer. In addition, we design a\ndecorrelation constraint in the transformer decoder and impose it over object\nqueries for better focus on different semantic components. To better eliminate\ninterference from occlusions, we design a contrast feature learning technique\n(CFL) for better separation of occlusion features and discriminative ID\nfeatures. Extensive experiments over occluded and holistic re-ID benchmarks\n(Occluded-DukeMTMC, Market1501 and DukeMTMC) show that the DRL-Net achieves\nsuperior re-ID performance consistently and outperforms the state-of-the-art by\nlarge margins for Occluded-DukeMTMC.",

          "description": "This paper considers deep visual recognition on long-tailed data. To be\ngeneral, we consider two applied scenarios, \\ie, deep classification and deep\nmetric learning. Under the long-tailed data distribution, the majority classes\n(\\ie, tail classes) only occupy relatively few samples and are prone to lack of\nwithin-class diversity. A radical solution is to augment the tail classes with\nhigher diversity. To this end, we introduce a simple and reliable method named\nMemory-based Jitter (MBJ). We observe that during training, the deep model\nconstantly changes its parameters after every iteration, yielding the\nphenomenon of \\emph{weight jitters}. Consequentially, given a same image as the\ninput, two historical editions of the model generate two different features in\nthe deeply-embedded space, resulting in \\emph{feature jitters}. Using a memory\nbank, we collect these (model or feature) jitters across multiple training\niterations and get the so-called Memory-based Jitter. The accumulated jitters\nenhance the within-class diversity for the tail classes and consequentially\nimproves long-tailed visual recognition. With slight modifications, MBJ is\napplicable for two fundamental visual recognition tasks, \\emph{i.e.}, deep\nimage classification and deep metric learning (on long-tailed data). Extensive\nexperiments on five long-tailed classification benchmarks and two deep metric\nlearning benchmarks demonstrate significant improvement.

A traditional approach is to contrast different\nmodalities to learn the information shared between them.

Another approach is to concatenate all the\nmodalities into a tuple and then contrast positive and negative tuple\ncorrespondences. However, that approach could consider only the stronger\nmodalities while ignoring the weaker ones. To address these issues, we propose\na novel contrastive learning objective, TupleInfoNCE. It contrasts tuples based\nnot only on positive and negative correspondences but also by composing new\nnegative tuples using modalities describing different scenes. Training with\nthese additional negatives encourages the learning model to examine the\ncorrespondences among modalities in the same tuple, ensuring that weak\nmodalities are not ignored. We provide a theoretical justification based on\nmutual information for why this approach works, and we propose a sample\noptimization algorithm to generate positive and negative samples to maximize\ntraining efficacy.

Although the deepening of\nnetworks has been well established, there is still room for efficient feature\nextraction within a layer which would reduce the need for mere parameter\nincrement. The conventional widening of networks by having more filters in each\nlayer introduces a quadratic increment of parameters. Having multiple parallel\nconvolutional/dense operations in each layer solves this problem, but without\nany context-dependent allocation of resources among these operations: the\nparallel computations tend to learn similar features making the widening\nprocess less effective. Therefore, we propose the use of multi-path neural\nnetworks with data-dependent resource allocation among parallel computations\nwithin layers, which also lets an input to be routed end-to-end through these\nparallel paths. To do this, we first introduce a cross-prediction based\nalgorithm between parallel tensors of subsequent layers. Second, we further\nreduce the routing overhead by introducing feature-dependent cross-connections\nbetween parallel tensors of successive layers. Our multi-path networks show\nsuperior performance to existing widening and adaptive feature extraction, and\neven ensembles, and deeper networks at similar complexity in the image\nrecognition task.",

          "description": "Visual Place Recognition (VPR) approaches have typically attempted to match\nplaces by identifying visual cues, image regions or landmarks that have high\n``utility'' in identifying a specific place. But this concept of utility is not\nsingular - rather it can take a range of forms. In this paper, we present a\nnovel approach to deduce two key types of utility for VPR: the utility of\nvisual cues `specific' to an environment, and to a particular place. We employ\ncontrastive learning principles to estimate both the environment- and\nplace-specific utility of Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD)\nclusters in an unsupervised manner, which is then used to guide local feature\nmatching through keypoint selection. By combining these two utility measures,\nour approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging\nbenchmark datasets, while simultaneously reducing the required storage and\ncompute time. We provide further analysis demonstrating that unsupervised\ncluster selection results in semantically meaningful results, that finer\ngrained categorization often has higher utility for VPR than high level\nsemantic categorization (e.g. building, road), and characterise how these two\nutility measures vary across different places and environments.

          "description": "Prostate segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a challenging\ntask. In recent years, several network architectures have been proposed to\nautomate this process and alleviate the burden of manual annotation. Although\nthe performance of these models has achieved promising results, there is still\nroom for improvement before these models can be used safely and effectively in\nclinical practice. One of the major challenges in prostate MR image\nsegmentation is the presence of class imbalance in the image labels where the\nbackground pixels dominate over the prostate. In the present work we propose a\nDL-based pipeline for cropping the region around the prostate from MRI images\nto produce a more balanced distribution of the foreground pixels (prostate) and\nthe background pixels and improve segmentation accuracy. The effect of\nDL-cropping for improving the segmentation performance compared to standard\ncenter-cropping is assessed using five popular DL networks for prostate\nsegmentation, namely U-net, U-net+, Res Unet++, Bridge U-net and Dense U-net.\nThe proposed smart-cropping outperformed the standard center cropping in terms\nof segmentation accuracy for all the evaluated prostate segmentation networks.\nIn terms of Dice score, the highest improvement was achieved for the U-net+ and\nResU-net++ architectures corresponding to 8.9% and 8%, respectively.",

          "description": "In Fluorescein Angiography (FA), an exogenous dye is injected in the\nbloodstream to image the vascular structure of the retina. The injected dye can\ncause adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, anaphylactic shock, and even\ndeath. In contrast, color fundus imaging is a non-invasive technique used for\nphotographing the retina but does not have sufficient fidelity for capturing\nits vascular structure. The only non-invasive method for capturing retinal\nvasculature is optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCTA). However, OCTA\nequipment is quite expensive, and stable imaging is limited to small areas on\nthe retina. In this paper, we propose a novel conditional generative\nadversarial network (GAN) capable of simultaneously synthesizing FA images from\nfundus photographs while predicting retinal degeneration. The proposed system\nhas the benefit of addressing the problem of imaging retinal vasculature in a\nnon-invasive manner as well as predicting the existence of retinal\nabnormalities. We use a semi-supervised approach to train our GAN using\nmultiple weighted losses on different modalities of data. Our experiments\nvalidate that the proposed architecture exceeds recent state-of-the-art\ngenerative networks for fundus-to-angiography synthesis. Moreover, our vision\ntransformer-based discriminators generalize quite well on out-of-distribution\ndata sets for retinal disease prediction.",

          "description": "Scene text detection and recognition have been well explored in the past few\nyears. Despite the progress, efficient and accurate end-to-end spotting of\narbitrarily-shaped text remains challenging. In this work, we propose an\nend-to-end text spotting framework, termed PAN++, which can efficiently detect\nand recognize text of arbitrary shapes in natural scenes. PAN++ is based on the\nkernel representation that reformulates a text line as a text kernel (central\nregion) surrounded by peripheral pixels. By systematically comparing with\nexisting scene text representations, we show that our kernel representation can\nnot only describe arbitrarily-shaped text but also well distinguish adjacent\ntext. Moreover, as a pixel-based representation, the kernel representation can\nbe predicted by a single fully convolutional network, which is very friendly to\nreal-time applications. Taking the advantages of the kernel representation, we\ndesign a series of components as follows: 1) a computationally efficient\nfeature enhancement network composed of stacked Feature Pyramid Enhancement\nModules (FPEMs); 2) a lightweight detection head cooperating with Pixel\nAggregation (PA); and 3) an efficient attention-based recognition head with\nMasked RoI. Benefiting from the kernel representation and the tailored\ncomponents, our method achieves high inference speed while maintaining\ncompetitive accuracy. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method.\nFor example, the proposed PAN++ achieves an end-to-end text spotting F-measure\nof 64.9 at 29.2 FPS on the Total-Text dataset, which significantly outperforms\nthe previous best method.

          "description": "Automated red blood cell (RBC) classification on blood smear images helps\nhematologists to analyze RBC lab results in a reduced time and cost. However,\noverlapping cells can cause incorrect predicted results, and so they have to be\nseparated into multiple single RBCs before classifying. To classify multiple\nclasses with deep learning, imbalance problems are common in medical imaging\nbecause normal samples are always higher than rare disease samples. This paper\npresents a new method to segment and classify RBCs from blood smear images,\nspecifically to tackle cell overlapping and data imbalance problems. Focusing\non overlapping cell separation, our segmentation process first estimates\nellipses to represent RBCs. The method detects the concave points and then\nfinds the ellipses using directed ellipse fitting. The accuracy from 20 blood\nsmear images was 0.889. Classification requires balanced training datasets.\nHowever, some RBC types are rare. The imbalance ratio of this dataset was\n34.538 for 12 RBC classes from 20,875 individual RBC samples. The use of\nmachine learning for RBC classification with an imbalanced dataset is hence\nmore challenging than many other applications. We analyzed techniques to deal\nwith this problem. The best accuracy and F1-score were 0.921 and 0.8679,\nrespectively, using EfficientNet-B1 with augmentation. Experimental results\nshowed that the weight balancing technique with augmentation had the potential\nto deal with imbalance problems by improving the F1-score on minority classes,\nwhile data augmentation significantly improved the overall classification\nperformance.",

          "description": "3D object detection is an important yet demanding task that heavily relies on\ndifficult to obtain 3D annotations. To reduce the required amount of\nsupervision, we propose 3DIoUMatch, a novel semi-supervised method for 3D\nobject detection applicable to both indoor and outdoor scenes. We leverage a\nteacher-student mutual learning framework to propagate information from the\nlabeled to the unlabeled train set in the form of pseudo-labels. However, due\nto the high task complexity, we observe that the pseudo-labels suffer from\nsignificant noise and are thus not directly usable. To that end, we introduce a\nconfidence-based filtering mechanism, inspired by FixMatch. We set confidence\nthresholds based upon the predicted objectness and class probability to filter\nlow-quality pseudo-labels. While effective, we observe that these two measures\ndo not sufficiently capture localization quality. We therefore propose to use\nthe estimated 3D IoU as a localization metric and set category-aware\nself-adjusted thresholds to filter poorly localized proposals. We adopt VoteNet\nas our backbone detector on indoor datasets while we use PV-RCNN on the\nautonomous driving dataset, KITTI. Our method consistently improves\nstate-of-the-art methods on both ScanNet and SUN-RGBD benchmarks by significant\nmargins under all label ratios (including fully labeled setting).

          "description": "Scene text spotting aims to detect and recognize the entire word or sentence\nwith multiple characters in natural images.

Indeed, a properly working capsule network\nshould theoretically achieve higher results with a considerably lower number of\nparameters count due to intrinsic capability to generalize to novel viewpoints.\nNevertheless, little attention has been given to this relevant aspect. In this\npaper, we investigate the efficiency of capsule networks and, pushing their\ncapacity to the limits with an extreme architecture with barely 160K\nparameters, we prove that the proposed architecture is still able to achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on three different datasets with only 2% of the\noriginal CapsNet parameters.

          "description": "In neuroimaging, MRI tissue properties characterize underlying neurobiology,\nprovide quantitative biomarkers for neurological disease detection and\nanalysis, and can be used to synthesize arbitrary MRI contrasts. Estimating\ntissue properties from a single scan session using a protocol available on all\nclinical scanners promises to reduce scan time and cost, enable quantitative\nanalysis in routine clinical scans and provide scan-independent biomarkers of\ndisease. However, existing tissue properties estimation methods - most often\n$\\mathbf{T_1}$ relaxation, $\\mathbf{T_2^*}$ relaxation, and proton density\n($\\mathbf{PD}$) - require data from multiple scan sessions and cannot estimate\nall properties from a single clinically available MRI protocol such as the\nmultiecho MRI scan. In addition, the widespread use of non-standard acquisition\nparameters across clinical imaging sites require estimation methods that can\ngeneralize across varying scanner parameters. However, existing learning\nmethods are acquisition protocol specific and cannot estimate from heterogenous\nclinical data from different imaging sites. In this work we propose an\nunsupervised deep-learning strategy that employs MRI physics to estimate all\nthree tissue properties from a single multiecho MRI scan session, and\ngeneralizes across varying acquisition parameters. The proposed strategy\noptimizes accurate synthesis of new MRI contrasts from estimated latent tissue\nproperties, enabling unsupervised training, we also employ random acquisition\nparameters during training to achieve acquisition generalization. We provide\nthe first demonstration of estimating all tissue properties from a single\nmultiecho scan session. We demonstrate improved accuracy and generalizability\nfor tissue property estimation and MRI synthesis.",

The downside to\nthese targeted approaches, however, is that they can be more brittle than\ngeneral-purpose neural networks, requiring significant modification or even\nredesign according to the particular task at hand.

          "description": "Visual Semantic Embedding (VSE) is a dominant approach for vision-language\nretrieval, which aims at learning a deep embedding space such that visual data\nare embedded close to their semantic text labels or descriptions. Recent VSE\nmodels use complex methods to better contextualize and aggregate multi-modal\nfeatures into holistic embeddings. However, we discover that surprisingly\nsimple (but carefully selected) global pooling functions (e.g., max pooling)\noutperform those complex models, across different feature extractors. Despite\nits simplicity and effectiveness, seeking the best pooling function for\ndifferent data modality and feature extractor is costly and tedious, especially\nwhen the size of features varies (e.g., text, video). Therefore, we propose a\nGeneralized Pooling Operator (GPO), which learns to automatically adapt itself\nto the best pooling strategy for different features, requiring no manual tuning\nwhile staying effective and efficient. We extend the VSE model using this\nproposed GPO and denote it as VSE$\\infty$.\n\nWithout bells and whistles, VSE$\\infty$ outperforms previous VSE methods\nsignificantly on image-text retrieval benchmarks across popular feature\nextractors. With a simple adaptation, variants of VSE$\\infty$ further\ndemonstrate its strength by achieving the new state of the art on two\nvideo-text retrieval datasets. Comprehensive experiments and visualizations\nconfirm that GPO always discovers the best pooling strategy and can be a\nplug-and-play feature aggregation module for standard VSE models.

Existing works typically formulate this as an\nimage-to-image translation problem in 2D screen space, which leads to artifacts\nsuch as over-smoothing, missing body parts, and temporal instability of\nfine-scale detail, such as pose-dependent wrinkles in the clothing. In this\npaper, we propose a novel human video synthesis method that approaches these\nlimiting factors by explicitly disentangling the learning of time-coherent\nfine-scale details from the embedding of the human in 2D screen space. More\nspecifically, our method relies on the combination of two convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs). Given the pose information, the first CNN predicts a dynamic\ntexture map that contains time-coherent high-frequency details, and the second\nCNN conditions the generation of the final video on the temporally coherent\noutput of the first CNN.

          "description": "Since visual perception can give rich information beyond text descriptions\nfor world understanding, there has been increasing interest in leveraging\nvisual grounding for language learning. Recently, vokenization has attracted\nattention by using the predictions of a text-to-image retrieval model as labels\nfor language model supervision. Despite its success, the method suffers from\napproximation error of using finite image labels and the lack of vocabulary\ndiversity of a small image-text dataset.

In contrast to previous\nworks, we do not generate arbitrary realistic videos, but provide efficient\ncontrol of movements, while still capturing the stochastic nature of our\nenvironment and the diversity of plausible outcomes it entails. Moreover, our\napproach can transfer kinematics onto novel object instances and is not\nconfined to particular object classes. Project page is available at\nhttps://bit.ly/3dJN4Lf",

Since\nfirst-person images exhibit strong bias in appearance among different\nenvironments, adapting a pre-trained segmentation model to a new domain is\nrequired in hand segmentation. Here, we focus on appearance gaps for hand\nregions and backgrounds separately. We propose (i) foreground-aware image\nstylization and (ii) consensus pseudo-labeling for domain adaptation of hand\nsegmentation. We stylize source images independently for the foreground and\nbackground using target images as style. To resolve the domain shift that the\nstylization has not addressed, we apply careful pseudo-labeling by taking a\nconsensus between the models trained on the source and stylized source images.\nWe validated our method on domain adaptation of hand segmentation from real and\nsimulation images. Our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in both\nsettings. We also demonstrated promising results in challenging multi-target\ndomain adaptation and domain generalization settings.

          "description": "Any spatio-temporal movement or reorientation of the hand, done with the\nintention of conveying a specific meaning, can be considered as a hand gesture.\nInputs to hand gesture recognition systems can be in several forms, such as\ndepth images, monocular RGB, or skeleton joint points. We observe that raw\ndepth images possess low contrasts in the hand regions of interest (ROI). They\ndo not highlight important details to learn, such as finger bending information\n(whether a finger is overlapping the palm, or another finger). Recently, in\ndeep-learning--based dynamic hand gesture recognition, researchers are tying to\nfuse different input modalities (e.g. RGB or depth images and hand skeleton\njoint points) to improve the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we focus on\ndynamic hand gesture (DHG) recognition using depth quantized image features and\nhand skeleton joint points. In particular, we explore the effect of using\ndepth-quantized features in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent\nNeural Network (RNN) based multi-modal fusion networks. We find that our method\nimproves existing results on the SHREC-DHG-14 dataset.

          "description": "One common failure mode of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models is fitting\nincorrect geometries when given an insufficient number of input views. We\npropose DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning\nneural radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth\nsupervision. Our key insight is that sparse depth supervision can be used to\nregularize the learned geometry, a crucial component for effectively rendering\nnovel views using NeRF. We exploit the fact that current NeRF pipelines require\nimages with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running\nstructure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that\ncan be used as ``free\" depth supervision during training: we simply add a loss\nto ensure that depth rendered along rays that intersect these 3D points is\nclose to the observed depth. We find that DS-NeRF can render more accurate\nimages given fewer training views while training 2-6x faster. With only two\ntraining views on real-world images, DS-NeRF significantly outperforms NeRF as\nwell as other sparse-view variants. We show that our loss is compatible with\nthese NeRF models, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible\nsupervisory signal. Finally, we show that DS-NeRF supports other types of depth\nsupervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGBD reconstruction outputs.",

The use of cameras for localization with\nhigh definition map (HD Map) provides an affordable localization sensor set.\nExisting methods suffer from pose estimation failure due to error prone data\nassociation or initialization with accurate initial pose requirement. In this\npaper, we propose a cost-effective vehicle localization system with HD map for\nautonomous driving that uses cameras as primary sensors. To this end, we\nformulate vision-based localization as a data association problem that maps\nvisual semantics to landmarks in HD map. Specifically, system initialization is\nfinished in a coarse to fine manner by combining coarse GPS (Global Positioning\nSystem) measurement and fine pose searching. In tracking stage, vehicle pose is\nrefined by implicitly aligning the semantic segmentation result between image\nand landmarks in HD maps with photometric consistency. Finally, vehicle pose is\ncomputed by pose graph optimization in a sliding window fashion. We evaluate\nour method on two datasets and demonstrate that the proposed approach yields\npromising localization results in different driving scenarios. Additionally,\nour approach is suitable for both monocular camera and multi-cameras that\nprovides flexibility and improves robustness for the localization system.",

          "description": "Due to a high heterogeneity in pose and size and to a limited number of\navailable data, segmentation of pediatric images is challenging for deep\nlearning methods. In this work, we propose a new CNN architecture that is pose\nand scale invariant thanks to the use of Spatial Transformer Network (STN). Our\narchitecture is composed of three sequential modules that are estimated\ntogether during training: (i) a regression module to estimate a similarity\nmatrix to normalize the input image to a reference one; (ii) a differentiable\nmodule to find the region of interest to segment; (iii) a segmentation module,\nbased on the popular UNet architecture, to delineate the object. Unlike the\noriginal UNet, which strives to learn a complex mapping, including pose and\nscale variations, from a finite training dataset, our segmentation module\nlearns a simpler mapping focusing on images with normalized pose and size.\nFurthermore, the use of an automatic bounding box detection through STN allows\nsaving time and especially memory, while keeping similar performance. We test\nthe proposed method in kidney and renal tumor segmentation on abdominal\npediatric CT scanners. Results indicate that the estimated STN homogenization\nof size and pose accelerates the segmentation (25h), compared to standard\ndata-augmentation (33h), while obtaining a similar quality for the kidney\n(88.01\\% of Dice score) and improving the renal tumor delineation (from 85.52\\%\nto 87.12\\%).",

Recent\nmethods have leveraged Deep Image Prior (DIP) to up-sample the LR-HSI due to\nits excellent ability to preserve both spatial and spectral information,\nwithout learning from large data sets.

To estimate the PAN image of the\nup-sampled HSI, we also propose a learnable spectral response function (SRF).\nMoreover, we noticed that the residual image between the up-sampled HSI and the\nreference HSI mainly consists of edge information and very fine structures.

Developing a collaborative\ncomputer-aided diagnosis system is challenging in different ways. Patient\nprivacy and regulations need to be carefully respected. Data across\ninstitutions may be acquired from different devices or imaging protocols,\nleading to heterogeneous non-IID data.

The amount of labels required can be drastically reduced by\nusing rules derived from prior knowledge to guide the segmentation.

We\nformulate the instance segmentation problem as graph partitioning and the actor\ncritic predicts the edge weights driven by the rewards, which are based on the\nconformity of segmented instances to high-level priors on object shape,\nposition or size.

          "description": "It is well noted that coordinate based MLPs benefit greatly -- in terms of\npreserving high-frequency information -- through the encoding of coordinate\npositions as an array of Fourier features. Hitherto, the rationale for the\neffectiveness of these positional encodings has been solely studied through a\nFourier lens. In this paper, we strive to broaden this understanding by showing\nthat alternative non-Fourier embedding functions can indeed be used for\npositional encoding. Moreover, we show that their performance is entirely\ndetermined by a trade-off between the stable rank of the embedded matrix and\nthe distance preservation between embedded coordinates. We further establish\nthat the now ubiquitous Fourier feature mapping of position is a special case\nthat fulfills these conditions. Consequently, we present a more general theory\nto analyze positional encoding in terms of shifted basis functions. To this\nend, we develop the necessary theoretical formulae and empirically verify that\nour theoretical claims hold in practice.

          "description": "The lower the distortion of an estimator, the more the distribution of its\noutputs generally deviates from the distribution of the signals it attempts to\nestimate. This phenomenon, known as the perception-distortion tradeoff, has\ncaptured significant attention in image restoration, where it implies that\nfidelity to ground truth images comes at the expense of perceptual quality\n(deviation from statistics of natural images). However, despite the increasing\npopularity of performing comparisons on the perception-distortion plane, there\nremains an important open question: what is the minimal distortion that can be\nachieved under a given perception constraint? In this paper, we derive a closed\nform expression for this distortion-perception (DP) function for the mean\nsquared-error (MSE) distortion and the Wasserstein-2 perception index. We prove\nthat the DP function is always quadratic, regardless of the underlying\ndistribution. This stems from the fact that estimators on the DP curve form a\ngeodesic in Wasserstein space. In the Gaussian setting, we further provide a\nclosed form expression for such estimators. For general distributions, we show\nhow these estimators can be constructed from the estimators at the two extremes\nof the tradeoff: The global MSE minimizer, and a minimizer of the MSE under a\nperfect perceptual quality constraint. The latter can be obtained as a\nstochastic transformation of the former.",

          "description": "3D point cloud registration is a fundamental task in robotics and computer\nvision. Recently, many learning-based point cloud registration methods based on\ncorrespondences have emerged. However, these methods heavily rely on such\ncorrespondences and meet great challenges with partial overlap. In this paper,\nwe propose ROPNet, a new deep learning model using Representative Overlapping\nPoints with discriminative features for registration that transforms\npartial-to-partial registration into partial-to-complete registration.\nSpecifically, we propose a context-guided module which uses an encoder to\nextract global features for predicting point overlap score. To better find\nrepresentative overlapping points, we use the extracted global features for\ncoarse alignment. Then, we introduce a Transformer to enrich point features and\nremove non-representative points based on point overlap score and feature\nmatching. A similarity matrix is built in a partial-to-complete mode, and\nfinally, weighted SVD is adopted to estimate a transformation matrix. Extensive\nexperiments over ModelNet40 using noisy and partially overlapping point clouds\nshow that the proposed method outperforms traditional and learning-based\nmethods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

          "description": "As cameras are increasingly deployed in new application domains such as\nautonomous driving, performing 3D object detection on monocular images becomes\nan important task for visual scene understanding. Recent advances on monocular\n3D object detection mainly rely on the ``pseudo-LiDAR'' generation, which\nperforms monocular depth estimation and lifts the 2D pixels to pseudo 3D\npoints. However, depth estimation from monocular images, due to its poor\naccuracy, leads to inevitable position shift of pseudo-LiDAR points within the\nobject. Therefore, the predicted bounding boxes may suffer from inaccurate\nlocation and deformed shape. In this paper, we present a novel neighbor-voting\nmethod that incorporates neighbor predictions to ameliorate object detection\nfrom severely deformed pseudo-LiDAR point clouds. Specifically, each feature\npoint around the object forms their own predictions, and then the ``consensus''\nis achieved through voting. In this way, we can effectively combine the\nneighbors' predictions with local prediction and achieve more accurate 3D\ndetection. To further enlarge the difference between the foreground region of\ninterest (ROI) pseudo-LiDAR points and the background points, we also encode\nthe ROI prediction scores of 2D foreground pixels into the corresponding\npseudo-LiDAR points. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark to\nvalidate the merits of our proposed method. Our results on the bird's eye view\ndetection outperform the state-of-the-art performance by a large margin,\nespecially for the ``hard'' level detection.",

This work tackles the problem of locating\nfloor-level lines in street-view images, using a supervised deep learning\napproach. Unfortunately, very little data is available for training such a\nnetwork $-$ current street-view datasets contain either semantic annotations\nthat lack geometric attributes, or rectified facades without perspective\npriors. To address this issue, we first compile a new dataset and develop a new\ndata augmentation scheme to synthesize training samples by harassing (i) the\nrich semantics of existing rectified facades and (ii) perspective priors of\nbuildings in diverse street views. Next, we design FloorLevel-Net, a multi-task\nlearning network that associates explicit features of building facades and\nimplicit floor-level lines, along with a height-attention mechanism to help\nenforce a vertical ordering of floor-level lines. The generated segmentations\nare then passed to a second-stage geometry post-processing to exploit\nself-constrained geometric priors for plausible and consistent reconstruction\nof floor-level lines. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations conducted on\nassorted facades in existing datasets and street views from Google demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach.

          "description": "The main challenges of image-to-image (I2I) translation are to make the\ntranslated image realistic and retain as much information from the source\ndomain as possible. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture,\ntermed as IEGAN, which removes the encoder of each network and introduces an\nencoder that is independent of other networks. Compared with previous models,\nit embodies three advantages of our model: Firstly, it is more directly and\ncomprehensively to grasp image information since the encoder no longer receives\nloss from generator and discriminator. Secondly, the independent encoder allows\neach network to focus more on its own goal which makes the translated image\nmore realistic. Thirdly, the reduction in the number of encoders performs more\nunified image representation. However, when the independent encoder applies two\ndown-sampling blocks, it's hard to extract semantic information. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose deep and shallow information space containing\ncharacteristic and semantic information, which can guide the model to translate\nhigh-quality images under the task with significant shape or texture change. We\ncompare IEGAN with other previous models, and conduct researches on semantic\ninformation consistency and component ablation at the same time.

          "description": "Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with surging interest\nin high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in this domain heavily relies on\nfaithful representation of the sparsity of subnetworks, which has been\ntraditionally computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct\nsparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize unpruned parameters\nthat detached from input or output layers of underlying subnetworks,\npotentially underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of\ninactivated connections. While this effect might be negligible for moderately\npruned networks (up to 10-100 compression rates), we find that it plays an\nincreasing role for thinner subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison between\ndifferent pruning algorithms. For example, we show that effective compression\nof a randomly pruned LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its\ndirect counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed when using SynFlow\nfor pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In this work, we adopt the lens of effective\nsparsity to reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common benchmark\narchitectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19, ResNet-18) and discover that their\nabsolute and relative performance changes dramatically in this new and more\nappropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than direct, sparsity, we\ndevelop a low-cost extension to most pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with\neffective sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that random\npruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across layers performs as well or\nbetter than more sophisticated algorithms for pruning at initialization [Su et\nal., 2020]. In response to this observation, using a simple analogy of pressure\ndistribution in coupled cylinders from physics, we design novel layerwise\nsparsity quotas that outperform all existing baselines in the context of random\npruning.",

          "description": "Over the last few decades, artificial intelligence research has made\ntremendous strides, but it still heavily relies on fixed datasets in stationary\nenvironments. Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines\nhow AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data\nin the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as\ndeepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current\nmultimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can\ndetect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to\ntheir reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in\nthis work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks' learning dynamics,\nemphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose\nContinual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the\nconcept of Continual Learning (CoL), Representation Learning (ReL), and\nKnowledge Distillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain\nadaptation tasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets,\nwhile effectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student\nmodel setting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method\nis efficient at domain adaptation to detect low-quality deepfakes videos and\nGAN-generated images from several datasets, outperforming the-state-of-art\nbaseline methods.",

          "description": "Image editing techniques enable people to modify the content of an image\nwithout leaving visual traces and thus may cause serious security risks. Hence\nthe detection and localization of these forgeries become quite necessary and\nchallenging. Furthermore, unlike other tasks with extensive data, there is\nusually a lack of annotated forged images for training due to annotation\ndifficulties. In this paper, we propose a self-adversarial training strategy\nand a reliable coarse-to-fine network that utilizes a self-attention mechanism\nto localize forged regions in forgery images. The self-attention module is\nbased on a Channel-Wise High Pass Filter block (CW-HPF). CW-HPF leverages\ninter-channel relationships of features and extracts noise features by high\npass filters. Based on the CW-HPF, a self-attention mechanism, called forgery\nattention, is proposed to capture rich contextual dependencies of intrinsic\ninconsistency extracted from tampered regions. Specifically, we append two\ntypes of attention modules on top of CW-HPF respectively to model internal\ninterdependencies in spatial dimension and external dependencies among\nchannels. We exploit a coarse-to-fine network to enhance the noise\ninconsistency between original and tampered regions. More importantly, to\naddress the issue of insufficient training data, we design a self-adversarial\ntraining strategy that expands training data dynamically to achieve more robust\nperformance. Specifically, in each training iteration, we perform adversarial\nattacks against our network to generate adversarial examples and train our\nmodel on them. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed\nalgorithm steadily outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin in\ndifferent benchmark datasets.",

          "description": "Deep learning-based image super-resolution (DL-SR) has shown great promise in\nmedical imaging applications. To date, most of the proposed methods for DL-SR\nhave only been assessed by use of traditional measures of image quality (IQ)\nthat are commonly employed in the field of computer vision. However, the impact\nof these methods on objective measures of image quality that are relevant to\nmedical imaging tasks remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate\nthe impact of DL-SR methods on binary signal detection performance. Two popular\nDL-SR methods, the super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) and\nthe super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN), were trained by\nuse of simulated medical image data. Binary signal-known-exactly with\nbackground-known-statistically (SKE/BKS) and signal-known-statistically with\nbackground-known-statistically (SKS/BKS) detection tasks were formulated.\nNumerical observers, which included a neural network-approximated ideal\nobserver and common linear numerical observers, were employed to assess the\nimpact of DL-SR on task performance. The impact of the complexity of the DL-SR\nnetwork architectures on task-performance was quantified. In addition, the\nutility of DL-SR for improving the task-performance of sub-optimal observers\nwas investigated. Our numerical experiments confirmed that, as expected, DL-SR\ncould improve traditional measures of IQ. However, for many of the study\ndesigns considered, the DL-SR methods provided little or no improvement in task\nperformance and could even degrade it. It was observed that DL-SR could improve\nthe task-performance of sub-optimal observers under certain conditions. The\npresented study highlights the urgent need for the objective assessment of\nDL-SR methods and suggests avenues for improving their efficacy in medical\nimaging applications.",

          "description": "Any clustering algorithm must synchronously learn to model the clusters and\nallocate data to those clusters in the absence of labels. Mixture model-based\nmethods model clusters with pre-defined statistical distributions and allocate\ndata to those clusters based on the cluster likelihoods. They iteratively\nrefine those distribution parameters and member assignments following the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. However, the cluster representability\nof such hand-designed distributions that employ a limited amount of parameters\nis not adequate for most real-world clustering tasks. In this paper, we realize\nmixture model-based clustering with a neural network where the final layer\nneurons, with the aid of an additional transformation, approximate cluster\ndistribution outputs. The network parameters pose as the parameters of those\ndistributions. The result is an elegant, much-generalized representation of\nclusters than a restricted mixture of hand-designed distributions. We train the\nnetwork end-to-end via batch-wise EM iterations where the forward pass acts as\nthe E-step and the backward pass acts as the M-step. In image clustering, the\nmixture-based EM objective can be used as the clustering objective along with\nexisting representation learning methods. In particular, we show that when\nmixture-EM optimization is fused with consistency optimization, it improves the\nsole consistency optimization performance in clustering. Our trained networks\noutperform single-stage deep clustering methods that still depend on k-means,\nwith unsupervised classification accuracy of 63.8% in STL10, 58% in CIFAR10,\n25.9% in CIFAR100, and 98.9% in MNIST.",

          "description": "In order to tackle the difficulty associated with the ill-posed nature of the\nimage registration problem, researchers use regularization to constrain the\nsolution space. For most learning-based registration approaches, the\nregularization usually has a fixed weight and only constrains the spatial\ntransformation. Such convention has two limitations: (1) The regularization\nstrength of a specific image pair should be associated with the content of the\nimages, thus the ``one value fits all'' scheme is not ideal; (2) Only spatially\nregularizing the transformation (but overlooking the temporal consistency of\ndifferent estimations) may not be the best strategy to cope with the\nill-posedness. In this study, we propose a mean-teacher based registration\nframework. This framework incorporates an additional \\textit{temporal\nregularization} term by encouraging the teacher model's temporal ensemble\nprediction to be consistent with that of the student model. At each training\nstep, it also automatically adjusts the weights of the \\textit{spatial\nregularization} and the \\textit{temporal regularization} by taking account of\nthe transformation uncertainty and appearance uncertainty derived from the\nperturbed teacher model. We perform experiments on multi- and uni-modal\nregistration tasks, and the results show that our strategy outperforms the\ntraditional and learning-based benchmark methods.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of training robust and accurate deep neural networks\n(DNNs) when subject to various proportions of noisy labels. Large-scale\ndatasets tend to contain mislabeled samples that can be memorized by DNNs,\nimpeding the performance. With appropriate handling, this degradation can be\nalleviated. There are two problems to consider: how to distinguish clean\nsamples and how to deal with noisy samples. In this paper, we present Ensemble\nNoise-robust K-fold Cross-Validation Selection (E-NKCVS) to effectively select\nclean samples from noisy data, solving the first problem. For the second\nproblem, we create a new pseudo label for any sample determined to have an\nuncertain or likely corrupt label. E-NKCVS obtains multiple predicted labels\nfor each sample and the entropy of these labels is used to tune the weight\ngiven to the pseudo label and the given label. Theoretical analysis and\nextensive verification of the algorithms in the noisy label setting are\nprovided. We evaluate our approach on various image and text classification\ntasks where the labels have been manually corrupted with different noise\nratios. Additionally, two large real-world noisy datasets are also used,\nClothing-1M and WebVision. E-NKCVS is empirically shown to be highly tolerant\nto considerable proportions of label noise and has a consistent improvement\nover state-of-the-art methods.

          "description": "Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains.\nHowever, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as\nlong documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has\nquadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence\nlength. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an\nefficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear\ncomplexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range\nattention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a\nshort-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations.

          "description": "This paper proposes an artificial neural network to determine orientation\nusing polarized skylight. This neural network has specific dilated convolution,\nwhich can extract light intensity information of different polarization\ndirections. Then, the degree of polarization (DOP) and angle of polarization\n(AOP) are directly extracted in the network. In addition, the exponential\nfunction encoding of orientation is designed as the network output, which can\nbetter reflect the insect's encoding of polarization information, and improve\nthe accuracy of orientation determination. Finally, training and testing were\nconducted on a public polarized skylight navigation dataset, and the\nexperimental results proved the stability and effectiveness of the network.",

          "description": "In this paper, we propose mean squared error (MSE) loss with outlying label\nfor class imbalanced classification. Cross entropy (CE) loss, which is widely\nused for image recognition, is learned so that the probability value of true\nclass is closer to one by back propagation. However, for imbalanced datasets,\nthe learning is insufficient for the classes with a small number of samples.\nTherefore, we propose a novel classification method using the MSE loss that can\nbe learned the relationships of all classes no matter which image is input.\nUnlike CE loss, MSE loss is possible to equalize the number of back propagation\nfor all classes and to learn the feature space considering the relationships\nbetween classes as metric learning. Furthermore, instead of the usual one-hot\nteacher label, we use a novel teacher label that takes the number of class\nsamples into account. This induces the outlying label which depends on the\nnumber of samples in each class, and the class with a small number of samples\nhas outlying margin in a feature space. It is possible to create the feature\nspace for separating high-difficulty classes and low-difficulty classes. By the\nexperiments on imbalanced classification and semantic segmentation, we\nconfirmed that the proposed method was much improved in comparison with\nstandard CE loss and conventional methods, even though only the loss and\nteacher labels were changed.",

          "description": "Active learning promises to alleviate the massive data needs of supervised\nmachine learning: it has successfully improved sample efficiency by an order of\nmagnitude on traditional tasks like topic classification and object\nrecognition. However, we uncover a striking contrast to this promise: across 5\nmodels and 4 datasets on the task of visual question answering, a wide variety\nof active learning approaches fail to outperform random selection. To\nunderstand this discrepancy, we profile 8 active learning methods on a\nper-example basis, and identify the problem as collective outliers -- groups of\nexamples that active learning methods prefer to acquire but models fail to\nlearn (e.g., questions that ask about text in images or require external\nknowledge). Through systematic ablation experiments and qualitative\nvisualizations, we verify that collective outliers are a general phenomenon\nresponsible for degrading pool-based active learning. Notably, we show that\nactive learning sample efficiency increases significantly as the number of\ncollective outliers in the active learning pool decreases. We conclude with a\ndiscussion and prescriptive recommendations for mitigating the effects of these\noutliers in future work.",

          "description": "The universe is composed of galaxies that have diverse shapes. Once the\nstructure of a galaxy is determined, it is possible to obtain important\ninformation about its formation and evolution. Morphologically classifying\ngalaxies means cataloging them according to their visual appearance and the\nclassification is linked to the physical properties of the galaxy. A\nmorphological classification made through visual inspection is subject to\nbiases introduced by subjective observations made by human volunteers. For this\nreason, systematic, objective and easily reproducible classification of\ngalaxies has been gaining importance since the astronomer Edwin Hubble created\nhis famous classification method. In this work, we combine accurate visual\nclassifications of the Galaxy Zoo project with \\emph {Deep Learning} methods.\nThe goal is to find an efficient technique at human performance level\nclassification, but in a systematic and automatic way, for classification of\nelliptical and spiral galaxies. For this, a neural network model was created\nthrough an Ensemble of four other convolutional models, allowing a greater\naccuracy in the classification than what would be obtained with any one\nindividual. Details of the individual models and improvements made are also\ndescribed. The present work is entirely based on the analysis of images (not\nparameter tables) from DR1 (www.datalab.noao.edu) of the Southern Photometric\nLocal Universe Survey (S-PLUS). In terms of classification, we achieved, with\nthe Ensemble, an accuracy of $\\approx 99 \\%$ in the test sample (using\npre-trained networks).",

To evaluate the\nperformance of domain adaptation, we utilized pre-existing retinal layer\nsegmentation tools developed on a different set of RETOUCH OCT data.

          "description": "Nowadays, deep learning is widely applied to extract features for similarity\ncomputation in person re-identification (re-ID) and have achieved great\nsuccess. However, due to the non-overlapping between training and testing IDs,\nthe difference between the data used for model training and the testing data\nmakes the performance of learned feature degraded during testing. Hence,\nre-ranking is proposed to mitigate this issue and various algorithms have been\ndeveloped. However, most of existing re-ranking methods focus on replacing the\nEuclidean distance with sophisticated distance metrics, which are not friendly\nto downstream tasks and hard to be used for fast retrieval of massive data in\nreal applications. In this work, we propose a graph-based re-ranking method to\nimprove learned features while still keeping Euclidean distance as the\nsimilarity metric. Inspired by graph convolution networks, we develop an\noperator to propagate features over an appropriate graph. Since graph is the\nessential key for the propagation, two important criteria are considered for\ndesigning the graph, and three different graphs are explored accordingly.\nFurthermore, a simple yet effective method is proposed to generate a profile\nvector for each tracklet in videos, which helps extend our method to video\nre-ID. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets, e.g., Market-1501,\nDuke, and MARS, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

Since its inception, BraTS has been\nfocusing on being a common benchmarking venue for brain glioma segmentation\nalgorithms, with well-curated multi-institutional multi-parametric magnetic\nresonance imaging (mpMRI) data. Gliomas are the most common primary\nmalignancies of the central nervous system, with varying degrees of\naggressiveness and prognosis. The RSNA-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS 2021 challenge targets\nthe evaluation of computational algorithms assessing the same tumor\ncompartmentalization, as well as the underlying tumor's molecular\ncharacterization, in pre-operative baseline mpMRI data from 2,000 patients.\nSpecifically, the two tasks that BraTS 2021 focuses on are: a) the segmentation\nof the histologically distinct brain tumor sub-regions, and b) the\nclassification of the tumor's O[6]-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)\npromoter methylation status. The performance evaluation of all participating\nalgorithms in BraTS 2021 will be conducted through the Sage Bionetworks Synapse\nplatform (Task 1) and Kaggle (Task 2), concluding in distributing to the top\nranked participants monetary awards of $60,000 collectively.",

This technology\nenables drivers to use voice commands to control the vehicle and will be soon\navailable in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Prior work has shown\nthat Siri, Alexa and Cortana, are highly vulnerable to inaudible command\nattacks. This could be extended to ADAS in real-world applications and such\ninaudible command threat is difficult to detect due to microphone\nnonlinearities. In this paper, we aim to develop a more practical solution by\nusing camera views to defend against inaudible command attacks where ADAS are\ncapable of detecting their environment via multi-sensors. To this end, we\npropose a novel multimodal deep learning classification system to defend\nagainst inaudible command attacks. Our experimental results confirm the\nfeasibility of the proposed defense methods and the best classification\naccuracy reaches 89.2%.

          "description": "Machine learning models often encounter distribution shifts when deployed in\nthe real world. In this paper, we focus on adaptation to label distribution\nshift in the online setting, where the test-time label distribution is\ncontinually changing and the model must dynamically adapt to it without\nobserving the true label. Leveraging a novel analysis, we show that the lack of\ntrue label does not hinder estimation of the expected test loss, which enables\nthe reduction of online label shift adaptation to conventional online learning.\nInformed by this observation, we propose adaptation algorithms inspired by\nclassical online learning techniques such as Follow The Leader (FTL) and Online\nGradient Descent (OGD) and derive their regret bounds. We empirically verify\nour findings under both simulated and real world label distribution shifts and\nshow that OGD is particularly effective and robust to a variety of challenging\nlabel shift scenarios.",

          "description": "Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) and its Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)\nextensions are state-of-the-art methods for estimating normalizing constants of\nprobability distributions. We propose here a novel Monte Carlo algorithm,\nAnnealed Flow Transport (AFT), that builds upon AIS and SMC and combines them\nwith normalizing flows (NFs) for improved performance. This method transports a\nset of particles using not only importance sampling (IS), Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) and resampling steps - as in SMC, but also relies on NFs which are\nlearned sequentially to push particles towards the successive annealed targets.\nWe provide limit theorems for the resulting Monte Carlo estimates of the\nnormalizing constant and expectations with respect to the target distribution.\nAdditionally, we show that a continuous-time scaling limit of the population\nversion of AFT is given by a Feynman--Kac measure which simplifies to the law\nof a controlled diffusion for expressive NFs. We demonstrate experimentally the\nbenefits and limitations of our methodology on a variety of applications.",

          "description": "There has been a long history of using ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\nto understand the dynamics of discrete-time algorithms (DTAs). Surprisingly,\nthere are still two fundamental and unanswered questions: (i) it is unclear how\nto obtain a \\emph{suitable} ODE from a given DTA, and (ii) it is unclear the\nconnection between the convergence of a DTA and its corresponding ODEs. In this\npaper, we propose a new machinery -- an $O(s^r)$-resolution ODE framework --\nfor analyzing the behavior of a generic DTA, which (partially) answers the\nabove two questions. The framework contains three steps: 1. To obtain a\nsuitable ODE from a given DTA, we define a hierarchy of $O(s^r)$-resolution\nODEs of a DTA parameterized by the degree $r$, where $s$ is the step-size of\nthe DTA. We present a principal approach to construct the unique\n$O(s^r)$-resolution ODEs from a DTA; 2. To analyze the resulting ODE, we\npropose the $O(s^r)$-linear-convergence condition of a DTA with respect to an\nenergy function, under which the $O(s^r)$-resolution ODE converges linearly to\nan optimal solution; 3. To bridge the convergence properties of a DTA and its\ncorresponding ODEs, we define the properness of an energy function and show\nthat the linear convergence of the $O(s^r)$-resolution ODE with respect to a\nproper energy function can automatically guarantee the linear convergence of\nthe DTA. To better illustrate this machinery, we utilize it to study three\nclassic algorithms -- gradient descent ascent (GDA), proximal point method\n(PPM) and extra-gradient method (EGM) -- for solving the unconstrained minimax\nproblem $\\min_{x\\in\\RR^n} \\max_{y\\in \\RR^m} L(x,y)$.",

          "description": "Increasingly, software is making autonomous decisions in case of criminal\nsentencing, approving credit cards, hiring employees, and so on. Some of these\ndecisions show bias and adversely affect certain social groups (e.g. those\ndefined by sex, race, age, marital status). Many prior works on bias mitigation\ntake the following form: change the data or learners in multiple ways, then see\nif any of that improves fairness. Perhaps a better approach is to postulate\nroot causes of bias and then applying some resolution strategy. This paper\npostulates that the root causes of bias are the prior decisions that affect-\n(a) what data was selected and (b) the labels assigned to those examples. Our\nFair-SMOTE algorithm removes biased labels; and rebalances internal\ndistributions such that based on sensitive attribute, examples are equal in\nboth positive and negative classes. On testing, it was seen that this method\nwas just as effective at reducing bias as prior approaches. Further, models\ngenerated via Fair-SMOTE achieve higher performance (measured in terms of\nrecall and F1) than other state-of-the-art fairness improvement algorithms. To\nthe best of our knowledge, measured in terms of number of analyzed learners and\ndatasets, this study is one of the largest studies on bias mitigation yet\npresented in the literature.",

          "description": "Bandit problems with linear or concave reward have been extensively studied,\nbut relatively few works have studied bandits with non-concave reward. This\nwork considers a large family of bandit problems where the unknown underlying\nreward function is non-concave, including the low-rank generalized linear\nbandit problems and two-layer neural network with polynomial activation bandit\nproblem. For the low-rank generalized linear bandit problem, we provide a\nminimax-optimal algorithm in the dimension, refuting both conjectures in\n[LMT21, JWWN19]. Our algorithms are based on a unified zeroth-order\noptimization paradigm that applies in great generality and attains optimal\nrates in several structured polynomial settings (in the dimension). We further\ndemonstrate the applicability of our algorithms in RL in the generative model\nsetting, resulting in improved sample complexity over prior approaches.\nFinally, we show that the standard optimistic algorithms (e.g., UCB) are\nsub-optimal by dimension factors. In the neural net setting (with polynomial\nactivation functions) with noiseless reward, we provide a bandit algorithm with\nsample complexity equal to the intrinsic algebraic dimension. Again, we show\nthat optimistic approaches have worse sample complexity, polynomial in the\nextrinsic dimension (which could be exponentially worse in the polynomial\ndegree).",

New analytical\nand numerical random walk methods are needed to cope with the increasing\ndiversity and complexity of multilayer networks. We propose here MultiXrank, a\nPython package that enables Random Walk with Restart (RWR) on any kind of\nmultilayer network with an optimized implementation. This package is supported\nby a universal mathematical formulation of the RWR. We evaluated MultiXrank\nwith leave-one-out cross-validation and link prediction, and introduced\nprotocols to measure the impact of the addition or removal of multilayer\nnetwork data on prediction performances. We further measured the sensitivity of\nMultiXrank to input parameters by in-depth exploration of the parameter space.\nFinally, we illustrate the versatility of MultiXrank with different use-cases\nof unsupervised node prioritization and supervised classification in the\ncontext of human genetic diseases.",

We frame subproblem selection as a\nregression problem and train a Transformer on a generated training set of\nproblem instances.

          "description": "Applying Federated Learning (FL) on Internet-of-Things devices is\nnecessitated by the large volumes of data they produce and growing concerns of\ndata privacy. However, there are three challenges that need to be addressed to\nmake FL efficient: (i) execute on devices with limited computational\ncapabilities, (ii) account for stragglers due to computational heterogeneity of\ndevices, and (iii) adapt to the changing network bandwidths. This paper\npresents FedAdapt, an adaptive offloading FL framework to mitigate the\naforementioned challenges. FedAdapt accelerates local training in\ncomputationally constrained devices by leveraging layer offloading of deep\nneural networks (DNNs) to servers. Further, FedAdapt adopts reinforcement\nlearning-based optimization and clustering to adaptively identify which layers\nof the DNN should be offloaded for each individual device on to a server to\ntackle the challenges of computational heterogeneity and changing network\nbandwidth. Experimental studies are carried out on a lab-based testbed\ncomprising five IoT devices. By offloading a DNN from the device to the server\nFedAdapt reduces the training time of a typical IoT device by over half\ncompared to classic FL. The training time of extreme stragglers and the overall\ntraining time can be reduced by up to 57%. Furthermore, with changing network\nbandwidth, FedAdapt is demonstrated to reduce the training time by up to 40%\nwhen compared to classic FL, without sacrificing accuracy. FedAdapt can be\ndownloaded from https://github.com/qub-blesson/FedAdapt.",

          "description": "As technology scaling is approaching the physical limit, lithography hotspot\ndetection has become an essential task in design for manufacturability. While\nthe deployment of pattern matching or machine learning in hotspot detection can\nhelp save significant simulation time, such methods typically demand for\nnon-trivial quality data to build the model, which most design houses are short\nof. Moreover, the design houses are also unwilling to directly share such data\nwith the other houses to build a unified model, which can be ineffective for\nthe design house with unique design patterns due to data insufficiency. On the\nother hand, with data homogeneity in each design house, the locally trained\nmodels can be easily over-fitted, losing generalization ability and robustness.\nIn this paper, we propose a heterogeneous federated learning framework for\nlithography hotspot detection that can address the aforementioned issues. On\none hand, the framework can build a more robust centralized global sub-model\nthrough heterogeneous knowledge sharing while keeping local data private. On\nthe other hand, the global sub-model can be combined with a local sub-model to\nbetter adapt to local data heterogeneity. The experimental results show that\nthe proposed framework can overcome the challenge of non-independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) data and heterogeneous communication to\nachieve very high performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods\nwhile guaranteeing a good convergence rate in various scenarios.",

          "description": "Sleep staging is of great importance in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep\ndisorders. Recently, numerous data driven deep learning models have been\nproposed for automatic sleep staging. They mainly rely on the assumption that\ntraining and testing data are drawn from the same distribution which may not\nhold in real-world scenarios. Unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) has been\nrecently developed to handle this domain shift problem. However, previous UDA\nmethods applied for sleep staging has two main limitations. First, they rely on\na totally shared model for the domain alignment, which may lose the\ndomain-specific information during feature extraction. Second, they only align\nthe source and target distributions globally without considering the class\ninformation in the target domain, which hinders the classification performance\nof the model. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework\nto tackle the domain shift problem in the unlabeled target domain. First, we\ndevelop unshared attention mechanisms to preserve the domain-specific features\nin the source and target domains. Second, we design a self-training strategy to\nalign the fine-grained class distributions for the source and target domains\nvia target domain pseudo labels. We also propose dual distinct classifiers to\nincrease the robustness and quality of the pseudo labels. The experimental\nresults on six cross-domain scenarios validate the efficacy of our proposed\nframework for sleep staging and its advantage over state-of-the-art UDA\nmethods.",

          "description": "The process of aggregation is ubiquitous in almost all deep nets models. It\nfunctions as an important mechanism for consolidating deep features into a more\ncompact representation, whilst increasing robustness to overfitting and\nproviding spatial invariance in deep nets. In particular, the proximity of\nglobal aggregation layers to the output layers of DNNs mean that aggregated\nfeatures have a direct influence on the performance of a deep net. A better\nunderstanding of this relationship can be obtained using information theoretic\nmethods. However, this requires the knowledge of the distributions of the\nactivations of aggregation layers. To achieve this, we propose a novel\nmathematical formulation for analytically modelling the probability\ndistributions of output values of layers involved with deep feature\naggregation. An important outcome is our ability to analytically predict the\nKL-divergence of output nodes in a DNN.

          "description": "The deployment of convolutional neural networks is often hindered by high\ncomputational and storage requirements. Structured model pruning is a promising\napproach to alleviate these requirements. Using the VGG-16 model as an example,\nwe measure the accuracy-efficiency trade-off for various structured model\npruning methods and datasets (CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) on Tensor Processing Units\n(TPUs). To measure the actual performance of models, we develop a structured\nmodel pruning library for TensorFlow2 to modify models in place (instead of\nadding mask layers). We show that structured model pruning can significantly\nimprove model memory usage and speed on TPUs without losing accuracy,\nespecially for small datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10).",

However, these neural network-based policies\nhave been shown to be susceptible to exploitation by adversarial agents.\nTherefore, there is a need to develop techniques to learn control policies that\nare robust against adversaries. We introduce Adversarially Robust Control\n(ARC), which trains the protagonist policy and the adversarial policy\nend-to-end on the same loss. The aim of the protagonist is to maximise this\nloss, whilst the adversary is attempting to minimise it. We demonstrate the\nproposed ARC training in a highway driving scenario, where the protagonist\ncontrols the follower vehicle whilst the adversary controls the lead vehicle.\nBy training the protagonist against an ensemble of adversaries, it learns a\nsignificantly more robust control policy, which generalises to a variety of\nadversarial strategies. The approach is shown to reduce the amount of\ncollisions against new adversaries by up to 90.25%, compared to the original\npolicy. Moreover, by utilising an auxiliary distillation loss, we show that the\nfine-tuned control policy shows no drop in performance across its original\ntraining distribution.",

Here, we present a joint convolutional neural network (CNN) - long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) model to infer the auditory attention. Our joint\nCNN-LSTM model takes the EEG signals and the spectrogram of the multiple\nspeakers as inputs and classifies the attention to one of the speakers. We\nevaluated the reliability of our neural network using three different datasets\ncomprising of 61 subjects where, each subject undertook a dual-speaker\nexperiment. The three datasets analysed corresponded to speech stimuli\npresented in three different languages namely German, Danish and Dutch. Using\nthe proposed joint CNN-LSTM model, we obtained a median decoding accuracy of\n77.2% at a trial duration of three seconds.

          "description": "Adaptation of a classifier to new domains is one of the challenging problems\nin machine learning. This has been addressed using many deep and non-deep\nlearning based methods. Among the methodologies used, that of adversarial\nlearning is widely applied to solve many deep learning problems along with\ndomain adaptation. These methods are based on a discriminator that ensures\nsource and target distributions are close. However, here we suggest that rather\nthan using a point estimate obtaining by a single discriminator, it would be\nuseful if a distribution based on ensembles of discriminators could be used to\nbridge this gap. This could be achieved using multiple classifiers or using\ntraditional ensemble methods. In contrast, we suggest that a Monte Carlo\ndropout based ensemble discriminator could suffice to obtain the distribution\nbased discriminator. Specifically, we propose a curriculum based dropout\ndiscriminator that gradually increases the variance of the sample based\ndistribution and the corresponding reverse gradients are used to align the\nsource and target feature representations. An ensemble of discriminators helps\nthe model to learn the data distribution efficiently. It also provides a better\ngradient estimates to train the feature extractor. The detailed results and\nthorough ablation analysis show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art\nresults.",

To mitigate this, we propose Form2Seq, a novel\nsequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) inspired framework for structure extraction\nusing text, with a specific focus on forms, which leverages relative spatial\narrangement of structures. We discuss two tasks; 1) Classification of low-level\nconstituent elements (TextBlock and empty fillable Widget) into ten types such\nas field captions, list items, and others; 2) Grouping lower-level elements\ninto higher-order constructs, such as Text Fields, ChoiceFields and\nChoiceGroups, used as information collection mechanism in forms. To achieve\nthis, we arrange the constituent elements linearly in natural reading order,\nfeed their spatial and textual representations to Seq2Seq framework, which\nsequentially outputs prediction of each element depending on the final task.

          "description": "Recent advances in robot learning have enabled robots to become increasingly\nbetter at mastering a predefined set of tasks. On the other hand, as humans, we\nhave the ability to learn a growing set of tasks over our lifetime. Continual\nrobot learning is an emerging research direction with the goal of endowing\nrobots with this ability. In order to learn new tasks over time, the robot\nfirst needs to infer the task at hand. Task inference, however, has received\nlittle attention in the multi-task learning literature. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach to continual learning of robotic control tasks. Our\napproach performs unsupervised learning of behavior embeddings by incrementally\nself-organizing demonstrated behaviors. Task inference is made by finding the\nnearest behavior embedding to a demonstrated behavior, which is used together\nwith the environment state as input to a multi-task policy trained with\nreinforcement learning to optimize performance over tasks. Unlike previous\napproaches, our approach makes no assumptions about task distribution and\nrequires no task exploration to infer tasks. We evaluate our approach in\nexperiments with concurrently and sequentially presented tasks and show that it\noutperforms other multi-task learning approaches in terms of generalization\nperformance and convergence speed, particularly in the continual learning\nsetting.",

In this work,\nwe propose, for the first time, to introduce the non-linear data projection\nconcept into the design of FSFGIC architecture in order to address the limited\nsample problem in few-shot learning and at the same time to increase the\ndiscriminability of the model for fine-grained image classification.\nSpecifically, we first design a feature re-abstraction embedding network that\nhas the ability to not only obtain the required semantic features for effective\nmetric learning but also re-enhance such features with finer details from input\nimages. Then the descriptors of the query images and the support classes are\nprojected into different non-linear spaces in our proposed similarity metric\nlearning network to learn discriminative projection factors. This design can\neffectively operate in the challenging and restricted condition of a FSFGIC\ntask for making the distance between the samples within the same class smaller\nand the distance between samples from different classes larger and for reducing\nthe coupling relationship between samples from different categories.\nFurthermore, a novel similarity measure based on the proposed non-linear data\nproject is presented for evaluating the relationships of feature information\nbetween a query image and a support set. It is worth to note that our proposed\narchitecture can be easily embedded into any episodic training mechanisms for\nend-to-end training from scratch.

However, implementing such operators\nefficiently with complex hardwareintrinsics such as matrix multiply is a task\nnot yet automated gracefully. Solving this task often requires joint program\nand data layouttransformations. First solutions to this problem have been\nproposed, such as TVM, UNIT or ISAMIR, which work on a loop-levelrepresentation\nof operators and specify data layout and possible program transformations\nbefore the embedding into the operator isperformed.

          "description": "Massive deployment of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in high-stake applications\ngenerates a strong demand for explanations that are robust to noise and align\nwell with human intuition. Most existing methods generate explanations by\nidentifying a subgraph of an input graph that has a strong correlation with the\nprediction. These explanations are not robust to noise because independently\noptimizing the correlation for a single input can easily overfit noise.\nMoreover, they do not align well with human intuition because removing an\nidentified subgraph from an input graph does not necessarily change the\nprediction result. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate robust\ncounterfactual explanations on GNNs by explicitly modelling the common decision\nlogic of GNNs on similar input graphs. Our explanations are naturally robust to\nnoise because they are produced from the common decision boundaries of a GNN\nthat govern the predictions of many similar input graphs.

To overcome this, we present a flexible framework to extend model-based\nlearning directly to nonuniform meshes, by interpreting the mesh as a graph and\nformulating our network architectures using graph convolutional neural\nnetworks. This gives rise to the proposed iterative Graph Convolutional\nNewton-type Method (GCNM), which includes the forward model in the solution of\nthe inverse problem, while all updates are directly computed by the network on\nthe problem specific mesh.

The security of this\napproach rests upon the difficulty of modeling the decisions of interacting\nagents from limited observations, a problem which we conjecture is also hard\nfor quantum computing. We release PyAMI, a prototype authentication and key\nagreement system based on the proposed method. We empirically validate our\nmethod for authenticating legitimate users while detecting different types of\nadversarial attacks. Finally, we show how reinforcement learning techniques can\nbe used to train server models which effectively probe a client's decisions to\nachieve more sample-efficient authentication.",

          "description": "Multi-relational graph is a ubiquitous and important data structure, allowing\nflexible representation of multiple types of interactions and relations between\nentities. Similar to other graph-structured data, link prediction is one of the\nmost important tasks on multi-relational graphs and is often used for knowledge\ncompletion. When related graphs coexist, it is of great benefit to build a\nlarger graph via integrating the smaller ones. The integration requires\npredicting hidden relational connections between entities belonged to different\ngraphs (inter-domain link prediction). However, this poses a real challenge to\nexisting methods that are exclusively designed for link prediction between\nentities of the same graph only (intra-domain link prediction). In this study,\nwe propose a new approach to tackle the inter-domain link prediction problem by\nsoftly aligning the entity distributions between different domains with optimal\ntransport and maximum mean discrepancy regularizers. Experiments on real-world\ndatasets show that optimal transport regularizer is beneficial and considerably\nimproves the performance of baseline methods.",

          "description": "Online allocation problems with resource constraints are central problems in\nrevenue management and online advertising. In these problems, requests arrive\nsequentially during a finite horizon and, for each request, a decision maker\nneeds to choose an action that consumes a certain amount of resources and\ngenerates reward. The objective is to maximize cumulative rewards subject to a\nconstraint on the total consumption of resources. In this paper, we consider a\ndata-driven setting in which the reward and resource consumption of each\nrequest are generated using an input model that is unknown to the decision\nmaker.\n\nWe design a general class of algorithms that attain good performance in\nvarious inputs models without knowing which type of input they are facing. In\nparticular, our algorithms are asymptotically optimal under stochastic i.i.d.\ninput model as well as various non-stationary stochastic input models, and they\nattain an asymptotically optimal fixed competitive ratio when the input is\nadversarial. Our algorithms operate in the Lagrangian dual space: they maintain\na dual multiplier for each resource that is updated using online mirror\ndescent. By choosing the reference function accordingly, we recover dual\nsub-gradient descent and dual exponential weights algorithm. The resulting\nalgorithms are simple, fast, and have minimal requirements on the reward\nfunctions, consumption functions and the action space, in contrast to existing\nmethods for online allocation problems. We discuss applications to network\nrevenue management, online bidding in repeated auctions with budget\nconstraints, online proportional matching with high entropy, and personalized\nassortment optimization with limited inventories.",

The\nfield has been recently boosted by the use of neural-based generators which\nexhibit on one side great syntactic skills without the need of hand-crafted\npipelines; on the other side, the quality of the generated text reflects the\nquality of the training data, which in realistic settings only offer\nimperfectly aligned structure-text pairs. Consequently, state-of-art neural\nmodels include misleading statements - usually called hallucinations - in their\noutputs. The control of this phenomenon is today a major challenge for DTG, and\nis the problem addressed in the paper.\n\nPrevious work deal with this issue at the instance level: using an alignment\nscore for each table-reference pair. In contrast, we propose a finer-grained\napproach, arguing that hallucinations should rather be treated at the word\nlevel. Specifically, we propose a Multi-Branch Decoder which is able to\nleverage word-level labels to learn the relevant parts of each training\ninstance. These labels are obtained following a simple and efficient scoring\nprocedure based on co-occurrence analysis and dependency parsing. Extensive\nevaluations, via automated metrics and human judgment on the standard WikiBio\nbenchmark, show the accuracy of our alignment labels and the effectiveness of\nthe proposed Multi-Branch Decoder.

          "description": "We consider local planning in fixed-horizon MDPs with a generative model\nunder the assumption that the optimal value function lies close to the span of\na feature map. The generative model provides a local access to the MDP: The\nplanner can ask for random transitions from previously returned states and\narbitrary actions, and features are only accessible for states that are\nencountered in this process. As opposed to previous work (e.g. Lattimore et al.\n(2020)) where linear realizability of all policies was assumed, we consider the\nsignificantly relaxed assumption of a single linearly realizable\n(deterministic) policy. A recent lower bound by Weisz et al. (2020) established\nthat the related problem when the action-value function of the optimal policy\nis linearly realizable requires an exponential number of queries, either in $H$\n(the horizon of the MDP) or $d$ (the dimension of the feature mapping). Their\nconstruction crucially relies on having an exponentially large action set. In\ncontrast, in this work, we establish that poly$(H,d)$ planning is possible with\nstate value function realizability whenever the action set has a constant size.\nIn particular, we present the TensorPlan algorithm which uses\npoly$((dH/\\delta)^A)$ simulator queries to find a $\\delta$-optimal policy\nrelative to any deterministic policy for which the value function is linearly\nrealizable with some bounded parameter. This is the first algorithm to give a\npolynomial query complexity guarantee using only linear-realizability of a\nsingle competing value function. Whether the computation cost is similarly\nbounded remains an open question. We extend the upper bound to the\nnear-realizable case and to the infinite-horizon discounted setup. We also\npresent a lower bound in the infinite-horizon episodic setting: Planners that\nachieve constant suboptimality need exponentially many queries, either in $d$\nor the number of actions.",

          "description": "Boosting techniques and neural networks are particularly effective machine\nlearning methods for insurance pricing. Often in practice, there are\nnevertheless endless debates about the choice of the right loss function to be\nused to train the machine learning model, as well as about the appropriate\nmetric to assess the performances of competing models. Also, the sum of fitted\nvalues can depart from the observed totals to a large extent and this often\nconfuses actuarial analysts. The lack of balance inherent to training models by\nminimizing deviance outside the familiar GLM with canonical link setting has\nbeen empirically documented in W\\\"uthrich (2019, 2020) who attributes it to the\nearly stopping rule in gradient descent methods for model fitting. The present\npaper aims to further study this phenomenon when learning proceeds by\nminimizing Tweedie deviance. It is shown that minimizing deviance involves a\ntrade-off between the integral of weighted differences of lower partial moments\nand the bias measured on a specific scale. Autocalibration is then proposed as\na remedy. This new method to correct for bias adds an extra local GLM step to\nthe analysis. Theoretically, it is shown that it implements the autocalibration\nconcept in pure premium calculation and ensures that balance also holds on a\nlocal scale, not only at portfolio level as with existing bias-correction\ntechniques. The convex order appears to be the natural tool to compare\ncompeting models, putting a new light on the diagnostic graphs and associated\nmetrics proposed by Denuit et al. (2019).",

          "description": "Application of deep neural networks to medical imaging tasks has in some\nsense become commonplace. Still, a \"thorn in the side\" of the deep learning\nmovement is the argument that deep networks are prone to overfitting and are\nthus unable to generalize well when datasets are small (as is common in medical\nimaging tasks). One way to bolster confidence is to provide mathematical\nguarantees, or bounds, on network performance after training which explicitly\nquantify the possibility of overfitting. In this work, we explore recent\nadvances using the PAC-Bayesian framework to provide bounds on generalization\nerror for large (stochastic) networks. While previous efforts focus on\nclassification in larger natural image datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR-10), we\napply these techniques to both classification and segmentation in a smaller\nmedical imagining dataset: the ISIC 2018 challenge set. We observe the\nresultant bounds are competitive compared to a simpler baseline, while also\nbeing more explainable and alleviating the need for holdout sets.",

          "description": "Predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) via reliable computational methods\nis an effective and efficient way to mitigate the enormous costs and time of\nthe drug discovery process. Structure-based drug similarities and\nsequence-based target protein similarities are the commonly used information\nfor DTI prediction. Among numerous computational methods, neighborhood-based\nchemogenomic approaches that leverage drug and target similarities to perform\npredictions directly are simple but promising ones. However, existing\nsimilarity-based methods need to be re-trained to predict interactions for any\nnew drugs or targets and cannot directly perform predictions for both new\ndrugs, new targets, and new drug-target pairs. Furthermore, a large amount of\nmissing (undetected) interactions in current DTI datasets hinders most DTI\nprediction methods. To address these issues, we propose a new method denoted as\nWeighted k-Nearest Neighbor with Interaction Recovery (WkNNIR). Not only can\nWkNNIR estimate interactions of any new drugs and/or new targets without any\nneed of re-training, but it can also recover missing interactions (false\nnegatives). In addition, WkNNIR exploits local imbalance to promote the\ninfluence of more reliable similarities on the interaction recovery and\nprediction processes. We also propose a series of ensemble methods that employ\ndiverse sampling strategies and could be coupled with WkNNIR as well as any\nother DTI prediction method to improve performance. Experimental results over\nfive benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in\npredicting drug-target interactions. Lastly, we confirm the practical\nprediction ability of proposed methods to discover reliable interactions that\nwere not reported in the original benchmark datasets.",

The required quality bar is close to perfection, the range of\nsentences is extremely narrow, and the sentences are often very different than\nthe ones in the machine translation training data. This combination of\nrequirements is novel in the field of domain adaptation for machine\ntranslation. We are able to reach the required quality bar by building on\nexisting ideas and adding new ones: finetuning on in-domain translations,\nadding sentences from the Web, adding semantic annotations, and using automatic\nerror detection. The paper shares our approach and results, together with a\ndistillation model to serve the translation models at scale.",

          "description": "Graphically-rich applications such as games are ubiquitous with attractive\nvisual effects of Graphical User Interface (GUI) that offers a bridge between\nsoftware applications and end-users. However, various types of graphical\nglitches may arise from such GUI complexity and have become one of the main\ncomponent of software compatibility issues. Our study on bug reports from game\ndevelopment teams in NetEase Inc. indicates that graphical glitches frequently\noccur during the GUI rendering and severely degrade the quality of\ngraphically-rich applications such as video games. Existing automated testing\ntechniques for such applications focus mainly on generating various GUI test\nsequences and check whether the test sequences can cause crashes. These\ntechniques require constant human attention to captures non-crashing bugs such\nas bugs causing graphical glitches. In this paper, we present the first step in\nautomating the test oracle for detecting non-crashing bugs in graphically-rich\napplications. Specifically, we propose \\texttt{GLIB} based on a code-based data\naugmentation technique to detect game GUI glitches. We perform an evaluation of\n\\texttt{GLIB} on 20 real-world game apps (with bug reports available) and the\nresult shows that \\texttt{GLIB} can achieve 100\\% precision and 99.5\\% recall\nin detecting non-crashing bugs such as game GUI glitches. Practical application\nof \\texttt{GLIB} on another 14 real-world games (without bug reports) further\ndemonstrates that \\texttt{GLIB} can effectively uncover GUI glitches, with 48\nof 53 bugs reported by \\texttt{GLIB} having been confirmed and fixed so far.",

          "description": "ECG is an attractive option to assess stress in serious Virtual Reality (VR)\napplications due to its non-invasive nature. However, the existing Machine\nLearning (ML) models perform poorly. Moreover, existing studies only perform a\nbinary stress assessment, while to develop a more engaging biofeedback-based\napplication, multi-level assessment is necessary. Existing studies annotate and\nclassify a single experience (e.g. watching a VR video) to a single stress\nlevel, which again prevents design of dynamic experiences where real-time\nin-game stress assessment can be utilized. In this paper, we report our\nfindings on a new study on VR stress assessment, where three stress levels are\nassessed. ECG data was collected from 9 users experiencing a VR roller coaster.\nThe VR experience was then manually labeled in 10-seconds segments to three\nstress levels by three raters. We then propose a novel multimodal deep fusion\nmodel utilizing spectrogram and 1D ECG that can provide a stress prediction\nfrom just a 1-second window. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nmodel outperforms the classical HRV-based ML models (9% increase in accuracy)\nand baseline deep learning models (2.5% increase in accuracy).

          "description": "Newton methods have fallen out of favor for modern optimization problems\n(e.g. deep learning) because of concerns about per-iteration computational\ncomplexity. In this setting highly subsampled first order methods are\npreferred. In this work we motivate the extension of Newton methods to the\nhighly stochastic regime, and argue for the use of the scalable low rank saddle\nfree Newton (LRSFN) method. In this setting, iterative updates are dominated by\nstochastic noise, and stability of the method is key. In stability analysis, we\ndemonstrate that stochastic errors for Newton methods can be greatly amplified\nby ill-conditioned matrix operators. The LRSFN algorithm mitigates this issue\nby the use of Levenberg-Marquardt damping, but generally second order methods\nwith stochastic Hessian and gradient information may need to take small steps,\nunlike in deterministic problems. Numerical results show that even under\nrestrictive step-length conditions, LRSFN can outperform popular first order\nmethods on nontrivial deep learning tasks in terms of generalizability for\nequivalent computational work.",

          "description": "Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) has been widely used to create lower order,\ncomputationally inexpensive representations of higher-order dynamical systems.\nUsing these representations, ROMs can efficiently model flow fields while using\nsignificantly lesser parameters. Conventional ROMs accomplish this by linearly\nprojecting higher-order manifolds to lower-dimensional space using\ndimensionality reduction techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition\n(POD). In this work, we develop a novel deep learning framework DL-ROM (Deep\nLearning - Reduced Order Modelling) to create a neural network capable of\nnon-linear projections to reduced order states. We then use the learned reduced\nstate to efficiently predict future time steps of the simulation using 3D\nAutoencoder and 3D U-Net based architectures. Our model DL-ROM is able to\ncreate highly accurate reconstructions from the learned ROM and is thus able to\nefficiently predict future time steps by temporally traversing in the learned\nreduced state. All of this is achieved without ground truth supervision or\nneeding to iteratively solve the expensive Navier-Stokes(NS) equations thereby\nresulting in massive computational savings. To test the effectiveness and\nperformance of our approach, we evaluate our implementation on five different\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets using reconstruction performance\nand computational runtime metrics.

          "description": "Communities in social networks evolve over time as people enter and leave the\nnetwork and their activity behaviors shift. The task of predicting structural\nchanges in communities over time is known as community evolution prediction.\nExisting work in this area has focused on the development of frameworks for\ndefining events while using traditional classification methods to perform the\nactual prediction. We present a novel graph neural network for predicting\ncommunity evolution events from structural and temporal information. The model\n(GNAN) includes a group-node attention component which enables support for\nvariable-sized inputs and learned representation of groups based on member and\nneighbor node features. A comparative evaluation with standard baseline methods\nis performed and we demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines.\nAdditionally, we show the effects of network trends on model performance.",

          "description": "Continual learning-the ability to learn many tasks in sequence-is critical\nfor artificial learning systems. Yet standard training methods for deep\nnetworks often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks\nerases knowledge of earlier tasks. While catastrophic forgetting labels the\nproblem, the theoretical reasons for interference between tasks remain unclear.\nHere, we attempt to narrow this gap between theory and practice by studying\ncontinual learning in the teacher-student setup. We extend previous analytical\nwork on two-layer networks in the teacher-student setup to multiple teachers.\nUsing each teacher to represent a different task, we investigate how the\nrelationship between teachers affects the amount of forgetting and transfer\nexhibited by the student when the task switches. In line with recent work, we\nfind that when tasks depend on similar features, intermediate task similarity\nleads to greatest forgetting. However, feature similarity is only one way in\nwhich tasks may be related. The teacher-student approach allows us to\ndisentangle task similarity at the level of readouts (hidden-to-output weights)\nand features (input-to-hidden weights). We find a complex interplay between\nboth types of similarity, initial transfer/forgetting rates, maximum\ntransfer/forgetting, and long-term transfer/forgetting. Together, these results\nhelp illuminate the diverse factors contributing to catastrophic forgetting.",

          "description": "Imitation learning has been widely used to learn control policies for\nautonomous driving based on pre-recorded data. However, imitation learning\nbased policies have been shown to be susceptible to compounding errors when\nencountering states outside of the training distribution. Further, these agents\nhave been demonstrated to be easily exploitable by adversarial road users\naiming to create collisions. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce\nAdversarial Mixture Density Networks (AMDN), which learns two distributions\nfrom separate datasets. The first is a distribution of safe actions learned\nfrom a dataset of naturalistic human driving. The second is a distribution\nrepresenting unsafe actions likely to lead to collision, learned from a dataset\nof collisions. During training, we leverage these two distributions to provide\nan additional loss based on the similarity of the two distributions. By\npenalising the safe action distribution based on its similarity to the unsafe\naction distribution when training on the collision dataset, a more robust and\nsafe control policy is obtained. We demonstrate the proposed AMDN approach in a\nvehicle following use-case, and evaluate under naturalistic and adversarial\ntesting environments. We show that despite its simplicity, AMDN provides\nsignificant benefits for the safety of the learned control policy, when\ncompared to pure imitation learning or standard mixture density network\napproaches.",

We investigate the existence of underlying\nstructures in the empirical interpolation coefficients using autoencoders.

          "description": "Model compression is generally performed by using quantization, low-rank\napproximation or pruning, for which various algorithms have been researched in\nrecent years. One fundamental question is: what types of compression work\nbetter for a given model? Or even better: can we improve by combining\ncompressions in a suitable way? We formulate this generally as a problem of\noptimizing the loss but where the weights are constrained to equal an additive\ncombination of separately compressed parts; and we give an algorithm to learn\nthe corresponding parts' parameters. Experimentally with deep neural nets, we\nobserve that 1) we can find significantly better models in the\nerror-compression space, indicating that different compression types have\ncomplementary benefits, and 2) the best type of combination depends exquisitely\non the type of neural net. For example, we can compress ResNets and AlexNet\nusing only 1 bit per weight without error degradation at the cost of adding a\nfew floating point weights. However, VGG nets can be better compressed by\ncombining low-rank with a few floating point weights.",

In particular, in this article we\nprove in the case where the target function is possibly multi-dimensional and\ncontinuous and in the case where the probability distribution of the input data\nis absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure that the risk of\nevery bounded GF trajectory converges to the risk of a critical point.

Finally, in the special situation where there is only one neuron on the\nhidden layer (1-dimensional hidden layer) we strengthen the above named result\nfor affine linear target functions by proving that that the risk of every (not\nnecessarily bounded) GF trajectory converges to zero if the initial risk is\nsufficiently small.",

          "description": "This work addresses the problem of predicting the motion trajectories of\ndynamic objects in the environment. Recent advances in predicting motion\npatterns often rely on machine learning techniques to extrapolate motion\npatterns from observed trajectories, with no mechanism to directly incorporate\nknown rules. We propose a novel framework, which combines probabilistic\nlearning and constrained trajectory optimisation. The learning component of our\nframework provides a distribution over future motion trajectories conditioned\non observed past coordinates. This distribution is then used as a prior to a\nconstrained optimisation problem which enforces chance constraints on the\ntrajectory distribution. This results in constraint-compliant trajectory\ndistributions which closely resemble the prior. In particular, we focus our\ninvestigation on collision constraints, such that extrapolated future\ntrajectory distributions conform to the environment structure. We empirically\ndemonstrate on real-world and simulated datasets the ability of our framework\nto learn complex probabilistic motion trajectories for motion data, while\ndirectly enforcing constraints to improve generalisability, producing more\nrobust and higher quality trajectory distributions.",

          "description": "Deep learning practitioners often operate on a computational and monetary\nbudget. Thus, it is critical to design optimization algorithms that perform\nwell under any budget. The linear learning rate schedule is considered the best\nbudget-aware schedule, as it outperforms most other schedules in the low budget\nregime. On the other hand, learning rate schedules -- such as the\n\\texttt{30-60-90} step schedule -- are known to achieve high performance when\nthe model can be trained for many epochs. Yet, it is often not known a priori\nwhether one's budget will be large or small; thus, the optimal choice of\nlearning rate schedule is made on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we frame\nthe learning rate schedule selection problem as a combination of $i)$ selecting\na profile (i.e., the continuous function that models the learning rate\nschedule), and $ii)$ choosing a sampling rate (i.e., how frequently the\nlearning rate is updated/sampled from this profile). We propose a novel profile\nand sampling rate combination called the Reflected Exponential (REX) schedule,\nwhich we evaluate across seven different experimental settings with both SGD\nand Adam optimizers. REX outperforms the linear schedule in the low budget\nregime, while matching or exceeding the performance of several state-of-the-art\nlearning rate schedules (linear, step, exponential, cosine, step decay on\nplateau, and OneCycle) in both high and low budget regimes. Furthermore, REX\nrequires no added computation, storage, or hyperparameters.",

          "description": "In recent years, formal methods of privacy protection such as differential\nprivacy (DP), capable of deployment to data-driven tasks such as machine\nlearning (ML), have emerged. Reconciling large-scale ML with the closed-form\nreasoning required for the principled analysis of individual privacy loss\nrequires the introduction of new tools for automatic sensitivity analysis and\nfor tracking an individual's data and their features through the flow of\ncomputation. For this purpose, we introduce a novel \\textit{hybrid} automatic\ndifferentiation (AD) system which combines the efficiency of reverse-mode AD\nwith an ability to obtain a closed-form expression for any given quantity in\nthe computational graph. This enables modelling the sensitivity of arbitrary\ndifferentiable function compositions, such as the training of neural networks\non private data. We demonstrate our approach by analysing the individual DP\nguarantees of statistical database queries. Moreover, we investigate the\napplication of our technique to the training of DP neural networks. Our\napproach can enable the principled reasoning about privacy loss in the setting\nof data processing, and further the development of automatic sensitivity\nanalysis and privacy budgeting systems.",

          "description": "Safe exploration is crucial for the real-world application of reinforcement\nlearning (RL). Previous works consider the safe exploration problem as\nConstrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the policies are being\noptimized under constraints. However, when encountering any potential dangers,\nhuman tends to stop immediately and rarely learns to behave safely in danger.\nMotivated by human learning, we introduce a new approach to address safe RL\nproblems under the framework of Early Terminated MDP (ET-MDP). We first define\nthe ET-MDP as an unconstrained MDP with the same optimal value function as its\ncorresponding CMDP. An off-policy algorithm based on context models is then\nproposed to solve the ET-MDP, which thereby solves the corresponding CMDP with\nbetter asymptotic performance and improved learning efficiency.

          "description": "Learning from data that contain missing values represents a common phenomenon\nin many domains. Relatively few Bayesian Network structure learning algorithms\naccount for missing data, and those that do tend to rely on standard approaches\nthat assume missing data are missing at random, such as the\nExpectation-Maximisation algorithm. Because missing data are often systematic,\nthere is a need for more pragmatic methods that can effectively deal with data\nsets containing missing values not missing at random. The absence of approaches\nthat deal with systematic missing data impedes the application of BN structure\nlearning methods to real-world problems where missingness are not random. This\npaper describes three variants of greedy search structure learning that utilise\npairwise deletion and inverse probability weighting to maximally leverage the\nobserved data and to limit potential bias caused by missing values. The first\ntwo of the variants can be viewed as sub-versions of the third and best\nperforming variant, but are important in their own in illustrating the\nsuccessive improvements in learning accuracy. The empirical investigations show\nthat the proposed approach outperforms the commonly used and state-of-the-art\nStructural EM algorithm, both in terms of learning accuracy and efficiency, as\nwell as both when data are missing at random and not at random.",

However, the performance of CAS detection was poor due to many\nreasons, one of which is the highly diversified CAS patterns. To make the\noriginal CNN-BiGRU model learn the CAS patterns more effectively and not cause\ntoo much computing burden, three strategies involving minimal modifications of\nthe network architecture of the CNN layers were investigated: (1) making the\nCNN layers a bit deeper by using the residual blocks, (2) making the CNN layers\na bit wider by increasing the number of CNN kernels, and (3) separating the\nfeature input into multiple paths (the model was denoted by Multi-path\nCNN-BiGRU). The performance of CAS segment and event detection were evaluated.\nResults showed that improvement in CAS detection was observed among all the\nproposed architecture-modified models. The F1 score for CAS event detection of\nthe proposed models increased from 0.445 to 0.491-0.530, which was deemed\nsignificant. However, the Multi-path CNN-BiGRU model outperformed the other\nmodels in terms of the number of winning titles (five) in total nine evaluation\nmetrics. In addition, the Multi-path CNN-BiGRU model did not cause extra\ncomputing burden (0.97-fold inference time) compared to the original CNN-BiGRU\nmodel. Conclusively, the Multi-path CNN layers can efficiently improve the\neffectiveness of feature extraction and subsequently result in better CAS\ndetection.",

Improved randomized learning streamlines the fitting abilities\nof individual learners by generating network parameters in accordance with the\ndata and target function features. A pattern-based representation of time\nseries makes the proposed approach suitable for forecasting time series with\nmultiple seasonality. We propose six strategies for controlling the diversity\nof ensemble members. Case studies conducted on four real-world forecasting\nproblems verified the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed\nensemble forecasting approach. It outperformed statistical models as well as\nstate-of-the-art machine learning models in terms of forecasting accuracy. The\nproposed approach has several advantages: fast and easy training, simple\narchitecture, ease of implementation, high accuracy and the ability to deal\nwith nonstationarity and multiple seasonality in time series.",

          "description": "Some real problems require the evaluation of expensive and noisy objective\nfunctions. Moreover, the analytical expression of these objective functions may\nbe unknown. These functions are known as black-boxes, for example, estimating\nthe generalization error of a machine learning algorithm and computing its\nprediction time in terms of its hyper-parameters. Multi-objective Bayesian\noptimization (MOBO) is a set of methods that has been successfully applied for\nthe simultaneous optimization of black-boxes. Concretely, BO methods rely on a\nprobabilistic model of the objective functions, typically a Gaussian process.\nThis model generates a predictive distribution of the objectives. However, MOBO\nmethods have problems when the number of objectives in a multi-objective\noptimization problem are 3 or more, which is the many objective setting. In\nparticular, the BO process is more costly as more objectives are considered,\ncomputing the quality of the solution via the hyper-volume is also more costly\nand, most importantly, we have to evaluate every objective function, wasting\nexpensive computational, economic or other resources. However, as more\nobjectives are involved in the optimization problem, it is highly probable that\nsome of them are redundant and not add information about the problem solution.\nA measure that represents how similar are GP predictive distributions is\nproposed. We also propose a many objective Bayesian optimization algorithm that\nuses this metric to determine whether two objectives are redundant. The\nalgorithm stops evaluating one of them if the similarity is found, saving\nresources and not hurting the performance of the multi-objective BO algorithm.\nWe show empirical evidence in a set of toy, synthetic, benchmark and real\nexperiments that GPs predictive distributions of the effectiveness of the\nmetric and the algorithm.",

          "description": "A key challenge for modern Bayesian statistics is how to perform scalable\ninference of posterior distributions. To address this challenge, variational\nBayes (VB) methods have emerged as a popular alternative to the classical\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. VB methods tend to be faster while\nachieving comparable predictive performance. However, there are few theoretical\nresults around VB. In this paper, we establish frequentist consistency and\nasymptotic normality of VB methods. Specifically, we connect VB methods to\npoint estimates based on variational approximations, called frequentist\nvariational approximations, and we use the connection to prove a variational\nBernstein-von Mises theorem. The theorem leverages the theoretical\ncharacterizations of frequentist variational approximations to understand\nasymptotic properties of VB. In summary, we prove that (1) the VB posterior\nconverges to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimizer of a normal distribution,\ncentered at the truth and (2) the corresponding variational expectation of the\nparameter is consistent and asymptotically normal. As applications of the\ntheorem, we derive asymptotic properties of VB posteriors in Bayesian mixture\nmodels, Bayesian generalized linear mixed models, and Bayesian stochastic block\nmodels. We conduct a simulation study to illustrate these theoretical results.",

In this work, we prove a simple lower bound on the target\ndomain error that complements the existing upper bound. Our bound shows the\ninsufficiency of minimizing source domain error and marginal distribution\nmismatch for a guaranteed reduction in the target domain error, due to the\npossible increase of induced labeling function mismatch. This insufficiency is\nfurther illustrated through simple distributions for which the same UDA\napproach succeeds, fails, and may succeed or fail with an equal chance.\nMotivated from this, we propose novel data poisoning attacks to fool UDA\nmethods into learning representations that produce large target domain errors.\nWe evaluate the effect of these attacks on popular UDA methods using benchmark\ndatasets where they have been previously shown to be successful. Our results\nshow that poisoning can significantly decrease the target domain accuracy,\ndropping it to almost 0\\% in some cases, with the addition of only 10\\%\npoisoned data in the source domain. The failure of UDA methods demonstrates the\nlimitations of UDA at guaranteeing cross-domain generalization consistent with\nthe lower bound.

We show that a dynamics model, constructed over the learned\nrepresentation space, enables visuomotor control for challenging manipulation\ntasks involving both rigid bodies and fluids, where the target is specified in\na viewpoint different from what the robot operates on. When coupled with an\nauto-decoding framework, it can even support goal specification from camera\nviewpoints that are outside the training distribution. We further demonstrate\nthe richness of the learned 3D dynamics model by performing future prediction\nand novel view synthesis. Finally, we provide detailed ablation studies\nregarding different system designs and qualitative analysis of the learned\nrepresentations.",

          "description": "Complex sensors like video cameras include tens of configurable parameters,\nwhich can be set by end-users to customize the sensors to specific application\nscenarios. Although parameter settings significantly affect the quality of the\nsensor output and the accuracy of insights derived from sensor data, most\nend-users use a fixed parameter setting because they lack the skill or\nunderstanding to appropriately configure these parameters. We propose CamTuner,\nwhich is a system to automatically, and dynamically adapt the complex sensor to\nchanging environments. CamTuner includes two key components. First, a bespoke\nanalytics quality estimator, which is a deep-learning model to automatically\nand continuously estimate the quality of insights from an analytics unit as the\nenvironment around a sensor change. Second, a reinforcement learning (RL)\nmodule, which reacts to the changes in quality, and automatically adjusts the\ncamera parameters to enhance the accuracy of insights. We improve the training\ntime of the RL module by an order of magnitude by designing virtual models to\nmimic essential behavior of the camera: we design virtual knobs that can be set\nto different values to mimic the effects of assigning different values to the\ncamera's configurable parameters, and we design a virtual camera model that\nmimics the output from a video camera at different times of the day. These\nvirtual models significantly accelerate training because (a) frame rates from a\nreal camera are limited to 25-30 fps while the virtual models enable processing\nat 300 fps, (b) we do not have to wait until the real camera sees different\nenvironments, which could take weeks or months, and (c) virtual knobs can be\nupdated instantly, while it can take 200-500 ms to change the camera parameter\nsettings. Our dynamic tuning approach results in up to 12% improvement in the\naccuracy of insights from several video analytics tasks.",

          "description": "We propose to address quadrupedal locomotion tasks using Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) with a Transformer-based model that learns to combine\nproprioceptive information and high-dimensional depth sensor inputs. While\nlearning-based locomotion has made great advances using RL, most methods still\nrely on domain randomization for training blind agents that generalize to\nchallenging terrains. Our key insight is that proprioceptive states only offer\ncontact measurements for immediate reaction, whereas an agent equipped with\nvisual sensory observations can learn to proactively maneuver environments with\nobstacles and uneven terrain by anticipating changes in the environment many\nsteps ahead. In this paper, we introduce LocoTransformer, an end-to-end RL\nmethod for quadrupedal locomotion that leverages a Transformer-based model for\nfusing proprioceptive states and visual observations. We evaluate our method in\nchallenging simulated environments with different obstacles and uneven terrain.\nWe show that our method obtains significant improvements over policies with\nonly proprioceptive state inputs, and that Transformer-based models further\nimprove generalization across environments.

Firstly, while\nthe discipline is still young, the analysis indicates the growing acceptance of\nXAI in PHM domain. Secondly, XAI functions as a double edge sword, where it is\nassimilated as a tool to execute PHM tasks as well as a mean of explanation, in\nparticular in diagnostic and anomaly detection. There is thus a need for XAI in\nPHM. Thirdly, the review shows that PHM XAI papers produce either good or\nexcellent results in general, suggesting that PHM performance is unaffected by\nXAI. Fourthly, human role, explainability metrics and uncertainty management\nare areas requiring further attention by the PHM community.

          "description": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is quickly becoming the customary means for\nidentification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to its ability to obtain\nhigh resolution information about the genes and mechanisms that are causing\nresistance and driving pathogen mobility. By contrast, traditional phenotypic\n(antibiogram) testing cannot easily elucidate such information. Yet development\nof AMR prediction tools from genotype-phenotype data can be biased, since\nsampling is non-randomized. Sample provenience, period of collection, and\nspecies representation can confound the association of genetic traits with AMR.\nThus, prediction models can perform poorly on new data with sampling\ndistribution shifts. In this work -- under an explicit set of causal\nassumptions -- we evaluate the effectiveness of propensity-based rebalancing\nand confounding adjustment on AMR prediction using genotype-phenotype AMR data\nfrom the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC). We select bacterial\ngenotypes (encoded as k-mer signatures, i.e. DNA fragments of length k),\ncountry, year, species, and AMR phenotypes for the tetracycline drug class,\npreparing test data with recent genomes coming from a single country. We test\nboosted logistic regression (BLR) and random forests (RF) with/without\nbias-handling. On 10,936 instances, we find evidence of species, location and\nyear imbalance with respect to the AMR phenotype. The crude versus\nbias-adjusted change in effect of genetic signatures on AMR varies but only\nmoderately (selecting the top 20,000 out of 40+ million k-mers). The area under\nthe receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of the RF (0.95) is comparable to\nthat of BLR (0.94) on both out-of-bag samples from bootstrap and the external\ntest (n=1,085), where AUROCs do not decrease. We observe a 1%-5% gain in AUROC\nwith bias-handling compared to the sole use of genetic signatures. ...",

          "description": "To safely navigate unknown environments, robots must accurately perceive\ndynamic obstacles. Instead of directly measuring the scene depth with a LiDAR\nsensor, we explore the use of a much cheaper and higher resolution sensor:\nprogrammable light curtains. Light curtains are controllable depth sensors that\nsense only along a surface that a user selects. We use light curtains to\nestimate the safety envelope of a scene: a hypothetical surface that separates\nthe robot from all obstacles. We show that generating light curtains that sense\nrandom locations (from a particular distribution) can quickly discover the\nsafety envelope for scenes with unknown objects. Importantly, we produce\ntheoretical safety guarantees on the probability of detecting an obstacle using\nrandom curtains. We combine random curtains with a machine learning based model\nthat forecasts and tracks the motion of the safety envelope efficiently. Our\nmethod accurately estimates safety envelopes while providing probabilistic\nsafety guarantees that can be used to certify the efficacy of a robot\nperception system to detect and avoid dynamic obstacles. We evaluate our\napproach in a simulated urban driving environment and a real-world environment\nwith moving pedestrians using a light curtain device and show that we can\nestimate safety envelopes efficiently and effectively.

          "description": "Energy production using renewable sources exhibits inherent uncertainties due\nto their intermittent nature. Nevertheless, the unified European energy market\npromotes the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) by the\nregional energy system operators. Consequently, RES forecasting can assist in\nthe integration of these volatile energy sources, since it leads to higher\nreliability and reduced ancillary operational costs for power systems. This\npaper presents a new dataset for solar and wind energy generation forecast in\nGreece and introduces a feature engineering pipeline that enriches the\ndimensional space of the dataset. In addition, we propose a novel method that\nutilizes the innovative Prophet model, an end-to-end forecasting tool that\nconsiders several kinds of nonlinear trends in decomposing the energy time\nseries before a tree-based ensemble provides short-term predictions. The\nperformance of the system is measured through representative evaluation\nmetrics, and by estimating the model's generalization under an industryprovided\nscheme of absolute error thresholds. The proposed hybrid model competes with\nbaseline persistence models, tree-based regression ensembles, and the Prophet\nmodel, managing to outperform them, presenting both lower error rates and more\nfavorable error distribution.",

          "description": "The needs for precisely estimating a student's academic performance have been\nemphasized with an increasing amount of attention paid to Intelligent Tutoring\nSystem (ITS). However, since labels for academic performance, such as test\nscores, are collected from outside of ITS, obtaining the labels is costly,\nleading to label-scarcity problem which brings challenge in taking machine\nlearning approaches for academic performance prediction. To this end, inspired\nby the recent advancement of pre-training method in natural language processing\ncommunity, we propose DPA, a transfer learning framework with Discriminative\nPre-training tasks for Academic performance prediction. DPA pre-trains two\nmodels, a generator and a discriminator, and fine-tunes the discriminator on\nacademic performance prediction. In DPA's pre-training phase, a sequence of\ninteractions where some tokens are masked is provided to the generator which is\ntrained to reconstruct the original sequence. Then, the discriminator takes an\ninteraction sequence where the masked tokens are replaced by the generator's\noutputs, and is trained to predict the originalities of all tokens in the\nsequence. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art generative pre-training\nmethod, DPA is more sample efficient, leading to fast convergence to lower\nacademic performance prediction error. We conduct extensive experimental\nstudies on a real-world dataset obtained from a multi-platform ITS application\nand show that DPA outperforms the previous state-of-the-art generative\npre-training method with a reduction of 4.05% in mean absolute error and more\nrobust to increased label-scarcity.",

One quality\ncriterion for discovered process models is generalization. Generalization seeks\nto quantify how well the discovered model describes future executions of the\nsystem, and is perhaps the least understood quality criterion in process\nmining. The lack of understanding is primarily a consequence of generalization\nseeking to measure properties over the entire future behavior of the system,\nwhen the only available sample of behavior is that provided by the event log\nitself. In this paper, we draw inspiration from computational statistics, and\nemploy a bootstrap approach to estimate properties of a population based on a\nsample. Specifically, we define an estimator of the model's generalization\nbased on the event log it was discovered from, and then use bootstrapping to\nmeasure the generalization of the model with respect to the system, and its\nstatistical significance.

We describe the behavior of the quadratic risk for estimating\nthe power sum functional $F_{\\gamma} = \\sum_{k=1}^K p_k^{\\gamma}$, $\\gamma >0$\nas a function of $K, \\, n$ and $\\alpha$. In the non-interactive case, we study\ntwo plug-in type estimators of $F_{\\gamma}$, for all $\\gamma >0$, that are\nsimilar to the MLE analyzed by Jiao et al.

          "description": "There is a proliferation in the number of satellites launched each year,\nresulting in downlinking of terabytes of data each day. The data received by\nground stations is often unprocessed, making this an expensive process\nconsidering the large data sizes and that not all of the data is useful. This,\ncoupled with the increasing demand for real-time data processing, has led to a\ngrowing need for on-orbit processing solutions. In this work, we investigate\nthe performance of CNN-based object detectors on constrained devices by\napplying different image compression techniques to satellite data. We examine\nthe capabilities of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier;\nlow-power, high-performance computers, with integrated GPUs, small enough to\nfit on-board a nanosatellite. We take a closer look at object detection\nnetworks, including the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Region-based\nFully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) models that are pre-trained on DOTA - a\nLarge Scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images. The performance is\nmeasured in terms of execution time, memory consumption, and accuracy, and are\ncompared against a baseline containing a server with two powerful GPUs. The\nresults show that by applying image compression techniques, we are able to\nimprove the execution time and memory consumption, achieving a fully runnable\ndataset. A lossless compression technique achieves roughly a 10% reduction in\nexecution time and about a 3% reduction in memory consumption, with no impact\non the accuracy. While a lossy compression technique improves the execution\ntime by up to 144% and the memory consumption is reduced by as much as 97%.\nHowever, it has a significant impact on accuracy, varying depending on the\ncompression ratio. Thus the application and ratio of these compression\ntechniques may differ depending on the required level of accuracy for a\nparticular task.",

          "description": "Point clouds and RGB images are naturally complementary modalities for 3D\nvisual understanding - the former provides sparse but accurate locations of\npoints on objects, while the latter contains dense color and texture\ninformation. Despite this potential for close sensor fusion, many methods train\ntwo models in isolation and use simple feature concatenation to represent 3D\nsensor data. This separated training scheme results in potentially sub-optimal\nperformance and prevents 3D tasks from being used to benefit 2D tasks that are\noften useful on their own. To provide a more integrated approach, we propose a\nnovel Multi-Modality Task Cascade network (MTC-RCNN) that leverages 3D box\nproposals to improve 2D segmentation predictions, which are then used to\nfurther refine the 3D boxes. We show that including a 2D network between two\nstages of 3D modules significantly improves both 2D and 3D task performance.\nMoreover, to prevent the 3D module from over-relying on the overfitted 2D\npredictions, we propose a dual-head 2D segmentation training and inference\nscheme, allowing the 2nd 3D module to learn to interpret imperfect 2D\nsegmentation predictions.

          "description": "Many current neural networks for medical imaging generalise poorly to data\nunseen during training. Such behaviour can be caused by networks overfitting\neasy-to-learn, or statistically dominant, features while disregarding other\npotentially informative features. For example, indistinguishable differences in\nthe sharpness of the images from two different scanners can degrade the\nperformance of the network significantly. All neural networks intended for\nclinical practice need to be robust to variation in data caused by differences\nin imaging equipment, sample preparation and patient populations.\n\nTo address these challenges, we evaluate the utility of spectral decoupling\nas an implicit bias mitigation method. Spectral decoupling encourages the\nneural network to learn more features by simply regularising the networks'\nunnormalised prediction scores with an L2 penalty, thus having no added\ncomputational costs.\n\nWe show that spectral decoupling allows training neural networks on datasets\nwith strong spurious correlations. Networks trained without spectral decoupling\ndo not learn the original task and appear to make false predictions based on\nthe spurious correlations. Spectral decoupling also increases networks'\nrobustness for data distribution shifts. To validate our findings, we train\nnetworks with and without spectral decoupling to detect prostate cancer tissue\nslides and COVID-19 in chest radiographs. Networks trained with spectral\ndecoupling achieve substantially higher performance on all evaluation datasets.\n\nOur results show that spectral decoupling helps with generalisation issues\nassociated with neural networks. We recommend using spectral decoupling as an\nimplicit bias mitigation method in any neural network intended for clinical\nuse.",

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine\nLearning (ML)-based prediction models, especially Deep Neural Network (DNN)\narchitectures, have the potential to act as a key enabling factor to reduce the\nadverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and future possible ones on financial\nmarkets. In this regard, first, a unique COVID-19 related PRIce MOvement\nprediction (COVID19 PRIMO) dataset is introduced in this paper, which\nincorporates effects of social media trends related to COVID-19 on stock market\nprice movements. Afterwards, a novel hybrid and parallel DNN-based framework is\nproposed that integrates different and diversified learning architectures.\nReferred to as the COVID-19 adopted Hybrid and Parallel deep fusion framework\nfor Stock price Movement Prediction (COVID19-HPSMP), innovative fusion\nstrategies are used to combine scattered social media news related to COVID-19\nwith historical mark data. The proposed COVID19-HPSMP consists of two parallel\npaths (hence hybrid), one based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with\nLocal/Global Attention modules, and one integrated CNN and Bi-directional Long\nShort term Memory (BLSTM) path. The two parallel paths are followed by a\nmultilayer fusion layer acting as a fusion centre that combines localized\nfeatures. Performance evaluations are performed based on the introduced COVID19\nPRIMO dataset illustrating superior performance of the proposed framework.",

          "description": "We prove new explicit upper bounds on the leverage scores of Fourier sparse\nfunctions under both the Gaussian and Laplace measures.

Bounding Fourier sparse leverage scores under various measures is\nof pure mathematical interest in approximation theory, and our work extends\nexisting results for the uniform measure [Erd17,CP19a]. Practically, our bounds\nare motivated by two important applications in machine learning:\n\n1. Kernel Approximation. They yield a new random Fourier features algorithm\nfor approximating Gaussian and Cauchy (rational quadratic) kernel matrices. For\nlow-dimensional data, our method uses a near optimal number of features, and\nits runtime is polynomial in the $statistical\\ dimension$ of the approximated\nkernel matrix. It is the first \"oblivious sketching method\" with this property\nfor any kernel besides the polynomial kernel, resolving an open question of\n[AKM+17,AKK+20b].\n\n2. Active Learning. They can be used as non-uniform sampling distributions\nfor robust active learning when data follows a Gaussian or Laplace\ndistribution.

Therefore, it is standard policy for a loan\nofficer to provide a textual loan assessment to mitigate limited data\navailability. In turn, this statement is analysed by a credit expert alongside\nany available standard credit data. In our paper, we exploit recent advances\nfrom the field of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP),\nincluding the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\nmodel, to extract information from 60 000 textual assessments provided by a\nlender. We consider the performance in terms of the AUC (Area Under the\nreceiver operating characteristic Curve) and Brier Score metrics and find that\nthe text alone is surprisingly effective for predicting default. However, when\ncombined with traditional data, it yields no additional predictive capability,\nwith performance dependent on the text's length. Our proposed deep learning\nmodel does, however, appear to be robust to the quality of the text and\ntherefore suitable for partly automating the mSME lending process.

          "description": "The incorporation of appropriate inductive bias plays a critical role in\nlearning dynamics from data. A growing body of work has been exploring ways to\nenforce energy conservation in the learned dynamics by encoding Lagrangian or\nHamiltonian dynamics into the neural network architecture. These existing\napproaches are based on differential equations, which do not allow\ndiscontinuity in the states and thereby limit the class of systems one can\nlearn. However, in reality, most physical systems, such as legged robots and\nrobotic manipulators, involve contacts and collisions, which introduce\ndiscontinuities in the states. In this paper, we introduce a differentiable\ncontact model, which can capture contact mechanics: frictionless/frictional, as\nwell as elastic/inelastic. This model can also accommodate inequality\nconstraints, such as limits on the joint angles. The proposed contact model\nextends the scope of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian neural networks by allowing\nsimultaneous learning of contact and system properties. We demonstrate this\nframework on a series of challenging 2D and 3D physical systems with different\ncoefficients of restitution and friction. The learned dynamics can be used as a\ndifferentiable physics simulator for downstream gradient-based optimization\ntasks, such as planning and control.",

More refined notions of fairness, like Odds Equality,\ncannot be guaranteed by a representation that does not take into account the\ntask specific labeling rule with respect to which such fairness will be\nevaluated (even if the marginal data distribution is known a priory).\nFurthermore, except for trivial cases, no representation can guarantee Odds\nEquality fairness for any two different tasks, while allowing accurate label\npredictions for both.\n\nWhile some of our conclusions are intuitive, we formulate (and prove) crisp\nstatements of such impossibilities, often contrasting impressions conveyed by\nmany recent works on fair representations.",

          "description": "Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been increasingly applied to problems\nfrom several different areas. Despite their growing popularity, their\npredictive performance is usually affected by the values assigned to their\nhyperparameters (HPs). As consequence, researchers and practitioners face the\nchallenge of how to set these values. Many users have limited knowledge about\nML algorithms and the effect of their HP values and, therefore, do not take\nadvantage of suitable settings. They usually define the HP values by trial and\nerror, which is very subjective, not guaranteed to find good values and\ndependent on the user experience. Tuning techniques search for HP values able\nto maximize the predictive performance of induced models for a given dataset,\nbut have the drawback of a high computational cost. Thus, practitioners use\ndefault values suggested by the algorithm developer or by tools implementing\nthe algorithm. Although default values usually result in models with acceptable\npredictive performance, different implementations of the same algorithm can\nsuggest distinct default values. To maintain a balance between tuning and using\ndefault values, we propose a strategy to generate new optimized default values.\nOur approach is grounded on a small set of optimized values able to obtain\npredictive performance values better than default settings provided by popular\ntools. After performing a large experiment and a careful analysis of the\nresults, we concluded that our approach delivers better default values.\nBesides, it leads to competitive solutions when compared to tuned values,\nmaking it easier to use and having a lower cost. We also extracted simple rules\nto guide practitioners in deciding whether to use our new methodology or a HP\ntuning approach.",

          "description": "The high computation, memory, and power budgets of inferring convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) are major bottlenecks of model deployment to edge\ncomputing platforms, e.g., mobile devices and IoT. Moreover, training CNNs is\ntime and energy-intensive even on high-grade servers. Convolution layers and\nfully connected layers, because of their intense use of multiplications, are\nthe dominant contributor to this computation budget.\n\nWe propose to alleviate this problem by introducing two new operations:\nconvolutional shifts and fully-connected shifts which replace multiplications\nwith bitwise shift and sign flipping during both training and inference. During\ninference, both approaches require only 5 bits (or less) to represent the\nweights. This family of neural network architectures (that use convolutional\nshifts and fully connected shifts) is referred to as DeepShift models. We\npropose two methods to train DeepShift models: DeepShift-Q which trains regular\nweights constrained to powers of 2, and DeepShift-PS that trains the values of\nthe shifts and sign flips directly.\n\nVery close accuracy, and in some cases higher accuracy, to baselines are\nachieved. Converting pre-trained 32-bit floating-point baseline models of\nResNet18, ResNet50, VGG16, and GoogleNet to DeepShift and training them for 15\nto 30 epochs, resulted in Top-1/Top-5 accuracies higher than that of the\noriginal model.\n\nLast but not least, we implemented the convolutional shifts and fully\nconnected shift GPU kernels and showed a reduction in latency time of 25% when\ninferring ResNet18 compared to unoptimized multiplication-based GPU kernels.\nThe code can be found at https://github.com/mostafaelhoushi/DeepShift.",

          "description": "Across machine learning, the use of curricula has shown strong empirical\npotential to improve learning from data by avoiding local optima of training\nobjectives. For reinforcement learning (RL), curricula are especially\ninteresting, as the underlying optimization has a strong tendency to get stuck\nin local optima due to the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Recently, a\nnumber of approaches for an automatic generation of curricula for RL have been\nshown to increase performance while requiring less expert knowledge compared to\nmanually designed curricula. However, these approaches are seldomly\ninvestigated from a theoretical perspective, preventing a deeper understanding\nof their mechanics. In this paper, we present an approach for automated\ncurriculum generation in RL with a clear theoretical underpinning. More\nprecisely, we formalize the well-known self-paced learning paradigm as inducing\na distribution over training tasks, which trades off between task complexity\nand the objective to match a desired task distribution. Experiments show that\ntraining on this induced distribution helps to avoid poor local optima across\nRL algorithms in different tasks with uninformative rewards and challenging\nexploration requirements.",

In this work, we present the first quantitative evaluation of the\nprivacy gain of synthetic data publishing and compare it to that of previous\nanonymisation techniques.\n\nOur evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art generative models\ndemonstrates that synthetic data either does not prevent inference attacks or\ndoes not retain data utility. In other words, we empirically show that\nsynthetic data suffers from the same limitations as traditional anonymisation\ntechniques.\n\nFurthermore, we find that, in contrast to traditional anonymisation, the\nprivacy-utility tradeoff of synthetic data publishing is hard to predict.\nBecause it is impossible to predict what signals a synthetic dataset will\npreserve and what information will be lost, synthetic data leads to a highly\nvariable privacy gain and unpredictable utility loss.

This not only aids\nin providing a potentially infinite data source, but also alleviates safety\nconcerns with real robots. Nonetheless, the gap between the simulated and real\nworlds degrades the performance of the policies once the models are transferred\ninto real robots. Multiple research efforts are therefore now being directed\ntowards closing this sim-to-real gap and accomplish more efficient policy\ntransfer. Recent years have seen the emergence of multiple methods applicable\nto different domains, but there is a lack, to the best of our knowledge, of a\ncomprehensive review summarizing and putting into context the different\nmethods. In this survey paper, we cover the fundamental background behind\nsim-to-real transfer in deep reinforcement learning and overview the main\nmethods being utilized at the moment: domain randomization, domain adaptation,\nimitation learning, meta-learning and knowledge distillation.

          "description": "A major goal of materials design is to find material structures with desired\nproperties and in a second step to find a processing path to reach one of these\nstructures. In this paper, we propose and investigate a deep reinforcement\nlearning approach for the optimization of processing paths. The goal is to find\noptimal processing paths in the material structure space that lead to\ntarget-structures, which have been identified beforehand to result in desired\nmaterial properties. There exists a target set containing one or multiple\ndifferent structures. Our proposed methods can find an optimal path from a\nstart structure to a single target structure, or optimize the processing paths\nto one of the equivalent target-structures in the set. In the latter case, the\nalgorithm learns during processing to simultaneously identify the best\nreachable target structure and the optimal path to it. The proposed methods\nbelong to the family of model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms. They\nare guided by structure representations as features of the process state and by\na reward signal, which is formulated based on a distance function in the\nstructure space. Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms learn through\ntrial and error while interacting with the process. Thereby, they are not\nrestricted to information from a priori sampled processing data and are able to\nadapt to the specific process. The optimization itself is model-free and does\nnot require any prior knowledge about the process itself. We instantiate and\nevaluate the proposed methods by optimizing paths of a generic metal forming\nprocess. We show the ability of both methods to find processing paths leading\nclose to target structures and the ability of the extended method to identify\ntarget-structures that can be reached effectively and efficiently and to focus\non these targets for sample efficient processing path optimization.",

          "description": "Inspired by BatchNorm, there has been an explosion of normalization layers\nfor deep neural networks (DNNs). However, these alternative normalization\nlayers have seen minimal use, partially due to a lack of guiding principles\nthat can help identify when these layers can serve as a replacement for\nBatchNorm. To address this problem, we take a theoretical approach,\ngeneralizing the known beneficial mechanisms of BatchNorm to several recently\nproposed normalization techniques. Our generalized theory leads to the\nfollowing set of principles: (i) similar to BatchNorm, activations-based\nnormalization layers can prevent exponential growth of activations in ResNets,\nbut parametric layers require explicit remedies; (ii) use of GroupNorm can\nensure informative forward propagation, with different samples being assigned\ndissimilar activations, but increasing group size results in increasingly\nindistinguishable activations for different samples, explaining slow\nconvergence speed in models with LayerNorm; (iii) small group sizes result in\nlarge gradient norm in earlier layers, hence explaining training instability\nissues in Instance Normalization and illustrating a speed-stability tradeoff in\nGroupNorm. Overall, our analysis reveals a unified set of mechanisms that\nunderpin the success of normalization methods in deep learning, providing us\nwith a compass to systematically explore the vast design space of DNN\nnormalization layers.",

          "description": "Adversarial robustness of deep neural networks has been actively\ninvestigated. However, most existing defense approaches are limited to a\nspecific type of adversarial perturbations. Specifically, they often fail to\noffer resistance to multiple attack types simultaneously, i.e., they lack\nmulti-perturbation robustness. Furthermore, compared to image recognition\nproblems, the adversarial robustness of video recognition models is relatively\nunexplored. While several studies have proposed how to generate adversarial\nvideos, only a handful of approaches about the defense strategies have been\npublished in the literature. In this paper, we propose one of the first defense\nstrategies against multiple types of adversarial videos for video recognition.\nThe proposed method, referred to as MultiBN, performs adversarial training on\nmultiple adversarial video types using multiple independent batch normalization\n(BN) layers with a learning-based BN selection module. With a multiple BN\nstructure, each BN brach is responsible for learning the distribution of a\nsingle perturbation type and thus provides more precise distribution\nestimations. This mechanism benefits dealing with multiple perturbation types.\nThe BN selection module detects the attack type of an input video and sends it\nto the corresponding BN branch, making MultiBN fully automatic and allow\nend-to-end training.

          "description": "Probabilistic finite mixture models are widely used for unsupervised\nclustering. These models can often be improved by adapting them to the topology\nof the data. For instance, in order to classify spatially adjacent data points\nsimilarly, it is common to introduce a Laplacian constraint on the posterior\nprobability that each data point belongs to a class. Alternatively, the mixing\nprobabilities can be treated as free parameters, while assuming Gauss-Markov or\nmore complex priors to regularize those mixing probabilities. However, these\napproaches are constrained by the shape of the prior and often lead to\ncomplicated or intractable inference. Here, we propose a new parametrization of\nthe Dirichlet distribution to flexibly regularize the mixing probabilities of\nover-parametrized mixture distributions. Using the Expectation-Maximization\nalgorithm, we show that our approach allows us to define any linear update rule\nfor the mixing probabilities, including spatial smoothing regularization as a\nspecial case. We then show that this flexible design can be extended to share\nclass information between multiple mixture models. We apply our algorithm to\nartificial and natural image segmentation tasks, and we provide quantitative\nand qualitative comparison of the performance of Gaussian and Student-t\nmixtures on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. We also demonstrate how to\npropagate class information across the layers of deep convolutional neural\nnetworks in a probabilistically optimal way, suggesting a new interpretation\nfor feedback signals in biological visual systems. Our flexible approach can be\neasily generalized to adapt probabilistic mixture models to arbitrary data\ntopologies.",

          "description": "This paper presents a new insight into improving the performance of\nStochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) by using Isolation kernel instead of\nGaussian kernel. Isolation kernel outperforms Gaussian kernel in two aspects.\nFirst, the use of Isolation kernel in t-SNE overcomes the drawback of\nmisrepresenting some structures in the data, which often occurs when Gaussian\nkernel is applied in t-SNE. This is because Gaussian kernel determines each\nlocal bandwidth based on one local point only, while Isolation kernel is\nderived directly from the data based on space partitioning. Second, the use of\nIsolation kernel yields a more efficient similarity computation because\ndata-dependent Isolation kernel has only one parameter that needs to be tuned.\nIn contrast, the use of data-independent Gaussian kernel increases the\ncomputational cost by determining n bandwidths for a dataset of n points. As\nthe root cause of these deficiencies in t-SNE is Gaussian kernel, we show that\nsimply replacing Gaussian kernel with Isolation kernel in t-SNE significantly\nimproves the quality of the final visualisation output (without creating\nmisrepresented structures) and removes one key obstacle that prevents t-SNE\nfrom processing large datasets. Moreover, Isolation kernel enables t-SNE to\ndeal with large-scale datasets in less runtime without trading off accuracy,\nunlike existing methods in speeding up t-SNE.",

In this paper, we incorporate the\ngrouping effect into MF and propose a novel method called Robust Matrix\nFactorization with Grouping effect (GRMF). The grouping effect is a\ngeneralization of the sparsity effect, which conducts denoising by clustering\nsimilar values around multiple centers instead of just around 0. Compared with\nexisting algorithms, the proposed GRMF can automatically learn the grouping\nstructure and sparsity in MF without prior knowledge, by introducing a\nnaturally adjustable non-convex regularization to achieve simultaneous sparsity\nand grouping effect. Specifically, GRMF uses an efficient alternating\nminimization framework to perform MF, in which the original non-convex problem\nis first converted into a convex problem through Difference-of-Convex (DC)\nprogramming, and then solved by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM). In addition, GRMF can be easily extended to the Non-negative Matrix\nFactorization (NMF) settings. Extensive experiments have been conducted using\nreal-world data sets with outliers and contaminated noise, where the\nexperimental results show that GRMF has promoted performance and robustness,\ncompared to five benchmark algorithms.",

          "description": "There is a prevailing trend to study urban morphology quantitatively thanks\nto the growing accessibility to various forms of spatial big data, increasing\ncomputing power, and use cases benefiting from such information. The methods\ndeveloped up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing\ndensity, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent\nmorphological features from the human's visual and intuitive perspective. We\ntake the first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based\ntechnique to automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual\nbasis. The method is implemented by generating an image of the street network\n(Colored Road Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and\nclassifying it using a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model\nachieves an overall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the\nworld are selected as the study areas with their road networks acquired from\nOpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through\nclustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent\npart of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: we apply\nour method in a case study of urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based\nregression model (LightGBM) is for the first time designated to establish the\nrelationship between morphological indices and vitality indicators. The effect\nof road network classification is found to be small but positively associated\nwith urban vitality.

          "description": "Recent studies have shown that providing personalized explanations alongside\nrecommendations increases trust and perceived quality. Furthermore, it gives\nusers an opportunity to refine the recommendations by critiquing parts of the\nexplanations. On one hand, current recommender systems model the\nrecommendation, explanation, and critiquing objectives jointly, but this\ncreates an inherent trade-off between their respective performance. On the\nother hand, although recent latent linear critiquing approaches are built upon\nan existing recommender system, they suffer from computational inefficiency at\ninference due to the objective optimized at each conversation's turn. We\naddress these deficiencies with M&Ms-VAE, a novel variational autoencoder for\nrecommendation and explanation that is based on multimodal modeling\nassumptions. We train the model under a weak supervision scheme to simulate\nboth fully and partially observed variables. Then, we leverage the\ngeneralization ability of a trained M&Ms-VAE model to embed the user preference\nand the critique separately. Our work's most important innovation is our\ncritiquing module, which is built upon and trained in a self-supervised manner\nwith a simple ranking objective. Experiments on four real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that among state-of-the-art models, our system is the first to\ndominate or match the performance in terms of recommendation, explanation, and\nmulti-step critiquing. Moreover, M&Ms-VAE processes the critiques up to 25.6x\nfaster than the best baselines. Finally, we show that our model infers coherent\njoint and cross generation, even under weak supervision, thanks to our\nmultimodal-based modeling and training scheme.",

          "description": "Effective molecular representation learning is of great importance to\nfacilitate molecular property prediction, which is a fundamental task for the\ndrug and material industry. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs)\nhave shown great promise in applying GNNs for molecular representation\nlearning. Moreover, a few recent studies have also demonstrated successful\napplications of self-supervised learning methods to pre-train the GNNs to\novercome the problem of insufficient labeled molecules. However, existing GNNs\nand pre-training strategies usually treat molecules as topological graph data\nwithout fully utilizing the molecular geometry information. Whereas, the\nthree-dimensional (3D) spatial structure of a molecule, a.k.a molecular\ngeometry, is one of the most critical factors for determining molecular\nphysical, chemical, and biological properties. To this end, we propose a novel\nGeometry Enhanced Molecular representation learning method (GEM) for Chemical\nRepresentation Learning (ChemRL). At first, we design a geometry-based GNN\narchitecture that simultaneously models atoms, bonds, and bond angles in a\nmolecule. To be specific, we devised double graphs for a molecule: The first\none encodes the atom-bond relations; The second one encodes bond-angle\nrelations. Moreover, on top of the devised GNN architecture, we propose several\nnovel geometry-level self-supervised learning strategies to learn spatial\nknowledge by utilizing the local and global molecular 3D structures. We compare\nChemRL-GEM with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on different\nmolecular benchmarks and exhibit that ChemRL-GEM can significantly outperform\nall baselines in both regression and classification tasks. For example, the\nexperimental results show an overall improvement of 8.8% on average compared to\nSOTA baselines on the regression tasks, demonstrating the superiority of the\nproposed method.",

Moreover, persistence of excitation(PE) conditions are usually\nrequired to guarantee consistent parameter estimates in the existing\nliterature, which are hard to be verified or guaranteed for feedback control\nsystems. In this paper, we propose an online projected Quasi-Newton type\nalgorithm for parameter estimation of stochastic regression models with\nbinary-valued observations and varying thresholds. By using both the stochastic\nLyapunov function and martingale estimation methods, we establish the strong\nconsistency of the estimation algorithm and provide the convergence rate, under\na signal condition which is considerably weaker than the traditional PE\ncondition and coincides with the weakest possible excitation known for the\nclassical least square algorithm of stochastic regression models. Convergence\nof adaptive predictors and their applications in adaptive control are also\ndiscussed.",

          "description": "Plastic yielding in solids strongly depends on various conditions, such as\ntemperature and loading rate and indeed, sample-dependent knowledge of yield\npoints in structural materials promotes reliability in mechanical behavior.\nCommonly, yielding is measured through controlled mechanical testing at small\nor large scales, in ways that either distinguish elastic (stress) from total\ndeformation measurements, or by identifying plastic slip contributions. In this\npaper we argue that instead of separate elastic/plastic measurements, yielding\ncan be unraveled through statistical analysis of total strain fluctuations\nduring the evolution sequence of profiles measured in-situ, through digital\nimage correlation. We demonstrate two distinct ways of precisely quantifying\nyield locations in widely applicable crystal plasticity models, that apply in\npolycrystalline solids, either by using principal component analysis or\ndiscrete wavelet transforms. We test and compare these approaches in synthetic\ndata of polycrystal simulations and a variety of yielding responses, through\nchanges of the applied loading rates and the strain-rate sensitivity exponents.",

          "description": "Meta-reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to train policies that quickly\nadapt to new tasks with orders of magnitude less data than standard RL, but\nthis fast adaptation often comes at the cost of greatly increasing the amount\nof reward supervision during meta-training time. Offline meta-RL removes the\nneed to continuously provide reward supervision because rewards must only be\nprovided once when the offline dataset is generated. In addition to the\nchallenges of offline RL, a unique distribution shift is present in meta RL:\nagents learn exploration strategies that can gather the experience needed to\nlearn a new task, and also learn adaptation strategies that work well when\npresented with the trajectories in the dataset, but the adaptation strategies\nare not adapted to the data distribution that the learned exploration\nstrategies collect. Unlike the online setting, the adaptation and exploration\nstrategies cannot effectively adapt to each other, resulting in poor\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid offline meta-RL algorithm,\nwhich uses offline data with rewards to meta-train an adaptive policy, and then\ncollects additional unsupervised online data, without any ground truth reward\nlabels, to bridge this distribution shift problem. Our method uses the offline\ndata to learn the distribution of reward functions, which is then sampled to\nself-supervise reward labels for the additional online data. By removing the\nneed to provide reward labels for the online experience, our approach can be\nmore practical to use in settings where reward supervision would otherwise be\nprovided manually. We compare our method to prior work on offline meta-RL on\nsimulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks and find that using\nadditional data and self-generated rewards significantly improves an agent's\nability to generalize.",

          "description": "Machine learning solutions for pattern classification problems are nowadays\nwidely deployed in society and industry. However, the lack of transparency and\naccountability of most accurate models often hinders their meaningful and safe\nuse. Thus, there is a clear need for developing explainable artificial\nintelligence mechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize\nfeature contributions, but their interpretability is limited to specific\npredictions made by black-box models. An open challenge is to develop models\nthat have intrinsic interpretability and produce their own explanations, even\nfor classes of models that are traditionally considered black boxes like\n(recurrent) neural networks. In this paper, we propose an LTCN-based model for\ninterpretable pattern classification of structured data. Our method brings its\nown mechanism for providing explanations by quantifying the relevance of each\nfeature in the decision process. For supporting the interpretability without\naffecting the performance, the model incorporates more flexibility through a\nquasi-nonlinear reasoning rule that allows controlling nonlinearity. Besides,\nwe propose a recurrence-aware decision model that evades the issues posed by\nunique fixed points while introducing a deterministic learning method to\ncompute the learnable parameters. The simulations show that our interpretable\nmodel obtains competitive performance when compared to the state-of-the-art\nwhite and black boxes.",

We propose a deep neural network for\ngenerating waveforms, similar to wavenet. This is fully probabilistic,\nauto-regressive, and causal, i.e. each sample generated depends only on the\npreviously observed samples. Our approach outperforms a widely used wavenet\narchitecture by up to 9% on a similar dataset for predicting the next step.\nUsing the attention mechanism, we enable the architecture to learn which audio\nsamples are important for the prediction of the future sample. We show how\ncausal transformer generative models can be used for raw waveform synthesis. We\nalso show that this performance can be improved by another 2% by conditioning\nsamples over a wider context. The flexibility of the current model to\nsynthesize audio from latent representations suggests a large number of\npotential applications. The novel approach of using generative transformer\narchitectures for raw audio synthesis is, however, still far away from\ngenerating any meaningful music, without using latent codes/meta-data to aid\nthe generation process.",

          "description": "We investigate resource allocation scheme to reduce the energy consumption of\nfederated learning (FL) in the integrated fog-cloud computing enabled\nInternet-of-things (IoT) networks. In the envisioned system, IoT devices are\nconnected with the centralized cloud server (CS) via multiple fog access points\n(F-APs). We consider two different scenarios for training the local models. In\nthe first scenario, local models are trained at the IoT devices and the F-APs\nupload the local model parameters to the CS. In the second scenario, local\nmodels are trained at the F-APs based on the collected data from the IoT\ndevices and the F-APs collaborate with the CS for updating the model\nparameters. Our objective is to minimize the overall energy-consumption of both\nscenarios subject to FL time constraint. Towards this goal, we devise a joint\noptimization of scheduling of IoT devices with the F-APs, transmit power\nallocation, computation frequency allocation at the devices and F-APs and\ndecouple it into two subproblems. In the first subproblem, we optimize the IoT\ndevice scheduling and power allocation, while in the second subproblem, we\noptimize the computation frequency allocation. For each scenario, we develop a\nconflict graph based solution to iteratively solve the two subproblems.\nSimulation results show that the proposed two schemes achieve a considerable\nperformance gain in terms of the energy consumption minimization. The presented\nsimulation results interestingly reveal that for a large number of IoT devices\nand large data sizes, it is more energy efficient to train the local models at\nthe IoT devices instead of the F-APs.",

An under-specified\nor poorly-designed DL model may train successfully but is likely to perform\npoorly when deployed in production. Design smells in DL programs are poor\ndesign and-or configuration decisions taken during the development of DL\ncomponents, that are likely to have a negative impact on the performance (i.e.,\nprediction accuracy) and then quality of DL based software systems. In this\npaper, we present a catalogue of 8 design smells for a popular DL architecture,\nnamely deep Feedforward Neural Networks which is widely employed in industrial\napplications. The design smells were identified through a review of the\nexisting literature on DL design and a manual inspection of 659 DL programs\nwith performance issues and design inefficiencies. The smells are specified by\ndescribing their context, consequences, and recommended refactorings. To\nprovide empirical evidence on the relevance and perceived impact of the\nproposed design smells, we conducted a survey with 81 DL developers.

The discrimination\ncapacity of the proposed classification framework is assessed by comparing it\nagainst the standard customized CNNs. The customized CNN models are implemented\nin two ways: softmax classifier and deep hybrid learning-based malware\nclassification. In the hybrid learning, Deep features are extracted from\ncustomized CNN architectures and fed into the conventional machine learning\nclassifier to improve the classification performance. We also introduced the\nconcept of transfer learning in a customized CNN architecture based malware\nclassification framework through fine-tuning. The performance of the proposed\nmalware classification approaches are validated on the MalImg malware dataset\nusing the hold-out cross-validation technique. Experimental comparisons were\nconducted by employing innovative, customized CNN, trained from scratch and\nfine-tuning the customized CNN using transfer learning.

The pen\nprovides linear acceleration, angular velocity, magnetic field, and force\napplied by the user, and acts as a digitizer that transforms the analogue\nsignals of the sensors into timeseries data while writing on regular paper. The\ndataset we collected with this pen consists of Latin lower-case and upper-case\nalphabets. We present the results of a convolutional neural network model for\nletter classification and show that this approach is practical and achieves\npromising results for writer-independent character recognition. This work aims\nat providing a realtime handwriting recognition system to be used for writing\non normal paper.",

To solve these problems, context\ninformation such as user communication network is usually used.

          "description": "The presence of snow and ice on runway surfaces reduces the available\ntire-pavement friction needed for retardation and directional control and\ncauses potential economic and safety threats for the aviation industry during\nthe winter seasons. To activate appropriate safety procedures, pilots need\naccurate and timely information on the actual runway surface conditions. In\nthis study, XGBoost is used to create a combined runway assessment system,\nwhich includes a classifcation model to predict slippery conditions and a\nregression model to predict the level of slipperiness. The models are trained\non weather data and data from runway reports. The runway surface conditions are\nrepresented by the tire-pavement friction coefficient, which is estimated from\nflight sensor data from landing aircrafts. To evaluate the performance of the\nmodels, they are compared to several state-of-the-art runway assessment\nmethods. The XGBoost models identify slippery runway conditions with a ROC AUC\nof 0.95, predict the friction coefficient with a MAE of 0.0254, and outperforms\nall the previous methods. The results show the strong abilities of machine\nlearning methods to model complex, physical phenomena with a good accuracy when\ndomain knowledge is used in the variable extraction. The XGBoost models are\ncombined with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) approximations to provide a\ncomprehensible decision support system for airport operators and pilots, which\ncan contribute to safer and more economic operations of airport runways.",

          "description": "This paper presents a multiple learner algorithm called the 'Three Ensemble\nClustering 3EC' algorithm that classifies unlabeled data into quality clusters\nas a part of unsupervised learning. It offers the flexibility to explore the\ncontext of new clusters formed by an ensemble of algorithms based on internal\nvalidation indices.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the input data set is considered to be a cluster\nof clusters. An anomaly can possibly manifest as a cluster as well. Each\npartitioned cluster is considered to be a new data set and is a candidate to\nexplore the most optimal algorithm and its number of partition splits until a\npredefined stopping criteria is met. The algorithms independently partition the\ndata set into clusters and the quality of the partitioning is assessed by an\nensemble of internal cluster validation indices. The 3EC algorithm presents the\nvalidation index scores from a choice of algorithms and its configuration of\npartitions and it is called the Tau Grid. 3EC chooses the most optimal score.\nThe 3EC algorithm owes its name to the two input ensembles of algorithms and\ninternal validation indices and an output ensemble of final clusters.\n\nQuality plays an important role in this clustering approach and it also acts\nas a stopping criteria from further partitioning. Quality is determined based\non the quality of the clusters provided by an algorithm and its optimal number\nof splits. The 3EC algorithm determines this from the score of the ensemble of\nvalidation indices. The user can configure the stopping criteria by providing\nquality thresholds for the score range of each of the validation indices and\nthe optimal size of the output cluster. The users can experiment with different\nsets of stopping criteria and choose the most 'sensible group' of quality\nclusters",

          "description": "Adversarial examples pose a threat to deep neural network models in a variety\nof scenarios, from settings where the adversary has complete knowledge of the\nmodel in a \"white box\" setting and to the opposite in a \"black box\" setting. In\nthis paper, we explore the use of output randomization as a defense against\nattacks in both the black box and white box models and propose two defenses. In\nthe first defense, we propose output randomization at test time to thwart\nfinite difference attacks in black box settings. Since this type of attack\nrelies on repeated queries to the model to estimate gradients, we investigate\nthe use of randomization to thwart such adversaries from successfully creating\nadversarial examples. We empirically show that this defense can limit the\nsuccess rate of a black box adversary using the Zeroth Order Optimization\nattack to 0%. Secondly, we propose output randomization training as a defense\nagainst white box adversaries. Unlike prior approaches that use randomization,\nour defense does not require its use at test time, eliminating the Backward\nPass Differentiable Approximation attack, which was shown to be effective\nagainst other randomization defenses. Additionally, this defense has low\noverhead and is easily implemented, allowing it to be used together with other\ndefenses across various model architectures. We evaluate output randomization\ntraining against the Projected Gradient Descent attacker and show that the\ndefense can reduce the PGD attack's success rate down to 12% when using\ncross-entropy loss.",

A MOD-Net is driven by a model to solve PDEs based on operator\nrepresentation with regularization from data. In this work, we use a deep\nneural network to parameterize the Green's function. The empirical risk\nconsists of the mean square of the governing equation, boundary conditions, and\na few labels, which are numerically computed by traditional schemes on coarse\ngrid points with cheap computation cost. With only the labeled dataset or only\nthe model constraints, it is insufficient to accurately train a MOD-Net for\ncomplicate problems. Intuitively, the labeled dataset works as a regularization\nin addition to the model constraints. The MOD-Net is much efficient than\noriginal neural operator because the MOD-Net also uses the information of\ngoverning equation and the boundary conditions of the PDE rather than purely\nthe expensive labels. Since the MOD-Net learns the Green's function of a PDE,\nit solves a type of PDEs but not a specific case. We numerically show MOD-Net\nis very efficient in solving Poisson equation and one-dimensional Boltzmann\nequation.

          "description": "Attention is a general reasoning mechanism than can flexibly deal with image\ninformation, but its memory requirements had made it so far impractical for\nhigh resolution image generation. We present Grid Partitioned Attention (GPA),\na new approximate attention algorithm that leverages a sparse inductive bias\nfor higher computational and memory efficiency in image domains: queries attend\nonly to few keys, spatially close queries attend to close keys due to\ncorrelations. Our paper introduces the new attention layer, analyzes its\ncomplexity and how the trade-off between memory usage and model power can be\ntuned by the hyper-parameters.We will show how such attention enables novel\ndeep learning architectures with copying modules that are especially useful for\nconditional image generation tasks like pose morphing. Our contributions are\n(i) algorithm and code1of the novel GPA layer, (ii) a novel deep\nattention-copying architecture, and (iii) new state-of-the art experimental\nresults in human pose morphing generation benchmarks.",

          "description": "The availability of large amounts of user-provided data has been key to the\nsuccess of machine learning for many real-world tasks. Recently, an increasing\nawareness has emerged that users should be given more control about how their\ndata is used. In particular, users should have the right to prohibit the use of\ntheir data for training machine learning systems, and to have it erased from\nalready trained systems. While several sample erasure methods have been\nproposed, all of them have drawbacks which have prevented them from gaining\nwidespread adoption. Most methods are either only applicable to very specific\nfamilies of models, sacrifice too much of the original model's accuracy, or\nthey have prohibitive memory or computational requirements. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient and effective algorithm, SSSE, for samples erasure, that\nis applicable to a wide class of machine learning models. From a second-order\nanalysis of the model's loss landscape we derive a closed-form update step of\nthe model parameters that only requires access to the data to be erased, not to\nthe original training set. Experiments on three datasets, CelebFaces attributes\n(CelebA), Animals with Attributes 2 (AwA2) and CIFAR10, show that in certain\ncases SSSE can erase samples almost as well as the optimal, yet impractical,\ngold standard of training a new model from scratch with only the permitted\ndata.",

          "description": "Latent variable models are powerful statistical tools that can uncover\nrelevant variation between patients or cells, by inferring unobserved hidden\nstates from observable high-dimensional data. A major shortcoming of current\nmethods, however, is their inability to learn sparse and interpretable hidden\nstates. Additionally, in settings where partial knowledge on the latent\nstructure of the data is readily available, a statistically sound integration\nof prior information into current methods is challenging. To address these\nissues, we propose spex-LVM, a factorial latent variable model with sparse\npriors to encourage the inference of explainable factors driven by\ndomain-relevant information. spex-LVM utilizes existing knowledge of curated\nbiomedical pathways to automatically assign annotated attributes to latent\nfactors, yielding interpretable results tailored to the corresponding domain of\ninterest. Evaluations on simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets\ndemonstrate that our model robustly identifies relevant structure in an\ninherently explainable manner, distinguishes technical noise from sources of\nbiomedical variation, and provides dataset-specific adaptations of existing\npathway annotations.

          "description": "In existing deep learning methods, almost all loss functions assume that\nsample data values used to be predicted are the only correct ones. This\nassumption does not hold for laboratory test data. Test results are often\nwithin tolerable or imprecision ranges, with all values in the ranges\nacceptable. By considering imprecision samples, we propose an imprecision range\nloss (IR loss) method and incorporate it into Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)\nmodel for disease progress prediction. In this method, each sample in\nimprecision range space has a certain probability to be the real value,\nparticipating in the loss calculation. The loss is defined as the integral of\nthe error of each point in the impression range space. A sampling method for\nimprecision space is formulated. The continuous imprecision space is\ndiscretized, and a sequence of imprecise data sets are obtained, which is\nconvenient for gradient descent learning. A heuristic learning algorithm is\ndeveloped to learn the model parameters based on the imprecise data sets.\nExperimental results on real data show that the prediction method based on IR\nloss can provide more stable and consistent prediction result when test samples\nare generated from imprecision range.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have increased the accuracy of automatic segmentation,\nhowever, their accuracy depends on the availability of a large number of fully\nsegmented images. Methods to train deep neural networks using images for which\nsome, but not all, regions of interest are segmented are necessary to make\nbetter use of partially annotated datasets. In this paper, we propose the first\naxiomatic definition of label-set loss functions that are the loss functions\nthat can handle partially segmented images. We prove that there is one and only\none method to convert a classical loss function for fully segmented images into\na proper label-set loss function.

          "description": "In large studies involving multi protocol Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),\nit can occur to miss one or more sub-modalities for a given patient owing to\npoor quality (e.g. imaging artifacts), failed acquisitions, or hallway\ninterrupted imaging examinations. In some cases, certain protocols are\nunavailable due to limited scan time or to retrospectively harmonise the\nimaging protocols of two independent studies. Missing image modalities pose a\nchallenge to segmentation frameworks as complementary information contributed\nby the missing scans is then lost. In this paper, we propose a novel model,\nMulti-modal Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoder (MGP-VAE), to impute\none or more missing sub-modalities for a patient scan. MGP-VAE can leverage the\nGaussian Process (GP) prior on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to utilize the\nsubjects/patients and sub-modalities correlations. Instead of designing one\nnetwork for each possible subset of present sub-modalities or using frameworks\nto mix feature maps, missing data can be generated from a single model based on\nall the available samples. We show the applicability of MGP-VAE on brain tumor\nsegmentation where either, two, or three of four sub-modalities may be missing.\nOur experiments against competitive segmentation baselines with missing\nsub-modality on BraTS'19 dataset indicate the effectiveness of the MGP-VAE\nmodel for segmentation tasks.",

However, in practical\napplication scenarios, the imbalance of time-series fault is an urgent problem\nto be solved. From the perspective of Bayesian probability, this paper analyzes\nhow to improve the performance of imbalanced classification by adjusting the\ndistance between classes and the distribution within a class and proposes a\ntime-series fault diagnosis model based on deep metric learning. As a core of\ndeep metric learning, a novel quadruplet data pair design considering imbalance\nclass is proposed with reference to traditional deep metric learning. Based on\nsuch data pair, this paper proposes a quadruplet loss function which takes into\naccount the inter-class distance and the intra-class data distribution, and\npays special attention to imbalanced sample pairs. The reasonable combination\nof quadruplet loss and softmax loss function can reduce the impact of\nimbalance.

Each expert\nis an individual network with expertise on a unique portion of the dataset,\nwhich enhances the collective capacity. Given a sample, an expert is selected\nby the delegator, which simultaneously outputs a rough prediction to support\nearly termination. To fulfill this framework, we propose three modules to impel\neach model to play its role, namely weight generation module (WGM), label\ngeneration module (LGM) and variance calculation module (VCM). Our method\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, 80.7% top-1 accuracy\nwith 194M FLOPs. Combined with PWLU activation function and CondConv, CoE\nfurther achieves the accuracy of 80.0% with only 100M FLOPs for the first time.\nMore importantly, our method is hardware friendly and achieves a 3-6x speedup\ncompared with some existing conditional computation approaches.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of model selection for the general stochastic\ncontextual bandits under the realizability assumption. We propose a successive\nrefinement based algorithm called Adaptive Contextual Bandit ({\\ttfamily ACB}),\nthat works in phases and successively eliminates model classes that are too\nsimple to fit the given instance. We prove that this algorithm is adaptive,\ni.e., the regret rate order-wise matches that of {\\ttfamily FALCON}, the\nstate-of-art contextual bandit algorithm of Levi et. al '20, that needs\nknowledge of the true model class. The price of not knowing the correct model\nclass is only an additive term contributing to the second order term in the\nregret bound. This cost possess the intuitive property that it becomes smaller\nas the model class becomes easier to identify, and vice-versa. We then show\nthat a much simpler explore-then-commit (ETC) style algorithm also obtains a\nregret rate of matching that of {\\ttfamily FALCON}, despite not knowing the\ntrue model class. However, the cost of model selection is higher in ETC as\nopposed to in {\\ttfamily ACB}, as expected. Furthermore, {\\ttfamily ACB}\napplied to the linear bandit setting with unknown sparsity, order-wise recovers\nthe model selection guarantees previously established by algorithms tailored to\nthe linear setting.",

In\nparticular, the analysis reveals how inference propagates and fuses across a\nnetwork. We study the design criterion of our proposed method and its bandwidth\nrequirements.

          "description": "A strong visual object tracker nowadays relies on its well-crafted modules,\nwhich typically consist of manually-designed network architectures to deliver\nhigh-quality tracking results. Not surprisingly, the manual design process\nbecomes a particularly challenging barrier, as it demands sufficient prior\nexperience, enormous effort, intuition and perhaps some good luck. Meanwhile,\nneural architecture search has gaining grounds in practical applications such\nas image segmentation, as a promising method in tackling the issue of automated\nsearch of feasible network structures. In this work, we propose a novel\ncell-level differentiable architecture search mechanism to automate the network\ndesign of the tracking module, aiming to adapt backbone features to the\nobjective of a tracking network during offline training. The proposed approach\nis simple, efficient, and with no need to stack a series of modules to\nconstruct a network. Our approach is easy to be incorporated into existing\ntrackers, which is empirically validated using different differentiable\narchitecture search-based methods and tracking objectives. Extensive\nexperimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach\nover five commonly-used benchmarks.

          "description": "Face recognition approaches often rely on equal image resolution for\nverification faces on two images. However, in practical applications, those\nimage resolutions are usually not in the same range due to different image\ncapture mechanisms or sources. In this work, we first analyze the impact of\nimage resolutions on the face verification performance with a state-of-the-art\nface recognition model. For images, synthetically reduced to $5\\, \\times 5\\,\n\\mathrm{px}$ resolution, the verification performance drops from $99.23\\%$\nincreasingly down to almost $55\\%$. Especially, for cross-resolution image\npairs (one high- and one low-resolution image), the verification accuracy\ndecreases even further. We investigate this behavior more in-depth by looking\nat the feature distances for every 2-image test pair. To tackle this problem,\nwe propose the following two methods: 1) Train a state-of-the-art\nface-recognition model straightforward with $50\\%$ low-resolution images\ndirectly within each batch. \\\\ 2) Train a siamese-network structure and adding\na cosine distance feature loss between high- and low-resolution features.

          "description": "Modern Internet of Things solutions are used in a variety of different areas,\nranging from connected vehicles and healthcare to industrial applications. They\nrely on a large amount of interconnected sensors, which can lead to both\ntechnical and economical challenges. Virtual sensing techniques aim to reduce\nthe number of physical sensors in a system by using data from available\nmeasurements to estimate additional unknown quantities of interest. Successful\nmodel-based solutions include Kalman filters or the combination of finite\nelement models and modal analysis, while many data-driven methods rely on\nmachine learning algorithms. The presented hybrid virtual sensing approach\ncombines Long Short-Term Memory networks with frequency response function\nmodels in order to estimate the behavior of non-linear dynamic systems with\nmultiple input and output channels. Network training and prediction make use of\nshort signal subsequences, which are later recombined by applying a windowing\ntechnique. The frequency response function model acts as a baseline estimate\nwhich perfectly captures linear dynamic systems and is augmented by the\nnon-linear Long Short-Term Memory network following two different hybrid\nmodeling strategies. The approach is tested using a non-linear experimental\ndataset, which results from measurements of a three-component servo-hydraulic\nfatigue test bench. A variety of metrics in time and frequency domains, as well\nas fatigue strength under variable amplitudes are used to evaluate the\napproximation quality of the proposed method. In addition to virtual sensing,\nthe algorithm is also applied to a forward prediction task. Synthetic data are\nused in a separate study to estimate the prediction quality on datasets of\ndifferent size.",

          "description": "We study a version of the contextual bandit problem where an agent is given\nsoft control of a node in a graph-structured environment through a set of\nstochastic expert policies. The agent interacts with the environment over\nepisodes, with each episode having different context distributions; this\nresults in the `best expert' changing across episodes. Our goal is to develop\nan agent that tracks the best expert over episodes. We introduce the Empirical\nDivergence-based UCB (ED-UCB) algorithm in this setting where the agent does\nnot have any knowledge of the expert policies or changes in context\ndistributions. With mild assumptions, we show that bootstrapping from\n$\\tilde{O}(N\\log(NT^2\\sqrt{E}))$ samples results in a regret of\n$\\tilde{O}(E(N+1) + \\frac{N\\sqrt{E}}{T^2})$. If the expert policies are known\nto the agent a priori, then we can improve the regret to $\\tilde{O}(EN)$\nwithout requiring any bootstrapping. Our analysis also tightens pre-existing\nlogarithmic regret bounds to a problem-dependent constant in the non-episodic\nsetting when expert policies are known. We finally empirically validate our\nfindings through simulations.",

          "description": "Optimization is often cast as a deterministic problem, where the solution is\nfound through some iterative procedure such as gradient descent. However, when\ntraining neural networks the loss function changes over (iteration) time due to\nthe randomized selection of a subset of the samples. This randomization turns\nthe optimization problem into a stochastic one. We propose to consider the loss\nas a noisy observation with respect to some reference optimum. This\ninterpretation of the loss allows us to adopt Kalman filtering as an optimizer,\nas its recursive formulation is designed to estimate unknown parameters from\nnoisy measurements. Moreover, we show that the Kalman Filter dynamical model\nfor the evolution of the unknown parameters can be used to capture the gradient\ndynamics of advanced methods such as Momentum and Adam. We call this stochastic\noptimization method KaFiStO. KaFiStO is an easy to implement, scalable, and\nefficient method to train neural networks.

          "description": "The goal of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) is to build agents that can\nquickly learn new tasks by leveraging prior experience on related tasks.\nLearning a new task often requires both exploring to gather task-relevant\ninformation and exploiting this information to solve the task. In principle,\noptimal exploration and exploitation can be learned end-to-end by simply\nmaximizing task performance. However, such meta-RL approaches struggle with\nlocal optima due to a chicken-and-egg problem: learning to explore requires\ngood exploitation to gauge the exploration's utility, but learning to exploit\nrequires information gathered via exploration. Optimizing separate objectives\nfor exploration and exploitation can avoid this problem, but prior meta-RL\nexploration objectives yield suboptimal policies that gather information\nirrelevant to the task. We alleviate both concerns by constructing an\nexploitation objective that automatically identifies task-relevant information\nand an exploration objective to recover only this information. This avoids\nlocal optima in end-to-end training, without sacrificing optimal exploration.\nEmpirically, DREAM substantially outperforms existing approaches on complex\nmeta-RL problems, such as sparse-reward 3D visual navigation.

          "description": "Normalizing flows are a widely used class of latent-variable generative\nmodels with a tractable likelihood. Affine-coupling (Dinh et al, 2014-16)\nmodels are a particularly common type of normalizing flows, for which the\nJacobian of the latent-to-observable-variable transformation is triangular,\nallowing the likelihood to be computed in linear time. Despite the widespread\nusage of affine couplings, the special structure of the architecture makes\nunderstanding their representational power challenging. The question of\nuniversal approximation was only recently resolved by three parallel papers\n(Huang et al.,2020;Zhang et al.,2020;Koehler et al.,2020) -- who showed\nreasonably regular distributions can be approximated arbitrarily well using\naffine couplings -- albeit with networks with a nearly-singular Jacobian. As\nill-conditioned Jacobians are an obstacle for likelihood-based training, the\nfundamental question remains: which distributions can be approximated using\nwell-conditioned affine coupling flows?\n\nIn this paper, we show that any log-concave distribution can be approximated\nusing well-conditioned affine-coupling flows. In terms of proof techniques, we\nuncover and leverage deep connections between affine coupling architectures,\nunderdamped Langevin dynamics (a stochastic differential equation often used to\nsample from Gibbs measures) and H\\'enon maps (a structured dynamical system\nthat appears in the study of symplectic diffeomorphisms). Our results also\ninform the practice of training affine couplings: we approximate a padded\nversion of the input distribution with iid Gaussians -- a strategy which\nKoehler et al.(2020) empirically observed to result in better-conditioned\nflows, but had hitherto no theoretical grounding. Our proof can thus be seen as\nproviding theoretical evidence for the benefits of Gaussian padding when\ntraining normalizing flows.",

The learning goal is to minimize the\nattackable rate (the probability mass of attackable test instances), which is\nmore difficult than optimal PAC learning. As we show, any robust algorithm with\ndiminishing attackable rate can achieve the optimal dependence on $\\epsilon$ in\nits PAC sample complexity, i.e., $O(1/\\epsilon)$. On the other hand, the\nattackable rate might be large even for some optimal PAC learners, e.g., SVM\nfor linear classifiers.

Using physics models can be inaccurate because they cannot account\nfor unknown factors and the effects of the deformation of the object as it is\nlaunched; moreover, deriving force coefficients for these models is not\npossible without extensive experimental testing. Recently, advancements in\ndata-powered artificial intelligence methods have allowed learnable models and\nsystems to emerge. It is desirable to train a model for launch prediction on a\nrobot, as deep neural networks can account for immeasurable dynamics.

However,\nlearning over graph data can raise privacy concerns when nodes represent people\nor human-related variables that involve sensitive or personal information.\nWhile numerous techniques have been proposed for privacy-preserving deep\nlearning over non-relational data, there is less work addressing the privacy\nissues pertained to applying deep learning algorithms on graphs. In this paper,\nwe study the problem of node data privacy, where graph nodes have potentially\nsensitive data that is kept private, but they could be beneficial for a central\nserver for training a GNN over the graph. To address this problem, we develop a\nprivacy-preserving, architecture-agnostic GNN learning algorithm with formal\nprivacy guarantees based on Local Differential Privacy (LDP). Specifically, we\npropose an LDP encoder and an unbiased rectifier, by which the server can\ncommunicate with the graph nodes to privately collect their data and\napproximate the GNN's first layer. To further reduce the effect of the injected\nnoise, we propose to prepend a simple graph convolution layer, called KProp,\nwhich is based on the multi-hop aggregation of the nodes' features acting as a\ndenoising mechanism. Finally, we propose a robust training framework, in which\nwe benefit from KProp's denoising capability to increase the accuracy of\ninference in the presence of noisy labels. Extensive experiments conducted over\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that our method can maintain a satisfying level\nof accuracy with low privacy loss.",

          "description": "Accurately forecasting transportation demand is crucial for efficient urban\ntraffic guidance, control and management. One solution to enhance the level of\nprediction accuracy is to leverage graph convolutional networks (GCN), a neural\nnetwork based modelling approach with the ability to process data contained in\ngraph based structures. As a powerful extension of GCN, a spatial-temporal\ngraph convolutional network (ST-GCN) aims to capture the relationship of data\ncontained in the graphical nodes across both spatial and temporal dimensions,\nwhich presents a novel deep learning paradigm for the analysis of complex\ntime-series data that also involves spatial information as present in\ntransportation use cases. In this paper, we present an Attention-based ST-GCN\n(AST-GCN) for predicting the number of available bikes in bike-sharing systems\nin cities, where the attention-based mechanism is introduced to further improve\nthe performance of an ST-GCN. Furthermore, we also discuss the impacts of\ndifferent modelling methods of adjacency matrices on the proposed architecture.\nOur experimental results are presented using two real-world datasets,\nDublinbikes and NYC-Citi Bike, to illustrate the efficacy of our proposed model\nwhich outperforms the majority of existing approaches.",

          "description": "A growing demand is witnessed in both industry and academia for employing\nDeep Learning (DL) in various domains to solve real-world problems. Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) is the application of DL in the domain of\nReinforcement Learning (RL). Like any software systems, DRL applications can\nfail because of faults in their programs. In this paper, we present the first\nattempt to categorize faults occurring in DRL programs. We manually analyzed\n761 artifacts of DRL programs (from Stack Overflow posts and GitHub issues)\ndeveloped using well-known DRL frameworks (OpenAI Gym, Dopamine, Keras-rl,\nTensorforce) and identified faults reported by developers/users. We labeled and\ntaxonomized the identified faults through several rounds of discussions. The\nresulting taxonomy is validated using an online survey with 19\ndevelopers/researchers. To allow for the automatic detection of faults in DRL\nprograms, we have defined a meta-model of DRL programs and developed DRLinter,\na model-based fault detection approach that leverages static analysis and graph\ntransformations. The execution flow of DRLinter consists in parsing a DRL\nprogram to generate a model conforming to our meta-model and applying detection\nrules on the model to identify faults occurrences. The effectiveness of\nDRLinter is evaluated using 15 synthetic DRLprograms in which we injected\nfaults observed in the analyzed artifacts of the taxonomy. The results show\nthat DRLinter can successfully detect faults in all synthetic faulty programs.",

We propose instead a robust framework for tests of\ndataset shift based on outlier scores, D-SOS for short. D-SOS detects adverse\nshifts and can identify false alarms caused by benign ones. It posits that a\nnew (test) sample is not substantively worse than an old (training) sample, and\nnot that the two are equal. The key idea is to reduce observations to outlier\nscores and compare contamination rates. Beyond comparing distributions, users\ncan define what worse means in terms of predictive performance and other\nrelevant notions. We show how versatile and practical D-SOS is for a wide range\nof real and simulated datasets.

          "description": "Federated Learning is an emerging decentralized machine learning paradigm\nthat allows a large number of clients to train a joint model without the need\nto share their private data. Participants instead only share ephemeral updates\nnecessary to train the model. To ensure the confidentiality of the client\nupdates, Federated Learning systems employ secure aggregation; clients encrypt\ntheir gradient updates, and only the aggregated model is revealed to the\nserver. Achieving this level of data protection, however, presents new\nchallenges to the robustness of Federated Learning, i.e., the ability to\ntolerate failures and attacks. Unfortunately, in this setting, a malicious\nclient can now easily exert influence on the model behavior without being\ndetected. As Federated Learning is being deployed in practice in a range of\nsensitive applications, its robustness is growing in importance. In this paper,\nwe take a step towards understanding and improving the robustness of secure\nFederated Learning. We start this paper with a systematic study that evaluates\nand analyzes existing attack vectors and discusses potential defenses and\nassesses their effectiveness. We then present RoFL, a secure Federated Learning\nsystem that improves robustness against malicious clients through input checks\non the encrypted model updates. RoFL extends Federated Learning's secure\naggregation protocol to allow expressing a variety of properties and\nconstraints on model updates using zero-knowledge proofs. To enable RoFL to\nscale to typical Federated Learning settings, we introduce several ML and\ncryptographic optimizations specific to Federated Learning. We implement and\nevaluate a prototype of RoFL and show that realistic ML models can be trained\nin a reasonable time while improving robustness.",

It will both\nincrease the diversity of learned skills and reduce the burden of manually\ndesigning reward functions for each skill. Self-supervised agents, setting\ntheir own goals, and trying to maximize the diversity of those goals have shown\ngreat promise towards this end. However, a currently known limitation of agents\ntrying to maximize the diversity of sampled goals is that they tend to get\nattracted to noise or more generally to parts of the environments that cannot\nbe controlled (distractors). When agents have access to predefined goal\nfeatures or expert knowledge, absolute Learning Progress (ALP) provides a way\nto distinguish between regions that can be controlled and those that cannot.\nHowever, those methods often fall short when the agents are only provided with\nraw sensory inputs such as images. In this work we extend those concepts to\nunsupervised image-based goal exploration. We propose a framework that allows\nagents to autonomously identify and ignore noisy distracting regions while\nsearching for novelty in the learnable regions to both improve overall\nperformance and avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our framework can be combined\nwith any state-of-the-art novelty seeking goal exploration approaches. We\nconstruct a rich 3D image based environment with distractors.

One novel\nregularization method called flooding makes the training loss fluctuate around\nthe flooding level. It intends to make the model continue to random walk until\nit comes to a flat loss landscape to enhance generalization. However, the\nhyper-parameter flooding level of the flooding method fails to be selected\nproperly and uniformly. We propose a novel method called Jitter to improve it.\nJitter is essentially a kind of random loss function. Before training, we\nrandomly sample the Jitter Point from a specific probability distribution. The\nflooding level should be replaced by Jitter point to obtain a new target\nfunction and train the model accordingly. As Jitter point acting as a random\nfactor, we actually add some randomness to the loss function, which is\nconsistent with the fact that there exists innumerable random behaviors in the\nlearning process of the machine learning model and is supposed to make the\nmodel more robust. In addition, Jitter performs random walk randomly which\ndivides the loss curve into small intervals and then flipping them over,\nideally making the loss curve much flatter and enhancing generalization\nability. Moreover, Jitter can be a domain-, task-, and model-independent\nregularization method and train the model effectively after the training error\nreduces to zero. Our experimental results show that Jitter method can improve\nmodel performance more significantly than the previous flooding method and make\nthe test loss curve descend twice.",

          "description": "Data depth is a non parametric statistical tool that measures centrality of\nany element $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to (w.r.t.) a probability\ndistribution or a data set. It is a natural median-oriented extension of the\ncumulative distribution function (cdf) to the multivariate case. Consequently,\nits upper level sets -- the depth-trimmed regions -- give rise to a definition\nof multivariate quantiles. In this work, we propose two new pseudo-metrics\nbetween continuous probability measures based on data depth and its associated\ncentral regions. The first one is constructed as the Lp-distance between data\ndepth w.r.t. each distribution while the second one relies on the Hausdorff\ndistance between their quantile regions. It can further be seen as an original\nway to extend the one-dimensional formulae of the Wasserstein distance, which\ninvolves quantiles and cdfs, to the multivariate space. After discussing the\nproperties of these pseudo-metrics and providing conditions under which they\ndefine a distance, we highlight similarities with the Wasserstein distance.\nInterestingly, the derived non-asymptotic bounds show that in contrast to the\nWasserstein distance, the proposed pseudo-metrics do not suffer from the curse\nof dimensionality. Moreover, based on the support function of a convex body, we\npropose an efficient approximation possessing linear time complexity w.r.t. the\nsize of the data set and its dimension. The quality of this approximation as\nwell as the performance of the proposed approach are illustrated in\nexperiments. Furthermore, by construction the regions-based pseudo-metric\nappears to be robust w.r.t. both outliers and heavy tails, a behavior witnessed\nin the numerical experiments.",

We describe and\nanalyze observational sampling from randomized controlled trials (OSRCT), a\nmethod for evaluating causal inference methods using data from randomized\ncontrolled trials (RCTs). This method can be used to create constructed\nobservational data sets with corresponding unbiased estimates of treatment\neffect, substantially increasing the number of data sets available for\nempirical evaluation of causal inference methods. We show that, in expectation,\nOSRCT creates data sets that are equivalent to those produced by randomly\nsampling from empirical data sets in which all potential outcomes are\navailable. We then perform a large-scale evaluation of seven causal inference\nmethods over 37 data sets, drawn from RCTs, as well as simulators, real-world\ncomputational systems, and observational data sets augmented with a synthetic\nresponse variable.

          "description": "Due to their increasing spread, confidence in neural network predictions\nbecame more and more important. However, basic neural networks do not deliver\ncertainty estimates or suffer from over or under confidence. Many researchers\nhave been working on understanding and quantifying uncertainty in a neural\nnetwork's prediction. As a result, different types and sources of uncertainty\nhave been identified and a variety of approaches to measure and quantify\nuncertainty in neural networks have been proposed. This work gives a\ncomprehensive overview of uncertainty estimation in neural networks, reviews\nrecent advances in the field, highlights current challenges, and identifies\npotential research opportunities. It is intended to give anyone interested in\nuncertainty estimation in neural networks a broad overview and introduction,\nwithout presupposing prior knowledge in this field. A comprehensive\nintroduction to the most crucial sources of uncertainty is given and their\nseparation into reducible model uncertainty and not reducible data uncertainty\nis presented. The modeling of these uncertainties based on deterministic neural\nnetworks, Bayesian neural networks, ensemble of neural networks, and test-time\ndata augmentation approaches is introduced and different branches of these\nfields as well as the latest developments are discussed. For a practical\napplication, we discuss different measures of uncertainty, approaches for the\ncalibration of neural networks and give an overview of existing baselines and\nimplementations. Different examples from the wide spectrum of challenges in\ndifferent fields give an idea of the needs and challenges regarding\nuncertainties in practical applications. Additionally, the practical\nlimitations of current methods for mission- and safety-critical real world\napplications are discussed and an outlook on the next steps towards a broader\nusage of such methods is given.",

          "description": "Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with noisy labels is a challenging\nproblem due to over-parameterization. DNNs tend to essentially fit on clean\nsamples at a higher rate in the initial stages, and later fit on the noisy\nsamples at a relatively lower rate. Thus, with a noisy dataset, the test\naccuracy increases initially and drops in the later stages. To find an early\nstopping point at the maximum obtainable test accuracy (MOTA), recent studies\nassume either that i) a clean validation set is available or ii) the noise\nratio is known, or, both. However, often a clean validation set is unavailable,\nand the noise estimation can be inaccurate. To overcome these issues, we\nprovide a novel training solution, free of these conditions. We analyze the\nrate of change of the training accuracy for different noise ratios under\ndifferent conditions to identify a training stop region. We further develop a\nheuristic algorithm based on a small-learning assumption to find a training\nstop point (TSP) at or close to MOTA. To the best of our knowledge, our method\nis the first to rely solely on the \\textit{training behavior}, while utilizing\nthe entire training set, to automatically find a TSP. We validated the\nrobustness of our algorithm (AutoTSP) through several experiments on CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100, and a real-world noisy dataset for different noise ratios, noise\ntypes, and architectures.",

However, the collected data is observational\nrather than experimental, causing various biases in the data which\nsignificantly affect the learned model. Most existing work for recommendation\ndebiasing, such as the inverse propensity scoring and imputation approaches,\nfocuses on one or two specific biases, lacking the universal capacity that can\naccount for mixed or even unknown biases in the data.\n\nTowards this research gap, we first analyze the origin of biases from the\nperspective of \\textit{risk discrepancy} that represents the difference between\nthe expectation empirical risk and the true risk. Remarkably, we derive a\ngeneral learning framework that well summarizes most existing debiasing\nstrategies by specifying some parameters of the general framework. This\nprovides a valuable opportunity to develop a universal solution for debiasing,\ne.g., by learning the debiasing parameters from data. However, the training\ndata lacks important signal of how the data is biased and what the unbiased\ndata looks like. To move this idea forward, we propose \\textit{AotoDebias} that\nleverages another (small) set of uniform data to optimize the debiasing\nparameters by solving the bi-level optimization problem with meta-learning.\nThrough theoretical analyses, we derive the generalization bound for AutoDebias\nand prove its ability to acquire the appropriate debiasing strategy.

The operators\nhighlight different types of features (e.g., patterns, gradients, geometrical\nfeatures) and are learned by using optimization techniques. In other words,\nCNNs seek to identify optimal operators that best map the input data to the\noutput data. A common misconception is that CNNs are only capable of processing\nimage or video data but their application scope is much wider; specifically,\ndatasets encountered in diverse applications can be expressed as grid data.\nHere, we show how to apply CNNs to new types of applications such as optimal\ncontrol, flow cytometry, multivariate process monitoring, and molecular\nsimulations.",

Label inference was recently\nintroduced as the problem of reconstructing the ground truth labels of this\nprivate dataset from just the (possibly perturbed) loss function values\nevaluated at chosen prediction vectors, without any other access to the hidden\ndataset. Existing results have demonstrated this inference is possible on\nspecific loss functions like the cross-entropy loss. In this paper, we\nintroduce the notion of codomain separability to formally study the necessary\nand sufficient conditions under which label inference is possible from any\n(noisy) loss function values. Using this notion, we show that for many commonly\nused loss functions, including multiclass cross-entropy with common activation\nfunctions and some Bregman divergence-based losses, it is possible to design\nlabel inference attacks for arbitrary noise levels. We demonstrate that these\nattacks can also be carried out through actual neural network models, and\nargue, both formally and empirically, the role of finite precision arithmetic\nin this setting.",

We focus on uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) for classification problems via two avenues -- prediction\nsets using conformal prediction and calibration of probabilistic predictors by\npost-hoc binning -- since these possess distribution-free guarantees for i.i.d.\ndata. Two common ways of generalizing beyond the i.i.d. setting include\nhandling covariate and label shift. Within the context of distribution-free UQ,\nthe former has already received attention, but not the latter. It is known that\nlabel shift hurts prediction, and we first argue that it also hurts UQ, by\nshowing degradation in coverage and calibration. Piggybacking on recent\nprogress in addressing label shift (for better prediction), we examine the\nright way to achieve UQ by reweighting the aforementioned conformal and\ncalibration procedures whenever some unlabeled data from the target\ndistribution is available.

Like any\nsoftware, a DL program can be faulty, which implies substantial challenges of\nsoftware quality assurance, especially in safety-critical domains. It is\ntherefore crucial to equip DL development teams with efficient fault detection\ntechniques and tools. In this paper, we propose NeuraLint, a model-based fault\ndetection approach for DL programs, using meta-modelling and graph\ntransformations. First, we design a meta-model for DL programs that includes\ntheir base skeleton and fundamental properties. Then, we construct a\ngraph-based verification process that covers 23 rules defined on top of the\nmeta-model and implemented as graph transformations to detect faults and design\ninefficiencies in the generated models (i.e., instances of the meta-model).\nFirst, the proposed approach is evaluated by finding faults and design\ninefficiencies in 28 synthesized examples built from common problems reported\nin the literature. Then NeuraLint successfully finds 64 faults and design\ninefficiencies in 34 real-world DL programs extracted from Stack Overflow posts\nand GitHub repositories. The results show that NeuraLint effectively detects\nfaults and design issues in both synthesized and real-world examples with a\nrecall of 70.5 % and a precision of 100 %. Although the proposed meta-model is\ndesigned for feedforward neural networks, it can be extended to support other\nneural network architectures such as recurrent neural networks. Researchers can\nalso expand our set of verification rules to cover more types of issues in DL\nprograms.",

While\nwe leverage concepts from the literature on provably efficient RL, we consider\na general agent-environment interface and provide a novel agent design and\nanalysis. This level of generality positions our results to inform the design\nof future agents for operation in complex real environments. We establish that,\nas time progresses, our agent performs competitively relative to policies that\nrequire longer times to evaluate. The time it takes to approach asymptotic\nperformance is polynomial in the complexity of the agent's state representation\nand the time required to evaluate the best policy that the agent can represent.\nNotably, there is no dependence on the complexity of the environment.

          "description": "One of the most widely used methods for solving large-scale stochastic\noptimization problems is distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient descent\n(DASGD), a family of algorithms that result from parallelizing stochastic\ngradient descent on distributed computing architectures (possibly)\nasychronously. However, a key obstacle in the efficient implementation of DASGD\nis the issue of delays: when a computing node contributes a gradient update,\nthe global model parameter may have already been updated by other nodes several\ntimes over, thereby rendering this gradient information stale. These delays can\nquickly add up if the computational throughput of a node is saturated, so the\nconvergence of DASGD may be compromised in the presence of large delays. Our\nfirst contribution is that, by carefully tuning the algorithm's step-size,\nconvergence to the critical set is still achieved in mean square, even if the\ndelays grow unbounded at a polynomial rate. We also establish finer results in\na broad class of structured optimization problems (called variationally\ncoherent), where we show that DASGD converges to a global optimum with\nprobability $1$ under the same delay assumptions. Together, these results\ncontribute to the broad landscape of large-scale non-convex stochastic\noptimization by offering state-of-the-art theoretical guarantees and providing\ninsights for algorithm design.",

However, DER prediction based on the transmission of\ncustomer level data, either repeatedly or in large amounts, is not feasible due\nto privacy concerns. In this paper, a distributed machine learning approach,\nFederated Learning, is proposed to carry out DER forecasting using a network of\nIoT nodes, each of which transmits a model of the consumption and generation\npatterns without revealing consumer data. We consider a simulation study which\nincludes 1000 DERs, and show that our method leads to an accurate prediction of\npreserve consumer privacy, while still leading to an accurate forecast.

          "description": "Regions of high-dimensional input spaces that are underrepresented in\ntraining datasets reduce machine-learnt classifier performance, and may lead to\ncorner cases and unwanted bias for classifiers used in decision making systems.\nWhen these regions belong to otherwise well-represented classes, their presence\nand negative impact are very hard to identify. We propose an approach for the\ndetection and mitigation of such rare subclasses in deep neural network\nclassifiers. The new approach is underpinned by an easy-to-compute commonality\nmetric that supports the detection of rare subclasses, and comprises methods\nfor reducing the impact of these subclasses during both model training and\nmodel exploitation. We demonstrate our approach using two well-known datasets,\nMNIST's handwritten digits and Kaggle's cats/dogs, identifying rare subclasses\nand producing models which compensate for subclass rarity. In addition we\ndemonstrate how our run-time approach increases the ability of users to\nidentify samples likely to be misclassified at run-time.",

          "description": "The proposed method re-frames traditional inverse problems of\nelectrocardiography into regression problems, constraining the solution space\nby decomposing signals with multidimensional Gaussian impulse basis functions.\nImpulse HSPs were generated with single Gaussian basis functions at discrete\nheart surface locations and projected to corresponding BSPs using a volume\nconductor torso model. Both BSP (inputs) and HSP (outputs) were mapped to\nregular 2D surface meshes and used to train a neural network. Predictive\ncapabilities of the network were tested with unseen synthetic and experimental\ndata. A dense full connected single hidden layer neural network was trained to\nmap body surface impulses to heart surface Gaussian basis functions for\nreconstructing HSP. Synthetic pulses moving across the heart surface were\npredicted from the neural network with root mean squared error of $9.1\\pm1.4$%.\nPredicted signals were robust to noise up to 20 dB and errors due to\ndisplacement and rotation of the heart within the torso were bounded and\npredictable. A shift of the heart 40 mm toward the spine resulted in a 4\\%\nincrease in signal feature localization error. The set of training impulse\nfunction data could be reduced and prediction error remained bounded. Recorded\nHSPs from in-vitro pig hearts were reliably decomposed using space-time\nGaussian basis functions. Predicted HSPs for left-ventricular pacing had a mean\nabsolute error of $10.4\\pm11.4$ ms. Other pacing scenarios were analyzed with\nsimilar success. Conclusion: Impulses from Gaussian basis functions are\npotentially an effective and robust way to train simple neural network data\nmodels for reconstructing HSPs from decomposed BSPs. The HSPs predicted by the\nneural network can be used to generate activation maps that non-invasively\nidentify features of cardiac electrical dysfunction and can guide subsequent\ntreatment options.",

          "description": "Attributed event sequences are commonly encountered in practice. A recent\nresearch line focuses on incorporating neural networks with the statistical\nmodel -- marked point processes, which is the conventional tool for dealing\nwith attributed event sequences. Neural marked point processes possess good\ninterpretability of probabilistic models as well as the representational power\nof neural networks. However, we find that performance of neural marked point\nprocesses is not always increasing as the network architecture becomes more\ncomplicated and larger, which is what we call the performance saturation\nphenomenon. This is due to the fact that the generalization error of neural\nmarked point processes is determined by both the network representational\nability and the model specification at the same time. Therefore we can draw two\nmajor conclusions: first, simple network structures can perform no worse than\ncomplicated ones for some cases; second, using a proper probabilistic\nassumption is as equally, if not more, important as improving the complexity of\nthe network. Based on this observation, we propose a simple graph-based network\nstructure called GCHP, which utilizes only graph convolutional layers, thus it\ncan be easily accelerated by the parallel mechanism. We directly consider the\ndistribution of interarrival times instead of imposing a specific assumption on\nthe conditional intensity function, and propose to use a likelihood ratio loss\nwith a moment matching mechanism for optimization and model selection.\nExperimental results show that GCHP can significantly reduce training time and\nthe likelihood ratio loss with interarrival time probability assumptions can\ngreatly improve the model performance.",

Examples include copies of books sold,\nauction prices of art pieces, demand for commodities in warehouses, etc. By\nlearning heavy-tailed distributions, \"big and rare\" instances (e.g., the\nbest-sellers) will have accurate predictions. Most existing approaches are not\ndedicated to learning heavy-tailed distribution; thus, they heavily\nunder-predict such instances. To tackle this problem, we introduce Learning to\nPlace (L2P), which exploits the pairwise relationships between instances for\nlearning. In its training phase, L2P learns a pairwise preference classifier:\nis instance A > instance B? In its placing phase, L2P obtains a prediction by\nplacing the new instance among the known instances. Based on its placement, the\nnew instance is then assigned a value for its outcome variable. Experiments on\nreal data show that L2P outperforms competing approaches in terms of accuracy\nand ability to reproduce heavy-tailed outcome distribution. In addition, L2P\nprovides an interpretable model by placing each predicted instance in relation\nto its comparable neighbors.

In principle,\nrestricted inference, i.e., procedures that exploit the structure of the\nsubmanifold, should be more effective than unrestricted inference; however, it\nis not clear how to conduct restricted inference when the submanifold is\nunknown. We submit that techniques for manifold learning can be used to learn\nthe unknown submanifold well enough to realize benefit from restricted\ninference.

          "description": "Building vehicles capable of operating without human supervision requires the\ndetermination of the agent's pose. Visual Odometry (VO) algorithms estimate the\negomotion using only visual changes from the input images. The most recent VO\nmethods implement deep-learning techniques using convolutional neural networks\n(CNN) extensively, which add a substantial cost when dealing with\nhigh-resolution images. Furthermore, in VO tasks, more input data does not mean\na better prediction; on the contrary, the architecture may filter out useless\ninformation. Therefore, the implementation of computationally efficient and\nlightweight architectures is essential. In this work, we propose the RAM-VO, an\nextension of the Recurrent Attention Model (RAM) for visual odometry tasks.\nRAM-VO improves the visual and temporal representation of information and\nimplements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to learn robust\npolicies. The results indicate that RAM-VO can perform regressions with six\ndegrees of freedom from monocular input images using approximately 3 million\nparameters. In addition, experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that\nRAM-VO achieves competitive results using only 5.7% of the available visual\ninformation.",

We\nemploy three types of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and test Keiki\nacross three metrics designed to quantify the quality of the generated\ndanmakus. The time-series GAN and periodic spatial GAN show different yet\ncompetitive performance in terms of the evaluation metrics adopted, their\ndeviation from human-designed danmakus, and the diversity of generated\ndanmakus.

          "description": "Recent work has shown that the performance of machine learning models can\nvary substantially when models are evaluated on data drawn from a distribution\nthat is close to but different from the training distribution. As a result,\npredicting model performance on unseen distributions is an important challenge.\nOur work connects techniques from domain adaptation and predictive uncertainty\nliterature, and allows us to predict model accuracy on challenging unseen\ndistributions without access to labeled data. In the context of distribution\nshift, distributional distances are often used to adapt models and improve\ntheir performance on new domains, however accuracy estimation, or other forms\nof predictive uncertainty, are often neglected in these investigations. Through\ninvestigating a wide range of established distributional distances, such as\nFrechet distance or Maximum Mean Discrepancy, we determine that they fail to\ninduce reliable estimates of performance under distribution shift.

          "description": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used to learn an informative latent\nrepresentation of a user or item from observed interactions. Existing CF-based\nmethods commonly adopt negative sampling to discriminate different items. That\nis, observed user-item pairs are treated as positive instances; unobserved\npairs are considered as negative instances and are sampled under a defined\ndistribution for training. Training with negative sampling on large datasets is\ncomputationally expensive. Further, negative items should be carefully sampled\nunder the defined distribution, in order to avoid selecting an observed\npositive item in the training dataset. Unavoidably, some negative items sampled\nfrom the training dataset could be positive in the test set. Recently,\nself-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful tool to learn a model\nwithout negative samples. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised\ncollaborative filtering framework (SelfCF), that is specially designed for\nrecommender scenario with implicit feedback. The main idea of SelfCF is to\naugment the output embeddings generated by backbone networks, because it is\ninfeasible to augment raw input of user/item ids. We propose and study three\noutput perturbation techniques that can be applied to different types of\nbackbone networks including both traditional CF models and graph-based models.\nBy encapsulating two popular recommendation models into the framework, our\nexperiments on three datasets show that the best performance of our framework\nis comparable or better than the supervised counterpart. We also show that\nSelfCF can boost up the performance by up to 8.93\\% on average, compared with\nanother self-supervised framework as the baseline.

We give an algorithm with cost\n$O(dm + m^2)$ for computing the IHVP and $O(dm + m^3)$ for adding or removing\nany gradient from the sliding window.

          "description": "Channel capacity plays a crucial role in the development of modern\ncommunication systems as it represents the maximum rate at which information\ncan be reliably transmitted over a communication channel. Nevertheless, for the\nmajority of channels, finding a closed-form capacity expression remains an open\nchallenge. This is because it requires to carry out two formidable tasks a) the\ncomputation of the mutual information between the channel input and output, and\nb) its maximization with respect to the signal distribution at the channel\ninput. In this paper, we address both tasks. Inspired by implicit generative\nmodels, we propose a novel cooperative framework to automatically learn the\nchannel capacity, for any type of memory-less channel. In particular, we\nfirstly develop a new methodology to estimate the mutual information directly\nfrom a discriminator typically deployed to train adversarial networks, referred\nto as discriminative mutual information estimator (DIME). Secondly, we include\nthe discriminator in a cooperative channel capacity learning framework,\nreferred to as CORTICAL, where a discriminator learns to distinguish between\ndependent and independent channel input-output samples while a generator learns\nto produce the optimal channel input distribution for which the discriminator\nexhibits the best performance. Lastly, we prove that a particular choice of the\ncooperative value function solves the channel capacity estimation problem.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed method offers high accuracy.",

To address this issue, we present a novel VAE-based\nmulti-view clustering framework (Multi-VAE) by learning disentangled visual\nrepresentations. Concretely, we define a view-common variable and multiple\nview-peculiar variables in the generative model. The prior of view-common\nvariable obeys approximately discrete Gumbel Softmax distribution, which is\nintroduced to extract the common cluster factor of multiple views. Meanwhile,\nthe prior of view-peculiar variable follows continuous Gaussian distribution,\nwhich is used to represent each view's peculiar visual factors.

          "description": "Quality inspection applications in industry are required to move towards a\nzero-defect manufacturing scenario, withnon-destructive inspection and\ntraceability of 100 % of produced parts. Developing robust fault detection and\nclassification modelsfrom the start-up of the lines is challenging due to the\ndifficulty in getting enough representative samples of the faulty patternsand\nthe need to manually label them. This work presents a methodology to develop a\nrobust inspection system, targeting thesepeculiarities, in the context of solar\ncell manufacturing. The methodology is divided into two phases: In the first\nphase, an anomalydetection model based on a Generative Adversarial Network\n(GAN) is employed. This model enables the detection and localizationof\nanomalous patterns within the solar cells from the beginning, using only\nnon-defective samples for training and without anymanual labeling involved. In\na second stage, as defective samples arise, the detected anomalies will be used\nas automaticallygenerated annotations for the supervised training of a Fully\nConvolutional Network that is capable of detecting multiple types offaults. The\nexperimental results using 1873 EL images of monocrystalline cells show that\n(a) the anomaly detection scheme can beused to start detecting features with\nvery little available data, (b) the anomaly detection may serve as automatic\nlabeling in order totrain a supervised model, and (c) segmentation and\nclassification results of supervised models trained with automatic labels\narecomparable to the ones obtained from the models trained with manual labels.",

Most of these models, however, predict concentrations of pollutants\nfollowing a data-driven approach in which the physical laws that govern their\nbehaviors and relationships remain hidden. With the aid of real-world air\nquality data collected hourly in different stations throughout Madrid, we\npresent an empirical approach using data-driven techniques with the following\ngoals: (1) Find parsimonious systems of ordinary differential equations via\nsparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) that model the\nconcentration of pollutants and their changes over time; (2) assess the\nperformance and limitations of our models using stability analysis; (3)\nreconstruct the time series of chemical pollutants not measured in certain\nstations using delay coordinate embedding results. Our results show that\nAkaike's Information Criterion can work well in conjunction with best subset\nregression as to find an equilibrium between sparsity and goodness of fit. We\nalso find that, due to the complexity of the chemical system under study,\nidentifying the dynamics of this system over longer periods of time require\nhigher levels of data filtering and smoothing. Stability analysis for the\nreconstructed ordinary differential equations (ODEs) reveals that more than\nhalf of the physically relevant critical points are saddle points, suggesting\nthat the system is unstable even under the idealized assumption that all\nenvironmental conditions are constant over time.",

          "description": "We establish an equivalence between the $\\ell_2$-regularized solution path\nfor a convex loss function, and the solution of an ordinary differentiable\nequation (ODE). Importantly, this equivalence reveals that the solution path\ncan be viewed as the flow of a hybrid of gradient descent and Newton method\napplying to the empirical loss, which is similar to a widely used optimization\ntechnique called trust region method. This provides an interesting algorithmic\nview of $\\ell_2$ regularization, and is in contrast to the conventional view\nthat the $\\ell_2$ regularization solution path is similar to the gradient flow\nof the empirical loss.New path-following algorithms based on homotopy methods\nand numerical ODE solvers are proposed to numerically approximate the solution\npath. In particular, we consider respectively Newton method and gradient\ndescent method as the basis algorithm for the homotopy method, and establish\ntheir approximation error rates over the solution path. Importantly, our theory\nsuggests novel schemes to choose grid points that guarantee an arbitrarily\nsmall suboptimality for the solution path. In terms of computational cost, we\nprove that in order to achieve an $\\epsilon$-suboptimality for the entire\nsolution path, the number of Newton steps required for the Newton method is\n$\\mathcal O(\\epsilon^{-1/2})$, while the number of gradient steps required for\nthe gradient descent method is $\\mathcal O\\left(\\epsilon^{-1}\n\\ln(\\epsilon^{-1})\\right)$.

          "description": "Gaussian process (GP) model based optimization is widely applied in\nsimulation and machine learning. In general, it first estimates a GP model\nbased on a few observations from the true response and then employs this model\nto guide the search, aiming to quickly locate the global optimum. Despite its\nsuccessful applications, it has several limitations that may hinder its broader\nusage. First, building an accurate GP model can be difficult and\ncomputationally expensive, especially when the response function is multi-modal\nor varies significantly over the design space. Second, even with an appropriate\nmodel, the search process can be trapped in suboptimal regions before moving to\nthe global optimum due to the excessive effort spent around the current best\nsolution. In this work, we adopt the Additive Global and Local GP (AGLGP) model\nin the optimization framework. The model is rooted in the inducing-points-based\nGP sparse approximations and is combined with independent local models in\ndifferent regions. With these properties, the AGLGP model is suitable for\nmulti-modal responses with relatively large data sizes. Based on this AGLGP\nmodel, we propose a Combined Global and Local search for Optimization (CGLO)\nalgorithm. It first divides the whole design space into disjoint local regions\nand identifies a promising region with the global model. Next, a local model in\nthe selected region is fit to guide detailed search within this region. The\nalgorithm then switches back to the global step when a good local solution is\nfound. The global and local natures of CGLO enable it to enjoy the benefits of\nboth global and local search to efficiently locate the global optimum.",

In this paper, we demonstrate that predictive uncertainty\nestimated by the current methods does not highly correlate with prediction\nerror by decomposing the latter into random and systematic errors, and showing\nthat the former is equivalent to the variance of the random error. In addition,\nwe observe that current methods unnecessarily compromise performance by\nmodifying the model and training loss to estimate the target and uncertainty\njointly.

However, our measurement results uncover multiple\nsecurity limitations of the deepfake detection methods in adversarial settings.\nFirst, we find that an attacker can evade a face extractor, i.e., the face\nextractor fails to extract the correct face regions, via adding small Gaussian\nnoise to its deepfake images. Second, we find that a face classifier trained\nusing deepfakes generated by one method cannot detect deepfakes generated by\nanother method, i.e., an attacker can evade detection via generating deepfakes\nusing a new method. Third, we find that an attacker can leverage backdoor\nattacks developed by the adversarial machine learning community to evade a face\nclassifier. Our results highlight that deepfake detection should consider the\nadversarial nature of the problem.",

          "description": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between humans\nand machines by translating brain activity into control commands. EEG is one of\nthe most common sources of neural signals because of its inexpensive and\nnon-invasive nature. However, interpretation of EEG signals is non-trivial\nbecause EEG signals have a low spatial resolution and are often distorted with\nnoise and artifacts. Therefore, it is possible that meaningful patterns for\nclassifying EEG signals are deeply hidden. Nowadays, state-of-the-art\ndeep-learning algorithms have proven to be quite efficient in learning hidden,\nmeaningful patterns. However, the performance of the deep learning algorithms\ndepends upon the quality and the amount of the provided training data. Hence, a\nbetter input formation (feature extraction) technique and a generative model to\nproduce high-quality data can enable the deep learning algorithms to adapt high\ngeneralization quality. In this study, we proposed a novel input formation\n(feature extraction) method in conjunction with a novel deep learning based\ngenerative model to harness new training examples. The feature vectors are\nextracted using a modified Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) called\nanchored-STFT. Anchored-STFT, inspired by wavelet transform, tries to minimize\nthe tradeoff between time and frequency resolution. As a result, it extracts\nthe inputs (feature vectors) with better time and frequency resolution compared\nto the standard STFT. Secondly, we introduced a novel generative adversarial\ndata augmentation technique called gradient norm adversarial augmentation\n(GNAA) for generating more training data. Thirdly, we investigated the\nexistence and significance of adversarial inputs in EEG data. Our approach\nobtained the kappa value of 0.814 for BCI competition II dataset III and 0.755\nfor BCI competition IV dataset 2b for session-to-session transfer on test data.",

Our theoretical results indicate\nthat, for any sample size in the target domain, the proposed TLCp estimator\nperforms better than the Cp estimator by the mean squared error (MSE) metric in\nthe case of orthogonal predictors, provided that i) the dissimilarity between\nthe tasks from source domain and target domain is small, and ii) the procedure\nparameters (complexity penalties) are tuned according to certain explicit\nrules. Moreover, we show that our transfer learning framework can be extended\nto other feature selection criteria, such as the Bayesian information\ncriterion. By analyzing the solution of the orthogonalized Cp, we identify an\nestimator that asymptotically approximates the solution of the Cp criterion in\nthe case of non-orthogonal predictors.

          "description": "Inverse problems are notoriously difficult to solve because they can have no\nsolutions, multiple solutions, or have solutions that vary significantly in\nresponse to small perturbations in measurements. Bayesian inference, which\nposes an inverse problem as a stochastic inference problem, addresses these\ndifficulties and provides quantitative estimates of the inferred field and the\nassociated uncertainty. However, it is difficult to employ when inferring\nvectors of large dimensions, and/or when prior information is available through\npreviously acquired samples. In this paper, we describe how deep generative\nadversarial networks can be used to represent the prior distribution in\nBayesian inference and overcome these challenges. We apply these ideas to\ninverse problems that are diverse in terms of the governing physical\nprinciples, sources of prior knowledge, type of measurement, and the extent of\navailable information about measurement noise.

          "description": "There is significant interest in learning and optimizing a complex system\ncomposed of multiple sub-components, where these components may be agents or\nautonomous sensors. Among the rich literature on this topic, agent-based and\ndomain-specific simulations can capture complex dynamics and subgroup\ninteraction, but optimizing over such simulations can be computationally and\nalgorithmically challenging. Bayesian approaches, such as Gaussian processes\n(GPs), can be used to learn a computationally tractable approximation to the\nunderlying dynamics but typically neglect the detailed information about\nsubgroups in the complicated system. We attempt to find the best of both worlds\nby proposing the idea of decomposed feedback, which captures group-based\nheterogeneity and dynamics. We introduce a novel decomposed GP regression to\nincorporate the subgroup decomposed feedback. Our modified regression has\nprovably lower variance -- and thus a more accurate posterior -- compared to\nprevious approaches; it also allows us to introduce a decomposed GP-UCB\noptimization algorithm that leverages subgroup feedback. The Bayesian nature of\nour method makes the optimization algorithm trackable with a theoretical\nguarantee on convergence and no-regret property.

          "description": "Partition of unity networks (POU-Nets) have been shown capable of realizing\nalgebraic convergence rates for regression and solution of PDEs, but require\nempirical tuning of training parameters. We enrich POU-Nets with a Gaussian\nnoise model to obtain a probabilistic generalization amenable to gradient-based\nminimization of a maximum likelihood loss. The resulting architecture provides\nspatial representations of both noiseless and noisy data as Gaussian mixtures\nwith closed form expressions for variance which provides an estimator of local\nerror. The training process yields remarkably sharp partitions of input space\nbased upon correlation of function values. This classification of training\npoints is amenable to a hierarchical refinement strategy that significantly\nimproves the localization of the regression, allowing for higher-order\npolynomial approximation to be utilized. The framework scales more favorably to\nlarge data sets as compared to Gaussian process regression and allows for\nspatially varying uncertainty, leveraging the expressive power of deep neural\nnetworks while bypassing expensive training associated with other probabilistic\ndeep learning methods. Compared to standard deep neural networks, the framework\ndemonstrates hp-convergence without the use of regularizers to tune the\nlocalization of partitions. We provide benchmarks quantifying performance in\nhigh/low-dimensions, demonstrating that convergence rates depend only on the\nlatent dimension of data within high-dimensional space.

          "description": "Active search is a learning paradigm where we seek to identify as many\nmembers of a rare, valuable class as possible given a labeling budget. Previous\nwork on active search has assumed access to a faithful (and expensive) oracle\nreporting experimental results. However, some settings offer access to cheaper\nsurrogates such as computational simulation that may aid in the search. We\npropose a model of multifidelity active search, as well as a novel,\ncomputationally efficient policy for this setting that is motivated by\nstate-of-the-art classical policies. Our policy is nonmyopic and budget aware,\nallowing for a dynamic tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.

          "description": "Large-scale pretrained language models have led to dramatic improvements in\ntext generation. Impressive performance can be achieved by finetuning only on a\nsmall number of instances (few-shot setting). Nonetheless, almost all previous\nwork simply applies random sampling to select the few-shot training instances.\nLittle to no attention has been paid to the selection strategies and how they\nwould affect model performance. In this work, we present a study on training\ninstance selection in few-shot neural text generation. The selection decision\nis made based only on the unlabeled data so as to identify the most worthwhile\ndata points that should be annotated under some budget of labeling cost. Based\non the intuition that the few-shot training instances should be diverse and\nrepresentative of the entire data distribution, we propose a simple selection\nstrategy with K-means clustering. We show that even with the naive\nclustering-based approach, the generation models consistently outperform random\nsampling on three text generation tasks: data-to-text generation, document\nsummarization and question generation. We hope that this work will call for\nmore attention on this largely unexplored area.",

However, it has received relatively little attention in the\nbroader ML community, as compared to point anomalies or other types of single\ninstance outliers. One reason for this is the lack of powerful benchmark\ndatasets.

We show by superimposing several patterns onto one\nphysical object, a DNN becomes confused and picks one of the patterns to assign\na class label. Our experiment with three flapping wing robots demonstrates the\npossibility of developing an adversarial camouflage to cause a targeted mistake\nby DNN.

We\nstudy adversarial examples for vision and language models, which typically\nadopt an encoder-decoder framework consisting of two major components: a\nConvolutional Neural Network (i.e., CNN) for image feature extraction and a\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) for caption generation. In particular, we\ninvestigate attacks on the visual encoder's hidden layer that is fed to the\nsubsequent recurrent network. The existing methods either attack the\nclassification layer of the visual encoder or they back-propagate the gradients\nfrom the language model. In contrast, we propose a GAN-based algorithm for\ncrafting adversarial examples for neural image captioning that mimics the\ninternal representation of the CNN such that the resulting deep features of the\ninput image enable a controlled incorrect caption generation through the\nrecurrent network. Our contribution provides new insights for understanding\nadversarial attacks on vision systems with language component. The proposed\nmethod employs two strategies for a comprehensive evaluation. The first\nexamines if a neural image captioning system can be misled to output targeted\nimage captions. The second analyzes the possibility of keywords into the\npredicted captions. Experiments show that our algorithm can craft effective\nadversarial images based on the CNN hidden layers to fool captioning framework.\nMoreover, we discover the proposed attack to be highly transferable.

While there exists a solid understanding of the conditions\nunder which cross-layer inferences are allowed from observations to\ninterventions, the results are somewhat scarcer when targeting counterfactual\nquantities. In this paper, we study the identification of nested\ncounterfactuals from an arbitrary combination of observations and experiments.\nSpecifically, building on a more explicit definition of nested counterfactuals,\nwe prove the counterfactual unnesting theorem (CUT), which allows one to map\narbitrary nested counterfactuals to unnested ones.

Second, we introduce a\nsufficient and necessary graphical condition for counterfactual identification\nfrom an arbitrary combination of observational and experimental distributions.\nLastly, we develop an efficient and complete algorithm for identifying nested\ncounterfactuals; failure of the algorithm returning an expression for a query\nimplies it is not identifiable.",

          "description": "We introduce the Particle Convolution Network (PCN), a new type of\nequivariant neural network layer suitable for many tasks in jet physics. The\nparticle convolution layer can be viewed as an extension of Deep Sets and\nEnergy Flow network architectures, in which the permutation-invariant operator\nis promoted to a group convolution. While the PCN can be implemented for\nvarious kinds of symmetries, we consider the specific case of rotation about\nthe jet axis the $\\eta - \\phi$ plane. In two standard benchmark tasks, q/g\ntagging and top tagging, we show that the rotational PCN (rPCN) achieves\nperformance comparable to graph networks such as ParticleNet. Moreover, we show\nthat it is possible to implement an IRC-safe rPCN, which significantly\noutperforms existing IRC-safe tagging methods on both tasks. We speculate that\nby generalizing the PCN to include additional convolutional symmetries relevant\nto jet physics, it may outperform the current state-of-the-art set by graph\nnetworks, while offering a new degree of control over physically-motivated\ninductive biases.",

Thus far, in silico metaphors have been dominated by concepts from\nneuroscience and cognitive psychology. In this paper we introduce a different\ntype of biomimetic model, one that borrows concepts from the immune system, for\ndesigning robust deep neural networks. This immuno-mimetic model leads to a new\ncomputational biology framework for robustification of deep neural networks\nagainst adversarial attacks. Within this Immuno-Net framework we define a\nrobust adaptive immune-inspired learning system (Immuno-Net RAILS) that\nemulates, in silico, the adaptive biological mechanisms of B-cells that are\nused to defend a mammalian host against pathogenic attacks. When applied to\nimage classification tasks on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that\nImmuno-net RAILS results in improvement of as much as 12.5% in adversarial\naccuracy of a baseline method, the DkNN-robustified CNN, without appreciable\nloss of accuracy on clean data.",

          "description": "The success of software crowdsourcing depends on active and trustworthy pool\nof worker supply. The uncertainty of crowd workers' behaviors makes it\nchallenging to predict workers' success and plan accordingly. In a competitive\ncrowdsourcing marketplace, competition for success over shared tasks adds\nanother layer of uncertainty in crowd workers' decision-making process.\nPreliminary analysis on software worker behaviors reveals an alarming task\ndropping rate of 82.9%. These factors lead to the need for an automated\nrecommendation system for CSD workers to improve the visibility and\npredictability of their success in the competition. To that end, this paper\nproposes a collaborative recommendation system for crowd workers. The proposed\nrecommendation system method uses five input metrics based on workers'\ncollaboration history in the pool, workers' preferences in taking tasks in\nterms of monetary prize and duration, workers' specialty, and workers'\nproficiency. The proposed method then recommends the most suitable tasks for a\nworker to compete on based on workers' probability of success in the task.\nExperimental results on 260 active crowd workers demonstrate that just\nfollowing the top three success probabilities of task recommendations, workers\ncan achieve success up to 86%",

However, differences between the\nperformances of the two scores in the earlier studies may be attributed to the\nfact that they used approximate learning algorithms, not exact ones. This paper\ncompares the classification accuracies of BNs with approximate learning using\nCLL to those with exact learning using ML. The results demonstrate that the\nclassification accuracies of BNs obtained by maximizing the ML are higher than\nthose obtained by maximizing the CLL for large data. However, the results also\ndemonstrate that the classification accuracies of exact learning BNs using the\nML are much worse than those of other methods when the sample size is small and\nthe class variable has numerous parents. To resolve the problem, we propose an\nexact learning augmented naive Bayes classifier (ANB), which ensures a class\nvariable with no parents.

In this paper, we present\nEVent-triggered Augmented Refitting of Gaussian Process Regression for Seasonal\nData (EVARS-GPR), a novel online algorithm that is able to handle sudden shifts\nin the target variable scale of seasonal data. For this purpose, EVARS-GPR\ncom-bines online change point detection with a refitting of the prediction\nmodel using data augmentation for samples prior to a change point. Our\nexperiments on sim-ulated data show that EVARS-GPR is applicable for a wide\nrange of output scale changes. EVARS-GPR has on average a 20.8 % lower RMSE on\ndifferent real-world datasets compared to methods with a similar computational\nresource con-sumption. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm leads to a\nsix-fold reduction of the averaged runtime in relation to all comparison\npartners with a periodical refitting strategy. In summary, we present a\ncomputationally efficient online fore-casting algorithm for seasonal time\nseries with changes of the target variable scale and demonstrate its\nfunctionality on simulated as well as real-world data.

This improves\nthe expressiveness and greatly eases the learning compared to Gaussians used in\nthe literature. 2) We model the sequential dependency structure of parts via a\nTransformer, which is more powerful and easier to train compared to RNNs used\nin the literature. 3) We propose an effective heuristic parsing algorithm to\npre-train the prior.

          "description": "The universe is composed of galaxies that have diverse shapes. Once the\nstructure of a galaxy is determined, it is possible to obtain important\ninformation about its formation and evolution. Morphologically classifying\ngalaxies means cataloging them according to their visual appearance and the\nclassification is linked to the physical properties of the galaxy. A\nmorphological classification made through visual inspection is subject to\nbiases introduced by subjective observations made by human volunteers. For this\nreason, systematic, objective and easily reproducible classification of\ngalaxies has been gaining importance since the astronomer Edwin Hubble created\nhis famous classification method. In this work, we combine accurate visual\nclassifications of the Galaxy Zoo project with \\emph {Deep Learning} methods.\nThe goal is to find an efficient technique at human performance level\nclassification, but in a systematic and automatic way, for classification of\nelliptical and spiral galaxies. For this, a neural network model was created\nthrough an Ensemble of four other convolutional models, allowing a greater\naccuracy in the classification than what would be obtained with any one\nindividual. Details of the individual models and improvements made are also\ndescribed. The present work is entirely based on the analysis of images (not\nparameter tables) from DR1 (www.datalab.noao.edu) of the Southern Photometric\nLocal Universe Survey (S-PLUS).

          "description": "Any clustering algorithm must synchronously learn to model the clusters and\nallocate data to those clusters in the absence of labels. Mixture model-based\nmethods model clusters with pre-defined statistical distributions and allocate\ndata to those clusters based on the cluster likelihoods. They iteratively\nrefine those distribution parameters and member assignments following the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. However, the cluster representability\nof such hand-designed distributions that employ a limited amount of parameters\nis not adequate for most real-world clustering tasks. In this paper, we realize\nmixture model-based clustering with a neural network where the final layer\nneurons, with the aid of an additional transformation, approximate cluster\ndistribution outputs. The network parameters pose as the parameters of those\ndistributions. The result is an elegant, much-generalized representation of\nclusters than a restricted mixture of hand-designed distributions. We train the\nnetwork end-to-end via batch-wise EM iterations where the forward pass acts as\nthe E-step and the backward pass acts as the M-step. In image clustering, the\nmixture-based EM objective can be used as the clustering objective along with\nexisting representation learning methods. In particular, we show that when\nmixture-EM optimization is fused with consistency optimization, it improves the\nsole consistency optimization performance in clustering.

The time complexity is\nreduced from cubic to quadratic in (latent) feature dimensions via a dedicated\nalgorithm design for subproblems that enhances them utilizing iterative\nquadratic approximations and backtracking. Finally, we provide the first proof\nof global convergence for an ADMM-based method (dlADMM) in a deep neural\nnetwork problem under mild conditions. Experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrated that our proposed dlADMM algorithm outperforms most of the\ncomparison methods.",

          "description": "In many real-world problems, we want to infer some property of an expensive\nblack-box function $f$, given a budget of $T$ function evaluations. One example\nis budget constrained global optimization of $f$, for which Bayesian\noptimization is a popular method. Other properties of interest include local\noptima, level sets, integrals, or graph-structured information induced by $f$.\nOften, we can find an algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$ to compute the desired property,\nbut it may require far more than $T$ queries to execute. Given such an\n$\\mathcal{A}$, and a prior distribution over $f$, we refer to the problem of\ninferring the output of $\\mathcal{A}$ using $T$ evaluations as Bayesian\nAlgorithm Execution (BAX). To tackle this problem, we present a procedure,\nInfoBAX, that sequentially chooses queries that maximize mutual information\nwith respect to the algorithm's output. Applying this to Dijkstra's algorithm,\nfor instance, we infer shortest paths in synthetic and real-world graphs with\nblack-box edge costs. Using evolution strategies, we yield variants of Bayesian\noptimization that target local, rather than global, optima. On these problems,\nInfoBAX uses up to 500 times fewer queries to $f$ than required by the original\nalgorithm. Our method is closely connected to other Bayesian optimal\nexperimental design procedures such as entropy search methods and optimal\nsensor placement using Gaussian processes.",

          "description": "Various non-trivial spaces are becoming popular for embedding structured data\nsuch as graphs, texts, or images. Following spherical and hyperbolic spaces,\nmore general product spaces have been proposed. However, searching for the best\nconfiguration of product space is a resource-intensive procedure, which reduces\nthe practical applicability of the idea. We generalize the concept of product\nspace and introduce an overlapping space that does not have the configuration\nsearch problem. The main idea is to allow subsets of coordinates to be shared\nbetween spaces of different types (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical). As a\nresult, parameter optimization automatically learns the optimal configuration.\nAdditionally, overlapping spaces allow for more compact representations since\ntheir geometry is more complex. Our experiments confirm that overlapping spaces\noutperform the competitors in graph embedding tasks. Here, we consider both\ndistortion setup, where the aim is to preserve distances, and ranking setup,\nwhere the relative order should be preserved. The proposed method effectively\nsolves the problem and outperforms the competitors in both settings. We also\nperform an empirical analysis in a realistic information retrieval task, where\nwe compare all spaces by incorporating them into DSSM. In this case, the\nproposed overlapping space consistently achieves nearly optimal results without\nany configuration tuning. This allows for reducing training time, which can be\nsignificant in large-scale applications.",

In this context, we provide two\ndistinct contributions. First, we use a Noise Contrastive approach to motivate\na family of surrogate loss functions, based on viewing non-optimal solutions as\nnegative examples. Second, we address a major bottleneck of all\npredict-and-optimize approaches, i.e. the need to frequently recompute optimal\nsolutions at training time. This is done via a solver-agnostic solution caching\nscheme, and by replacing optimization calls with a lookup in the solution\ncache. The method is formally based on an inner approximation of the feasible\nspace and, combined with a cache lookup strategy, provides a controllable\ntrade-off between training time and accuracy of the loss approximation. We\nempirically show that even a very slow growth rate is enough to match the\nquality of state-of-the-art methods, at a fraction of the computational cost.",

          "description": "In many coordination problems, independently reasoning humans are able to\ndiscover mutually compatible policies. In contrast, independently trained\nself-play policies are often mutually incompatible. Zero-shot coordination\n(ZSC) has recently been proposed as a new frontier in multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning to address this fundamental issue. Prior work approaches the ZSC\nproblem by assuming players can agree on a shared learning algorithm but not on\nlabels for actions and observations, and proposes other-play as an optimal\nsolution. However, until now, this \"label-free\" problem has only been\ninformally defined. We formalize this setting as the label-free coordination\n(LFC) problem by defining the label-free coordination game. We show that\nother-play is not an optimal solution to the LFC problem as it fails to\nconsistently break ties between incompatible maximizers of the other-play\nobjective. We introduce an extension of the algorithm, other-play with\ntie-breaking, and prove that it is optimal in the LFC problem and an\nequilibrium in the LFC game. Since arbitrary tie-breaking is precisely what the\nZSC setting aims to prevent, we conclude that the LFC problem does not reflect\nthe aims of ZSC. To address this, we introduce an alternative informal\noperationalization of ZSC as a starting point for future work.",

While orthopantomogram is a first-line tool for\ndental examinations, no existing work has explored the summarization of\nfindings from it. A finding summary has to find teeth in the imaging study and\nlabel the teeth with several types of past treatments. To tackle the problem,\nwe developDeepOPG that breaks the summarization process into functional\nsegmentation and tooth localization, the latter of which is further refined by\na novel dental coherence module. We also leverage weak supervision labels to\nimprove detection results in a reinforcement learning scenario. Experiments\nshow high efficacy of DeepOPG on finding summarization, achieving an overall\nAUC of 88.2% in detecting six types of findings. The proposed dental coherence\nand weak supervision both are shown to improve DeepOPG by adding 5.9% and 0.4%\nto AP@IoU=0.5.",

          "description": "We consider a set-valued online prediction problem in the context of network\ncaching. Assume that multiple users are connected to several caches via a\nbipartite network. At any time slot, each user requests an arbitrary file\nchosen from a large catalog. A user's request at a slot is met if the requested\nfile is cached in at least one of the caches connected to the user. Our\nobjective is to predict, prefetch, and optimally distribute the files on the\ncaches to maximize the total number of cache hits in an online setting. The\nproblem is non-trivial due to the non-convex and non-smooth nature of the\nobjective function. In this paper, we propose $\\texttt{LeadCache}$ - an online\ncaching policy based on the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader paradigm. We show that\nthe policy is regret-optimal up to a factor of $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/8}),$ where $n$\nis the number of users. We design two efficient implementations of the\n$\\texttt{LeadCache}$ policy, one based on Pipage rounding and the other based\non Madow's sampling, each of which makes precisely one call to an LP-solver per\niteration. With a Strong-Law-type assumption, we show that the total number of\nfile fetches under $\\texttt{LeadCache}$ remains almost surely finite over an\ninfinite horizon. Finally, we derive a tight regret lower bound using results\nfrom graph coloring. We conclude that the learning-based $\\texttt{LeadCache}$\npolicy decisively outperforms the known caching policies both theoretically and\nempirically.",

          "description": "Any spatio-temporal movement or reorientation of the hand, done with the\nintention of conveying a specific meaning, can be considered as a hand gesture.\nInputs to hand gesture recognition systems can be in several forms, such as\ndepth images, monocular RGB, or skeleton joint points. We observe that raw\ndepth images possess low contrasts in the hand regions of interest (ROI). They\ndo not highlight important details to learn, such as finger bending information\n(whether a finger is overlapping the palm, or another finger). Recently, in\ndeep-learning--based dynamic hand gesture recognition, researchers are tying to\nfuse different input modalities (e.g. RGB or depth images and hand skeleton\njoint points) to improve the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we focus on\ndynamic hand gesture (DHG) recognition using depth quantized image features and\nhand skeleton joint points. In particular, we explore the effect of using\ndepth-quantized features in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent\nNeural Network (RNN) based multi-modal fusion networks. We find that our method\nimproves existing results on the SHREC-DHG-14 dataset. Furthermore, using our\nmethod, we show that it is possible to reduce the resolution of the input\nimages by more than four times and still obtain comparable or better accuracy\nto that of the resolutions used in previous methods.",

          "description": "Since visual perception can give rich information beyond text descriptions\nfor world understanding, there has been increasing interest in leveraging\nvisual grounding for language learning. Recently, vokenization has attracted\nattention by using the predictions of a text-to-image retrieval model as labels\nfor language model supervision. Despite its success, the method suffers from\napproximation error of using finite image labels and the lack of vocabulary\ndiversity of a small image-text dataset. To overcome these limitations, we\npresent VidLanKD, a video-language knowledge distillation method for improving\nlanguage understanding. We train a multi-modal teacher model on a video-text\ndataset, and then transfer its knowledge to a student language model with a\ntext dataset. To avoid approximation error, we propose to use different\nknowledge distillation objectives. In addition, the use of a large-scale\nvideo-text dataset helps learn diverse and richer vocabularies. In our\nexperiments, VidLanKD achieves consistent improvements over text-only language\nmodels and vokenization models, on several downstream language understanding\ntasks including GLUE, SQuAD, and SWAG. We also demonstrate the improved world\nknowledge, physical reasoning, and temporal reasoning capabilities of our model\nby evaluating on the GLUE-diagnostics, PIQA, and TRACIE datasets. Lastly, we\npresent comprehensive ablation studies as well as visualizations of the learned\ntext-to-video grounding results of our teacher and student language models.

          "description": "Hyperspectral pansharpening aims to synthesize a low-resolution hyperspectral\nimage (LR-HSI) with a registered panchromatic image (PAN) to generate an\nenhanced HSI with high spectral and spatial resolution. Recently proposed HS\npansharpening methods have obtained remarkable results using deep convolutional\nnetworks (ConvNets), which typically consist of three steps: (1) up-sampling\nthe LR-HSI, (2) predicting the residual image via a ConvNet, and (3) obtaining\nthe final fused HSI by adding the outputs from first and second steps. Recent\nmethods have leveraged Deep Image Prior (DIP) to up-sample the LR-HSI due to\nits excellent ability to preserve both spatial and spectral information,\nwithout learning from large data sets. However, we observed that the quality of\nup-sampled HSIs can be further improved by introducing an additional\nspatial-domain constraint to the conventional spectral-domain energy function.\nWe define our spatial-domain constraint as the $L_1$ distance between the\npredicted PAN image and the actual PAN image. To estimate the PAN image of the\nup-sampled HSI, we also propose a learnable spectral response function (SRF).\nMoreover, we noticed that the residual image between the up-sampled HSI and the\nreference HSI mainly consists of edge information and very fine structures. In\norder to accurately estimate fine information, we propose a novel over-complete\nnetwork, called HyperKite, which focuses on learning high-level features by\nconstraining the receptive from increasing in the deep layers. We perform\nexperiments on three HSI datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our\nDIP-HyperKite over the state-of-the-art pansharpening methods. The deployment\ncodes, pre-trained models, and final fusion outputs of our DIP-HyperKite and\nthe methods used for the comparisons will be publicly made available at\nhttps://github.com/wgcban/DIP-HyperKite.git.",

We show that ado agents trained in this\nfashion are better than traditional falsification or testing techniques because\nthey can generalize to ego agents and environments that differ from the\noriginal ego agent.

In this work, we propose ActNN, a memory-efficient\ntraining framework that stores randomly quantized activations for back\npropagation. We prove the convergence of ActNN for general network\narchitectures, and we characterize the impact of quantization on the\nconvergence via an exact expression for the gradient variance. Using our\ntheory, we propose novel mixed-precision quantization strategies that exploit\nthe activation's heterogeneity across feature dimensions, samples, and layers.\nThese techniques can be readily applied to existing dynamic graph frameworks,\nsuch as PyTorch, simply by substituting the layers. We evaluate ActNN on\nmainstream computer vision models for classification, detection, and\nsegmentation tasks. On all these tasks, ActNN compresses the activation to 2\nbits on average, with negligible accuracy loss. ActNN reduces the memory\nfootprint of the activation by 12x, and it enables training with a 6.6x to 14x\nlarger batch size.",

          "description": "We address the problem of teaching a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent\nto follow instructions in multi-task environments. Instructions are expressed\nin a well-known formal language -- linear temporal logic (LTL) -- and can\nspecify a diversity of complex, temporally extended behaviours, including\nconditionals and alternative realizations. Our proposed learning approach\nexploits the compositional syntax and the semantics of LTL, enabling our RL\nagent to learn task-conditioned policies that generalize to new instructions,\nnot observed during training. To reduce the overhead of learning LTL semantics,\nwe introduce an environment-agnostic LTL pretraining scheme which improves\nsample-efficiency in downstream environments. Experiments on discrete and\ncontinuous domains target combinatorial task sets of up to $\\sim10^{39}$ unique\ntasks and demonstrate the strength of our approach in learning to solve\n(unseen) tasks, given LTL instructions.",

          "description": "Due to a high heterogeneity in pose and size and to a limited number of\navailable data, segmentation of pediatric images is challenging for deep\nlearning methods. In this work, we propose a new CNN architecture that is pose\nand scale invariant thanks to the use of Spatial Transformer Network (STN). Our\narchitecture is composed of three sequential modules that are estimated\ntogether during training: (i) a regression module to estimate a similarity\nmatrix to normalize the input image to a reference one; (ii) a differentiable\nmodule to find the region of interest to segment; (iii) a segmentation module,\nbased on the popular UNet architecture, to delineate the object. Unlike the\noriginal UNet, which strives to learn a complex mapping, including pose and\nscale variations, from a finite training dataset, our segmentation module\nlearns a simpler mapping focusing on images with normalized pose and size.\nFurthermore, the use of an automatic bounding box detection through STN allows\nsaving time and especially memory, while keeping similar performance. We test\nthe proposed method in kidney and renal tumor segmentation on abdominal\npediatric CT scanners. Results indicate that the estimated STN homogenization\nof size and pose accelerates the segmentation (25h), compared to standard\ndata-augmentation (33h), while obtaining a similar quality for the kidney\n(88.01\\% of Dice score) and improving the renal tumor delineation (from 85.52\\%\nto 87.12\\%).",

However, the performance of existing\nGNNs would decrease significantly when they stack many layers, because of the\nover-smoothing issue. Node embeddings tend to converge to similar vectors when\nGNNs keep recursively aggregating the representations of neighbors. To enable\ndeep GNNs, several methods have been explored recently. But they are developed\nfrom either techniques in convolutional neural networks or heuristic\nstrategies. There is no generalizable and theoretical principle to guide the\ndesign of deep GNNs. To this end, we analyze the bottleneck of deep GNNs by\nleveraging the Dirichlet energy of node embeddings, and propose a generalizable\nprinciple to guide the training of deep GNNs. Based on it, a novel deep GNN\nframework -- EGNN is designed. It could provide lower and upper constraints in\nterms of Dirichlet energy at each layer to avoid over-smoothing.

It is thus natural\nto investigate potentially game changing technologies such as quantum annealers\nto augment the capabilities of deep learning. In this work, we explore binary\nneural networks, which are lightweight yet powerful models typically intended\nfor resource constrained devices. Departing from current training regimes for\nbinary networks that smooth/approximate the activation functions to make the\nnetwork differentiable, we devise a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization\nformulation for the training problem. While the problem is intractable, i.e.,\nthe cost to estimate the binary weights scales exponentially with network size,\nwe show how the problem can be optimized directly on a quantum annealer,\nthereby opening up to the potential gains of quantum computing.

In the literature, the gradient temporal\ndifference (GTD) learning method has been adopted to evaluate GVFs in the\noff-policy setting, but such an approach may suffer from a large estimation\nerror even if the function approximation class is sufficiently expressive.\nMoreover, none of the previous work have formally established the convergence\nguarantee to the ground truth GVFs under the function approximation settings.\nIn this paper, we address both issues through the lens of a class of GVFs with\ncausal filtering, which cover a wide range of RL applications such as reward\nvariance, value gradient, cost in anomaly detection, stationary distribution\ngradient, etc. We propose a new algorithm called GenTD for off-policy GVFs\nevaluation and show that GenTD learns multiple interrelated multi-dimensional\nGVFs as efficiently as a single canonical scalar value function. We further\nshow that unlike GTD, the learned GVFs by GenTD are guaranteed to converge to\nthe ground truth GVFs as long as the function approximation power is\nsufficiently large.

          "description": "Tabular generative adversarial networks (TGAN) have recently emerged to cater\nto the need of synthesizing tabular data -- the most widely used data format.\nWhile synthetic tabular data offers the advantage of complying with privacy\nregulations, there still exists a risk of privacy leakage via inference attacks\ndue to interpolating the properties of real data during training. Differential\nprivate (DP) training algorithms provide theoretical guarantees for training\nmachine learning models by injecting statistical noise to prevent privacy\nleaks. However, the challenges of applying DP on TGAN are to determine the most\noptimal framework (i.e., PATE/DP-SGD) and neural network (i.e.,\nGenerator/Discriminator)to inject noise such that the data utility is well\nmaintained under a given privacy guarantee. In this paper, we propose DTGAN, a\nnovel conditional Wasserstein tabular GAN that comes in two variants DTGAN_G\nand DTGAN_D, for providing a detailed comparison of tabular GANs trained using\nDP-SGD for the generator vs discriminator, respectively. We elicit the privacy\nanalysis associated with training the generator with complex loss functions\n(i.e., classification and information losses) needed for high quality tabular\ndata synthesis. Additionally, we rigorously evaluate the theoretical privacy\nguarantees offered by DP empirically against membership and attribute inference\nattacks. Our results on 3 datasets show that the DP-SGD framework is superior\nto PATE and that a DP discriminator is more optimal for training convergence.\nThus, we find (i) DTGAN_D is capable of maintaining the highest data utility\nacross 4 ML models by up to 18% in terms of the average precision score for a\nstrict privacy budget, epsilon = 1, as compared to the prior studies and (ii)\nDP effectively prevents privacy loss against inference attacks by restricting\nthe success probability of membership attacks to be close to 50%.",

Such approaches have been demonstrated to result in\nmodels with feature representations that generalize better. However, limited\nworks have been done on adversarial training of models on graph data. In this\npaper, we raise such a question { does adversarial training improve the\ngeneralization of graph representations. We formulate L2 and L1 versions of\nadversarial training in two powerful node embedding methods: graph autoencoder\n(GAE) and variational graph autoencoder (VGAE). We conduct extensive\nexperiments on three main applications, i.e. link prediction, node clustering,\ngraph anomaly detection of GAE and VGAE, and demonstrate that both L2 and L1\nadversarial training boost the generalization of GAE and VGAE.",

In this paper, we propose a principled framework for\nadaptive RL, called AdaRL, that adapts reliably to changes across domains.\nSpecifically, we construct a generative environment model for the structural\nrelationships among variables in the system and embed the changes in a compact\nway, which provides a clear and interpretable picture for locating what and\nwhere the changes are and how to adapt. Based on the environment model, we\ncharacterize a minimal set of representations, including both domain-specific\nfactors and domain-shared state representations, that suffice for reliable and\nlow-cost transfer. Moreover, we show that by explicitly leveraging a compact\nrepresentation to encode changes, we can adapt the policy with only a few\nsamples without further policy optimization in the target domain.

          "description": "Motor disturbances can affect the interaction with dynamic objects, such as\ncatching a ball. A classification of clinical catching trials might give\ninsight into the existence of pathological alterations in the relation of arm\nand ball movements. Accurate, but also early decisions are required to classify\na catching attempt before the catcher's first ball contact. To obtain\nclinically valuable results, a significant decision confidence of at least 75%\nis required. Hence, three competing objectives have to be optimized at the same\ntime: accuracy, earliness and decision-making confidence. Here we propose a\ncoupled classification and prediction approach for early time series\nclassification: a predictive, generative recurrent neural network (RNN)\nforecasts the next data points of ball trajectories based on already available\nobservations; a discriminative RNN continuously generates classification\nguesses based on the available data points and the unrolled sequence\npredictions. We compare our approach, which we refer to as predictive\nsequential classification (PSC), to state-of-the-art sequence learners,\nincluding various RNN and temporal convolutional network (TCN) architectures.\nOn this hard real-world task we can consistently demonstrate the superiority of\nPSC over all other models in terms of accuracy and confidence with respect to\nearliness of recognition. Specifically, PSC is able to confidently classify the\nsuccess of catching trials as early as 123 milliseconds before the first ball\ncontact. We conclude that PSC is a promising approach for early time series\nclassification, when accurate and confident decisions are required.",

We model this as a\nstochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with side-information, where the\ninterventions correspond to the arms of the bandit instance. First, we propose\na simple regret minimization algorithm that takes as input a semi-Markovian\ncausal graph with atomic interventions and possibly unobservable variables, and\nachieves $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{M/T})$ expected simple regret, where $M$ is dependent\non the input CBN and could be very small compared to the number of arms. We\nalso show that this is almost optimal for CBNs described by causal graphs\nhaving an $n$-ary tree structure. Our simple regret minimization results, both\nupper and lower bound, subsume previous results in the literature, which\nassumed additional structural restrictions on the input causal graph. In\nparticular, our results indicate that the simple regret guarantee of our\nproposed algorithm can only be improved by considering more nuanced structural\nrestrictions on the causal graph. Next, we propose a cumulative regret\nminimization algorithm that takes as input a general causal graph with all\nobservable nodes and atomic interventions and performs better than the optimal\nMAB algorithm that does not take causal side-information into account. We also\nexperimentally compare both our algorithms with the best known algorithms in\nthe literature. To the best of our knowledge, this work gives the first simple\nand cumulative regret minimization algorithms for CBNs with general causal\ngraphs under atomic interventions and having unobserved confounders.",

          "description": "Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with surging interest\nin high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in this domain heavily relies on\nfaithful representation of the sparsity of subnetworks, which has been\ntraditionally computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct\nsparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize unpruned parameters\nthat detached from input or output layers of underlying subnetworks,\npotentially underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of\ninactivated connections. While this effect might be negligible for moderately\npruned networks (up to 10-100 compression rates), we find that it plays an\nincreasing role for thinner subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison between\ndifferent pruning algorithms. For example, we show that effective compression\nof a randomly pruned LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its\ndirect counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed when using SynFlow\nfor pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In this work, we adopt the lens of effective\nsparsity to reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common benchmark\narchitectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19, ResNet-18) and discover that their\nabsolute and relative performance changes dramatically in this new and more\nappropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than direct, sparsity, we\ndevelop a low-cost extension to most pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with\neffective sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that random\npruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across layers performs as well or\nbetter than more sophisticated algorithms for pruning at initialization [Su et\nal., 2020]. In response to this observation, using a simple analogy of pressure\ndistribution in coupled cylinders from physics, we design novel layerwise\nsparsity quotas that outperform all existing baselines in the context of random\npruning.",

          "description": "Drought is a serious natural disaster that has a long duration and a wide\nrange of influence. To decrease the drought-caused losses, drought prediction\nis the basis of making the corresponding drought prevention and disaster\nreduction measures. While this problem has been studied in the literature, it\nremains unknown whether drought can be precisely predicted or not with machine\nlearning models using weather data. To answer this question, a real-world\npublic dataset is leveraged in this study and different drought levels are\npredicted using the last 90 days of 18 meteorological indicators as the\npredictors. In a comprehensive approach, 16 machine learning models and 16 deep\nlearning models are evaluated and compared. The results show no single model\ncan achieve the best performance for all evaluation metrics simultaneously,\nwhich indicates the drought prediction problem is still challenging. As\nbenchmarks for further studies, the code and results are publicly available in\na Github repository.",

To capture external changes, the\nblack-box function is allowed to be time-varying within a reproducing kernel\nHilbert space (RKHS). To this end, we develop WGP-UCB, a novel UCB-type\nalgorithm based on weighted Gaussian process regression. A key challenge is how\nto cope with infinite-dimensional feature maps. To that end, we leverage kernel\napproximation techniques to prove a sublinear regret bound, which is the first\n(frequentist) sublinear regret guarantee on weighted time-varying bandits with\ngeneral nonlinear rewards. This result generalizes both non-stationary linear\nbandits and standard GP-UCB algorithms. Further, a novel concentration\ninequality is achieved for weighted Gaussian process regression with general\nweights. We also provide universal upper bounds and weight-dependent upper\nbounds for weighted maximum information gains.

To\napproach this problem, self-supervised learning provides a feasible solution\nfor graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level\nGraph Contrastive Learning (MLGCL) framework for learning robust representation\nof graph data by contrasting space views of graphs. Specifically, we introduce\na novel contrastive view - topological and feature space views. The original\ngraph is first-order approximation structure and contains uncertainty or error,\nwhile the $k$NN graph generated by encoding features preserves high-order\nproximity. Thus $k$NN graph generated by encoding features not only provide a\ncomplementary view, but is more suitable to GNN encoder to extract discriminant\nrepresentation. Furthermore, we develop a multi-level contrastive mode to\npreserve the local similarity and semantic similarity of graph-structured data\nsimultaneously.

          "description": "Fetal ultrasound screening during pregnancy plays a vital role in the early\ndetection of fetal malformations which have potential long-term health impacts.\nThe level of skill required to diagnose such malformations from live ultrasound\nduring examination is high and resources for screening are often limited. We\npresent an interpretable, atlas-learning segmentation method for automatic\ndiagnosis of Hypo-plastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) from a single `4 Chamber\nHeart' view image. We propose to extend the recently introduced\nImage-and-Spatial Transformer Networks (Atlas-ISTN) into a framework that\nenables sensitising atlas generation to disease. In this framework we can\njointly learn image segmentation, registration, atlas construction and disease\nprediction while providing a maximum level of clinical interpretability\ncompared to direct image classification methods. As a result our segmentation\nallows diagnoses competitive with expert-derived manual diagnosis and yields an\nAUC-ROC of 0.978 (1043 cases for training, 260 for validation and 325 for\ntesting).",

          "description": "Prostate segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a challenging\ntask. In recent years, several network architectures have been proposed to\nautomate this process and alleviate the burden of manual annotation. Although\nthe performance of these models has achieved promising results, there is still\nroom for improvement before these models can be used safely and effectively in\nclinical practice. One of the major challenges in prostate MR image\nsegmentation is the presence of class imbalance in the image labels where the\nbackground pixels dominate over the prostate. In the present work we propose a\nDL-based pipeline for cropping the region around the prostate from MRI images\nto produce a more balanced distribution of the foreground pixels (prostate) and\nthe background pixels and improve segmentation accuracy. The effect of\nDL-cropping for improving the segmentation performance compared to standard\ncenter-cropping is assessed using five popular DL networks for prostate\nsegmentation, namely U-net, U-net+, Res Unet++, Bridge U-net and Dense U-net.\nThe proposed smart-cropping outperformed the standard center cropping in terms\nof segmentation accuracy for all the evaluated prostate segmentation networks.\nIn terms of Dice score, the highest improvement was achieved for the U-net+ and\nResU-net++ architectures corresponding to 8.9% and 8%, respectively.",

          "description": "Many real-world systems can be expressed in temporal networks with nodes\nplaying far different roles in structure and function and edges representing\nthe relationships between nodes. Identifying critical nodes can help us control\nthe spread of public opinions or epidemics, predict leading figures in\nacademia, conduct advertisements for various commodities, and so on. However,\nit is rather difficult to identify critical nodes because the network structure\nchanges over time in temporal networks. In this paper, considering the sequence\ntopological information of temporal networks, a novel and effective learning\nframework based on the combination of special GCNs and RNNs is proposed to\nidentify nodes with the best spreading ability.

However,\nquestions regarding the theoretical basis for such approximations, including\nthe required network size, remain open. In this paper, we investigate the\nrepresentational power of neural networks for approximating solutions to linear\nelliptic PDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We prove that when a PDE's\ncoefficients are representable by small neural networks, the parameters\nrequired to approximate its solution scale polynomially with the input\ndimension $d$ and proportionally to the parameter counts of the coefficient\nnetworks. To this we end, we develop a proof technique that simulates gradient\ndescent (in an appropriate Hilbert space) by growing a neural network\narchitecture whose iterates each participate as sub-networks in their (slightly\nlarger) successors, and converge to the solution of the PDE. We bound the size\nof the solution, showing a polynomial dependence on $d$ and no dependence on\nthe volume of the domain.",

          "description": "Meta learning has attracted much attention recently in machine learning\ncommunity. Contrary to conventional machine learning aiming to learn inherent\nprediction rules to predict labels for new query data, meta learning aims to\nlearn the learning methodology for machine learning from observed tasks, so as\nto generalize to new query tasks by leveraging the meta-learned learning\nmethodology. In this study, we interpret such learning methodology as learning\nan explicit hyperparameter prediction policy shared by all training tasks.\nSpecifically, this policy is represented as a parameterized function called\nmeta-learner, mapping from a training/test task to its suitable hyperparameter\nsetting, extracted from a pre-specified function set called meta learning\nmachine. Such setting guarantees that the meta-learned learning methodology is\nable to flexibly fit diverse query tasks, instead of only obtaining fixed\nhyperparameters by many current meta learning methods, with less adaptability\nto query task's variations. Such understanding of meta learning also makes it\neasily succeed from traditional learning theory for analyzing its\ngeneralization bounds with general losses/tasks/models. The theory naturally\nleads to some feasible controlling strategies for ameliorating the quality of\nthe extracted meta-learner, verified to be able to finely ameliorate its\ngeneralization capability in some typical meta learning applications, including\nfew-shot regression, few-shot classification and domain generalization.",

          "description": "Hierarchical topic models such as the gamma belief network (GBN) have\ndelivered promising results in mining multi-layer document representations and\ndiscovering interpretable topic taxonomies. However, they often assume in the\nprior that the topics at each layer are independently drawn from the Dirichlet\ndistribution, ignoring the dependencies between the topics both at the same\nlayer and across different layers. To relax this assumption, we propose\nsawtooth factorial topic embedding guided GBN, a deep generative model of\ndocuments that captures the dependencies and semantic similarities between the\ntopics in the embedding space. Specifically, both the words and topics are\nrepresented as embedding vectors of the same dimension. The topic matrix at a\nlayer is factorized into the product of a factor loading matrix and a topic\nembedding matrix, the transpose of which is set as the factor loading matrix of\nthe layer above. Repeating this particular type of factorization, which shares\ncomponents between adjacent layers, leads to a structure referred to as\nsawtooth factorization. An auto-encoding variational inference network is\nconstructed to optimize the model parameter via stochastic gradient descent.\nExperiments on big corpora show that our models outperform other neural topic\nmodels on extracting deeper interpretable topics and deriving better document\nrepresentations.",

If the current exponential growth of computational\nconsumption persists, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will sadly become a\nconsiderable contributor to global warming.\n\nAt the heart of this problem are the measures that we use as a scientific\ncommunity to evaluate our work. Currently, researchers in the field of AI judge\nscientific works mostly based on the improvement in accuracy, log-likelihood,\nreconstruction or opinion scores, all of which entirely obliterates the actual\ncomputational cost of generative models.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce the idea of relying on a multi-objective measure\nbased on Pareto optimality, which simultaneously integrates the models\naccuracy, as well as the environmental impact of their training. By applying\nthis measure on the current state-of-the-art in generative audio models, we\nshow that this measure drastically changes the perceived significance of the\nresults in the field, encouraging optimal training techniques and resource\nallocation.

          "description": "With the widespread use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), machine learning\nalgorithms have evolved in two diverse directions -- one with ever-increasing\nconnection density for better accuracy and the other with more compact sizing\nfor energy efficiency. The increase in connection density increases on-chip\ndata movement, which makes efficient on-chip communication a critical function\nof the DNN accelerator. The contribution of this work is threefold. First, we\nillustrate that the point-to-point (P2P)-based interconnect is incapable of\nhandling a high volume of on-chip data movement for DNNs. Second, we evaluate\nP2P and network-on-chip (NoC) interconnect (with a regular topology such as a\nmesh) for SRAM- and ReRAM-based in-memory computing (IMC) architectures for a\nrange of DNNs. This analysis shows the necessity for the optimal interconnect\nchoice for an IMC DNN accelerator. Finally, we perform an experimental\nevaluation for different DNNs to empirically obtain the performance of the IMC\narchitecture with both NoC-tree and NoC-mesh. We conclude that, at the tile\nlevel, NoC-tree is appropriate for compact DNNs employed at the edge, and\nNoC-mesh is necessary to accelerate DNNs with high connection density.\nFurthermore, we propose a technique to determine the optimal choice of\ninterconnect for any given DNN. In this technique, we use analytical models of\nNoC to evaluate end-to-end communication latency of any given DNN. We\ndemonstrate that the interconnect optimization in the IMC architecture results\nin up to 6$\\times$ improvement in energy-delay-area product for VGG-19\ninference compared to the state-of-the-art ReRAM-based IMC architectures.",

          "description": "A compact, accurate, and bitwidth-programmable in-memory computing (IMC)\nstatic random-access memory (SRAM) macro, named CAP-RAM, is presented for\nenergy-efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) inference. It leverages a\nnovel charge-domain multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) mechanism and circuitry to\nachieve superior linearity under process variations compared to conventional\nIMC designs. The adopted semi-parallel architecture efficiently stores filters\nfrom multiple CNN layers by sharing eight standard 6T SRAM cells with one\ncharge-domain MAC circuit. Moreover, up to six levels of bit-width of weights\nwith two encoding schemes and eight levels of input activations are supported.\nA 7-bit charge-injection SAR (ciSAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) getting\nrid of sample and hold (S&H) and input/reference buffers further improves the\noverall energy efficiency and throughput. A 65-nm prototype validates the\nexcellent linearity and computing accuracy of CAP-RAM. A single 512x128 macro\nstores a complete pruned and quantized CNN model to achieve 98.8% inference\naccuracy on the MNIST data set and 89.0% on the CIFAR-10 data set, with a\n573.4-giga operations per second (GOPS) peak throughput and a 49.4-tera\noperations per second (TOPS)/W energy efficiency.",

One possible extension is the Fr\\'echet mean, the generalization of\nthe Euclidean mean; however, it has been difficult to apply because it lacks a\nclosed form with an easily computable derivative. In this paper, we show how to\ndifferentiate through the Fr\\'echet mean for arbitrary Riemannian manifolds.\nThen, focusing on hyperbolic space, we derive explicit gradient expressions and\na fast, accurate, and hyperparameter-free Fr\\'echet mean solver. This fully\nintegrates the Fr\\'echet mean into the hyperbolic neural network pipeline. To\ndemonstrate this integration, we present two case studies. First, we apply our\nFr\\'echet mean to the existing Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network,\nreplacing its projected aggregation to obtain state-of-the-art results on\ndatasets with high hyperbolicity. Second, to demonstrate the Fr\\'echet mean's\ncapacity to generalize Euclidean neural network operations, we develop a\nhyperbolic batch normalization method that gives an improvement parallel to the\none observed in the Euclidean setting.",

The approach combines an offline-trained fully-connected\nneural network with an online primal active set solver. The neural network\nprovides a control input initialization while the primal active set method\nensures recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. The neural network is\ntrained with a primal-dual loss function, aiming to generate control sequences\nthat are primal feasible and meet a desired level of suboptimality. Since the\nneural network alone does not guarantee constraint satisfaction, its output is\nused to warm start the primal active set method online. We demonstrate that\nthis approach scales to large problems with thousands of optimization\nvariables, which are challenging for current approaches.

In the framework, we first define\na feature vector $f(C)$ of a chemical graph $C$ and construct an ANN that maps\n$x=f(C)$ to a predicted value $\\eta(x)$ of a chemical property $\\pi$ to $C$.\nAfter this, we formulate an MILP that simulates the computation process of\n$f(C)$ from $C$ and that of $\\eta(x)$ from $x$. Given a target value $y^*$ of\nthe chemical property $\\pi$, we infer a chemical graph $C^\\dagger$ such that\n$\\eta(f(C^\\dagger))=y^*$ by solving the MILP. In this paper, we use linear\nregression to construct a prediction function $\\eta$ instead of ANNs. For this,\nwe derive an MILP formulation that simulates the computation process of a\nprediction function by linear regression.

Hitherto, the rationale for the\neffectiveness of these positional encodings has been solely studied through a\nFourier lens. In this paper, we strive to broaden this understanding by showing\nthat alternative non-Fourier embedding functions can indeed be used for\npositional encoding. Moreover, we show that their performance is entirely\ndetermined by a trade-off between the stable rank of the embedded matrix and\nthe distance preservation between embedded coordinates. We further establish\nthat the now ubiquitous Fourier feature mapping of position is a special case\nthat fulfills these conditions. Consequently, we present a more general theory\nto analyze positional encoding in terms of shifted basis functions. To this\nend, we develop the necessary theoretical formulae and empirically verify that\nour theoretical claims hold in practice.

          "description": "Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains.\nHowever, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as\nlong documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has\nquadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence\nlength. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an\nefficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear\ncomplexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range\nattention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a\nshort-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a\ndual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two\nattention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and\nbidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains,\nincluding the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and\nImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on\nenwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being\nfaster and is able to handle 3$\\times$ as long sequences compared to its\nfull-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the\nstate-of-the-art results~(e.g., Top-1 accuracy 84.1% trained on 224$\\times$224\nImageNet-1K only), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

In this paper, we expand by studying\npublications that apply supervised ML in a far broader spectrum of disciplines,\nfocusing on human-labeled data. We report to what extent a random sample of ML\napplication papers across disciplines give specific details about whether best\npractices were followed, while acknowledging that a greater range of\napplication fields necessarily produces greater diversity of labeling and\nannotation methods. Because much of machine learning research and education\nonly focuses on what is done once a \"ground truth\" or \"gold standard\" of\ntraining data is available, it is especially relevant to discuss issues around\nthe equally-important aspect of whether such data is reliable in the first\nplace.

          "description": "Humans and other intelligent animals evolved highly sophisticated perception\nsystems that combine multiple sensory modalities. On the other hand,\nstate-of-the-art artificial agents rely mostly on visual inputs or structured\nlow-dimensional observations provided by instrumented environments. Learning to\nact based on combined visual and auditory inputs is still a new topic of\nresearch that has not been explored beyond simple scenarios. To facilitate\nprogress in this area we introduce a new version of VizDoom simulator to create\na highly efficient learning environment that provides raw audio observations.\nWe study the performance of different model architectures in a series of tasks\nthat require the agent to recognize sounds and execute instructions given in\nnatural language. Finally, we train our agent to play the full game of Doom and\nfind that it can consistently defeat a traditional vision-based adversary.

          "description": "We address the problem of solving complex bimanual robot manipulation tasks\non multiple objects with sparse rewards. Such complex tasks can be decomposed\ninto sub-tasks that are accomplishable by different robots concurrently or\nsequentially for better efficiency. While previous reinforcement learning\napproaches primarily focus on modeling the compositionality of sub-tasks, two\nfundamental issues are largely ignored particularly when learning cooperative\nstrategies for two robots: (i) domination, i.e., one robot may try to solve a\ntask by itself and leaves the other idle; (ii) conflict, i.e., one robot can\neasily interrupt another's workspace when executing different sub-tasks\nsimultaneously. To tackle these two issues, we propose a novel technique called\ndisentangled attention, which provides an intrinsic regularization for two\nrobots to focus on separate sub-tasks and objects. We evaluate our method on\nfour bimanual manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed\nintrinsic regularization successfully avoids domination and reduces conflicts\nfor the policies, which leads to significantly more effective cooperative\nstrategies than all the baselines.

Under one choice of prior, the SSVAE objective (i.e. the ELBO) is\nexactly equal to the mutual information (up to constants).

Instead, we show that good\ngeneralization may be instigated by bounded spectral products over layers\nleading to a novel geometric regularizer. It is revealed that in deep enough\nmodels such a regularizer enables both, extreme accuracy and generalization, to\nbe reached. We associate popular regularization techniques like weight decay,\ndrop out, batch normalization, and early stopping with this perspective. Backed\nup by theory we further demonstrate that \"generalization by design\" is\npractically possible and that good generalization may be encoded into the\nstructure of the network. We design two such easy-to-use structural\nregularizers that insert an additional \\textit{generalization layer} into a\nmodel architecture, one with a skip connection and another one with drop-out.\nWe verify our theoretical results in experiments on various feedforward and\nconvolutional architectures, including ResNets, and datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10,\nsynthetic data).

Specifically, we develop an\nunsupervised sequence learning system, SAGE, that leverages the temporal and\nprobabilistic dependence between alerts in a suffix-based probabilistic\ndeterministic finite automaton (S-PDFA) -- a model that accentuates infrequent\nsevere alerts and summarizes paths leading to them.

          "description": "We consider the problem of training robust and accurate deep neural networks\n(DNNs) when subject to various proportions of noisy labels. Large-scale\ndatasets tend to contain mislabeled samples that can be memorized by DNNs,\nimpeding the performance. With appropriate handling, this degradation can be\nalleviated. There are two problems to consider: how to distinguish clean\nsamples and how to deal with noisy samples. In this paper, we present Ensemble\nNoise-robust K-fold Cross-Validation Selection (E-NKCVS) to effectively select\nclean samples from noisy data, solving the first problem. For the second\nproblem, we create a new pseudo label for any sample determined to have an\nuncertain or likely corrupt label. E-NKCVS obtains multiple predicted labels\nfor each sample and the entropy of these labels is used to tune the weight\ngiven to the pseudo label and the given label. Theoretical analysis and\nextensive verification of the algorithms in the noisy label setting are\nprovided. We evaluate our approach on various image and text classification\ntasks where the labels have been manually corrupted with different noise\nratios. Additionally, two large real-world noisy datasets are also used,\nClothing-1M and WebVision.

          "description": "This report proposes a polyphonic sound event detection (SED) method for the\nDCASE 2021 Challenge Task 4. The proposed SED model consists of two stages: a\nmean-teacher model for providing target labels regarding weakly labeled or\nunlabeled data and a self-training-based noisy student model for predicting\nstrong labels for sound events. The mean-teacher model, which is based on the\nresidual convolutional recurrent neural network (RCRNN) for the teacher and\nstudent model, is first trained using all the training data from a weakly\nlabeled dataset, an unlabeled dataset, and a strongly labeled synthetic\ndataset. Then, the trained mean-teacher model predicts the strong label to each\nof the weakly labeled and unlabeled datasets, which is brought to the noisy\nstudent model in the second stage of the proposed SED model. Here, the\nstructure of the noisy student model is identical to the RCRNN-based student\nmodel of the mean-teacher model in the first stage. Then, it is self-trained by\nadding feature noises, such as time-frequency shift, mixup, SpecAugment, and\ndropout-based model noise. In addition, a semi-supervised loss function is\napplied to train the noisy student model, which acts as label noise injection.\nThe performance of the proposed SED model is evaluated on the validation set of\nthe DCASE 2021 Challenge Task 4, and then, several ensemble models that combine\nfive-fold validation models with different hyperparameters of the\nsemi-supervised loss function are finally selected as our final models.",

We\nargue that the majority of available data in the nature for Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), specifically Machine Learning (ML) are unlabeled. Hence,\nunsupervised and/or semi-supervised ML approaches are the practical choices.\nHowever, prior work in the literature of MDSE has considered supervised ML\napproaches, which only work with labeled training data. Our proposed approach\nis fully implemented and integrated with an existing state-of-the-art MDSE tool\nto serve the CPS/IoT domain. Moreover, we validate the proposed approach using\na portion of the open data of the REFIT reference dataset for the smart energy\nsystems domain. Our model-to-code transformations (code generators) provide the\nfull source code of the desired IoT services out of the model instances in an\nautomated manner. Currently, we generate the source code in Java and Python.\nThe Python code is responsible for the ML functionalities and uses the APIs of\nseveral ML libraries and frameworks, namely Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow.\nFor unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, the APIs of Scikit-Learn are\ndeployed. In addition to the pure MDSE approach, where certain ML methods,\ne.g., K-Means, Mini-Batch K-Means, DB-SCAN, Spectral Clustering, Gaussian\nMixture Model, Self-Training, Label Propagation and Label Spreading are\nsupported, a more flexible, hybrid approach is also enabled to support the\npractitioner in deploying a pre-trained ML model with any arbitrary\narchitecture and learning algorithm.",

However, we uncover a striking contrast to this promise: across 5\nmodels and 4 datasets on the task of visual question answering, a wide variety\nof active learning approaches fail to outperform random selection. To\nunderstand this discrepancy, we profile 8 active learning methods on a\nper-example basis, and identify the problem as collective outliers -- groups of\nexamples that active learning methods prefer to acquire but models fail to\nlearn (e.g., questions that ask about text in images or require external\nknowledge). Through systematic ablation experiments and qualitative\nvisualizations, we verify that collective outliers are a general phenomenon\nresponsible for degrading pool-based active learning. Notably, we show that\nactive learning sample efficiency increases significantly as the number of\ncollective outliers in the active learning pool decreases.

          "description": "Deep learning has advanced from fully connected architectures to structured\nmodels organized into components, e.g., the transformer composed of positional\nelements, modular architectures divided into slots, and graph neural nets made\nup of nodes. In structured models, an interesting question is how to conduct\ndynamic and possibly sparse communication among the separate components. Here,\nwe explore the hypothesis that restricting the transmitted information among\ncomponents to discrete representations is a beneficial bottleneck. The\nmotivating intuition is human language in which communication occurs through\ndiscrete symbols. Even though individuals have different understandings of what\na ``\"cat\" is based on their specific experiences, the shared discrete token\nmakes it possible for communication among individuals to be unimpeded by\nindividual differences in internal representation. To discretize the values of\nconcepts dynamically communicated among specialist components, we extend the\nquantization mechanism from the Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder to\nmulti-headed discretization with shared codebooks and use it for\ndiscrete-valued neural communication (DVNC). Our experiments show that DVNC\nsubstantially improves systematic generalization in a variety of architectures\n-- transformers, modular architectures, and graph neural networks. We also show\nthat the DVNC is robust to the choice of hyperparameters, making the method\nvery useful in practice. Moreover, we establish a theoretical justification of\nour discretization process, proving that it has the ability to increase noise\nrobustness and reduce the underlying dimensionality of the model.",

We\npropose DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning\nneural radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth\nsupervision. Our key insight is that sparse depth supervision can be used to\nregularize the learned geometry, a crucial component for effectively rendering\nnovel views using NeRF. We exploit the fact that current NeRF pipelines require\nimages with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running\nstructure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that\ncan be used as ``free\" depth supervision during training: we simply add a loss\nto ensure that depth rendered along rays that intersect these 3D points is\nclose to the observed depth. We find that DS-NeRF can render more accurate\nimages given fewer training views while training 2-6x faster. With only two\ntraining views on real-world images, DS-NeRF significantly outperforms NeRF as\nwell as other sparse-view variants. We show that our loss is compatible with\nthese NeRF models, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible\nsupervisory signal.

          "description": "When a robot performs a task next to a human, physical interaction is\ninevitable: the human might push, pull, twist, or guide the robot. The\nstate-of-the-art treats these interactions as disturbances that the robot\nshould reject or avoid. At best, these robots respond safely while the human\ninteracts; but after the human lets go, these robots simply return to their\noriginal behavior. We recognize that physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is\noften intentional -- the human intervenes on purpose because the robot is not\ndoing the task correctly. In this paper, we argue that when pHRI is intentional\nit is also informative: the robot can leverage interactions to learn how it\nshould complete the rest of its current task even after the person lets go. We\nformalize pHRI as a dynamical system, where the human has in mind an objective\nfunction they want the robot to optimize, but the robot does not get direct\naccess to the parameters of this objective -- they are internal to the human.\nWithin our proposed framework human interactions become observations about the\ntrue objective. We introduce approximations to learn from and respond to pHRI\nin real-time. We recognize that not all human corrections are perfect: often\nusers interact with the robot noisily, and so we improve the efficiency of\nrobot learning from pHRI by reducing unintended learning. Finally, we conduct\nsimulations and user studies on a robotic manipulator to compare our proposed\napproach to the state-of-the-art. Our results indicate that learning from pHRI\nleads to better task performance and improved human satisfaction.",

          "description": "Over the last few decades, artificial intelligence research has made\ntremendous strides, but it still heavily relies on fixed datasets in stationary\nenvironments. Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines\nhow AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data\nin the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as\ndeepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current\nmultimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can\ndetect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to\ntheir reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in\nthis work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks' learning dynamics,\nemphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose\nContinual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the\nconcept of Continual Learning (CoL), Representation Learning (ReL), and\nKnowledge Distillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain\nadaptation tasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets,\nwhile effectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student\nmodel setting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method\nis efficient at domain adaptation to detect low-quality deepfakes videos and\nGAN-generated images from several datasets, outperforming the-state-of-art\nbaseline methods.",

However, the number of possible drug combinations is so\nhuge that it is hard to screen synergistic drug combinations through wet-lab\nexperiments. Therefore, computational screening has become an important way to\nprioritize drug combinations. Graph neural network have recently shown\nremarkable performance in the prediction of compound-protein interactions, but\nit has not been applied to the screening of drug combinations. In this paper,\nwe proposed a deep learning model based on graph neural networks and attention\nmechanism to identify drug combinations that can effectively inhibit the\nviability of specific cancer cells. The feature embeddings of drug molecule\nstructure and gene expression profiles were taken as input to multi-layer\nfeedforward neural network to identify the synergistic drug combinations. We\ncompared DeepDDS with classical machine learning methods and other deep\nlearning-based methods on benchmark data set, and the leave-one-out\nexperimental results showed that DeepDDS achieved better performance than\ncompetitive methods. Also, on an independent test set released by well-known\npharmaceutical enterprise AstraZeneca, DeepDDS was superior to competitive\nmethods by more than 16\\% predictive precision. Furthermore, we explored the\ninterpretability of the graph attention network, and found the correlation\nmatrix of atomic features revealed important chemical substructures of drugs.\nWe believed that DeepDDS is an effective tool that prioritized synergistic drug\ncombinations for further wet-lab experiment validation.",

          "description": "A recurring theme in statistical learning, online learning, and beyond is\nthat faster convergence rates are possible for problems with low noise, often\nquantified by the performance of the best hypothesis; such results are known as\nfirst-order or small-loss guarantees. While first-order guarantees are\nrelatively well understood in statistical and online learning, adapting to low\nnoise in contextual bandits (and more broadly, decision making) presents major\nalgorithmic challenges. In a COLT 2017 open problem, Agarwal, Krishnamurthy,\nLangford, Luo, and Schapire asked whether first-order guarantees are even\npossible for contextual bandits and -- if so -- whether they can be attained by\nefficient algorithms. We give a resolution to this question by providing an\noptimal and efficient reduction from contextual bandits to online regression\nwith the logarithmic (or, cross-entropy) loss. Our algorithm is simple and\npractical, readily accommodates rich function classes, and requires no\ndistributional assumptions beyond realizability. In a large-scale empirical\nevaluation, we find that our approach typically outperforms comparable\nnon-first-order methods.\n\nOn the technical side, we show that the logarithmic loss and an\ninformation-theoretic quantity called the triangular discrimination play a\nfundamental role in obtaining first-order guarantees, and we combine this\nobservation with new refinements to the regression oracle reduction framework\nof Foster and Rakhlin. The use of triangular discrimination yields novel\nresults even for the classical statistical learning model, and we anticipate\nthat it will find broader use.",

          "description": "Sarcasm detection is the task of identifying irony containing utterances in\nsentiment-bearing text. However, the figurative and creative nature of sarcasm\nposes a great challenge for affective computing systems performing sentiment\nanalysis. This article compiles and reviews the salient work in the literature\nof automatic sarcasm detection. Thus far, three main paradigm shifts have\noccurred in the way researchers have approached this task: 1) semi-supervised\npattern extraction to identify implicit sentiment, 2) use of hashtag-based\nsupervision, and 3) incorporation of context beyond target text. In this\narticle, we provide a comprehensive review of the datasets, approaches, trends,\nand issues in sarcasm and irony detection.",

          "description": "When data is collected in an adaptive manner, even simple methods like\nordinary least squares can exhibit non-normal asymptotic behavior. As an\nundesirable consequence, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals based on\nasymptotic normality can lead to erroneous results. We propose an online\ndebiasing estimator to correct these distributional anomalies in least squares\nestimation. Our proposed method takes advantage of the covariance structure\npresent in the dataset and provides sharper estimates in directions for which\nmore information has accrued. We establish an asymptotic normality property for\nour proposed online debiasing estimator under mild conditions on the data\ncollection process, and provide asymptotically exact confidence intervals. We\nadditionally prove a minimax lower bound for the adaptive linear regression\nproblem, thereby providing a baseline by which to compare estimators. There are\nvarious conditions under which our proposed estimator achieves the minimax\nlower bound up to logarithmic factors. We demonstrate the usefulness of our\ntheory via applications to multi-armed bandit, autoregressive time series\nestimation, and active learning with exploration.",

          "description": "Density ratio estimation serves as an important technique in the unsupervised\nmachine learning toolbox. However, such ratios are difficult to estimate for\ncomplex, high-dimensional data, particularly when the densities of interest are\nsufficiently different. In our work, we propose to leverage an invertible\ngenerative model to map the two distributions into a common feature space prior\nto estimation. This featurization brings the densities closer together in\nlatent space, sidestepping pathological scenarios where the learned density\nratios in input space can be arbitrarily inaccurate. At the same time, the\ninvertibility of our feature map guarantees that the ratios computed in feature\nspace are equivalent to those in input space. Empirically, we demonstrate the\nefficacy of our approach in a variety of downstream tasks that require access\nto accurate density ratios such as mutual information estimation, targeted\nsampling in deep generative models, and classification with data augmentation.",

          "description": "We introduce the problem of sleeping dueling bandits with stochastic\npreferences and adversarial availabilities (DB-SPAA). In almost all dueling\nbandit applications, the decision space often changes over time; eg, retail\nstore management, online shopping, restaurant recommendation, search engine\noptimization, etc. Surprisingly, this `sleeping aspect' of dueling bandits has\nnever been studied in the literature. Like dueling bandits, the goal is to\ncompete with the best arm by sequentially querying the preference feedback of\nitem pairs. The non-triviality however results due to the non-stationary item\nspaces that allow any arbitrary subsets items to go unavailable every round.\nThe goal is to find an optimal `no-regret' policy that can identify the best\navailable item at each round, as opposed to the standard `fixed best-arm regret\nobjective' of dueling bandits. We first derive an instance-specific lower bound\nfor DB-SPAA $\\Omega( \\sum_{i =1}^{K-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^K \\frac{\\log\nT}{\\Delta(i,j)})$, where $K$ is the number of items and $\\Delta(i,j)$ is the\ngap between items $i$ and $j$. This indicates that the sleeping problem with\npreference feedback is inherently more difficult than that for classical\nmulti-armed bandits (MAB). We then propose two algorithms, with near optimal\nregret guarantees. Our results are corroborated empirically.",

However, typical meta-learning\nalgorithms have assumed the tasks to be similar such that a single meta-learner\nis sufficient to aggregate the variations in all aspects. In addition, there\nhas been less consideration on uncertainty when limited information is given as\ncontext. In this paper, we devise a novel meta-learning framework, called\nMeta-learning Amidst Heterogeneity and Ambiguity (MAHA), that outperforms\nprevious works in terms of prediction based on its ability on task\nidentification.

In this work, we\npropose a deep learning-based algorithm for precise molecule localization of\nhigh density frames acquired by SMLM techniques whose $\\ell_{2}$-based loss\nfunction is regularized by positivity and $\\ell_{0}$-based constraints.

          "description": "Aggregating multiple sources of weak supervision (WS) can ease the\ndata-labeling bottleneck prevalent in many machine learning applications, by\nreplacing the tedious manual collection of ground truth labels. Current state\nof the art approaches that do not use any labeled training data, however,\nrequire two separate modeling steps: Learning a probabilistic latent variable\nmodel based on the WS sources -- making assumptions that rarely hold in\npractice -- followed by downstream model training. Importantly, the first step\nof modeling does not consider the performance of the downstream model. To\naddress these caveats we propose an end-to-end approach for directly learning\nthe downstream model by maximizing its agreement with probabilistic labels\ngenerated by reparameterizing previous probabilistic posteriors with a neural\nnetwork. Our results show improved performance over prior work in terms of end\nmodel performance on downstream test sets, as well as in terms of improved\nrobustness to dependencies among weak supervision sources.",
