          "description": "Current open-domain question answering systems often follow a\nRetriever-Reader architecture, where the retriever first retrieves relevant\npassages and the reader then reads the retrieved passages to form an answer. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple and effective passage reranking method, named\nReader-guIDEd Reranker (RIDER), which does not involve training and reranks the\nretrieved passages solely based on the top predictions of the reader before\nreranking. We show that RIDER, despite its simplicity, achieves 10 to 20\nabsolute gains in top-1 retrieval accuracy and 1 to 4 Exact Match (EM) gains\nwithout refining the retriever or reader. In addition, RIDER, without any\ntraining, outperforms state-of-the-art transformer-based supervised rerankers.\nRemarkably, RIDER achieves 48.3 EM on the Natural Questions dataset and 66.4 EM\non the TriviaQA dataset when only 1,024 tokens (7.8 passages on average) are\nused as the reader input after passage reranking.",

          "description": "Neural text generation models are typically trained by maximizing\nlog-likelihood with the sequence cross entropy loss, which encourages an exact\ntoken-by-token match between a target sequence with a generated sequence. Such\ntraining objective is sub-optimal when the target sequence not perfect, e.g.,\nwhen the target sequence is corrupted with noises, or when only weak sequence\nsupervision is available. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nEdit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL), which computes the matching loss of a\ntarget n-gram with all n-grams in the generated sequence. EISL draws\ninspirations from convolutional networks (ConvNets) which are shift-invariant\nto images, hence is robust to the shift of n-grams to tolerate edits in the\ntarget sequences. Moreover, the computation of EISL is essentially a\nconvolution operation with target n-grams as kernels, which is easy to\nimplement with existing libraries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EISL, we\nconduct experiments on three tasks: machine translation with noisy target\nsequences, unsupervised text style transfer, and non-autoregressive machine\ntranslation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms\ncross entropy loss on these three tasks.",

          "description": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can achieve promising results with outrageous\nlarge amount of parameters but constant computation cost, and thus it has\nbecome a trend in model scaling. Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring\nquality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this\nwork, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe\nthat load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,\ncontrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely\nactivated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can\nsignificantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step\nforward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits\nexperts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This\nstrategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,\nand our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is\nmore effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$\ntrillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in\ncomparison with the recent SOTAs on $2048$ TPU cores. The proposed giant model\nachieves substantial speedup in convergence over the same-size baseline.",

          "description": "We propose Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) for answering open-domain\nquestions, which augments a query through text generation of heuristically\ndiscovered relevant contexts without external resources as supervision. We\ndemonstrate that the generated contexts substantially enrich the semantics of\nthe queries and GAR with sparse representations (BM25) achieves comparable or\nbetter performance than state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods such as DPR.\nWe show that generating diverse contexts for a query is beneficial as fusing\ntheir results consistently yields better retrieval accuracy. Moreover, as\nsparse and dense representations are often complementary, GAR can be easily\ncombined with DPR to achieve even better performance. GAR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets under\nthe extractive QA setup when equipped with an extractive reader, and\nconsistently outperforms other retrieval methods when the same generative\nreader is used.",

          "description": "Recent work has shown success in incorporating pre-trained models like BERT\nto improve NLP systems. However, existing pre-trained models lack of causal\nknowledge which prevents today's NLP systems from thinking like humans. In this\npaper, we investigate the problem of injecting causal knowledge into\npre-trained models. There are two fundamental problems: 1) how to collect\nvarious granularities of causal pairs from unstructured texts; 2) how to\neffectively inject causal knowledge into pre-trained models. To address these\nissues, we extend the idea of CausalBERT from previous studies, and conduct\nexperiments on various datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. In addition, we\nadopt a regularization-based method to preserve the already learned knowledge\nwith an extra regularization term while injecting causal knowledge. Extensive\nexperiments on 7 datasets, including four causal pair classification tasks, two\ncausal QA tasks and a causal inference task, demonstrate that CausalBERT\ncaptures rich causal knowledge and outperforms all pre-trained models-based\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving a new causal inference benchmark.",

          "description": "Answering questions about why characters perform certain actions is central\nto understanding and reasoning about narratives. Despite recent progress in QA,\nit is not clear if existing models have the ability to answer \"why\" questions\nthat may require commonsense knowledge external to the input narrative. In this\nwork, we introduce TellMeWhy, a new crowd-sourced dataset that consists of more\nthan 30k questions and free-form answers concerning why characters in short\nnarratives perform the actions described. For a third of this dataset, the\nanswers are not present within the narrative. Given the limitations of\nautomated evaluation for this task, we also present a systematized human\nevaluation interface for this dataset. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art\nmodels show that they are far below human performance on answering such\nquestions.

However, parsers are mostly designed for and evaluated on\nEnglish resources, such as CFQ (Keysers et al., 2020), the current standard\nbenchmark based on English data generated from grammar rules and oriented\ntowards Freebase, an outdated knowledge base. We propose a method for creating\na multilingual, parallel dataset of question-query pairs, grounded in Wikidata,\nand introduce such a dataset called Compositional Wikidata Questions (CWQ). We\nutilize this data to train and evaluate semantic parsers for Hebrew, Kannada,\nChinese and English, to better understand the current strengths and weaknesses\nof multilingual semantic parsing. Experiments on zero-shot cross-lingual\ntransfer demonstrate that models fail to generate valid queries even with\npretrained multilingual encoders. Our methodology, dataset and results will\nfacilitate future research on semantic parsing in more realistic and diverse\nsettings than has been possible with existing resources.",

Indeed, it is still a challenge to subjective\ninformation extraction systems to identify opinions and feelings in context. In\nsentiment-based NLP tasks, there are few resources to information extraction,\nabove all offensive or hateful opinions in context. To fill this important gap,\nthis short paper provides a new cross-lingual and contextual offensive lexicon,\nwhich consists of explicit and implicit offensive and swearing expressions of\nopinion, which were annotated in two different classes: context dependent and\ncontext-independent offensive.

To answer these\nquestions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a\nnew English-French dataset comprising supporting context words for 14K\ntranslations that professional translators found useful for pronoun\ndisambiguation. Using SCAT, we perform an in-depth analysis of the context used\nto disambiguate, examining positional and lexical characteristics of the\nsupporting words.

          "description": "The exponential growths of social media and micro-blogging sites not only\nprovide platforms for empowering freedom of expressions and individual voices,\nbut also enables people to express anti-social behaviour like online\nharassment, cyberbullying, and hate speech. Numerous works have been proposed\nto utilize textual data for social and anti-social behaviour analysis, by\npredicting the contexts mostly for highly-resourced languages like English.\nHowever, some languages are under-resourced, e.g., South Asian languages like\nBengali, that lack computational resources for accurate natural language\nprocessing (NLP). In this paper, we propose an explainable approach for hate\nspeech detection from the under-resourced Bengali language, which we called\nDeepHateExplainer. Bengali texts are first comprehensively preprocessed, before\nclassifying them into political, personal, geopolitical, and religious hates\nusing a neural ensemble method of transformer-based neural architectures (i.e.,\nmonolingual Bangla BERT-base, multilingual BERT-cased/uncased, and\nXLM-RoBERTa). Important(most and least) terms are then identified using\nsensitivity analysis and layer-wise relevance propagation(LRP), before\nproviding human-interpretable explanations. Finally, we compute\ncomprehensiveness and sufficiency scores to measure the quality of explanations\nw.r.t faithfulness. Evaluations against machine learning~(linear and tree-based\nmodels) and neural networks (i.e., CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM with word\nembeddings) baselines yield F1-scores of 78%, 91%, 89%, and 84%, for political,\npersonal, geopolitical, and religious hates, respectively, outperforming both\nML and DNN baselines.",

Our model is then trained with a combination of\nsupervised, self-supervised and unsupervised loss functions, which are\nmotivated by multiple social and political phenomenons. We conduct extensive\nexperiments to compare our method with existing text and graph analysis\nbaselines. Our model achieves highest stance detection accuracy and yields\ninspiring insights regarding social entity stances. We further conduct ablation\nstudy and parameter analysis to study the mechanism and effectiveness of our\nproposed approach.",

To monitor the pandemic trend, existing studies rely on\nthe aggregation of traditional statistical models and epidemic spread theory.\nIn other words, historical statistics of COVID-19, as well as the population\nmobility data, become the essential knowledge for monitoring the pandemic\ntrend. However, these solutions can barely provide precise prediction and\nsatisfactory explanations on the long-term disease surveillance while the\nubiquitous social media resources can be the key enabler for solving this\nproblem. For example, serious discussions may occur on social media before and\nafter some breaking events take place. These events, such as marathon and\nparade, may impact the spread of the virus. To take advantage of the social\nmedia data, we propose a novel framework, Social Media enhAnced pandemic\nsuRveillance Technique (SMART), which is composed of two modules: (i)\ninformation extraction module to construct heterogeneous knowledge graphs based\non the extracted events and relationships among them; (ii) time series\nprediction module to provide both short-term and long-term forecasts of the\nconfirmed cases and fatality at the state-level in the United States and to\ndiscover risk factors for COVID-19 interventions.

Motivated by this question, we aim at constructing an\ninformative prior over neural weights, in order to adapt quickly to held-out\nlanguages in the task of character-level language modeling. We infer this\ndistribution from a sample of typologically diverse training languages via\nLaplace approximation. The use of such a prior outperforms baseline models with\nan uninformative prior (so-called \"fine-tuning\") in both zero-shot and few-shot\nsettings. This shows that the prior is imbued with universal phonological\nknowledge. Moreover, we harness additional language-specific side information\nas distant supervision for held-out languages. Specifically, we condition\nlanguage models on features from typological databases, by concatenating them\nto hidden states or generating weights with hyper-networks. These features\nappear beneficial in the few-shot setting, but not in the zero-shot setting.\nSince the paucity of digital texts affects the majority of the world's\nlanguages, we hope that these findings will help broaden the scope of\napplications for language technology.",

          "description": "The capabilities of natural language models trained on large-scale data have\nincreased immensely over the past few years. Open source libraries such as\nHuggingFace have made these models easily available and accessible. While prior\nresearch has identified biases in large language models, this paper considers\nbiases contained in the most popular versions of these models when applied\n`out-of-the-box' for downstream tasks. We focus on generative language models\nas they are well-suited for extracting biases inherited from training data.\nSpecifically, we conduct an in-depth analysis of GPT-2, which is the most\ndownloaded text generation model on HuggingFace, with over half a million\ndownloads in the past month alone. We assess biases related to occupational\nassociations for different protected categories by intersecting gender with\nreligion, sexuality, ethnicity, political affiliation, and continental name\norigin. Using a template-based data collection pipeline, we collect 396K\nsentence completions made by GPT-2 and find: (i) The machine-predicted jobs are\nless diverse and more stereotypical for women than for men, especially for\nintersections; (ii) Intersectional interactions are highly relevant for\noccupational associations, which we quantify by fitting 262 logistic models;\n(iii) For most occupations, GPT-2 reflects the skewed gender and ethnicity\ndistribution found in US Labour Bureau data, and even pulls the\nsocietally-skewed distribution towards gender parity in cases where its\npredictions deviate from real labor market observations. This raises the\nnormative question of what language models _should_ learn - whether they should\nreflect or correct for existing inequalities.",

          "description": "Sentence semantic matching requires an agent to determine the semantic\nrelation between two sentences, which is widely used in various natural\nlanguage tasks, such as Natural Language Inference (NLI), Paraphrase\nIdentification (PI), and so on. Much recent progress has been made in this\narea, especially attention-based methods and pre-trained language model based\nmethods. However, most of these methods focus on all the important parts in\nsentences in a static way and only emphasize how important the words are to the\nquery, inhibiting the ability of attention mechanism. In order to overcome this\nproblem and boost the performance of attention mechanism, we propose a novel\ndynamic re-read attention, which can pay close attention to one small region of\nsentences at each step and re-read the important parts for better sentence\nrepresentations. Based on this attention variation, we develop a novel Dynamic\nRe-read Network (DRr-Net) for sentence semantic matching. Moreover, selecting\none small region in dynamic re-read attention seems insufficient for sentence\nsemantics, and employing pre-trained language models as input encoders will\nintroduce incomplete and fragile representation problems. To this end, we\nextend DRrNet to Locally-Aware Dynamic Re-read Attention Net (LadRa-Net), in\nwhich local structure of sentences is employed to alleviate the shortcoming of\nByte-Pair Encoding (BPE) in pre-trained language models and boost the\nperformance of dynamic reread attention. Extensive experiments on two popular\nsentence semantic matching tasks demonstrate that DRr-Net can significantly\nimprove the performance of sentence semantic matching. Meanwhile, LadRa-Net is\nable to achieve better performance by considering the local structures of\nsentences. In addition, it is exceedingly interesting that some discoveries in\nour experiments are consistent with some findings of psychological research.",

          "description": "Humans possess the unique ability to communicate emotions through language.\nAlthough concepts like anger or awe are abstract, there is a shared consensus\nabout what these English emotion words mean. This consensus may give the\nimpression that their meaning is static, but we propose this is not the case.\nWe cannot travel back to earlier periods to study emotion concepts directly,\nbut we can examine text corpora, which have partially preserved the meaning of\nemotion words. Using natural language processing of historical text, we found\nevidence for semantic change in emotion words over the past century and that\nvarying rates of change were predicted in part by an emotion concept's\nprototypicality - how representative it is of the broader category of\n\"emotion\". Prototypicality negatively correlated with historical rates of\nemotion semantic change obtained from text-based word embeddings, beyond more\nestablished variables including usage frequency in English and a second\ncomparison language, French. This effect for prototypicality did not\nconsistently extend to the semantic category of birds, suggesting its relevance\nfor predicting semantic change may be category-dependent.

          "description": "The current state-of-the-art generative models for open-domain question\nanswering (ODQA) have focused on generating direct answers from unstructured\ntextual information. However, a large amount of world's knowledge is stored in\nstructured databases, and need to be accessed using query languages such as\nSQL. Furthermore, query languages can answer questions that require complex\nreasoning, as well as offering full explainability. In this paper, we propose a\nhybrid framework that takes both textual and tabular evidence as input and\ngenerates either direct answers or SQL queries depending on which form could\nbetter answer the question. The generated SQL queries can then be executed on\nthe associated databases to obtain the final answers. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first paper that applies Text2SQL to ODQA tasks.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that on several ODQA datasets, the hybrid methods\nconsistently outperforms the baseline models that only take homogeneous input\nby a large margin. Specifically we achieve state-of-the-art performance on\nOpenSQuAD dataset using a T5-base model. In a detailed analysis, we demonstrate\nthat the being able to generate structural SQL queries can always bring gains,\nespecially for those questions that requires complex reasoning.",

          "description": "Structured text understanding on Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) is a crucial\npart of Document Intelligence. Due to the complexity of content and layout in\nVRDs, structured text understanding has been a challenging task. Most existing\nstudies decoupled this problem into two sub-tasks: entity labeling and entity\nlinking, which require an entire understanding of the context of documents at\nboth token and segment levels. However, little work has been concerned with the\nsolutions that efficiently extract the structured data from different levels.\nThis paper proposes a unified framework named StrucTexT, which is flexible and\neffective for handling both sub-tasks. Specifically, based on the transformer,\nwe introduce a segment-token aligned encoder to deal with the entity labeling\nand entity linking tasks at different levels of granularity. Moreover, we\ndesign a novel pre-training strategy with three self-supervised tasks to learn\na richer representation. StrucTexT uses the existing Masked Visual Language\nModeling task and the new Sentence Length Prediction and Paired Boxes Direction\ntasks to incorporate the multi-modal information across text, image, and\nlayout. We evaluate our method for structured text understanding at\nsegment-level and token-level and show it outperforms the state-of-the-art\ncounterparts with significantly superior performance on the FUNSD, SROIE, and\nEPHOIE datasets.",

          "description": "Recall the classical text generation works, the generation framework can be\nbriefly divided into two phases: \\textbf{idea reasoning} and \\textbf{surface\nrealization}. The target of idea reasoning is to figure out the main idea which\nwill be presented in the following talking/writing periods. Surface realization\naims to arrange the most appropriate sentence to depict and convey the\ninformation distilled from the main idea. However, the current popular\ntoken-by-token text generation methods ignore this crucial process and suffer\nfrom many serious issues, such as idea/topic drift. To tackle the problems and\nrealize this two-phase paradigm, we propose a new framework named Sentence\nSemantic Regression (\\textbf{SSR}) based on sentence-level language modeling.\nFor idea reasoning, two architectures \\textbf{SSR-AR} and \\textbf{SSR-NonAR}\nare designed to conduct sentence semantic regression autoregressively (like\nGPT2/3) and bidirectionally (like BERT). In the phase of surface realization, a\nmixed-granularity sentence decoder is designed to generate text with better\nconsistency by jointly incorporating the predicted sentence-level main idea as\nwell as the preceding contextual token-level information. We conduct\nexperiments on four tasks of story ending prediction, story ending generation,\ndialogue generation, and sentence infilling.

          "description": "Text variational autoencoders (VAEs) are notorious for posterior collapse, a\nphenomenon where the model's decoder learns to ignore signals from the encoder.\nBecause posterior collapse is known to be exacerbated by expressive decoders,\nTransformers have seen limited adoption as components of text VAEs. Existing\nstudies that incorporate Transformers into text VAEs (Li et al., 2020; Fang et\nal., 2021) mitigate posterior collapse using massive pretraining, a technique\nunavailable to most of the research community without extensive computing\nresources. We present a simple two-phase training scheme to convert a\nsequence-to-sequence Transformer into a VAE with just finetuning. The resulting\nlanguage model is competitive with massively pretrained Transformer-based VAEs\nin some internal metrics while falling short on others. To facilitate training\nwe comprehensively explore the impact of common posterior collapse alleviation\ntechniques in the literature. We release our code for reproducability.",

          "description": "Numerous online stock image libraries offer high quality yet copyright free\nimages for use in marketing campaigns. To assist advertisers in navigating such\nthird party libraries, we study the problem of automatically fetching relevant\nad images given the ad text (via a short textual query for images). Motivated\nby our observations in logged data on ad image search queries (given ad text),\nwe formulate a keyword extraction problem, where a keyword extracted from the\nad text (or its augmented version) serves as the ad image query. In this\ncontext, we propose VisualTextRank: an unsupervised method to (i) augment input\nad text using semantically similar ads, and (ii) extract the image query from\nthe augmented ad text. VisualTextRank builds on prior work on graph based\ncontext extraction (biased TextRank in particular) by leveraging both the text\nand image of similar ads for better keyword extraction, and using advertiser\ncategory specific biasing with sentence-BERT embeddings. Using data collected\nfrom the Verizon Media Native (Yahoo Gemini) ad platform's stock image search\nfeature for onboarding advertisers, we demonstrate the superiority of\nVisualTextRank compared to competitive keyword extraction baselines (including\nan $11\\%$ accuracy lift over biased TextRank). For the case when the stock\nimage library is restricted to English queries, we show the effectiveness of\nVisualTextRank on multilingual ads (translated to English) while leveraging\nsemantically similar English ads. Online tests with a simplified version of\nVisualTextRank led to a 28.7% increase in the usage of stock image search, and\na 41.6% increase in the advertiser onboarding rate in the Verizon Media Native\nad platform.",

          "description": "Single online handwritten Chinese character recognition~(single OLHCCR) has\nachieved prominent performance. However, in real application scenarios, users\nalways write multiple Chinese characters to form one complete sentence and the\ncontextual information within these characters holds the significant potential\nto improve the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of sentence-level OLHCCR. In\nthis work, we first propose a simple and straightforward end-to-end network,\nnamely vanilla compositional network~(VCN) to tackle the sentence-level OLHCCR.\nIt couples convolutional neural network with sequence modeling architecture to\nexploit the handwritten character's previous contextual information. Although\nVCN performs much better than the state-of-the-art single OLHCCR model, it\nexposes high fragility when confronting with not well written characters such\nas sloppy writing, missing or broken strokes. To improve the robustness of\nsentence-level OLHCCR, we further propose a novel deep spatial-temporal fusion\nnetwork~(DSTFN). It utilizes a pre-trained autoregresssive framework as the\nbackbone component, which projects each Chinese character into word embeddings,\nand integrates the spatial glyph features of handwritten characters and their\ncontextual information multiple times at multi-layer fusion module. We also\nconstruct a large-scale sentence-level handwriting dataset, named as CSOHD to\nevaluate models. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that DSTFN achieves\nthe state-of-the-art performance, which presents strong robustness compared\nwith VCN and exiting single OLHCCR models. The in-depth empirical analysis and\ncase studies indicate that DSTFN can significantly improve the efficiency of\nhandwriting input, with the handwritten Chinese character with incomplete\nstrokes being recognized precisely.",

          "description": "Aspect-level sentiment classification (ASC) aims to predict the fine-grained\nsentiment polarity towards a given aspect mentioned in a review. Despite recent\nadvances in ASC, enabling machines to preciously infer aspect sentiments is\nstill challenging. This paper tackles two challenges in ASC: (1) due to lack of\naspect knowledge, aspect representation derived in prior works is inadequate to\nrepresent aspect's exact meaning and property information; (2) prior works only\ncapture either local syntactic information or global relational information,\nthus missing either one of them leads to insufficient syntactic information. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose a novel ASC model which not only end-to-end\nembeds and leverages aspect knowledge but also marries the two kinds of\nsyntactic information and lets them compensate for each other. Our model\nincludes three key components: (1) a knowledge-aware gated recurrent memory\nnetwork recurrently integrates dynamically summarized aspect knowledge; (2) a\ndual syntax graph network combines both kinds of syntactic information to\ncomprehensively capture sufficient syntactic information; (3) a knowledge\nintegrating gate re-enhances the final representation with further needed\naspect knowledge; (4) an aspect-to-context attention mechanism aggregates the\naspect-related semantics from all hidden states into the final representation.\nExperimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model, which overpass previous state-of-the-art models by\nlarge margins in terms of both Accuracy and Macro-F1.",

          "description": "This paper presents Sinsy, a deep neural network (DNN)-based singing voice\nsynthesis (SVS) system. In recent years, DNNs have been utilized in statistical\nparametric SVS systems, and DNN-based SVS systems have demonstrated better\nperformance than conventional hidden Markov model-based ones. SVS systems are\nrequired to synthesize a singing voice with pitch and timing that strictly\nfollow a given musical score. Additionally, singing expressions that are not\ndescribed on the musical score, such as vibrato and timing fluctuations, should\nbe reproduced. The proposed system is composed of four modules: a time-lag\nmodel, a duration model, an acoustic model, and a vocoder, and singing voices\ncan be synthesized taking these characteristics of singing voices into account.\nTo better model a singing voice, the proposed system incorporates improved\napproaches to modeling pitch and vibrato and better training criteria into the\nacoustic model. In addition, we incorporated PeriodNet, a non-autoregressive\nneural vocoder with robustness for the pitch, into our systems to generate a\nhigh-fidelity singing voice waveform. Moreover, we propose automatic pitch\ncorrection techniques for DNN-based SVS to synthesize singing voices with\ncorrect pitch even if the training data has out-of-tune phrases. Experimental\nresults show our system can synthesize a singing voice with better timing, more\nnatural vibrato, and correct pitch, and it can achieve better mean opinion\nscores in subjective evaluation tests.",

          "description": "End-to-end intent classification using speech has numerous advantages\ncompared to the conventional pipeline approach using automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR), followed by natural language processing modules. It attempts\nto predict intent from speech without using an intermediate ASR module.\nHowever, such end-to-end framework suffers from the unavailability of large\nspeech resources with higher acoustic variation in spoken language\nunderstanding. In this work, we exploit the scope of the transformer\ndistillation method that is specifically designed for knowledge distillation\nfrom a transformer based language model to a transformer based speech model. In\nthis regard, we leverage the reliable and widely used bidirectional encoder\nrepresentations from transformers (BERT) model as a language model and transfer\nthe knowledge to build an acoustic model for intent classification using the\nspeech. In particular, a multilevel transformer based teacher-student model is\ndesigned, and knowledge distillation is performed across attention and hidden\nsub-layers of different transformer layers of the student and teacher models.\nWe achieve an intent classification accuracy of 99.10% and 88.79% for Fluent\nspeech corpus and ATIS database, respectively. Further, the proposed method\ndemonstrates better performance and robustness in acoustically degraded\ncondition compared to the baseline method.",

Our main contribution is a novel variant of the Multistreaming\nTime-Delay Neural Network (MTDNN) architecture, called MSTRE-Net, which\nprocesses the temporal information using multiple streams in parallel with\nvarying resolutions keeping the network more compact, and thus with a faster\ninference and an improved recognition rate than having identical TDNN streams.\nIn addition, two novel preprocessing steps prior to training the acoustic model\nare proposed. First, we suggest using recordings from both monophonic and\npolyphonic domains during training the acoustic model. Second, we tag\nmonophonic and polyphonic recordings with distinct labels for discriminating\nnon-vocal silence and music instances during alignment. Moreover, we present a\nnew test set with a considerably larger size and a higher musical variability\ncompared to the existing datasets used in ALT literature, while maintaining the\ngender balance of the singers.

However, vaccine hesitancy,\nfueled by exposure to social media misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines\nbecame a major hurdle. Therefore, it is essential to automatically detect where\nmisinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media is spread and what kind\nof misinformation is discussed, such that inoculation interventions can be\ndelivered at the right time and in the right place, in addition to\ninterventions designed to address vaccine hesitancy. This paper is addressing\nthe first step in tackling hesitancy against COVID-19 vaccines, namely the\nautomatic detection of misinformation about the vaccines on Twitter, the social\nmedia platform that has the highest volume of conversations about COVID-19 and\nits vaccines. We present CoVaxLies, a new dataset of tweets judged relevant to\nseveral misinformation targets about COVID-19 vaccines on which a novel method\nof detecting misinformation was developed. Our method organizes CoVaxLies in a\nMisinformation Knowledge Graph as it casts misinformation detection as a graph\nlink prediction problem. The misinformation detection method detailed in this\npaper takes advantage of the link scoring functions provided by several\nknowledge embedding methods. The experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of this method when compared with classification-based methods,\nwidely used currently.",

          "description": "The task of video-based commonsense captioning aims to generate event-wise\ncaptions and meanwhile provide multiple commonsense descriptions (e.g.,\nattribute, effect and intention) about the underlying event in the video. Prior\nworks explore the commonsense captions by using separate networks for different\ncommonsense types, which is time-consuming and lacks mining the interaction of\ndifferent commonsense. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Reasoning Network\n(HybridNet) to endow the neural networks with the capability of semantic-level\nreasoning and word-level reasoning. Firstly, we develop multi-commonsense\nlearning for semantic-level reasoning by jointly training different commonsense\ntypes in a unified network, which encourages the interaction between the clues\nof multiple commonsense descriptions, event-wise captions and videos. Then,\nthere are two steps to achieve the word-level reasoning: (1) a memory module\nrecords the history predicted sequence from the previous generation processes;\n(2) a memory-routed multi-head attention (MMHA) module updates the word-level\nattention maps by incorporating the history information from the memory module\ninto the transformer decoder for word-level reasoning. Moreover, the multimodal\nfeatures are used to make full use of diverse knowledge for commonsense\nreasoning. Experiments and abundant analysis on the large-scale\nVideo-to-Commonsense benchmark show that our HybridNet achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance compared with other methods.",

          "description": "Video captioning combines video understanding and language generation.\nDifferent from image captioning that describes a static image with details of\nalmost every object, video captioning usually considers a sequence of frames\nand biases towards focused objects, e.g., the objects that stay in focus\nregardless of the changing background. Therefore, detecting and properly\naccommodating focused objects is critical in video captioning. To enforce the\ndescription of focused objects and achieve controllable video captioning, we\npropose an Object-Oriented Non-Autoregressive approach (O2NA), which performs\ncaption generation in three steps: 1) identify the focused objects and predict\ntheir locations in the target caption; 2) generate the related attribute words\nand relation words of these focused objects to form a draft caption; and 3)\ncombine video information to refine the draft caption to a fluent final\ncaption. Since the focused objects are generated and located ahead of other\nwords, it is difficult to apply the word-by-word autoregressive generation\nprocess; instead, we adopt a non-autoregressive approach.

          "description": "Neural agents trained in reinforcement learning settings can learn to\ncommunicate among themselves via discrete tokens, accomplishing as a team what\nagents would be unable to do alone. However, the current standard of using\none-hot vectors as discrete communication tokens prevents agents from acquiring\nmore desirable aspects of communication such as zero-shot understanding.\nInspired by word embedding techniques from natural language processing, we\npropose neural agent architectures that enables them to communicate via\ndiscrete tokens derived from a learned, continuous space. We show in a decision\ntheoretic framework that our technique optimizes communication over a wide\nrange of scenarios, whereas one-hot tokens are only optimal under restrictive\nassumptions. In self-play experiments, we validate that our trained agents\nlearn to cluster tokens in semantically-meaningful ways, allowing them\ncommunicate in noisy environments where other techniques fail. Lastly, we\ndemonstrate both that agents using our method can effectively respond to novel\nhuman communication and that humans can understand unlabeled emergent agent\ncommunication, outperforming the use of one-hot communication.",

          "description": "Tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) with task-specific prompts has been\na promising approach for text classification. Particularly, previous studies\nsuggest that prompt-tuning has remarkable superiority in the low-data scenario\nover the generic fine-tuning methods with extra classifiers. The core idea of\nprompt-tuning is to insert text pieces, i.e., template, to the input and\ntransform a classification problem into a masked language modeling problem,\nwhere a crucial step is to construct a projection, i.e., verbalizer, between a\nlabel space and a label word space. A verbalizer is usually handcrafted or\nsearched by gradient descent, which may lack coverage and bring considerable\nbias and high variances to the results. In this work, we focus on incorporating\nexternal knowledge into the verbalizer, forming a knowledgeable prompt-tuning\n(KPT), to improve and stabilize prompt-tuning. Specifically, we expand the\nlabel word space of the verbalizer using external knowledge bases (KBs) and\nrefine the expanded label word space with the PLM itself before predicting with\nthe expanded label word space. Extensive experiments on zero and few-shot text\nclassification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledgeable\nprompt-tuning.",

          "description": "Assessing an AI agent that can converse in human language and understand\nvisual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor\ncorrect syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,\nwhere an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)\nmetric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a\nsingle human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:\nthe ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence\n(e.g., `yeah' and `yes'). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative\ngain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct\nanswers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually\napplicable uncertain answers such as `I don't know. Crafting a model that\nexcels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should\nanswer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To\naddress this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that\ncan merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep\nmost MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG\nstate-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%).

In this paper, we address\nthis issue by introducing a \\textit{weakly-supervised} paradigm for learning\nMWPs. Our method only requires the annotations of the final answers and can\ngenerate various solutions for a single problem. To boost weakly-supervised\nlearning, we propose a novel \\textit{learning-by-fixing} (LBF) framework, which\ncorrects the misperceptions of the neural network via symbolic reasoning.\nSpecifically, for an incorrect solution tree generated by the neural network,\nthe \\textit{fixing} mechanism propagates the error from the root node to the\nleaf nodes and infers the most probable fix that can be executed to get the\ndesired answer. To generate more diverse solutions, \\textit{tree\nregularization} is applied to guide the efficient shrinkage and exploration of\nthe solution space, and a \\textit{memory buffer} is designed to track and save\nthe discovered various fixes for each problem. Experimental results on the\nMath23K dataset show the proposed LBF framework significantly outperforms\nreinforcement learning baselines in weakly-supervised learning.

Such methods\ncritically rely on those embeddings having a similar structure, but it was\nrecently shown that the separate training in different languages causes\ndepartures from this assumption. In this paper, we propose an alternative\napproach that does not have this limitation, while requiring a weak seed\ndictionary (e.g., a list of identical words) as the only form of supervision.\nRather than aligning two fixed embedding spaces, our method works by fixing the\ntarget language embeddings, and learning a new set of embeddings for the source\nlanguage that are aligned with them. To that end, we use an extension of\nskip-gram that leverages translated context words as anchor points, and\nincorporates self-learning and iterative restarts to reduce the dependency on\nthe initial dictionary.

          "description": "Video captioning is an essential technology to understand scenes and describe\nevents in natural language. To apply it to real-time monitoring, a system needs\nnot only to describe events accurately but also to produce the captions as soon\nas possible. Low-latency captioning is needed to realize such functionality,\nbut this research area for online video captioning has not been pursued yet.\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to optimize each caption's output timing\nbased on a trade-off between latency and caption quality. An audio-visual\nTrans-former is trained to generate ground-truth captions using only a small\nportion of all video frames, and to mimic outputs of a pre-trained Transformer\nto which all the frames are given. A CNN-based timing detector is also trained\nto detect a proper output timing, where the captions generated by the two\nTrans-formers become sufficiently close to each other. With the jointly trained\nTransformer and timing detector, a caption can be generated in the early stages\nof an event-triggered video clip, as soon as an event happens or when it can be\nforecasted. Experiments with the ActivityNet Captions dataset show that our\napproach achieves 94% of the caption quality of the upper bound given by the\npre-trained Transformer using the entire video clips, using only 28% of frames\nfrom the beginning.",

          "description": "Large pre-trained language models (LMs) are capable of not only recovering\nlinguistic but also factual and commonsense knowledge. To access the knowledge\nstored in mask-based LMs, we can use cloze-style questions and let the model\nfill in the blank. The flexibility advantage over structured knowledge bases\ncomes with the drawback of finding the right query for a certain information\nneed. Inspired by human behavior to disambiguate a question, we propose to\nquery LMs by example. To clarify the ambivalent question \"Who does Neuer play\nfor?\", a successful strategy is to demonstrate the relation using another\nsubject, e.g., \"Ronaldo plays for Portugal. Who does Neuer play for?\". We apply\nthis approach of querying by example to the LAMA probe and obtain substantial\nimprovements of up to 37.8% for BERT-large on the T-REx data when providing\nonly 10 demonstrations--even outperforming a baseline that queries the model\nwith up to 40 paraphrases of the question. The examples are provided through\nthe model's context and thus require neither fine-tuning nor an additional\nforward pass. This suggests that LMs contain more factual and commonsense\nknowledge than previously assumed--if we query the model in the right way.",

          "description": "Fine-tuning pretrained language models (LMs) is a popular approach to\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) error detection during post-processing.\nWhile error detection systems often take advantage of statistical language\narchetypes captured by LMs, at times the pretrained knowledge can hinder error\ndetection performance. For instance, presence of speech disfluencies might\nconfuse the post-processing system into tagging disfluent but accurate\ntranscriptions as ASR errors. Such confusion occurs because both error\ndetection and disfluency detection tasks attempt to identify tokens at\nstatistically unlikely positions. This paper proposes a scheme to improve\nexisting LM-based ASR error detection systems, both in terms of detection\nscores and resilience to such distracting auxiliary tasks. Our approach adopts\nthe popular mixup method in text feature space and can be utilized with any\nblack-box ASR output. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we\nconduct post-processing experiments with both traditional and end-to-end ASR\nsystems (both for English and Korean languages) with 5 different speech\ncorpora. We find that our method improves both ASR error detection F 1 scores\nand reduces the number of correctly transcribed disfluencies wrongly detected\nas ASR errors. Finally, we suggest methods to utilize resulting LMs directly in\nsemi-supervised ASR training.",

This paper presents a novel loss objective to compress token\nembeddings in the Transformer-based models by leveraging an AutoEncoder\narchitecture. More specifically, we emphasize the importance of the direction\nof compressed embeddings with respect to original uncompressed embeddings. The\nproposed method is task-agnostic and does not require further language modeling\npre-training. Our method significantly outperforms the commonly used SVD-based\nmatrix-factorization approach in terms of initial language model Perplexity.\nMoreover, we evaluate our proposed approach over SQuAD v1.1 dataset and several\ndownstream tasks from the GLUE benchmark, where we also outperform the baseline\nin most scenarios. Our code is public.",

          "description": "How to effectively incorporate cross-utterance information cues into a neural\nlanguage model (LM) has emerged as one of the intriguing issues for automatic\nspeech recognition (ASR). Existing research efforts on improving\ncontextualization of an LM typically regard previous utterances as a sequence\nof additional input and may fail to capture complex global structural\ndependencies among these utterances. In view of this, we in this paper seek to\nrepresent the historical context information of an utterance as\ngraph-structured data so as to distill cross-utterances, global word\ninteraction relationships. To this end, we apply a graph convolutional network\n(GCN) on the resulting graph to obtain the corresponding GCN embeddings of\nhistorical words. GCN has recently found its versatile applications on\nsocial-network analysis, text summarization, and among others due mainly to its\nability of effectively capturing rich relational information among elements.\nHowever, GCN remains largely underexplored in the context of ASR, especially\nfor dealing with conversational speech. In addition, we frame ASR N-best\nreranking as a prediction problem, leveraging bidirectional encoder\nrepresentations from transformers (BERT) as the vehicle to not only seize the\nlocal intrinsic word regularity patterns inherent in a candidate hypothesis but\nalso incorporate the cross-utterance, historical word interaction cues\ndistilled by GCN for promoting performance. Extensive experiments conducted on\nthe AMI benchmark dataset seem to confirm the pragmatic utility of our methods,\nin relation to some current top-of-the-line methods.",

          "description": "Controlling the style of natural language by disentangling the latent space\nis an important step towards interpretable machine learning. After the latent\nspace is disentangled, the style of a sentence can be transformed by tuning the\nstyle representation without affecting other features of the sentence. Previous\nworks usually use adversarial training to guarantee that disentangled vectors\ndo not affect each other. However, adversarial methods are difficult to train.\nEspecially when there are multiple features (e.g., sentiment, or tense, which\nwe call style types in this paper), each feature requires a separate\ndiscriminator for extracting a disentangled style vector corresponding to that\nfeature. In this paper, we propose a unified distribution-controlling method,\nwhich provides each specific style value (the value of style types, e.g.,\npositive sentiment, or past tense) with a unique representation. This method\ncontributes a solid theoretical basis to avoid adversarial training in\nmulti-type disentanglement. We also propose multiple loss functions to achieve\na style-content disentanglement as well as a disentanglement among multiple\nstyle types. In addition, we observe that if two different style types always\nhave some specific style values that occur together in the dataset, they will\naffect each other when transferring the style values. We call this phenomenon\ntraining bias, and we propose a loss function to alleviate such training bias\nwhile disentangling multiple types. We conduct experiments on two datasets\n(Yelp service reviews and Amazon product reviews) to evaluate the\nstyle-disentangling effect and the unsupervised style transfer performance on\ntwo style types: sentiment and tense. The experimental results show the\neffectiveness of our model.",

          "description": "Abductive and counterfactual reasoning, core abilities of everyday human\ncognition, require reasoning about what might have happened at time t, while\nconditioning on multiple contexts from the relative past and future. However,\nsimultaneous incorporation of past and future contexts using generative\nlanguage models (LMs) can be challenging, as they are trained either to\ncondition only on the past context or to perform narrowly scoped\ntext-infilling. In this paper, we propose DeLorean, a new unsupervised decoding\nalgorithm that can flexibly incorporate both the past and future contexts using\nonly off-the-shelf, left-to-right language models and no supervision. The key\nintuition of our algorithm is incorporating the future through\nback-propagation, during which, we only update the internal representation of\nthe output while fixing the model parameters. By alternating between forward\nand backward propagation, DeLorean can decode the output representation that\nreflects both the left and right contexts.

          "description": "Multiple parallel attention mechanisms that use multiple attention heads\nfacilitate greater performance of the Transformer model for various\napplications e.g., Neural Machine Translation (NMT), text classification. In\nmulti-head attention mechanism, different heads attend to different parts of\nthe input. However, the limitation is that multiple heads might attend to the\nsame part of the input, resulting in multiple heads being redundant. Thus, the\nmodel resources are under-utilized. One approach to avoid this is to prune\nleast important heads based on certain importance score. In this work, we focus\non designing a Dynamic Head Importance Computation Mechanism (DHICM) to\ndynamically calculate the importance of a head with respect to the input. Our\ninsight is to design an additional attention layer together with multi-head\nattention, and utilize the outputs of the multi-head attention along with the\ninput, to compute the importance for each head. Additionally, we add an extra\nloss function to prevent the model from assigning same score to all heads, to\nidentify more important heads and improvise performance. We analyzed\nperformance of DHICM for NMT with different languages. Experiments on different\ndatasets show that DHICM outperforms traditional Transformer-based approach by\nlarge margin, especially, when less training data is available.",

          "description": "The role of predicting sarcasm in the text is known as automatic sarcasm\ndetection. Given the prevalence and challenges of sarcasm in sentiment-bearing\ntext, this is a critical phase in most sentiment analysis tasks. With the\nincreasing popularity and usage of different social media platforms among users\naround the world, people are using sarcasm more and more in their day-to-day\nconversations, social media posts and tweets, and it is considered as a way for\npeople to express their sentiment about some certain topics or issues. As a\nresult of the increasing popularity, researchers started to focus their\nresearch endeavors on detecting sarcasm from a text in different languages\nespecially the English language. However, the task of sarcasm detection is a\nchallenging task due to the nature of sarcastic texts; which can be relative\nand significantly differs from one person to another depending on the topic,\nregion, the user's mentality and other factors. In addition to these\nchallenges, sarcasm detection in the Arabic language has its own challenges due\nto the complexity of the Arabic language, such as being morphologically rich,\nwith many dialects that significantly vary between each other, while also being\nlowly resourced. In recent years, only few research attempts started tackling\nthe task of sarcasm detection in Arabic, including creating and collecting\ncorpora, organizing workshops and establishing baseline models. This paper\nintends to create a new humanly annotated Arabic corpus for sarcasm detection\ncollected from tweets, and implementing a new approach for sarcasm detection\nand quantification in Arabic tweets. The annotation technique followed in this\npaper is unique in sarcasm detection and the proposed approach tackles the\nproblem as a regression problem instead of classification; i.e., the model\nattempts to predict the level of sarcasm instead of binary classification.",

In human\ncommunication, we can recover from them by repeating misrecognized words or\nphrases; however in human-machine communication this recovery mechanism is not\navailable. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap and present a system\nthat allows a user to correct speech recognition errors in a virtual assistant\nby repeating misunderstood words. When a user repeats part of the phrase the\nsystem rewrites the original query to incorporate the correction. This rewrite\nallows the virtual assistant to understand the original query successfully. We\npresent an end-to-end 2-step attention pointer network that can generate the\nthe rewritten query by merging together the incorrectly understood utterance\nwith the correction follow-up. We evaluate the model on data collected for this\ntask and compare the proposed model to a rule-based baseline and a standard\npointer network. We show that rewriting the original query is an effective way\nto handle repetition-based recovery and that the proposed model outperforms the\nrule based baseline, reducing Word Error Rate by 19% relative at 2% False Alarm\nRate on annotated data.",

Many\npeople forgo these rules, and given the identical phonetic sounds, they often\nconfuse such letters. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term\nmemory network that corrects this class of errors. We develop, train, evaluate,\nand compare a set of BiLSTM networks. We approach the spelling correction\nproblem at the character level. We handle Arabic texts from both classical and\nmodern standard Arabic. We treat the problem as a one-to-one sequence\ntranscription problem. Since the soft Arabic errors class encompasses omission\nand addition mistakes, to preserve the one-to-one sequence transcription, we\npropose a simple low-resource yet effective technique that maintains the\none-to-one sequencing and avoids using a costly encoder-decoder architecture.\nWe train the BiLSTM models to correct the spelling mistakes using transformed\ninput and stochastic error injection approaches. We recommend a configuration\nthat has two BiLSTM layers, uses the dropout regularization, and is trained\nusing the latter training approach with error injection rate of 40%. The best\nmodel corrects 96.4% of the injected errors and achieves a low character error\nrate of 1.28% on a real test set of soft spelling mistakes.",

          "description": "Multi-stage ranking pipelines have been a practical solution in modern search\nsystems, where the first-stage retrieval is to return a subset of candidate\ndocuments, and latter stages attempt to re-rank those candidates. Unlike\nre-ranking stages going through quick technique shifts during past decades, the\nfirst-stage retrieval has long been dominated by classical term-based models.\nUnfortunately, these models suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem, which\nmay block re-ranking stages from relevant documents at the very beginning.\nTherefore, it has been a long-term desire to build semantic models for the\nfirst-stage retrieval that can achieve high recall efficiently. Recently, we\nhave witnessed an explosive growth of research interests on the first-stage\nsemantic retrieval models. We believe it is the right time to survey current\nstatus, learn from existing methods, and gain some insights for future\ndevelopment. In this paper, we describe the current landscape of the\nfirst-stage retrieval models under a unified framework to clarify the\nconnection between classical term-based retrieval methods, early semantic\nretrieval methods and neural semantic retrieval methods. Moreover, we identify\nsome open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of\ninspiring more researches on these important yet less investigated topics.",

In the literature, high localization accuracy is achieved with the\nmainstream strongly supervised frameworks. However, such methods require\nobject-level annotations and are unable to detect objects of unknown\ncategories. Weakly supervised methods face similar difficulties.

The proposed\nframework mines the target instance gradually from the queries and their\ncorresponding top-ranked search results. Since a common instance is shared\nbetween the query and the images in the rank list, the target visual instance\ncan be accurately localized even without knowing what the object category is.\nIn addition to performing localization on instance search, the issue of\nfew-shot object detection is also addressed under the same framework.

In this paper, we formulate a new adversarial attack against\ndeep ranking systems, i.e., the Order Attack, which covertly alters the\nrelative order among a selected set of candidates according to an\nattacker-specified permutation, with limited interference to other unrelated\ncandidates. Specifically, it is formulated as a triplet-style loss imposing an\ninequality chain reflecting the specified permutation. However, direct\noptimization of such white-box objective is infeasible in a real-world attack\nscenario due to various black-box limitations. To cope with them, we propose a\nShort-range Ranking Correlation metric as a surrogate objective for black-box\nOrder Attack to approximate the white-box method. The Order Attack is evaluated\non the Fashion-MNIST and Stanford-Online-Products datasets under both white-box\nand black-box threat models.

          "description": "User response prediction, which aims to predict the probability that a user\nwill provide a predefined positive response in a given context such as clicking\non an ad or purchasing an item, is crucial to many industrial applications such\nas online advertising, recommender systems, and search ranking. However, due to\nthe high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these\ntasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies\nin predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing\nfeature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order\ncross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing\nmethods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model\narchitecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with\nequal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel\narchitecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross\nnetwork's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at\nthe vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of\ndifferent cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head\nattention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to\nperform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed\nmodel can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets. The results have robustly\ndemonstrated that our proposed model DCAP achieves superior prediction\nperformance compared with the state-of-the-art models.",

          "description": "In the current deep learning based recommendation system, the embedding\nmethod is generally employed to complete the conversion from the\nhigh-dimensional sparse feature vector to the low-dimensional dense feature\nvector. However, as the dimension of the input vector of the embedding layer is\ntoo large, the addition of the embedding layer significantly slows down the\nconvergence speed of the entire neural network, which is not acceptable in\nreal-world scenarios. In addition, as the interaction between users and items\nincreases and the relationship between items becomes more complicated, the\nembedding method proposed for sequence data is no longer suitable for graphic\ndata in the current real environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the\nDual-modal Graph Embedding Method (DGEM) to solve these problems. DGEM includes\ntwo modes, static and dynamic. We first construct the item graph to extract the\ngraph structure and use random walk of unequal probability to capture the\nhigh-order proximity between the items. Then we generate the graph embedding\nvector through the Skip-Gram model, and finally feed the downstream deep neural\nnetwork for the recommendation task. The experimental results show that DGEM\ncan mine the high-order proximity between items and enhance the expression\nability of the recommendation model. Meanwhile it also improves the\nrecommendation performance by utilizing the time dependent relationship between\nitems.",

          "description": "Search result diversification is a beneficial approach to overcome\nunder-specified queries, such as those that are ambiguous or multi-faceted.\nExisting approaches often rely on massive query logs and interaction data to\ngenerate a variety of possible query intents, which then can be used to re-rank\ndocuments. However, relying on user interaction data is problematic because one\nfirst needs a massive user base to build a sufficient log; public query logs\nare insufficient on their own. Given the recent success of causal language\nmodels (such as the Text-To-Text Transformer (T5) model) at text generation\ntasks, we explore the capacity of these models to generate potential query\nintents. We find that to encourage diversity in the generated queries, it is\nbeneficial to adapt the model by including a new Distributional Causal Language\nModeling (DCLM) objective during fine-tuning and a representation replacement\nduring inference. Across six standard evaluation benchmarks, we find that our\nmethod (which we call IntenT5) improves search result diversity and attains\n(and sometimes exceeds) the diversity obtained when using query suggestions\nbased on a proprietary query log.

          "description": "Numerous neural retrieval models have been proposed in recent years. These\nmodels learn to compute a ranking score between the given query and document.\nThe majority of existing models are trained in pairwise fashion using\nhuman-judged labels directly without further calibration. The traditional\npairwise schemes can be time-consuming and require pre-defined\npositive-negative document pairs for training, potentially leading to learning\nbias due to document distribution mismatch between training and test\nconditions. Some popular existing listwise schemes rely on the strong\npre-defined probabilistic assumptions and stark difference between relevant and\nnon-relevant documents for the given query, which may limit the model potential\ndue to the low-quality or ambiguous relevance labels. To address these\nconcerns, we turn to a physics-inspired ranking balance scheme and propose\nPoolRank, a pooling-based listwise learning framework. The proposed scheme has\nfour major advantages: (1) PoolRank extracts training information from the best\ncandidates at the local level based on model performance and relative ranking\namong abundant document candidates. (2) By combining four pooling-based loss\ncomponents in a multi-task learning fashion, PoolRank calibrates the ranking\nbalance for the partially relevant and the highly non-relevant documents\nautomatically without costly human inspection. (3) PoolRank can be easily\ngeneralized to any neural retrieval model without requiring additional\nlearnable parameters or model structure modifications. (4) Compared to pairwise\nlearning and existing listwise learning schemes, PoolRank yields better ranking\nperformance for all studied retrieval models while retaining efficient\nconvergence rates.",

          "description": "Traditional recommendation systems are faced with two long-standing\nobstacles, namely, data sparsity and cold-start problems, which promote the\nemergence and development of Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR). The core idea\nof CDR is to leverage information collected from other domains to alleviate the\ntwo problems in one domain. Over the last decade, many efforts have been\nengaged for cross-domain recommendation. Recently, with the development of deep\nlearning and neural networks, a large number of methods have emerged. However,\nthere is a limited number of systematic surveys on CDR, especially regarding\nthe latest proposed methods as well as the recommendation scenarios and\nrecommendation tasks they address. In this survey paper, we first proposed a\ntwo-level taxonomy of cross-domain recommendation which classifies different\nrecommendation scenarios and recommendation tasks. We then introduce and\nsummarize existing cross-domain recommendation approaches under different\nrecommendation scenarios in a structured manner. We also organize datasets\ncommonly used. We conclude this survey by providing several potential research\ndirections about this field.",

          "description": "Exposure bias is a well-known issue in recommender systems where items and\nsuppliers are not equally represented in the recommendation results. This is\nespecially problematic when bias is amplified over time as a few popular items\nare repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists. This phenomenon can be\nviewed as a recommendation feedback loop: the system repeatedly recommends\ncertain items at different time points and interactions of users with those\nitems will amplify bias towards those items over time. This issue has been\nextensively studied in the literature on model-based or neighborhood-based\nrecommendation algorithms, but less work has been done on online recommendation\nmodels such as those based on multi-armed Bandit algorithms. In this paper, we\nstudy exposure bias in a class of well-known bandit algorithms known as Linear\nCascade Bandits. We analyze these algorithms on their ability to handle\nexposure bias and provide a fair representation for items and suppliers in the\nrecommendation results. Our analysis reveals that these algorithms fail to\ntreat items and suppliers fairly and do not sufficiently explore the item space\nfor each user. To mitigate this bias, we propose a discounting factor and\nincorporate it into these algorithms that controls the exposure of items at\neach time step. To show the effectiveness of the proposed discounting factor on\nmitigating exposure bias, we perform experiments on two datasets using three\ncascading bandit algorithms and our experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod improves the exposure fairness for items and suppliers.",

While\nthere has been much work in streamlining, caching, and modifying transformer\narchitectures for production, here we explore a new direction: distilling a\nlarge pre-trained translation model into a lightweight bi-encoder which can be\nefficiently cached and queried. We argue from a probabilistic perspective that\nsequence-to-sequence models are a conceptually ideal---albeit highly\nimpractical---retriever. We derive a new distillation objective, implementing\nit as a data augmentation scheme.

          "description": "Motives or goals are recognized in psychology literature as the most\nfundamental drive that explains and predicts why people do what they do,\nincluding when they browse the web. Although providing enormous value, these\nhigher-ordered goals are often unobserved, and little is known about how to\nleverage such goals to assist people's browsing activities. This paper proposes\nto take a new approach to address this problem, which is fulfilled through a\nnovel neural framework, Goal-directed Web Browsing (GoWeB). We adopt a\npsychologically-sound taxonomy of higher-ordered goals and learn to build their\nrepresentations in a structure-preserving manner. Then we incorporate the\nresulting representations for enhancing the experiences of common activities\npeople perform on the web. Experiments on large-scale data from Microsoft Edge\nweb browser show that GoWeB significantly outperforms competitive baselines for\nin-session web page recommendation, re-visitation classification, and\ngoal-based web page grouping. A follow-up analysis further characterizes how\nthe variety of human motives can affect the difference observed in human\nbehavioral patterns.",

          "description": "The online estimation of rhythmic information, such as beat positions,\ndownbeat positions, and meter, is critical for many real-time music\napplications. Musical rhythm comprises complex hierarchical relationships\nacross time, rendering its analysis intrinsically challenging and at times\nsubjective. Furthermore, systems which attempt to estimate rhythmic information\nin real-time must be causal and must produce estimates quickly and efficiently.\nIn this work, we introduce an online system for joint beat, downbeat, and meter\ntracking, which utilizes causal convolutional and recurrent layers, followed by\na pair of sequential Monte Carlo particle filters applied during inference. The\nproposed system does not need to be primed with a time signature in order to\nperform downbeat tracking, and is instead able to estimate meter and adjust the\npredictions over time. Additionally, we propose an information gate strategy to\nsignificantly decrease the computational cost of particle filtering during the\ninference step, making the system much faster than previous sampling-based\nmethods. Experiments on the GTZAN dataset, which is unseen during training,\nshow that the system outperforms various online beat and downbeat tracking\nsystems and achieves comparable performance to a baseline offline joint method.",

          "description": "BERT-based Neural Ranking Models (NRMs) can be classified according to how\nthe query and document are encoded through BERT's self-attention layers -\nbi-encoder versus cross-encoder. Bi-encoder models are highly efficient because\nall the documents can be pre-processed before the query time, but their\nperformance is inferior compared to cross-encoder models. Both models utilize a\nranker that receives BERT representations as the input and generates a\nrelevance score as the output. In this work, we propose a method where\nmulti-teacher distillation is applied to a cross-encoder NRM and a bi-encoder\nNRM to produce a bi-encoder NRM with two rankers. The resulting student\nbi-encoder achieves an improved performance by simultaneously learning from a\ncross-encoder teacher and a bi-encoder teacher and also by combining relevance\nscores from the two rankers. We call this method TRMD (Two Rankers and\nMulti-teacher Distillation). In the experiments, TwinBERT and ColBERT are\nconsidered as baseline bi-encoders. When monoBERT is used as the cross-encoder\nteacher, together with either TwinBERT or ColBERT as the bi-encoder teacher,\nTRMD produces a student bi-encoder that performs better than the corresponding\nbaseline bi-encoder. For P@20, the maximum improvement was 11.4%, and the\naverage improvement was 6.8%. As an additional experiment, we considered\nproducing cross-encoder students with TRMD, and found that it could also\nimprove the cross-encoders.",

          "description": "Hybrid recommendations have recently attracted a lot of attention where user\nfeatures are utilized as auxiliary information to address the sparsity problem\ncaused by insufficient user-item interactions. However, extracted user features\ngenerally contain rich multimodal information, and most of them are irrelevant\nto the recommendation purpose. Therefore, excessive reliance on these features\nwill make the model overfit on noise and difficult to generalize. In this\narticle, we propose a variational bandwidth auto-encoder (VBAE) for\nrecommendations, aiming to address the sparsity and noise problems\nsimultaneously. VBAE first encodes user collaborative and feature information\ninto Gaussian latent variables via deep neural networks to capture non-linear\nuser similarities. Moreover, by considering the fusion of collaborative and\nfeature variables as a virtual communication channel from an\ninformation-theoretic perspective, we introduce a user-dependent channel to\ndynamically control the information allowed to be accessed from the feature\nembeddings. A quantum-inspired uncertainty measurement of the hidden rating\nembeddings is proposed accordingly to infer the channel bandwidth by\ndisentangling the uncertainty information in the ratings from the semantic\ninformation. Through this mechanism, VBAE incorporates adequate auxiliary\ninformation from user features if collaborative information is insufficient,\nwhile avoiding excessive reliance on noisy user features to improve its\ngeneralization ability to new users. Extensive experiments conducted on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Codes\nand datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/vbae.",

We then present a\nperformer identification method based on the similarity of feature\ndistribution, given a set of piano performances. The identification is done\nconsidering each feature individually as well as a fusion of the features.\nResults show that the proposed method achieved a precision of 0.903 using\nfusion features. Moreover, the onset time deviation feature shows promising\nresult when considered individually.",

          "description": "Reasoning on knowledge graph (KG) has been studied for explainable\nrecommendation due to it's ability of providing explicit explanations. However,\ncurrent KG-based explainable recommendation methods unfortunately ignore the\ntemporal information (such as purchase time, recommend time, etc.), which may\nresult in unsuitable explanations. In this work, we propose a novel Time-aware\nPath reasoning for Recommendation (TPRec for short) method, which leverages the\npotential of temporal information to offer better recommendation with plausible\nexplanations. First, we present an efficient time-aware interaction relation\nextraction component to construct collaborative knowledge graph with time-aware\ninteractions (TCKG for short), and then introduce a novel time-aware path\nreasoning method for recommendation.

Our main contribution is a novel variant of the Multistreaming\nTime-Delay Neural Network (MTDNN) architecture, called MSTRE-Net, which\nprocesses the temporal information using multiple streams in parallel with\nvarying resolutions keeping the network more compact, and thus with a faster\ninference and an improved recognition rate than having identical TDNN streams.\nIn addition, two novel preprocessing steps prior to training the acoustic model\nare proposed. First, we suggest using recordings from both monophonic and\npolyphonic domains during training the acoustic model.

Moreover, we present a\nnew test set with a considerably larger size and a higher musical variability\ncompared to the existing datasets used in ALT literature, while maintaining the\ngender balance of the singers.

          "description": "Matching items for a user from a travel item pool of large cardinality have\nbeen the most important technology for increasing the business at Fliggy, one\nof the most popular online travel platforms (OTPs) in China. There are three\nmajor challenges facing OTPs: sparsity, diversity, and implicitness. In this\npaper, we present a novel Fliggy ITinerary-aware deep matching NETwork (FitNET)\nto address these three challenges. FitNET is designed based on the popular deep\nmatching network, which has been successfully employed in many industrial\nrecommendation systems, due to its effectiveness. The concept itinerary is\nfirstly proposed under the context of recommendation systems for OTPs, which is\ndefined as the list of unconsumed orders of a user. All orders in a user\nitinerary are learned as a whole, based on which the implicit travel intention\nof each user can be more accurately inferred. To alleviate the sparsity\nproblem, users' profiles are incorporated into FitNET. Meanwhile, a series of\nitinerary-aware attention mechanisms that capture the vital interactions\nbetween user's itinerary and other input categories are carefully designed.\nThese mechanisms are very helpful in inferring a user's travel intention or\npreference, and handling the diversity in a user's need. Further, two training\nobjectives, i.e., prediction accuracy of user's travel intention and prediction\naccuracy of user's click behavior, are utilized by FitNET, so that these two\nobjectives can be optimized simultaneously. An offline experiment on Fliggy\nproduction dataset with over 0.27 million users and 1.55 million travel items,\nand an online A/B test both show that FitNET effectively learns users' travel\nintentions, preferences, and diverse needs, based on their itineraries and\ngains superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. FitNET now\nhas been successfully deployed at Fliggy, serving major online traffic.",

          "description": "Most current recommender systems used the historical behaviour data of user\nto predict user' preference. However, it is difficult to recommend items to new\nusers accurately. To alleviate this problem, existing user cold start methods\neither apply deep learning to build a cross-domain recommender system or map\nuser attributes into the space of user behaviour. These methods are more\nchallenging when applied to online travel platform (e.g., Fliggy), because it\nis hard to find a cross-domain that user has similar behaviour with travel\nscenarios and the Location Based Services (LBS) information of users have not\nbeen paid sufficient attention. In this work, we propose a LBS-based\nHeterogeneous Relations Model (LHRM) for user cold start recommendation, which\nutilizes user's LBS information and behaviour information in related domains\nand user's behaviour information in travel platforms (e.g., Fliggy) to\nconstruct the heterogeneous relations between users and items. Moreover, an\nattention-based multi-layer perceptron is applied to extract latent factors of\nusers and items. Through this way, LHRM has better generalization performance\nthan existing methods. Experimental results on real data from Fliggy's offline\nlog illustrate the effectiveness of LHRM.",

          "description": "Assessing an AI agent that can converse in human language and understand\nvisual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor\ncorrect syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,\nwhere an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)\nmetric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a\nsingle human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:\nthe ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence\n(e.g., `yeah' and `yes'). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative\ngain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct\nanswers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually\napplicable uncertain answers such as `I don't know. Crafting a model that\nexcels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should\nanswer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To\naddress this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that\ncan merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep\nmost MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG\nstate-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%).

State-of-the-art recommendation models\nare one of the largest models rivalling the likes of GPT-3 and Switch\nTransformer. Challenges in deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) stem from\nlearning dense embeddings for each of the categorical values. These embedding\ntables in industrial scale models can be as large as hundreds of terabytes.\nSuch large models lead to a plethora of engineering challenges, not to mention\nprohibitive communication overheads, and slower training and inference times.\nOf these, slower inference time directly impacts user experience. Model\ncompression for DLRM is gaining traction and the community has recently shown\nimpressive compression results. In this paper, we present Random Offset Block\nEmbedding Array (ROBE) as a low memory alternative to embedding tables which\nprovide orders of magnitude reduction in memory usage while maintaining\naccuracy and boosting execution speed. ROBE is a simple fundamental approach in\nimproving both cache performance and the variance of randomized hashing, which\ncould be of independent interest in itself. We demonstrate that we can\nsuccessfully train DLRM models with same accuracy while using $1000 \\times$\nless memory. A $1000\\times$ compressed model directly results in faster\ninference without any engineering. In particular, we show that we can train\nDLRM model using ROBE Array of size 100MB on a single GPU to achieve AUC of\n0.8025 or higher as required by official MLPerf CriteoTB benchmark DLRM model\nof 100GB while achieving about $2.7\\times$ (170\\%) improvement in inference\nthroughput.",

          "description": "Recommender systems research tends to evaluate model performance offline and\non randomly sampled targets, yet the same systems are later used to predict\nuser behavior sequentially from a fixed point in time. Simulating online\nrecommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy\nbetween online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline\nevaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model\nis deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how\nomitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads\nto false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation\nprotocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal\ncontext. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal\ncontext in existing models: we introduce it in a multi-objective approach to\ntraditionally time-unaware recommender systems and confirm its advantage via\nthe proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we validate that the Pareto Fronts\nobtained with the added objective dominate those produced by state-of-the-art\nmodels that are only optimized for accuracy on three real-world publicly\navailable datasets. The results show that including our temporal objective can\nimprove recall@20 by up to 20%.",

The flexibility advantage over structured knowledge bases\ncomes with the drawback of finding the right query for a certain information\nneed. Inspired by human behavior to disambiguate a question, we propose to\nquery LMs by example. To clarify the ambivalent question \"Who does Neuer play\nfor?\", a successful strategy is to demonstrate the relation using another\nsubject, e.g., \"Ronaldo plays for Portugal. Who does Neuer play for?\". We apply\nthis approach of querying by example to the LAMA probe and obtain substantial\nimprovements of up to 37.8% for BERT-large on the T-REx data when providing\nonly 10 demonstrations--even outperforming a baseline that queries the model\nwith up to 40 paraphrases of the question.

The intuition is that user-item interactions in a\nsource domain can augment the recommendation quality in a target domain. The\nintuition can be taken to its extreme, where, in a cross-domain setup, the user\nhistory in a source domain is enough to generate high-quality recommendations\nin a target one. We thus create a Product-of-Experts (POE) architecture for\nrecommendations that jointly models user-item interactions across multiple\ndomains. The method is resilient to missing data for one or more of the\ndomains, which is a situation often found in real life. We present results on\ntwo widely-used datasets - Amazon and Yelp, which support the claim that\nholistic user preference knowledge leads to better recommendations.\nSurprisingly, we find that in some cases, a POE recommender that does not\naccess the target domain user representation can surpass a strong VAE\nrecommender baseline trained on the target domain.",

          "description": "Providing suitable recommendations is of vital importance to improve the user\nsatisfaction of music recommender systems. Here, users often listen to the same\ntrack repeatedly and appreciate recommendations of the same song multiple\ntimes. Thus, accounting for users' relistening behavior is critical for music\nrecommender systems. In this paper, we describe a psychology-informed approach\nto model and predict music relistening behavior that is inspired by studies in\nmusic psychology, which relate music preferences to human memory. We adopt a\nwell-established psychological theory of human cognition that models the\noperations of human memory, i.e., Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R).\nIn contrast to prior work, which uses only the base-level component of ACT-R,\nwe utilize five components of ACT-R, i.e., base-level, spreading, partial\nmatching, valuation, and noise, to investigate the effect of five factors on\nmusic relistening behavior: (i) recency and frequency of prior exposure to\ntracks, (ii) co-occurrence of tracks, (iii) the similarity between tracks, (iv)\nfamiliarity with tracks, and (v) randomness in behavior. On a dataset of 1.7\nmillion listening events from Last.fm, we evaluate the performance of our\napproach by sequentially predicting the next track(s) in user sessions. We find\nthat recency and frequency of prior exposure to tracks is an effective\npredictor of relistening behavior. Besides, considering the co-occurrence of\ntracks and familiarity with tracks further improves performance in terms of\nR-precision. We hope that our work inspires future research on the merits of\nconsidering cognitive aspects of memory retrieval to model and predict complex\nuser behavior.",

The total number of distinct keywords over the\nsaid time span has been found as 1155, which have been analyzed into 869\nnumbers of single words having total frequency of occurrence of 2287. The\nsingle words obtained from keywords have been categorized in four broad\nclasses, viz. eponymous word, form word, acronym and semantic word. A semantic\nword bears several contexts and thus may be considered as relevant in several\nother subject areas. These probable relevant subject areas have been found with\nthe aid of two popular online reference tools. The semantic words are further\ncategorized in twelve classes according to their contexts. Some parameters have\nbeen defined on the basis of associations among the words and formation of\nkeywords in consequence, i.e. Word Association Density, Word Association\nCoefficient and Keyword Formation Density. The values of these parameters have\nbeen observed for different word categories. The statistics of word association\ntending keyword formation would be known from this study.

          "description": "Recommender systems(RS), especially collaborative filtering(CF) based RS, has\nbeen playing an important role in many e-commerce applications. As the\ninformation being searched over the internet is rapidly increasing, users often\nface the difficulty of finding items of his/her own interest and RS often\nprovides help in such tasks. Recent studies show that, as the item space\nincreases, and the number of items rated by the users become very less, issues\nlike sparsity arise. To mitigate the sparsity problem, transfer learning\ntechniques are being used wherein the data from dense domain(source) is\nconsidered in order to predict the missing entries in the sparse\ndomain(target). In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach for\ncross-domain recommendation when both domains have no overlap of users and\nitems. In our approach the transferring of knowledge from source to target\ndomain is done in a novel way. We make use of co-clustering technique to obtain\nthe codebook (cluster-level rating pattern) of source domain. By making use of\nhinge loss function we transfer the learnt codebook of the source domain to\ntarget. The use of hinge loss as a loss function is novel and has not been\ntried before in transfer learning. We demonstrate that our technique improves\nthe approximation of the target matrix on benchmark datasets.",

However, existing video-music retrieval methods only\nbased on the visual modality cannot show promising performance regarding videos\nwith fine-grained virtual contents. In this paper, we also investigate the\nwidely added voice-overs in short videos and propose a novel framework to\nretrieve BGM for fine-grained short videos. In our framework, we use the\nself-attention (SA) and the cross-modal attention (CMA) modules to explore the\nintra- and the inter-relationships of different modalities respectively. For\nbalancing the modalities, we dynamically assign different weights to the modal\nfeatures via a fusion gate. For paring the query and the BGM embeddings, we\nintroduce a triplet pseudo-label loss to constrain the semantics of the modal\nembeddings. As there are no existing virtual-content video-BGM retrieval\ndatasets, we build and release two virtual-content video datasets HoK400 and\nCFM400.

          "description": "E-commerce sites strive to provide users the most timely relevant information\nin order to reduce shopping frictions and increase customer satisfaction. Multi\narmed bandit models (MAB) as a type of adaptive optimization algorithms provide\npossible approaches for such purposes. In this paper, we analyze using three\nclassic MAB algorithms, epsilon-greedy, Thompson sampling (TS), and upper\nconfidence bound 1 (UCB1) for dynamic content recommendations, and walk through\nthe process of developing these algorithms internally to solve a real world\ne-commerce use case. First, we analyze the three MAB algorithms using simulated\npurchasing datasets with non-stationary reward distributions to simulate the\npossible time-varying customer preferences, where the traffic allocation\ndynamics and the accumulative rewards of different algorithms are studied.\nSecond, we compare the accumulative rewards of the three MAB algorithms with\nmore than 1,000 trials using actual historical A/B test datasets. We find that\nthe larger difference between the success rates of competing recommendations\nthe more accumulative rewards the MAB algorithms can achieve. In addition, we\nfind that TS shows the highest average accumulative rewards under different\ntesting scenarios. Third, we develop a batch-updated MAB algorithm to overcome\nthe delayed reward issue in e-commerce and enable an online content\noptimization on our App homepage. For a state-of-the-art comparison, a real A/B\ntest among our batch-updated MAB algorithm, a third-party MAB solution, and the\ndefault business logic are conducted. The result shows that our batch-updated\nMAB algorithm outperforms the counterparts and achieves 6.13% relative\nclick-through rate (CTR) increase and 16.1% relative conversion rate (CVR)\nincrease compared to the default experience, and 2.9% relative CTR increase and\n1.4% relative CVR increase compared to the external MAB service.",

          "description": "Accounting for the fact that users have different sequential patterns, the\nmain drawback of state-of-the-art recommendation strategies is that a fixed\nsequence length of user-item interactions is required as input to train the\nmodels. This might limit the recommendation accuracy, as in practice users\nfollow different trends on the sequential recommendations. Hence, baseline\nstrategies might ignore important sequential interactions or add noise to the\nmodels with redundant interactions, depending on the variety of users'\nsequential behaviours. To overcome this problem, in this study we propose the\nSAR model, which not only learns the sequential patterns but also adjusts the\nsequence length of user-item interactions in a personalized manner. We first\ndesign an actor-critic framework, where the RL agent tries to compute the\noptimal sequence length as an action, given the user's state representation at\na certain time step. In addition, we optimize a joint loss function to align\nthe accuracy of the sequential recommendations with the expected cumulative\nrewards of the critic network, while at the same time we adapt the sequence\nlength with the actor network in a personalized manner. Our experimental\nevaluation on four real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our\nproposed model over several baseline approaches.

          "description": "Reading comprehension is a complex cognitive process involving many human\nbrain activities. Plenty of works have studied the reading patterns and\nattention allocation mechanisms in the reading process. However, little is\nknown about what happens in human brain during reading comprehension and how we\ncan utilize this information as implicit feedback to facilitate information\nacquisition performance. With the advances in brain imaging techniques such as\nEEG, it is possible to collect high-precision brain signals in almost real\ntime. With neuroimaging techniques, we carefully design a lab-based user study\nto investigate brain activities during reading comprehension. Our findings show\nthat neural responses vary with different types of contents, i.e., contents\nthat can satisfy users' information needs and contents that cannot. We suggest\nthat various cognitive activities, e.g., cognitive loading, semantic-thematic\nunderstanding, and inferential processing, at the micro-time scale during\nreading comprehension underpin these neural responses. Inspired by these\ndetectable differences in cognitive activities, we construct supervised\nlearning models based on EEG features for two reading comprehension tasks:\nanswer sentence classification and answer extraction. Results show that it is\nfeasible to improve their performance with brain signals. These findings imply\nthat brain signals are valuable feedback for enhancing human-computer\ninteractions during reading comprehension.",

          "description": "Click-through rate prediction is one of the core tasks in commercial\nrecommender systems. It aims to predict the probability of a user clicking a\nparticular item given user and item features. As feature interactions bring in\nnon-linearity, they are widely adopted to improve the performance of CTR\nprediction models. Therefore, effectively modelling feature interactions has\nattracted much attention in both the research and industry field. The current\napproaches can generally be categorized into three classes: (1) na\\\"ive\nmethods, which do not model feature interactions and only use original\nfeatures; (2) memorized methods, which memorize feature interactions by\nexplicitly viewing them as new features and assigning trainable embeddings; (3)\nfactorized methods, which learn latent vectors for original features and\nimplicitly model feature interactions through factorization functions. Studies\nhave shown that modelling feature interactions by one of these methods alone\nare suboptimal due to the unique characteristics of different feature\ninteractions. To address this issue, we first propose a general framework\ncalled OptInter which finds the most suitable modelling method for each feature\ninteraction. Different state-of-the-art deep CTR models can be viewed as\ninstances of OptInter. To realize the functionality of OptInter, we also\nintroduce a learning algorithm that automatically searches for the optimal\nmodelling method. We conduct extensive experiments on four large datasets. Our\nexperiments show that OptInter improves the best performed state-of-the-art\nbaseline deep CTR models by up to 2.21%. Compared to the memorized method,\nwhich also outperforms baselines, we reduce up to 91% parameters. In addition,\nwe conduct several ablation studies to investigate the influence of different\ncomponents of OptInter. Finally, we provide interpretable discussions on the\nresults of OptInter.",

          "description": "Recent work has demonstrated the viability of using crowdsourcing as a tool\nfor evaluating the truthfulness of public statements. Under certain conditions\nsuch as: (1) having a balanced set of workers with different backgrounds and\ncognitive abilities; (2) using an adequate set of mechanisms to control the\nquality of the collected data; and (3) using a coarse grained assessment scale,\nthe crowd can provide reliable identification of fake news. However, fake news\nare a subtle matter: statements can be just biased (\"cherrypicked\"), imprecise,\nwrong, etc. and the unidimensional truth scale used in existing work cannot\naccount for such differences. In this paper we propose a multidimensional\nnotion of truthfulness and we ask the crowd workers to assess seven different\ndimensions of truthfulness selected based on existing literature: Correctness,\nNeutrality, Comprehensibility, Precision, Completeness, Speaker's\nTrustworthiness, and Informativeness. We deploy a set of quality control\nmechanisms to ensure that the thousands of assessments collected on 180\npublicly available fact-checked statements distributed over two datasets are of\nadequate quality, including a custom search engine used by the crowd workers to\nfind web pages supporting their truthfulness assessments. A comprehensive\nanalysis of crowdsourced judgments shows that: (1) the crowdsourced assessments\nare reliable when compared to an expert-provided gold standard; (2) the\nproposed dimensions of truthfulness capture independent pieces of information;\n(3) the crowdsourcing task can be easily learned by the workers; and (4) the\nresulting assessments provide a useful basis for a more complete estimation of\nstatement truthfulness.",

          "description": "User response prediction, which aims to predict the probability that a user\nwill provide a predefined positive response in a given context such as clicking\non an ad or purchasing an item, is crucial to many industrial applications such\nas online advertising, recommender systems, and search ranking. However, due to\nthe high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these\ntasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies\nin predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing\nfeature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order\ncross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing\nmethods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model\narchitecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with\nequal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel\narchitecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross\nnetwork's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at\nthe vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of\ndifferent cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head\nattention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to\nperform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed\nmodel can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets. The results have robustly\ndemonstrated that our proposed model DCAP achieves superior prediction\nperformance compared with the state-of-the-art models.",

          "description": "Hashing learns compact binary codes to store and retrieve massive data\nefficiently. Particularly, unsupervised deep hashing is supported by powerful\ndeep neural networks and has the desirable advantage of label independence. It\nis a promising technique for scalable image retrieval. However, deep models\nintroduce a large number of parameters, which is hard to optimize due to the\nlack of explicit semantic labels and brings considerable training cost. As a\nresult, the retrieval accuracy and training efficiency of existing unsupervised\ndeep hashing are still limited. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we\npropose a simple and efficient \\emph{Lightweight Augmented Graph Network\nHashing} (LAGNH) method with a two-pronged strategy. For one thing, we extract\nthe inner structure of the image as the auxiliary semantics to enhance the\nsemantic supervision of the unsupervised hash learning process. For another, we\ndesign a lightweight network structure with the assistance of the auxiliary\nsemantics, which greatly reduces the number of network parameters that needs to\nbe optimized and thus greatly accelerates the training process. Specifically,\nwe design a cross-modal attention module based on the auxiliary semantic\ninformation to adaptively mitigate the adverse effects in the deep image\nfeatures. Besides, the hash codes are learned by multi-layer message passing\nwithin an adversarial regularized graph convolutional network. Simultaneously,\nthe semantic representation capability of hash codes is further enhanced by\nreconstructing the similarity graph.",

          "description": "This paper investigates a valuable setting called few-shot unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (FS-UDA), which has not been sufficiently studied in the\nliterature. In this setting, the source domain data are labelled, but with\nfew-shot per category, while the target domain data are unlabelled. To address\nthe FS-UDA setting, we develop a general UDA model to solve the following two\nkey issues: the few-shot labeled data per category and the domain adaptation\nbetween support and query sets. Our model is general in that once trained it\nwill be able to be applied to various FS-UDA tasks from the same source and\ntarget domains. Inspired by the recent local descriptor based few-shot learning\n(FSL), our general UDA model is fully built upon local descriptors (LDs) for\nimage classification and domain adaptation. By proposing a novel concept called\nsimilarity patterns (SPs), our model not only effectively considers the spatial\nrelationship of LDs that was ignored in previous FSL methods, but also makes\nthe learned image similarity better serve the required domain alignment.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel IMage-to-class sparse Similarity Encoding\n(IMSE) method. It learns SPs to extract the local discriminative information\nfor classification and meanwhile aligns the covariance matrix of the SPs for\ndomain adaptation. Also, domain adversarial training and multi-scale local\nfeature matching are performed upon LDs. Extensive experiments conducted on a\nmulti-domain benchmark dataset DomainNet demonstrates the state-of-the-art\nperformance of our IMSE for the novel setting of FS-UDA. In addition, for FSL,\nour IMSE can also show better performance than most of recent FSL methods on\nminiImageNet.",

          "description": "We introduce a new efficient framework, the Unified Context Network (UniCon),\nfor robust active speaker detection (ASD). Traditional methods for ASD usually\noperate on each candidate's pre-cropped face track separately and do not\nsufficiently consider the relationships among the candidates. This potentially\nlimits performance, especially in challenging scenarios with low-resolution\nfaces, multiple candidates, etc. Our solution is a novel, unified framework\nthat focuses on jointly modeling multiple types of contextual information:\nspatial context to indicate the position and scale of each candidate's face,\nrelational context to capture the visual relationships among the candidates and\ncontrast audio-visual affinities with each other, and temporal context to\naggregate long-term information and smooth out local uncertainties. Based on\nsuch information, our model optimizes all candidates in a unified process for\nrobust and reliable ASD. A thorough ablation study is performed on several\nchallenging ASD benchmarks under different settings. In particular, our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin of about 15% mean Average\nPrecision (mAP) absolute on two challenging subsets: one with three candidate\nspeakers, and the other with faces smaller than 64 pixels. Together, our UniCon\nachieves 92.0% mAP on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker validation set, surpassing 90% for\nthe first time on this challenging dataset at the time of submission.

          "description": "The amount of multimedia content shared everyday, combined with the level of\nrealism reached by recent fake-generating technologies, threatens to impair the\ntrustworthiness of online information sources. The process of uploading and\nsharing data tends to hinder standard media forensic analyses, since multiple\nre-sharing steps progressively hide the traces of past manipulations. At the\nsame time though, new traces are introduced by the platforms themselves,\nenabling the reconstruction of the sharing history of digital objects, with\npossible applications in information flow monitoring and source identification.\nIn this work, we propose a supervised framework for the reconstruction of image\nsharing chains on social media platforms. The system is structured as a cascade\nof backtracking blocks, each of them tracing back one step of the sharing chain\nat a time. Blocks are designed as ensembles of classifiers trained to analyse\nthe input image independently from one another by leveraging different feature\nrepresentations that describe both content and container of the media object.\nIndividual decisions are then properly combined by a late fusion strategy.\nResults highlight the advantages of employing multiple clues, which allow\naccurately tracing back up to three steps along the sharing chain.",

          "description": "Over the last few decades, artificial intelligence research has made\ntremendous strides, but it still heavily relies on fixed datasets in stationary\nenvironments. Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines\nhow AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data\nin the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as\ndeepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current\nmultimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can\ndetect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to\ntheir reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in\nthis work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks' learning dynamics,\nemphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose\nContinual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the\nconcept of Continual Learning (CL), Representation Learning (RL), and Knowledge\nDistillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain adaptation\ntasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets, while\neffectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student model\nsetting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method is\nefficient at domain adaptation to detect low-quality deepfakes videos and\nGAN-generated images from several datasets, outperforming the-state-of-art\nbaseline methods.",

In this context, this paper proposes a joint geometry\nand color projection-based point cloud objective quality metric which solves\nthe critical weakness of this type of quality metrics, i.e., the misalignment\nbetween the reference and degraded projected images. Moreover, the proposed\npoint cloud quality metric exploits the best performing 2D quality metrics in\nthe literature to assess the quality of the projected images. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed projection-based quality metric offers the best\nsubjective-objective correlation performance in comparison with other metrics\nin the literature.

As a\npotential alternative to convolutional neural networks, it shares merits of\nstrong interpretability, high discriminative power on hyper-scale data, and\nflexibility in processing varying length inputs. However, its encoders\nnaturally contain computational intensive operations such as pair-wise\nself-attention, incurring heavy computational burden when being applied on the\ncomplex 3-dimensional video signals.\n\nThis paper presents Token Shift Module (i.e., TokShift), a novel,\nzero-parameter, zero-FLOPs operator, for modeling temporal relations within\neach transformer encoder. Specifically, the TokShift barely temporally shifts\npartial [Class] token features back-and-forth across adjacent frames.

          "description": "The latest trend in the bottom-up perspective for arbitrary-shape scene text\ndetection is to reason the links between text segments using Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN). Notwithstanding, the performance of the best\nperforming bottom-up method is still inferior to that of the best performing\ntop-down method even with the help of GCN. We argue that this is not mainly\ncaused by the limited feature capturing ability of the text proposal backbone\nor GCN, but by their failure to make a full use of visual-relational features\nfor suppressing false detection, as well as the sub-optimal route-finding\nmechanism used for grouping text segments. In this paper, we revitalize the\nclassic text detection frameworks by aggregating the visual-relational features\nof text with two effective false positive/negative suppression mechanisms.\nFirst, dense overlapping text segments depicting the `characterness' and\n`streamline' of text are generated for further relational reasoning and weakly\nsupervised segment classification. Here, relational graph features are used for\nsuppressing false positives/negatives. Then, to fuse the relational features\nwith visual features, a Location-Aware Transfer (LAT) module is designed to\ntransfer text's relational features into visual compatible features with a Fuse\nDecoding (FD) module to enhance the representation of text regions for the\nsecond step suppression. Finally, a novel multiple-text-map-aware\ncontour-approximation strategy is developed, instead of the widely-used\nroute-finding process. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets, i.e.,\nCTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR2015, MSRA-TD500, and MLT2017 demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art performance when being embedded in a\nclassic text detection framework, which revitalises the superb strength of the\nbottom-up methods.",

          "description": "Recently, the witness of the rapidly growing popularity of short videos on\ndifferent Internet platforms has intensified the need for a background music\n(BGM) retrieval system. However, existing video-music retrieval methods only\nbased on the visual modality cannot show promising performance regarding videos\nwith fine-grained virtual contents. In this paper, we also investigate the\nwidely added voice-overs in short videos and propose a novel framework to\nretrieve BGM for fine-grained short videos. In our framework, we use the\nself-attention (SA) and the cross-modal attention (CMA) modules to explore the\nintra- and the inter-relationships of different modalities respectively. For\nbalancing the modalities, we dynamically assign different weights to the modal\nfeatures via a fusion gate. For paring the query and the BGM embeddings, we\nintroduce a triplet pseudo-label loss to constrain the semantics of the modal\nembeddings. As there are no existing virtual-content video-BGM retrieval\ndatasets, we build and release two virtual-content video datasets HoK400 and\nCFM400. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance\nand outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with large margins.",

Firstly, to\nparticipate in the challenge, we employ a transformer to capture the spatial\ninformation from each modality. Secondly, we employ a temporal attention module\nto model temporal-wise inter-dependency. Thirdly, we employ the adversarial\ndomain adaptation network to learn the general features between labeled source\nand unlabeled target domain. Finally, we incorporate multiple modalities to\nimprove the performance by a three-stream network with late fusion.

We use the Recipe1M\ndataset for the technical description and empirical validation. In\npreprocessing, we perform deep feature calibration by combining deep feature\nengineering with semantic context features derived from raw text-image input\ndata. We leverage LSTM to identify key terms, NLP methods to produce ranking\nscores for key terms before generating the key term feature. We leverage\nwideResNet50 to extract and encode the image category semantics to help\nsemantic alignment of the learned recipe and image embeddings in the joint\nlatent space. In joint embedding learning, we perform deep feature calibration\nby optimizing the batch-hard triplet loss function with soft-margin and double\nnegative sampling, also utilizing the category-based alignment loss and\ndiscriminator-based alignment loss.

          "description": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a type of brain disease which causes visual,\nsensory, and motor problems for people with a detrimental effect on the\nfunctioning of the nervous system. In order to diagnose MS, multiple screening\nmethods have been proposed so far; among them, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nhas received considerable attention among physicians. MRI modalities provide\nphysicians with fundamental information about the structure and function of the\nbrain, which is crucial for the rapid diagnosis of MS lesions. Diagnosing MS\nusing MRI is time-consuming, tedious, and prone to manual errors. Hence,\ncomputer aided diagnosis systems (CADS) based on artificial intelligence (AI)\nmethods have been proposed in recent years for accurate diagnosis of MS using\nMRI neuroimaging modalities. In the AI field, automated MS diagnosis is being\nconducted using (i) conventional machine learning and (ii) deep learning (DL)\ntechniques. The conventional machine learning approach is based on feature\nextraction and selection by trial and error. In DL, these steps are performed\nby the DL model itself. In this paper, a complete review of automated MS\ndiagnosis methods performed using DL techniques with MRI neuroimaging\nmodalities are discussed. Also, each work is thoroughly reviewed and discussed.\nFinally, the most important challenges and future directions in the automated\nMS diagnosis using DL techniques coupled with MRI modalities are presented in\ndetail.",

Third, we introduce a Compound Ranking (CR) loss that makes use\nof textual descriptions for other images of the same identity to provide extra\nsupervision, thereby effectively reducing the intra-class variance in textual\nfeatures. Finally, to expedite future research in text-to-image ReID, we build\na new database named ICFG-PEDES. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSAN\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins.

          "description": "Effectively tackling the problem of temporal action localization (TAL)\nnecessitates a visual representation that jointly pursues two confounding\ngoals, i.e., fine-grained discrimination for temporal localization and\nsufficient visual invariance for action classification. We address this\nchallenge by enriching both the local and global contexts in the popular\ntwo-stage temporal localization framework, where action proposals are first\ngenerated followed by action classification and temporal boundary regression.\nOur proposed model, dubbed ContextLoc, can be divided into three sub-networks:\nL-Net, G-Net and P-Net. L-Net enriches the local context via fine-grained\nmodeling of snippet-level features, which is formulated as a\nquery-and-retrieval process. G-Net enriches the global context via higher-level\nmodeling of the video-level representation. In addition, we introduce a novel\ncontext adaptation module to adapt the global context to different proposals.\nP-Net further models the context-aware inter-proposal relations. We explore two\nexisting models to be the P-Net in our experiments. The efficacy of our\nproposed method is validated by experimental results on the THUMOS14 (54.3\\% at\ntIoU@0.5) and ActivityNet v1.3 (56.01\\% at tIoU@0.5) datasets, which\noutperforms recent states of the art.

Previous\nmethods are either subject to single-modal input or perform supervised\nimage-level product retrieval, thus fail to accommodate real-life scenarios\nwhere enormous weakly annotated multi-modal data are present. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a more realistic setting that aims to perform weakly-supervised\nmulti-modal instance-level product retrieval among fine-grained product\ncategories. To promote the study of this challenging task, we contribute\nProduct1M, one of the largest multi-modal cosmetic datasets for real-world\ninstance-level retrieval. Notably, Product1M contains over 1 million\nimage-caption pairs and consists of two sample types, i.e., single-product and\nmulti-product samples, which encompass a wide variety of cosmetics brands. In\naddition to the great diversity, Product1M enjoys several appealing\ncharacteristics including fine-grained categories, complex combinations, and\nfuzzy correspondence that well mimic the real-world scenes. Moreover, we\npropose a novel model named Cross-modal contrAstive Product Transformer for\ninstance-level prodUct REtrieval (CAPTURE), that excels in capturing the\npotential synergy between multi-modal inputs via a hybrid-stream transformer in\na self-supervised manner.CAPTURE generates discriminative instance features via\nmasked multi-modal learning as well as cross-modal contrastive pretraining and\nit outperforms several SOTA cross-modal baselines.

          "description": "Localizing individuals in crowds is more in accordance with the practical\ndemands of subsequent high-level crowd analysis tasks than simply counting.\nHowever, existing localization based methods relying on intermediate\nrepresentations (\\textit{i.e.}, density maps or pseudo boxes) serving as\nlearning targets are counter-intuitive and error-prone. In this paper, we\npropose a purely point-based framework for joint crowd counting and individual\nlocalization. For this framework, instead of merely reporting the absolute\ncounting error at image level, we propose a new metric, called density\nNormalized Average Precision (nAP), to provide more comprehensive and more\nprecise performance evaluation. Moreover, we design an intuitive solution under\nthis framework, which is called Point to Point Network (P2PNet). P2PNet\ndiscards superfluous steps and directly predicts a set of point proposals to\nrepresent heads in an image, being consistent with the human annotation\nresults. By thorough analysis, we reveal the key step towards implementing such\na novel idea is to assign optimal learning targets for these proposals.\nTherefore, we propose to conduct this crucial association in an one-to-one\nmatching manner using the Hungarian algorithm.

In the literature, high localization accuracy is achieved with the\nmainstream strongly supervised frameworks. However, such methods require\nobject-level annotations and are unable to detect objects of unknown\ncategories. Weakly supervised methods face similar difficulties. In this paper,\na self-paced learning framework is proposed to achieve accurate object\nlocalization on the rank list returned by instance search. The proposed\nframework mines the target instance gradually from the queries and their\ncorresponding top-ranked search results. Since a common instance is shared\nbetween the query and the images in the rank list, the target visual instance\ncan be accurately localized even without knowing what the object category is.\nIn addition to performing localization on instance search, the issue of\nfew-shot object detection is also addressed under the same framework.

          "description": "The early diagnosis and screening of glaucoma are important for patients to\nreceive treatment in time and maintain eyesight. Nowadays, deep learning (DL)\nbased models have been successfully used for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of\nglaucoma from retina fundus images. However, a DL model pre-trained using a\ndataset from one hospital center may have poor performance on a dataset from\nanother new hospital center and therefore its applications in the real scene\nare limited. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive transfer learning (SATL)\nstrategy to fill the domain gap between multicenter datasets. Specifically, the\nencoder of a DL model that is pre-trained on the source domain is used to\ninitialize the encoder of a reconstruction model. Then, the reconstruction\nmodel is trained using only unlabeled image data from the target domain, which\nmakes the encoder in the model adapt itself to extract useful high-level\nfeatures both for target domain images encoding and glaucoma classification,\nsimultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SATL\nstrategy is effective in the domain adaptation task between one private and two\npublic glaucoma diagnosis datasets, i.e. pri-RFG, REFUGE, and LAG. Moreover,\nthe proposed strategy is completely independent of the source domain data,\nwhich meets the real scene application and the privacy protection policy.",

          "description": "Transfer learning (TL) utilizes data or knowledge from one or more source\ndomains to facilitate the learning in a target domain. It is particularly\nuseful when the target domain has very few or no labeled data, due to\nannotation expense, privacy concerns, etc. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of\nTL is not always guaranteed. Negative transfer (NT), i.e., leveraging source\ndomain data/knowledge undesirably reduces the learning performance in the\ntarget domain, has been a long-standing and challenging problem in TL. Various\napproaches have been proposed in the literature to handle it. However, there\ndoes not exist a systematic survey on the formulation of NT, the factors\nleading to NT, and the algorithms that mitigate NT. This paper fills this gap,\nby first introducing the definition of NT and its factors, then reviewing about\nfifty representative approaches for overcoming NT, according to four\ncategories: secure transfer, domain similarity estimation, distant transfer,\nand NT mitigation. NT in related fields, e.g., multi-task learning, lifelong\nlearning, and adversarial attacks, are also discussed.",

It is a common paradigm in object detection frameworks\nto perform multi-scale detection. However, each scale is treated equally during\ntraining. In this paper, we carefully study the objective imbalance of\nmulti-scale detector training. We argue that the loss in each scale level is\nneither equally important nor independent. Different from the existing\nsolutions of setting multi-task weights, we dynamically optimize the loss\nweight of each scale level in the training process. Specifically, we propose an\nAdaptive Variance Weighting (AVW) to balance multi-scale loss according to the\nstatistical variance. Then we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning\nOptimization (RLO) to decide the weighting scheme probabilistically during\ntraining. The proposed dynamic methods make better utilization of multi-scale\ntraining loss without extra computational complexity and learnable parameters\nfor backpropagation.

This way, our model can\ngenerate a set of strokes in parallel and obtain the final painting of size 512\n* 512 in near real time.

The first tier improves recipe text embedding\nby optimizing the LSTM networks with term extraction and ranking enhanced\nsequence patterns, and optimizes the image embedding by combining the\nResNeXt-101 image encoder with the category embedding using wideResNet-50 with\nword2vec. The second tier modality alignment optimizes the textual-visual joint\nembedding loss function using a double batch-hard triplet loss with soft-margin\noptimization. The third modality alignment incorporates two types of\ncross-modality alignments as the auxiliary loss regularizations to further\nreduce the alignment errors in the joint learning of the two modality-specific\nembedding functions. The category-based cross-modal alignment aims to align the\nimage category with the recipe category as a loss regularization to the joint\nembedding. The cross-modal discriminator-based alignment aims to add the\nvisual-textual embedding distribution alignment to further regularize the joint\nembedding loss. Extensive experiments with the one-million recipes benchmark\ndataset Recipe1M demonstrate that the proposed JEMA approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art cross-modal embedding methods for both image-to-recipe and\nrecipe-to-image retrievals.",

          "description": "Monocular depth estimation aims at predicting depth from a single image or\nvideo. Recently, self-supervised methods draw much attention, due to their free\nof depth annotations and impressive performance on several daytime benchmarks,\nsuch as KITTI and Cityscapes. However, they produce weird outputs in more\nchallenging nighttime scenarios because of low visibility and varying\nilluminations, which bring weak textures and break brightness-consistency\nassumption, respectively. To address these problems, in this paper we propose a\nnovel framework with several improvements: (1) we introduce Priors-Based\nRegularization to learn distribution knowledge from unpaired depth maps and\nprevent model from being incorrectly trained; (2) we leverage\nMapping-Consistent Image Enhancement module to enhance image visibility and\ncontrast while maintaining brightness consistency; and (3) we present\nStatistics-Based Mask strategy to tune the number of removed pixels within\ntextureless regions, using dynamic statistics. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of each component. Meanwhile, our framework achieves\nremarkable improvements and state-of-the-art results on two nighttime datasets.",

Deep\nlearning-based region of interest segmentation is among the most exciting use\ncases. However, this paradigm is restricted in real-world clinical applications\ndue to poor robustness and generalization. The issue is more sinister with a\nlack of training data. In this paper, we address the challenge from the\nrepresentation learning point of view. We investigate that the collapsed\nrepresentations, as one of the main reasons which caused poor robustness and\ngeneralization, could be avoided through transfer learning. Therefore, we\npropose a novel two-stage framework for robust generalized segmentation. In\nparticular, an unsupervised Tile-wise AutoEncoder (T-AE) pretraining\narchitecture is coined to learn meaningful representation for improving the\ngeneralization and robustness of the downstream tasks. Furthermore, the learned\nknowledge is transferred to the segmentation benchmark. Coupled with an image\nreconstruction network, the representation keeps to be decoded, encouraging the\nmodel to capture more semantic features. Experiments of lung segmentation on\nmulti chest X-ray datasets are conducted. Empirically, the related experimental\nresults demonstrate the superior generalization capability of the proposed\nframework on unseen domains in terms of high performance and robustness to\ncorruption, especially under the scenario of the limited training data.",

          "description": "Unsupervised learning of global features for 3D shape analysis is an\nimportant research challenge because it avoids manual effort for supervised\ninformation collection. In this paper, we propose a view-based deep learning\nmodel called Hierarchical View Predictor (HVP) to learn 3D shape features from\nunordered views in an unsupervised manner. To mine highly discriminative\ninformation from unordered views, HVP performs a novel hierarchical view\nprediction over a view pair, and aggregates the knowledge learned from the\npredictions in all view pairs into a global feature. In a view pair, we pose\nhierarchical view prediction as the task of hierarchically predicting a set of\nimage patches in a current view from its complementary set of patches, and in\naddition, completing the current view and its opposite from any one of the two\nsets of patches. Hierarchical prediction, in patches to patches, patches to\nview and view to view, facilitates HVP to effectively learn the structure of 3D\nshapes from the correlation between patches in the same view and the\ncorrelation between a pair of complementary views. In addition, the employed\nimplicit aggregation over all view pairs enables HVP to learn global features\nfrom unordered views.

Given\nan arbitrary textual search query, Open-vocabulary Visual Instance Search\n(OVIS) aims to return a ranked list of visual instances, i.e., image patches,\nthat satisfies the search intent from an image database. The term \"open\nvocabulary\" means that there are neither restrictions to the visual instance to\nbe searched nor restrictions to the word that can be used to compose the\ntextual search query. We propose to address such a search challenge via\nvisual-semantic aligned representation learning (ViSA). ViSA leverages massive\nimage-caption pairs as weak image-level (not instance-level) supervision to\nlearn a rich cross-modal semantic space where the representations of visual\ninstances (not images) and those of textual queries are aligned, thus allowing\nus to measure the similarities between any visual instance and an arbitrary\ntextual query. To evaluate the performance of ViSA, we build two datasets named\nOVIS40 and OVIS1600 and also introduce a pipeline for error analysis. Through\nextensive experiments on the two datasets, we demonstrate ViSA's ability to\nsearch for visual instances in images not available during training given a\nwide range of textual queries including those composed of uncommon words.\nExperimental results show that ViSA achieves an mAP@50 of 21.9% on OVIS40 under\nthe most challenging setting and achieves an mAP@6 of 14.9% on OVIS1600\ndataset.",

Here, we seek to characterize the computational demands\nfor abstract visual reasoning. We do this by systematically assessing the\nability of modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn to solve\nthe Synthetic Visual Reasoning Test (SVRT) challenge, a collection of\ntwenty-three visual reasoning problems. Our analysis leads to a novel taxonomy\nof visual reasoning tasks, which can be primarily explained by both the type of\nrelations (same-different vs. spatial-relation judgments) and the number of\nrelations used to compose the underlying rules. Prior cognitive neuroscience\nwork suggests that attention plays a key role in human's visual reasoning\nability. To test this, we extended the CNNs with spatial and feature-based\nattention mechanisms. In a second series of experiments, we evaluated the\nability of these attention networks to learn to solve the SVRT challenge and\nfound the resulting architectures to be much more efficient at solving the\nhardest of these visual reasoning tasks. Most importantly, the corresponding\nimprovements on individual tasks partially explained the taxonomy. Overall,\nthis work advances our understanding of visual reasoning and yields testable\nNeuroscience predictions regarding the need for feature-based vs. spatial\nattention in visual reasoning.",

          "description": "Fast arbitrary neural style transfer has attracted widespread attention from\nacademic, industrial and art communities due to its flexibility in enabling\nvarious applications. Existing solutions either attentively fuse deep style\nfeature into deep content feature without considering feature distributions, or\nadaptively normalize deep content feature according to the style such that\ntheir global statistics are matched. Although effective, leaving shallow\nfeature unexplored and without locally considering feature statistics, they are\nprone to unnatural output with unpleasing local distortions. To alleviate this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a novel attention and normalization module,\nnamed Adaptive Attention Normalization (AdaAttN), to adaptively perform\nattentive normalization on per-point basis. Specifically, spatial attention\nscore is learnt from both shallow and deep features of content and style\nimages. Then per-point weighted statistics are calculated by regarding a style\nfeature point as a distribution of attention-weighted output of all style\nfeature points. Finally, the content feature is normalized so that they\ndemonstrate the same local feature statistics as the calculated per-point\nweighted style feature statistics. Besides, a novel local feature loss is\nderived based on AdaAttN to enhance local visual quality. We also extend\nAdaAttN to be ready for video style transfer with slight modifications.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art arbitrary\nimage/video style transfer.

          "description": "We propose the ViNet architecture for audio-visual saliency prediction. ViNet\nis a fully convolutional encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder uses visual\nfeatures from a network trained for action recognition, and the decoder infers\na saliency map via trilinear interpolation and 3D convolutions, combining\nfeatures from multiple hierarchies. The overall architecture of ViNet is\nconceptually simple; it is causal and runs in real-time (60 fps). ViNet does\nnot use audio as input and still outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-visual\nsaliency prediction models on nine different datasets (three visual-only and\nsix audio-visual datasets). ViNet also surpasses human performance on the CC,\nSIM and AUC metrics for the AVE dataset, and to our knowledge, it is the first\nnetwork to do so. We also explore a variation of ViNet architecture by\naugmenting audio features into the decoder. To our surprise, upon sufficient\ntraining, the network becomes agnostic to the input audio and provides the same\noutput irrespective of the input. Interestingly, we also observe similar\nbehaviour in the previous state-of-the-art models \\cite{tsiami2020stavis} for\naudio-visual saliency prediction. Our findings contrast with previous works on\ndeep learning-based audio-visual saliency prediction, suggesting a clear avenue\nfor future explorations incorporating audio in a more effective manner.

However,\nit remains challenging to acquire novel classes in an online fashion for the\nsegmentation task, mainly due to its continuously-evolving semantic label\nspace, partial pixelwise ground-truth annotations, and constrained data\navailability. To ad- dress this, we propose an incremental learning strategy\nthat can fast adapt deep segmentation models without catastrophic forgetting,\nusing a streaming input data with pixel annotations on the novel classes only.\nTo this end, we develop a uni ed learning strategy based on the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) framework, which integrates an iterative\nrelabeling strategy that lls in the missing labels and a rehearsal-based\nincremental learning step that balances the stability-plasticity of the model.\nMoreover, our EM algorithm adopts an adaptive sampling method to select\ninformative train- ing data and a class-balancing training strategy in the\nincremental model updates, both improving the e cacy of model learning.

          "description": "Automated and accurate segmentation of the infected regions in computed\ntomography (CT) images is critical for the prediction of the pathological stage\nand treatment response of COVID-19. Several deep convolutional neural networks\n(DCNNs) have been designed for this task, whose performance, however, tends to\nbe suppressed by their limited local receptive fields and insufficient global\nreasoning ability. In this paper, we propose a pixel-wise sparse graph\nreasoning (PSGR) module and insert it into a segmentation network to enhance\nthe modeling of long-range dependencies for COVID-19 infected region\nsegmentation in CT images. In the PSGR module, a graph is first constructed by\nprojecting each pixel on a node based on the features produced by the\nsegmentation backbone, and then converted into a sparsely-connected graph by\nkeeping only K strongest connections to each uncertain pixel. The long-range\ninformation reasoning is performed on the sparsely-connected graph to generate\nenhanced features. The advantages of this module are two-fold: (1) the\npixel-wise mapping strategy not only avoids imprecise pixel-to-node projections\nbut also preserves the inherent information of each pixel for global reasoning;\nand (2) the sparsely-connected graph construction results in effective\ninformation retrieval and reduction of the noise propagation. The proposed\nsolution has been evaluated against four widely-used segmentation models on\nthree public datasets. The results show that the segmentation model equipped\nwith our PSGR module can effectively segment COVID-19 infected regions in CT\nimages, outperforming all other competing models.",

          "description": "Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws\nincreasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem\nby trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead\nof the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting\nmight make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely\nimbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a\nnovel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP),\nwhich always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all\nintervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably\nintroduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose\nanother criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP).

          "description": "The semantic representation of deep features is essential for image context\nunderstanding, and effective fusion of features with different semantic\nrepresentations can significantly improve the model's performance on salient\nobject detection. In this paper, a novel method called MPI is proposed for\nsalient object detection. Firstly, a multi-receptive enhancement module (MRE)\nis designed to effectively expand the receptive fields of features from\ndifferent layers and generate features with different receptive fields. MRE can\nenhance the semantic representation and improve the model's perception of the\nimage context, which enables the model to locate the salient object accurately.\nSecondly, in order to reduce the reuse of redundant information in the complex\ntop-down fusion method and weaken the differences between semantic features, a\nrelatively simple but effective parallel fusion strategy (PFS) is proposed. It\nallows multi-scale features to better interact with each other, thus improving\nthe overall performance of the model. Experimental results on multiple datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods under\ndifferent evaluation metrics.",

To overcome the difficulty of varying\nocclusion in complex scenes, we propose an inter-view cost volume aggregation\nmodule for adaptive pixel-wise view aggregation, which is able to preserve\nbetter-matched pairs among all views. The two proposed adaptive aggregation\nmodules are lightweight, effective and complementary regarding improving the\naccuracy and completeness of 3D reconstruction.

Intraoperative diagnosis\ncan be challenging due to tumor diversity and lack of intraoperative pathology\nresources.\n\nObjective: To develop an independent and parallel intraoperative pathology\nworkflow that can provide rapid and accurate skull base tumor diagnoses using\nlabel-free optical imaging and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMethod: We used a fiber laser-based, label-free, non-consumptive,\nhigh-resolution microscopy method ($<$ 60 sec per 1 $\\times$ 1 mm$^\\text{2}$),\ncalled stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a consecutive, multicenter\ncohort of skull base tumor patients. SRH images were then used to train a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) model using three representation learning\nstrategies: cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised\ncontrastive learning. Our trained CNN models were tested on a held-out,\nmulticenter SRH dataset.\n\nResults: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of both benign and\nmalignant skull base tumors. Of the three representation learning strategies,\nsupervised contrastive learning most effectively learned the distinctive and\ndiagnostic SRH image features for each of the skull base tumor types. In our\nmulticenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy\nof 91.5%, self-supervised contrastive learning 83.9%, and supervised\ncontrastive learning 96.6%. Our trained model was able to identify tumor-normal\nmargins and detect regions of microscopic tumor infiltration in whole-slide SRH\nimages.\n\nConclusion: SRH with AI models trained using contrastive representation\nlearning can provide rapid and accurate intraoperative diagnosis of skull base\ntumors.",

In this\nwork, we pose the question of how to efficiently guide the training of foveated\nreconstruction techniques such that they are fully aware of the human visual\nsystem's capabilities and limitations, and therefore, reconstruct visually\nimportant image features. Due to the nature of GAN-based solutions, we\nconcentrate on the human's sensitivity to hallucination for different input\nsample densities. We present new psychophysical experiments, a dataset, and a\nprocedure for training foveated image reconstruction. The strategy provides\nflexibility to the generator network by penalizing only perceptually important\ndeviations in the output.

          "description": "Recent studies on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) reveal that different\nlayers of a generative CNN hold different semantics of the synthesized images.\nHowever, few GAN models have explicit dimensions to control the semantic\nattributes represented in a specific layer. This paper proposes EigenGAN which\nis able to unsupervisedly mine interpretable and controllable dimensions from\ndifferent generator layers. Specifically, EigenGAN embeds one linear subspace\nwith orthogonal basis into each generator layer. Via generative adversarial\ntraining to learn a target distribution, these layer-wise subspaces\nautomatically discover a set of \"eigen-dimensions\" at each layer corresponding\nto a set of semantic attributes or interpretable variations. By traversing the\ncoefficient of a specific eigen-dimension, the generator can produce samples\nwith continuous changes corresponding to a specific semantic attribute. Taking\nthe human face for example, EigenGAN can discover controllable dimensions for\nhigh-level concepts such as pose and gender in the subspace of deep layers, as\nwell as low-level concepts such as hue and color in the subspace of shallow\nlayers.

          "description": "Most existing trackers based on deep learning perform tracking in a holistic\nstrategy, which aims to learn deep representations of the whole target for\nlocalizing the target. It is arduous for such methods to track targets with\nvarious appearance variations. To address this limitation, another type of\nmethods adopts a part-based tracking strategy which divides the target into\nequal patches and tracks all these patches in parallel. The target state is\ninferred by summarizing the tracking results of these patches. A potential\nlimitation of such trackers is that not all patches are equally informative for\ntracking. Some patches that are not discriminative may have adverse effects. In\nthis paper, we propose to track the salient local parts of the target that are\ndiscriminative for tracking. In particular, we propose a fine-grained saliency\nmining module to capture the local saliencies. Further, we design a\nsaliency-association modeling module to associate the captured saliencies\ntogether to learn effective correlation representations between the exemplar\nand the search image for state estimation.

However, action detection requires not\nonly categorizing actions, but also localizing them in untrimmed videos.\nTherefore, transferring knowledge pertaining to temporal relations is critical\nfor this task which is missing in the previous cross-modal KD frameworks. To\nthis end, we aim at learning an augmented RGB representation for action\ndetection, taking advantage of additional modalities at training time through\nKD. We propose a KD framework consisting of two levels of distillation. On one\nhand, atomic-level distillation encourages the RGB student to learn the\nsub-representation of the actions from the teacher in a contrastive manner. On\nthe other hand, sequence-level distillation encourages the student to learn the\ntemporal knowledge from the teacher, which consists of transferring the Global\nContextual Relations and the Action Boundary Saliency. The result is an\nAugmented-RGB stream that can achieve competitive performance as the two-stream\nnetwork while using only RGB at inference time.

          "description": "Learning to generate 3D point clouds without 3D supervision is an important\nbut challenging problem. Current solutions leverage various differentiable\nrenderers to project the generated 3D point clouds onto a 2D image plane, and\ntrain deep neural networks using the per-pixel difference with 2D ground truth\nimages. However, these solutions are still struggling to fully recover fine\nstructures of 3D shapes, such as thin tubes or planes. To resolve this issue,\nwe propose an unsupervised approach for 3D point cloud generation with fine\nstructures. Specifically, we cast 3D point cloud learning as a 2D projection\nmatching problem. Rather than using entire 2D silhouette images as a regular\npixel supervision, we introduce structure adaptive sampling to randomly sample\n2D points within the silhouettes as an irregular point supervision, which\nalleviates the consistency issue of sampling from different view angles. Our\nmethod pushes the neural network to generate a 3D point cloud whose 2D\nprojections match the irregular point supervision from different view angles.\nOur 2D projection matching approach enables the neural network to learn more\naccurate structure information than using the per-pixel difference, especially\nfor fine and thin 3D structures. Our method can recover fine 3D structures from\n2D silhouette images at different resolutions, and is robust to different\nsampling methods and point number in irregular point supervision.

However, these\napproaches neglect that the appearance of rain is often accompanied by low\nlight conditions, which will further degrade the image quality. Therefore, it\nis very indispensable to jointly remove the rain and enhance the light for\nreal-world rain image restoration. In this paper, we aim to address this\nproblem from two aspects. First, we proposed a novel entangled network, namely\nEMNet, which can remove the rain and enhance illumination in one go.\nSpecifically, two encoder-decoder networks interact complementary information\nthrough entanglement structure, and parallel rain removal and illumination\nenhancement. Considering that the encoder-decoder structure is unreliable in\npreserving spatial details, we employ a detail recovery network to restore the\ndesired fine texture. Second, we present a new synthetic dataset, namely\nDarkRain, to boost the development of rain image restoration algorithms in\npractical scenarios. DarkRain not only contains different degrees of rain, but\nalso considers different lighting conditions, and more realistically simulates\nthe rainfall in the real world. EMNet is extensively evaluated on the proposed\nbenchmark and achieves state-of-the-art results.

          "description": "In this paper, we introduce a novel task, referred to as Weakly-Supervised\nSpatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection (WSSTAD) in surveillance video. Specifically,\ngiven an untrimmed video, WSSTAD aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube (i.e.,\na sequence of bounding boxes at consecutive times) that encloses the abnormal\nevent, with only coarse video-level annotations as supervision during training.\nTo address this challenging task, we propose a dual-branch network which takes\nas input the proposals with multi-granularities in both spatial-temporal\ndomains. Each branch employs a relationship reasoning module to capture the\ncorrelation between tubes/videolets, which can provide rich contextual\ninformation and complex entity relationships for the concept learning of\nabnormal behaviors. Mutually-guided Progressive Refinement framework is set up\nto employ dual-path mutual guidance in a recurrent manner, iteratively sharing\nauxiliary supervision information across branches. It impels the learned\nconcepts of each branch to serve as a guide for its counterpart, which\nprogressively refines the corresponding branch and the whole framework.\nFurthermore, we contribute two datasets, i.e., ST-UCF-Crime and STRA,\nconsisting of videos containing spatio-temporal abnormal annotations to serve\nas the benchmarks for WSSTAD. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and\nanalyze the key factors that contribute more to handle this task.",

The World Health\nOrganization reports that the disease still affects a significant portion of\nthe developing world citing increased mortality rates in the majority of low to\nmiddle income countries. The most popular protocol pathologists use for\ndiagnosing breast cancer is the Nottingham grading system which grades the\nproliferation of tumors based on 3 major criteria, the most important of them\nbeing mitotic cell count. The way in which pathologists evaluate mitotic cell\ncount is to subjectively and qualitatively analyze cells present in stained\nslides of tissue and make a decision on its mitotic state i.e. is it mitotic or\nnot?This process is extremely inefficient and tiring for pathologists and so an\nefficient, accurate, and fully automated tool to aid with the diagnosis is\nextremely desirable. Fortunately, creating such a tool is made significantly\neasier with the AutoML tool available from Microsoft Azure, however to the best\nof our knowledge the AutoML tool has never been formally evaluated for use in\nmitotic cell detection in histopathology images.

          "description": "Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) has become an important technique in exploiting\nhyperspectral data since it decomposes a mixed pixel into a collection of\nendmembers weighted by fractional abundances. The endmembers of a hyperspectral\nimage (HSI) are more likely to be generated by independent sources and be mixed\nin a macroscopic degree before arriving at the sensor element of the imaging\nspectrometer as mixed spectra. Over the past few decades, many attempts have\nfocused on imposing auxiliary constraints on the conventional nonnegative\nmatrix factorization (NMF) framework in order to effectively unmix these mixed\nspectra. As a promising step toward finding an optimum constraint to extract\nendmembers, this paper presents a novel blind HU algorithm, referred to as\nKurtosis-based Smooth Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (KbSNMF) which\nincorporates a novel constraint based on the statistical independence of the\nprobability density functions of endmember spectra. Imposing this constraint on\nthe conventional NMF framework promotes the extraction of independent\nendmembers while further enhancing the parts-based representation of data.\nExperiments conducted on diverse synthetic HSI datasets (with numerous numbers\nof endmembers, spectral bands, pixels, and noise levels) and three standard\nreal HSI datasets demonstrate the validity of the proposed KbSNMF algorithm\ncompared to several state-of-the-art NMF-based HU baselines. The proposed\nalgorithm exhibits superior performance especially in terms of extracting\nendmember spectra from hyperspectral data; therefore, it could uplift the\nperformance of recent deep learning HU methods which utilize the endmember\nspectra as supervisory input data for abundance extraction.",

          "description": "Pedestrian behavior prediction is one of the major challenges for intelligent\ndriving systems. Pedestrians often exhibit complex behaviors influenced by\nvarious contextual elements. To address this problem, we propose BiPed, a\nmultitask learning framework that simultaneously predicts trajectories and\nactions of pedestrians by relying on multimodal data. Our method benefits from\n1) a bifold encoding approach where different data modalities are processed\nindependently allowing them to develop their own representations, and jointly\nto produce a representation for all modalities using shared parameters; 2) a\nnovel interaction modeling technique that relies on categorical semantic\nparsing of the scenes to capture interactions between target pedestrians and\ntheir surroundings; and 3) a bifold prediction mechanism that uses both\nindependent and shared decoding of multimodal representations. Using public\npedestrian behavior benchmark datasets for driving, PIE and JAAD, we highlight\nthe benefits of the proposed method for behavior prediction and show that our\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves trajectory and action\nprediction by up to 22% and 9% respectively.

          "description": "High-resolution magnetic resonance images can provide fine-grained anatomical\ninformation, but acquiring such data requires a long scanning time. In this\npaper, a framework called the Fused Attentive Generative Adversarial\nNetworks(FA-GAN) is proposed to generate the super-resolution MR image from\nlow-resolution magnetic resonance images, which can reduce the scanning time\neffectively but with high resolution MR images. In the framework of the FA-GAN,\nthe local fusion feature block, consisting of different three-pass networks by\nusing different convolution kernels, is proposed to extract image features at\ndifferent scales. And the global feature fusion module, including the channel\nattention module, the self-attention module, and the fusion operation, is\ndesigned to enhance the important features of the MR image. Moreover, the\nspectral normalization process is introduced to make the discriminator network\nstable. 40 sets of 3D magnetic resonance images (each set of images contains\n256 slices) are used to train the network, and 10 sets of images are used to\ntest the proposed method. The experimental results show that the PSNR and SSIM\nvalues of the super-resolution magnetic resonance image generated by the\nproposed FA-GAN method are higher than the state-of-the-art reconstruction\nmethods.",

Specifically, we find the final embedding obtained\nby the mainstream SSL methods contains the most fruitful information, and\npropose to distill the final embedding to maximally transmit a teacher's\nknowledge to a lightweight model by constraining the last embedding of the\nstudent to be consistent with that of the teacher.

          "description": "A key factor for assessing the state of the heart after myocardial infarction\n(MI) is to measure whether the myocardium segment is viable after reperfusion\nor revascularization therapy. Delayed enhancement-MRI or DE-MRI, which is\nperformed several minutes after injection of the contrast agent, provides high\ncontrast between viable and nonviable myocardium and is therefore a method of\nchoice to evaluate the extent of MI. To automatically assess myocardial status,\nthe results of the EMIDEC challenge that focused on this task are presented in\nthis paper. The challenge's main objectives were twofold. First, to evaluate if\ndeep learning methods can distinguish between normal and pathological cases.\nSecond, to automatically calculate the extent of myocardial infarction. The\npublicly available database consists of 150 exams divided into 50 cases with\nnormal MRI after injection of a contrast agent and 100 cases with myocardial\ninfarction (and then with a hyperenhanced area on DE-MRI), whatever their\ninclusion in the cardiac emergency department. Along with MRI, clinical\ncharacteristics are also provided. The obtained results issued from several\nworks show that the automatic classification of an exam is a reachable task\n(the best method providing an accuracy of 0.92), and the automatic segmentation\nof the myocardium is possible. However, the segmentation of the diseased area\nneeds to be improved, mainly due to the small size of these areas and the lack\nof contrast with the surrounding structures.",

          "description": "COVID-19 has caused many deaths worldwide. The automation of the diagnosis of\nthis virus is highly desired. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown\noutstanding classification performance on image datasets. To date, it appears\nthat COVID computer-aided diagnosis systems based on CNNs and clinical\ninformation have not yet been analysed or explored. We propose a novel method,\nnamed the CNN-AE, to predict the survival chance of COVID-19 patients using a\nCNN trained with clinical information. Notably, the required resources to\nprepare CT images are expensive and limited compared to those required to\ncollect clinical data, such as blood pressure, liver disease, etc. We evaluated\nour method using a publicly available clinical dataset that we collected. The\ndataset properties were carefully analysed to extract important features and\ncompute the correlations of features. A data augmentation procedure based on\nautoencoders (AEs) was proposed to balance the dataset. The experimental\nresults revealed that the average accuracy of the CNN-AE (96.05%) was higher\nthan that of the CNN (92.49%). To demonstrate the generality of our\naugmentation method, we trained some existing mortality risk prediction methods\non our dataset (with and without data augmentation) and compared their\nperformances. We also evaluated our method using another dataset for further\ngenerality verification. To show that clinical data can be used for COVID-19\nsurvival chance prediction, the CNN-AE was compared with multiple pre-trained\ndeep models that were tuned based on CT images.",

Compared to the task of scene graph generation from images, it is more\nchallenging because of the dynamic relationships between objects and the\ntemporal dependencies between frames allowing for a richer semantic\ninterpretation. In this paper, we propose Spatial-temporal Transformer\n(STTran), a neural network that consists of two core modules: (1) a spatial\nencoder that takes an input frame to extract spatial context and reason about\nthe visual relationships within a frame, and (2) a temporal decoder which takes\nthe output of the spatial encoder as input in order to capture the temporal\ndependencies between frames and infer the dynamic relationships. Furthermore,\nSTTran is flexible to take varying lengths of videos as input without clipping,\nwhich is especially important for long videos. Our method is validated on the\nbenchmark dataset Action Genome (AG). The experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of our method in terms of dynamic scene graphs.

To better exploit the value of both pre-trained weights and unlabeled\ntarget examples, we introduce adaptive consistency regularization that consists\nof two complementary components: Adaptive Knowledge Consistency (AKC) on the\nexamples between the source and target model, and Adaptive Representation\nConsistency (ARC) on the target model between labeled and unlabeled examples.\nExamples involved in the consistency regularization are adaptively selected\naccording to their potential contributions to the target task. We conduct\nextensive experiments on popular benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and\nMURA, by fine-tuning the ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-50 model. Results show\nthat our proposed adaptive consistency regularization outperforms\nstate-of-the-art semi-supervised learning techniques such as Pseudo Label, Mean\nTeacher, and FixMatch.

          "description": "Ill-posed linear inverse problems appear in many scientific setups, and are\ntypically addressed by solving optimization problems, which are composed of\ndata fidelity and prior terms. Recently, several works have considered a\nback-projection (BP) based fidelity term as an alternative to the common least\nsquares (LS), and demonstrated excellent results for popular inverse problems.\nThese works have also empirically shown that using the BP term, rather than the\nLS term, requires fewer iterations of optimization algorithms. In this paper,\nwe examine the convergence rate of the projected gradient descent (PGD)\nalgorithm for the BP objective. Our analysis allows to identify an inherent\nsource for its faster convergence compared to using the LS objective, while\nmaking only mild assumptions. We also analyze the more general proximal\ngradient method under a relaxed contraction condition on the proximal mapping\nof the prior. This analysis further highlights the advantage of BP when the\nlinear measurement operator is badly conditioned. Numerical experiments with\nboth $\\ell_1$-norm and GAN-based priors corroborate our theoretical results.",

          "description": "With the success of deep neural networks, knowledge distillation which guides\nthe learning of a small student network from a large teacher network is being\nactively studied for model compression and transfer learning. However, few\nstudies have been performed to resolve the poor learning issue of the student\nnetwork when the student and teacher model sizes significantly differ. In this\npaper, we propose a densely guided knowledge distillation using multiple\nteacher assistants that gradually decreases the model size to efficiently\nbridge the large gap between the teacher and student networks. To stimulate\nmore efficient learning of the student network, we guide each teacher assistant\nto every other smaller teacher assistants iteratively. Specifically, when\nteaching a smaller teacher assistant at the next step, the existing larger\nteacher assistants from the previous step are used as well as the teacher\nnetwork. Moreover, we design stochastic teaching where, for each mini-batch, a\nteacher or teacher assistants are randomly dropped. This acts as a regularizer\nto improve the efficiency of teaching of the student network. Thus, the student\ncan always learn salient distilled knowledge from the multiple sources. We\nverified the effectiveness of the proposed method for a classification task\nusing CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. We also achieved significant\nperformance improvements with various backbone architectures such as ResNet,\nWideResNet, and VGG.",

Remarkably, the most\ncritical scenarios aremuch less frequent and more complex than the\nuncriticalones. Therefore, uncritical cases dominate the prediction. In this\npaper, we address specifically the challenging scenarios at the long tail of\nthe dataset distribution. Our analysis shows that the common losses tend to\nplace challenging cases suboptimally in the embedding space. As a consequence,\nwe propose to supplement the usual loss with aloss that places challenging\ncases closer to each other. This triggers sharing information among challenging\ncases andlearning specific predictive features. We show on four public datasets\nthat this leads to improved performance on the challenging scenarios while the\noverall performance stays stable.

To overcome the problem mentioned above,\nwe propose a deep learning pipeline for the temporal analysis of the visual\nchanges induced in the plant due to stress and apply it for the specific case\nof water stress identification in Chickpea plant shoot images. For this, we\nhave considered an image dataset of two chickpea varieties JG-62 and Pusa-372,\nunder three water stress conditions; control, young seedling, and before\nflowering, captured over five months. We have employed a variant of the\nLong-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) to learn spatio-temporal\npatterns from the chickpea plant dataset and use them for water stress\nclassification. Our model has achieved ceiling level classification performance\nof 98.52% on JG-62 and 97.78% on Pusa-372 chickpea plant data and has\noutperformed the state-of-the-art time-invariant technique by at least 14% for\nboth JG-62 and Pusa-372 species, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, our\nLRCN model has demonstrated robustness to noisy input, with a less than 2.5%\ndip in average model accuracy and a small standard deviation about the mean for\nboth species. Lastly, we have performed an ablation study to analyze the\nperformance of the LRCN model by decreasing the number of temporal session data\nused for training.",

In\naddition, the selected pose sequence is often misaligned with the music beat.\nTo solve this problem, we further develop a temporal alignment algorithm to\nalign the rhythm of music and dance. Finally, the processed pose sequence is\nused to synthesize realistic dancing videos in the imagination module.

          "description": "Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) based on image-level labels\nhas been greatly advanced by exploiting the outputs of Class Activation Map\n(CAM) to generate the pseudo labels for semantic segmentation. However, CAM\nmerely discovers seeds from a small number of regions, which may be\ninsufficient to serve as pseudo masks for semantic segmentation. In this paper,\nwe formulate the expansion of object regions in CAM as an increase in\ninformation. From the perspective of information theory, we propose a novel\nComplementary Patch (CP) Representation and prove that the information of the\nsum of the CAMs by a pair of input images with complementary hidden (patched)\nparts, namely CP Pair, is greater than or equal to the information of the\nbaseline CAM. Therefore, a CAM with more information related to object seeds\ncan be obtained by narrowing down the gap between the sum of CAMs generated by\nthe CP Pair and the original CAM. We propose a CP Network (CPN) implemented by\na triplet network and three regularization functions. To further improve the\nquality of the CAMs, we propose a Pixel-Region Correlation Module (PRCM) to\naugment the contextual information by using object-region relations between the\nfeature maps and the CAMs. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nshow that our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art in WSSS,\nvalidating the effectiveness of our CP Representation and CPN.",

          "description": "Open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) considers that the target domain contains\nsamples from novel categories unobserved in external source domain.\nUnfortunately, existing OSDA methods always ignore the demand for the\ninformation of unseen categories and simply recognize them as \"unknown\" set\nwithout further explanation. This motivates us to understand the unknown\ncategories more specifically by exploring the underlying structures and\nrecovering their interpretable semantic attributes. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework to accurately identify the seen categories in target domain,\nand effectively recover the semantic attributes for unseen categories.\nSpecifically, structure preserving partial alignment is developed to recognize\nthe seen categories through domain-invariant feature learning. Attribute\npropagation over visual graph is designed to smoothly transit attributes from\nseen to unseen categories via visual-semantic mapping. Moreover, two new\ncross-main benchmarks are constructed to evaluate the proposed framework in the\nnovel and practical challenge.

In the literature, this problem is\noften tackled using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Despite the powerful\ncapabilities of RNNs in capturing the temporal dependency in the pedestrians'\nmotion trajectories, they were argued to be challenged when dealing with longer\nsequential data. Thus, in this work, we are introducing a framework based on\nthe transformer networks that were shown recently to be more efficient and\noutperformed RNNs in many sequential-based tasks. We relied on a fusion of the\npast positional information, agent interactions information and scene physical\nsemantics information as an input to our framework in order to provide a robust\ntrajectory prediction of pedestrians.

In this paper, we formulate a new adversarial attack against\ndeep ranking systems, i.e., the Order Attack, which covertly alters the\nrelative order among a selected set of candidates according to an\nattacker-specified permutation, with limited interference to other unrelated\ncandidates. Specifically, it is formulated as a triplet-style loss imposing an\ninequality chain reflecting the specified permutation. However, direct\noptimization of such white-box objective is infeasible in a real-world attack\nscenario due to various black-box limitations. To cope with them, we propose a\nShort-range Ranking Correlation metric as a surrogate objective for black-box\nOrder Attack to approximate the white-box method. The Order Attack is evaluated\non the Fashion-MNIST and Stanford-Online-Products datasets under both white-box\nand black-box threat models.

          "description": "A point cloud serves as a representation of the surface of a\nthree-dimensional (3D) shape. Deep generative models have been adapted to model\ntheir variations typically using a map from a ball-like set of latent\nvariables. However, previous approaches did not pay much attention to the\ntopological structure of a point cloud, despite that a continuous map cannot\nexpress the varying numbers of holes and intersections. Moreover, a point cloud\nis often composed of multiple subparts, and it is also difficult to express. In\nthis study, we propose ChartPointFlow, a flow-based generative model with\nmultiple latent labels for 3D point clouds. Each label is assigned to points in\nan unsupervised manner. Then, a map conditioned on a label is assigned to a\ncontinuous subset of a point cloud, similar to a chart of a manifold. This\nenables our proposed model to preserve the topological structure with clear\nboundaries, whereas previous approaches tend to generate blurry point clouds\nand fail to generate holes. The experimental results demonstrate that\nChartPointFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of generation and\nreconstruction compared with other point cloud generators.

Moreover, the\nhandwriting of calligraphy masters has a more irregular stroke and is difficult\nto obtain in real-world scenarios. Recently, several GAN-based methods have\nbeen proposed for font synthesis, but some of them require numerous reference\ndata and the other part of them have cumbersome preprocessing steps to divide\nthe character into different parts to be learned and transferred separately. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple but powerful end-to-end Chinese calligraphy\nfont generation framework ZiGAN, which does not require any manual operation or\nredundant preprocessing to generate fine-grained target-style characters with\nfew-shot references. To be specific, a few paired samples from different\ncharacter styles are leveraged to attain a fine-grained correlation between\nstructures underlying different glyphs. To capture valuable style knowledge in\ntarget and strengthen the coarse-grained understanding of character content, we\nutilize multiple unpaired samples to align the feature distributions belonging\nto different character styles. By doing so, only a few target Chinese\ncalligraphy characters are needed to generated expected style transferred\ncharacters. Experiments demonstrate that our method has a state-of-the-art\ngeneralization ability in few-shot Chinese character style transfer.",

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to adapt a model of the labeled\nsource domain to an unlabeled target domain. Although the domain shifts may\nexist in various dimensions such as appearance, textures, etc, the contextual\ndependency, which is generally shared across different domains, is neglected by\nrecent methods. In this paper, we utilize this important clue as explicit prior\nknowledge and propose end-to-end Context-Aware Mixup (CAMix) for domain\nadaptive semantic segmentation. Firstly, we design a contextual mask generation\nstrategy by leveraging accumulated spatial distributions and contextual\nrelationships. The generated contextual mask is critical in this work and will\nguide the domain mixup. In addition, we define the significance mask to\nindicate where the pixels are credible. To alleviate the over-alignment (e.g.,\nearly performance degradation), the source and target significance masks are\nmixed based on the contextual mask into the mixed significance mask, and we\nintroduce a significance-reweighted consistency loss on it. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\nby a large margin on two widely-used domain adaptation benchmarks, i.e., GTAV\n$\\rightarrow $ Cityscapes and SYNTHIA $\\rightarrow $ Cityscapes.",

In this work, we propose a general model-agnostic technique for improving\nthe image quality and the distribution fidelity of generated images, obtained\nby any generative model.

Recent studies on 2D\nobject detection show that the anchor-free methods also are of great potential.\nHowever, the unordered and sparse properties of point clouds prevent us from\ndirectly leveraging the advanced 2D methods on 3D point clouds. We overcome\nthis by converting the voxel-based sparse 3D feature volumes into the sparse 2D\nfeature maps. We propose an attentive module to fit the sparse feature maps to\ndense mostly on the object regions through the deformable convolution tower and\nthe supervised mask-guided attention. By directly regressing the 3D bounding\nbox from the enhanced and dense feature maps, we construct a novel single-stage\n3D detector for point clouds in an anchor-free manner.

          "description": "The capsule network is a distinct and promising segment of the neural network\nfamily that drew attention due to its unique ability to maintain the\nequivariance property by preserving the spatial relationship amongst the\nfeatures. The capsule network has attained unprecedented success over image\nclassification tasks with datasets such as MNIST and affNIST by encoding the\ncharacteristic features into the capsules and building the parse-tree\nstructure. However, on the datasets involving complex foreground and background\nregions such as CIFAR-10, the performance of the capsule network is sub-optimal\ndue to its naive data routing policy and incompetence towards extracting\ncomplex features. This paper proposes a new design strategy for capsule network\narchitecture for efficiently dealing with complex images.

A wide bottleneck residual module facilitates extracting\ncomplex features followed by the squeeze and excitation attention block to\nenable channel-wise attention by suppressing the trivial features. This setup\nallows channel inter-dependencies at almost no computational cost, thereby\nenhancing the representation ability of capsules on complex images.

          "description": "Semi-supervised video object segmentation is a task of segmenting the target\nobject in a video sequence given only a mask annotation in the first frame. The\nlimited information available makes it an extremely challenging task. Most\nprevious best-performing methods adopt matching-based transductive reasoning or\nonline inductive learning. Nevertheless, they are either less discriminative\nfor similar instances or insufficient in the utilization of spatio-temporal\ninformation. In this work, we propose to integrate transductive and inductive\nlearning into a unified framework to exploit the complementarity between them\nfor accurate and robust video object segmentation. The proposed approach\nconsists of two functional branches. The transduction branch adopts a\nlightweight transformer architecture to aggregate rich spatio-temporal cues\nwhile the induction branch performs online inductive learning to obtain\ndiscriminative target information. To bridge these two diverse branches, a\ntwo-head label encoder is introduced to learn the suitable target prior for\neach of them. The generated mask encodings are further forced to be\ndisentangled to better retain their complementarity. Extensive experiments on\nseveral prevalent benchmarks show that, without the need of synthetic training\ndata, the proposed approach sets a series of new state-of-the-art records.

Utilizing precise superpixels and\nsuperpixel pooling on deep features, we refine initial coarse proposals in an\nend-to-end learned system. Furthermore, we propose a novel DeepFH segmentation,\nwhich enriches the classic Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher (FH) segmentation with\ndeep features leading to improved segmentation results and better object\nproposal refinements. On the COCO dataset with LVIS annotations, we show that\nour refinement based on DeepFH superpixels outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nand leads to more precise object proposals.",

          "description": "In this work, we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for\nperson re-ID where annotations are available for the source domain but not for\ntarget. Previous methods typically follow a two-stage optimization pipeline,\nwhere the network is first pre-trained on source and then fine-tuned on target\nwith pseudo labels created by feature clustering. Such methods sustain two main\nlimitations. (1) The label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative\nfeatures for recognizing target classes. (2) The domain gap may hinder\nknowledge transferring from source to target. We propose three types of\ntechnical schemes to alleviate these issues. First, we propose a cluster-wise\ncontrastive learning algorithm (CCL) by iterative optimization of feature\nlearning and cluster refinery to learn noise-tolerant representations in the\nunsupervised manner. Second, we adopt a progressive domain adaptation (PDA)\nstrategy to gradually mitigate the domain gap between source and target data.\nThird, we propose Fourier augmentation (FA) for further maximizing the class\nseparability of re-ID models by imposing extra constraints in the Fourier\nspace. We observe that these proposed schemes are capable of facilitating the\nlearning of discriminative feature representations. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our method consistently achieves notable improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods on multiple benchmarks, e.g.,\nsurpassing MMT largely by 8.1\\%, 9.9\\%, 11.4\\% and 11.1\\% mAP on the\nMarket-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT and Duke-to-MSMT tasks,\nrespectively.",

          "description": "The selective visual attention mechanism in the human visual system (HVS)\nrestricts the amount of information to reach visual awareness for perceiving\nnatural scenes, allowing near real-time information processing with limited\ncomputational capacity [Koch and Ullman, 1987]. This kind of selectivity acts\nas an 'Information Bottleneck (IB)', which seeks a trade-off between\ninformation compression and predictive accuracy. However, such information\nconstraints are rarely explored in the attention mechanism for deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an IB-inspired spatial attention\nmodule for DNN structures built for visual recognition. The module takes as\ninput an intermediate representation of the input image, and outputs a\nvariational 2D attention map that minimizes the mutual information (MI) between\nthe attention-modulated representation and the input, while maximizing the MI\nbetween the attention-modulated representation and the task label. To further\nrestrict the information bypassed by the attention map, we quantize the\ncontinuous attention scores to a set of learnable anchor values during\ntraining. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IB-inspired spatial\nattention mechanism can yield attention maps that neatly highlight the regions\nof interest while suppressing backgrounds, and bootstrap standard DNN\nstructures for visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification,\nfine-grained recognition, cross-domain classification). The attention maps are\ninterpretable for the decision making of the DNNs as verified in the\nexperiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/ashleylqx/AIB.git.",

          "description": "Aiming at discovering and locating most distinctive objects from visual\nscenes, salient object detection (SOD) plays an essential role in various\ncomputer vision systems. Coming to the era of high resolution, SOD methods are\nfacing new challenges. The major limitation of previous methods is that they\ntry to identify the salient regions and estimate the accurate objects\nboundaries simultaneously with a single regression task at low-resolution. This\npractice ignores the inherent difference between the two difficult problems,\nresulting in poor detection quality. In this paper, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework for high-resolution SOD task, which disentangles the task\ninto a low-resolution saliency classification network (LRSCN) and a\nhigh-resolution refinement network (HRRN). As a pixel-wise classification task,\nLRSCN is designed to capture sufficient semantics at low-resolution to identify\nthe definite salient, background and uncertain image regions. HRRN is a\nregression task, which aims at accurately refining the saliency value of pixels\nin the uncertain region to preserve a clear object boundary at high-resolution\nwith limited GPU memory. It is worth noting that by introducing uncertainty\ninto the training process, our HRRN can well address the high-resolution\nrefinement task without using any high-resolution training data.

Moreover, in cloud computing or GPU clusters where the tasks\narrive sequentially in a stream, faster online fine-tuning is a more desired\nand realistic strategy for saving money, energy consumption, and CO2 emission.\nIn this paper, we propose a joint Neural Architecture Search and Online\nAdaption framework named NASOA towards a faster task-oriented fine-tuning upon\nthe request of users.

          "description": "Existing vision systems for autonomous driving or robots are sensitive to\nwaterdrops adhered to windows or camera lenses. Most recent waterdrop removal\napproaches take a single image as input and often fail to recover the missing\ncontent behind waterdrops faithfully. Thus, we propose a learning-based model\nfor waterdrop removal with stereo images. To better detect and remove\nwaterdrops from stereo images, we propose a novel row-wise dilated attention\nmodule to enlarge attention's receptive field for effective information\npropagation between the two stereo images. In addition, we propose an attention\nconsistency loss between the ground-truth disparity map and attention scores to\nenhance the left-right consistency in stereo images. Because of related\ndatasets' unavailability, we collect a real-world dataset that contains stereo\nimages with and without waterdrops. Extensive experiments on our dataset\nsuggest that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively\nand qualitatively.

In this work, we present the LeafMask\nneural network, a new end-to-end model to delineate each leaf region and count\nthe number of leaves, with two main components: 1) the mask assembly module\nmerging position-sensitive bases of each predicted box after non-maximum\nsuppression (NMS) and corresponding coefficients to generate original masks; 2)\nthe mask refining module elaborating leaf boundaries from the mask assembly\nmodule by the point selection strategy and predictor. In addition, we also\ndesign a novel and flexible multi-scale attention module for the dual\nattention-guided mask (DAG-Mask) branch to effectively enhance information\nexpression and produce more accurate bases.

          "description": "Domain adaptation aims to bridge the domain shifts between the source and\ntarget domains. These shifts may span different dimensions such as fog,\nrainfall, etc. However, recent methods typically do not consider explicit prior\nknowledge on a specific dimension, thus leading to less desired adaptation\nperformance. In this paper, we study a practical setting called Specific Domain\nAdaptation (SDA) that aligns the source and target domains in a\ndemanded-specific dimension. Within this setting, we observe the intra-domain\ngap induced by different domainness (i.e., numerical magnitudes of this\ndimension) is crucial when adapting to a specific domain. To address the\nproblem, we propose a novel Self-Adversarial Disentangling (SAD) framework. In\nparticular, given a specific dimension, we first enrich the source domain by\nintroducing a domainness creator with providing additional supervisory signals.\nGuided by the created domainness, we design a self-adversarial regularizer and\ntwo loss functions to jointly disentangle the latent representations into\ndomainness-specific and domainness-invariant features, thus mitigating the\nintra-domain gap. Our method can be easily taken as a plug-and-play framework\nand does not introduce any extra costs in the inference time.

Furthermore, existing real-world benchmarks and datasets do not\ncategorize image data based on the types and appearances of reflection (e.g.,\nsmoothness, intensity), making it hard to analyze reflection removal methods.\nHence, we construct a new reflection removal dataset that is categorized,\ndiverse, and real-world (CDR).

          "description": "Faces manifest large variations in many aspects, such as identity,\nexpression, pose, and face styling. Therefore, it is a great challenge to\ndisentangle and extract these characteristics from facial images, especially in\nan unsupervised manner. In this work, we introduce cycle-consistency in facial\ncharacteristics as free supervisory signal to learn facial representations from\nunlabeled facial images. The learning is realized by superimposing the facial\nmotion cycle-consistency and identity cycle-consistency constraints. The main\nidea of the facial motion cycle-consistency is that, given a face with\nexpression, we can perform de-expression to a neutral face via the removal of\nfacial motion and further perform re-expression to reconstruct back to the\noriginal face. The main idea of the identity cycle-consistency is to exploit\nboth de-identity into mean face by depriving the given neutral face of its\nidentity via feature re-normalization and re-identity into neutral face by\nadding the personal attributes to the mean face. At training time, our model\nlearns to disentangle two distinct facial representations to be useful for\nperforming cycle-consistent face reconstruction. At test time, we use the\nlinear protocol scheme for evaluating facial representations on various tasks,\nincluding facial expression recognition and head pose regression. We also can\ndirectly apply the learnt facial representations to person recognition,\nfrontalization and image-to-image translation. Our experiments show that the\nresults of our approach is competitive with those of existing methods,\ndemonstrating the rich and unique information embedded in the disentangled\nrepresentations.

Although\nsome prior methods have partially addressed this task, there still remain some\nlimitations. Firstly, a direct association of Audio and Visual features may\nlimit the correlations to be extracted due to different modalities. Secondly,\nthe relationship across temporal segments helping to maintain the consistency\nof localization, separation, and conversation contexts is not effectively\nexploited.

          "description": "This paper strives for action recognition and detection in video modalities\nlike RGB, depth maps or 3D-skeleton sequences when only limited\nmodality-specific labeled examples are available. For the RGB, and derived\noptical-flow, modality many large-scale labeled datasets have been made\navailable. They have become the de facto pre-training choice when recognizing\nor detecting new actions from RGB datasets that have limited amounts of labeled\nexamples available. Unfortunately, large-scale labeled action datasets for\nother modalities are unavailable for pre-training. In this paper, our goal is\nto recognize actions from limited examples in non-RGB video modalities, by\nlearning from large-scale labeled RGB data. To this end, we propose a two-step\ntraining process: (i) we extract action representation knowledge from an\nRGB-trained teacher network and adapt it to a non-RGB student network. (ii) we\nthen fine-tune the transfer model with available labeled examples of the target\nmodality. For the knowledge transfer we introduce feature-supervision\nstrategies, which rely on unlabeled pairs of two modalities (the RGB and the\ntarget modality) to transfer feature level representations from the teacher to\nthe student network. Ablations and generalizations with two RGB source datasets\nand two non-RGB target datasets demonstrate that an optical-flow teacher\nprovides better action transfer features than RGB for both depth maps and\n3D-skeletons, even when evaluated on a different target domain, or for a\ndifferent task. Compared to alternative cross-modal action transfer methods we\nshow a good improvement in performance especially when labeled non-RGB examples\nto learn from are scarce",

But due to its complexity, researchers have not reached great\nresults compared to the action recognition task. The complexity is related to\npredicting precise start and end times for different actions in any video. In\nthis paper, we propose a new network based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and\ntwo novel post-processing ideas for TAL task. Specifically, we propose a new\ndesign for the output layer of the GRU resulting in the so-called GRU-Splitted\nmodel. Moreover, linear interpolation is used to generate the action proposals\nwith precise start and end times.

          "description": "Recent research in embodied AI has been boosted by the use of simulation\nenvironments to develop and train robot learning approaches. However, the use\nof simulation has skewed the attention to tasks that only require what robotics\nsimulators can simulate: motion and physical contact. We present iGibson 2.0,\nan open-source simulation environment that supports the simulation of a more\ndiverse set of household tasks through three key innovations. First, iGibson\n2.0 supports object states, including temperature, wetness level, cleanliness\nlevel, and toggled and sliced states, necessary to cover a wider range of\ntasks. Second, iGibson 2.0 implements a set of predicate logic functions that\nmap the simulator states to logic states like Cooked or Soaked. Additionally,\ngiven a logic state, iGibson 2.0 can sample valid physical states that satisfy\nit. This functionality can generate potentially infinite instances of tasks\nwith minimal effort from the users. The sampling mechanism allows our scenes to\nbe more densely populated with small objects in semantically meaningful\nlocations. Third, iGibson 2.0 includes a virtual reality (VR) interface to\nimmerse humans in its scenes to collect demonstrations. As a result, we can\ncollect demonstrations from humans on these new types of tasks, and use them\nfor imitation learning. We evaluate the new capabilities of iGibson 2.0 to\nenable robot learning of novel tasks, in the hope of demonstrating the\npotential of this new simulator to support new research in embodied AI. iGibson\n2.0 and its new dataset will be publicly available at\nthis http URL",

However, acquiring and\nmanually labeling a large medical image set is resource-intensive, expensive,\nand sometimes impractical due to data sharing and privacy issues. To address\nthis challenge, we propose an adversarial data augmentation approach to improve\nthe efficiency in utilizing training data and to enlarge the dataset via\nsimulated but realistic transformations. Specifically, we present a generic\ntask-driven learning framework, which jointly optimizes a data augmentation\nmodel and a segmentation network during training, generating informative\nexamples to enhance network generalizability for the downstream task. The data\naugmentation model utilizes a set of photometric and geometric image\ntransformations and chains them to simulate realistic complex imaging\nvariations that could exist in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The proposed\nadversarial data augmentation does not rely on generative networks and can be\nused as a plug-in module in general segmentation networks. It is\ncomputationally efficient and applicable for both supervised and\nsemi-supervised learning. We analyze and evaluate the method on two MR image\nsegmentation tasks: cardiac segmentation and prostate segmentation.

The challenges\nof collecting such datasets, especially in case of 3D volumes, motivate to\ndevelop approaches that can learn from other types of labels that are cheap to\nobtain, e.g. bounding boxes. We focus on 3D medical images with their\ncorresponding 3D bounding boxes which are considered as series of per-slice\nnon-tight 2D bounding boxes. While current weakly-supervised approaches that\nuse 2D bounding boxes as weak labels can be applied to medical image\nsegmentation, we show that their success is limited in cases when the\nassumption about the tightness of the bounding boxes breaks. We propose a new\nbounding box correction framework which is trained on a small set of\npixel-level annotations to improve the tightness of a larger set of non-tight\nbounding box annotations. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated by\nevaluating a known weakly-supervised segmentation approach with and without the\nproposed bounding box correction algorithm.

Specifically, in our PSViT, token pooling can be defined as the\noperation that decreases the number of tokens at the spatial level.

In an end-to-end training, the\nfeatures from both labeled and unlabeled data are optimized to be similar to\nsame-class samples from the memory bank. Our approach outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art for semi-supervised semantic segmentation and semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation on well-known public benchmarks, with larger improvements on\nthe most challenging scenarios, i.e., less available labeled data.\nhttps://github.com/Shathe/SemiSeg-Contrastive",

          "description": "Coronaviruses constitute a family of viruses that gives rise to respiratory\ndiseases. As COVID-19 is highly contagious, early diagnosis of COVID-19 is\ncrucial for an effective treatment strategy. However, the RT-PCR test which is\nconsidered to be a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suffers from a\nhigh false-negative rate. Chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis has emerged as a\nfeasible and effective diagnostic technique towards this objective. In this\nwork, we propose the COVID-19 classification problem as a three-class\nclassification problem to distinguish between COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia\nclasses. We propose a three-stage framework, named COV-ELM. Stage one deals\nwith preprocessing and transformation while stage two deals with feature\nextraction. These extracted features are passed as an input to the ELM at the\nthird stage, resulting in the identification of COVID-19. The choice of ELM in\nthis work has been motivated by its faster convergence, better generalization\ncapability, and shorter training time in comparison to the conventional\ngradient-based learning algorithms. As bigger and diverse datasets become\navailable, ELM can be quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based\ncompetitor models. The proposed model achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95\nand the overall sensitivity of ${0.94 \\pm 0.02} at a 95% confidence interval.\nWhen compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the COV-ELM is\nfound to outperform its competitors in this three-class classification\nscenario. Further, LIME has been integrated with the proposed COV-ELM model to\ngenerate annotated CXR images. The annotations are based on the superpixels\nthat have contributed to distinguish between the different classes. It was\nobserved that the superpixels correspond to the regions of the human lungs that\nare clinically observed in COVID-19 and Pneumonia cases.",

          "description": "Adversarial robustness of deep learning models has gained much traction in\nthe last few years. Various attacks and defenses are proposed to improve the\nadversarial robustness of modern-day deep learning architectures. While all\nthese approaches help improve the robustness, one promising direction for\nimproving adversarial robustness is un-explored, i.e., the complex topology of\nthe neural network architecture. In this work, we answer the following\nquestion: \"Can the complex topology of a neural network give adversarial\nrobustness without any form of adversarial training?\" empirically by\nexperimenting with different hand-crafted and NAS based architectures. Our\nfindings show that, for small-scale attacks, NAS-based architectures are more\nrobust for small-scale datasets and simple tasks than hand-crafted\narchitectures. However, as the dataset's size or the task's complexity\nincrease, hand-crafted architectures are more robust than NAS-based\narchitectures. We perform the first large scale study to understand adversarial\nrobustness purely from an architectural perspective. Our results show that\nrandom sampling in the search space of DARTS (a popular NAS method) with simple\nensembling can improve the robustness to PGD attack by nearly ~12\\%. We show\nthat NAS, which is popular for SoTA accuracy, can provide adversarial accuracy\nas a free add-on without any form of adversarial training. Our results show\nthat leveraging the power of neural network topology with methods like\nensembles can be an excellent way to achieve adversarial robustness without any\nform of adversarial training. We also introduce a metric that can be used to\ncalculate the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness.",

          "description": "The goal of representation learning is different from the ultimate objective\nof machine learning such as decision making, it is therefore very difficult to\nestablish clear and direct objectives for training representation learning\nmodels. It has been argued that a good representation should disentangle the\nunderlying variation factors, yet how to translate this into training\nobjectives remains unknown. This paper presents an attempt to establish direct\ntraining criterions and design principles for developing good representation\nlearning models. We propose that a good representation learning model should be\nmaximally expressive, i.e., capable of distinguishing the maximum number of\ninput configurations. We formally define expressiveness and introduce the\nmaximum expressiveness (MEXS) theorem of a general learning model. We propose\nto train a model by maximizing its expressiveness while at the same time\nincorporating general priors such as model smoothness. We present a conscience\ncompetitive learning algorithm which encourages the model to reach its MEXS\nwhilst at the same time adheres to model smoothness prior. We also introduce a\nlabel consistent training (LCT) technique to boost model smoothness by\nencouraging it to assign consistent labels to similar samples. We present\nextensive experimental results to show that our method can indeed design\nrepresentation learning models capable of developing representations that are\nas good as or better than state of the art. We also show that our technique is\ncomputationally efficient, robust against different parameter settings and can\nwork effectively on a variety of datasets.

          "description": "In image fusion, images obtained from different sensors are fused to generate\na single image with enhanced information. In recent years, state-of-the-art\nmethods have adopted Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to encode meaningful\nfeatures for image fusion. Specifically, CNN-based methods perform image fusion\nby fusing local features. However, they do not consider long-range dependencies\nthat are present in the image. Transformer-based models are designed to\novercome this by modeling the long-range dependencies with the help of\nself-attention mechanism. This motivates us to propose a novel Image Fusion\nTransformer (IFT) where we develop a transformer-based multi-scale fusion\nstrategy that attends to both local and long-range information (or global\ncontext). The proposed method follows a two-stage training approach. In the\nfirst stage, we train an auto-encoder to extract deep features at multiple\nscales. In the second stage, multi-scale features are fused using a\nSpatio-Transformer (ST) fusion strategy. The ST fusion blocks are comprised of\na CNN and a transformer branch which capture local and long-range features,\nrespectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that\nthe proposed method performs better than many competitive fusion algorithms.\nFurthermore, we show the effectiveness of the proposed ST fusion strategy with\nan ablation analysis.

In recent, many researchers use deep learning\nmethods to classify plants directly using plant images. While deep learning\nmodels have achieved a great success, the lack of interpretability limit their\nwidespread application. To overcome this, we explore the use of interpretable,\nmeasurable and computer-aided features extracted from plant leaf images. Image\nprocessing is one of the most challenging, and crucial steps in\nfeature-extraction. The purpose of image processing is to improve the leaf\nimage by removing undesired distortion. The main image processing steps of our\nalgorithm involves: i) Convert original image to RGB (Red-Green-Blue) image,\nii) Gray scaling, iii) Gaussian smoothing, iv) Binary thresholding, v) Remove\nstalk, vi) Closing holes, and vii) Resize image. The next step after image\nprocessing is to extract features from plant leaf images. We introduced 52\ncomputationally efficient features to classify plant species. These features\nare mainly classified into four groups as: i) shape-based features, ii)\ncolor-based features, iii) texture-based features, and iv) scagnostic features.\nLength, width, area, texture correlation, monotonicity and scagnostics are to\nname few of them. We explore the ability of features to discriminate the\nclasses of interest under supervised learning and unsupervised learning\nsettings. For that, supervised dimensionality reduction technique, Linear\nDiscriminant Analysis (LDA), and unsupervised dimensionality reduction\ntechnique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used to convert and visualize\nthe images from digital-image space to feature space. The results show that the\nfeatures are sufficient to discriminate the classes of interest under both\nsupervised and unsupervised learning settings.",

To\naddress this limitation, we propose a connectivity-based approach called\nbilateral connectivity network (BiconNet), which uses connectivity masks\ntogether with saliency masks as labels for effective modeling of inter-pixel\nrelationships and object saliency. Moreover, we propose a bilateral voting\nmodule to enhance the output connectivity map, and a novel edge feature\nenhancement method that efficiently utilizes edge-specific features. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our\nproposed method can be plugged into any existing state-of-the-art\nsaliency-based SOD framework to improve its performance with negligible\nparameter increase.",

          "description": "Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) maps have emerged as one of the most powerful\nrepresentations for scene understanding due to their ability to provide rich\nspatial context while being easy to interpret and process. However, generating\nBEV maps requires complex multi-stage paradigms that encapsulate a series of\ndistinct tasks such as depth estimation, ground plane estimation, and semantic\nsegmentation. These sub-tasks are often learned in a disjoint manner which\nprevents the model from holistic reasoning and results in erroneous BEV maps.\nMoreover, existing algorithms only predict the semantics in the BEV space,\nwhich limits their use in applications where the notion of object instances is\ncritical. In this work, we present the first end-to-end learning approach for\ndirectly predicting dense panoptic segmentation maps in the BEV, given a single\nmonocular image in the frontal view (FV). Our architecture follows the top-down\nparadigm and incorporates a novel dense transformer module consisting of two\ndistinct transformers that learn to independently map vertical and flat regions\nin the input image from the FV to the BEV. Additionally, we derive a\nmathematical formulation for the sensitivity of the FV-BEV transformation which\nallows us to intelligently weight pixels in the BEV space to account for the\nvarying descriptiveness across the FV image. Extensive evaluations on the\nKITTI-360 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach exceeds the\nstate-of-the-art in the PQ metric by 3.61 pp and 4.93 pp respectively.",

          "description": "Deep generative models have made great progress in synthesizing images with\narbitrary human poses and transferring poses of one person to others.

To alleviate the current limitations and improve the quality\nof the synthesized images, we propose a pose transfer network with Disentangled\nFeature Consistency (DFC-Net) to facilitate human pose transfer.

Additionally, an unpaired\nsupport dataset Mixamo-Sup providing more extra pose information has been\nfurther utilized during the training to improve the generality and robustness\nof DFC-Net.

          "description": "Instance segmentation is an important pre-processing task in numerous\nreal-world applications, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and\nhuman-computer interaction. Compared with the rapid development of deep\nlearning for two-dimensional (2D) image tasks, deep learning-based instance\nsegmentation of 3D point cloud still has a lot of room for development. In\nparticular, distinguishing a large number of occluded objects of the same class\nis a highly challenging problem, which is seen in a robotic bin-picking. In a\nusual bin-picking scene, many indentical objects are stacked together and the\nmodel of the objects is known. Thus, the semantic information can be ignored;\ninstead, the focus in the bin-picking is put on the segmentation of instances.\nBased on this task requirement, we propose a Fast Point Cloud Clustering (FPCC)\nfor instance segmentation of bin-picking scene. FPCC includes a network named\nFPCC-Net and a fast clustering algorithm. FPCC-net has two subnets, one for\ninferring the geometric centers for clustering and the other for describing\nfeatures of each point. FPCC-Net extracts features of each point and infers\ngeometric center points of each instance simultaneously. After that, the\nproposed clustering algorithm clusters the remaining points to the closest\ngeometric center in feature embedding space. Experiments show that FPCC also\nsurpasses the existing works in bin-picking scenes and is more computationally\nefficient. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/xyjbaal/FPCC.",

          "description": "Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT)\ndue to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one\nmap between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests\nnear equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from\ncompressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As\nthe latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent\nthis equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical\nsignificance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach\nbased on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the\nsubsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step\napproach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly\nrecovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the\nphotoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic\nforward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet\ntransform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are\nformulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily\noverdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of\nthe solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed\nsensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA.\nSubsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as\nimplemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to\nrecover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition\nincluding a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative\nmerits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real\ndata in a fair and rigorous manner.",

This issue is\nexacerbated in many methods that ignore important video temporal dependencies.\nTo address this issue, we introduce a novel and theoretically sound method,\nnamed Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude learning (RTFM), which trains a feature\nmagnitude learning function to effectively recognise the positive instances,\nsubstantially improving the robustness of the MIL approach to the negative\ninstances from abnormal videos. RTFM also adapts dilated convolutions and\nself-attention mechanisms to capture long- and short-range temporal\ndependencies to learn the feature magnitude more faithfully.

To\naddress this issue, we propose a SofGAN image generator to decouple the latent\nspace of portraits into two subspaces: a geometry space and a texture space.\nThe latent codes sampled from the two subspaces are fed to two network branches\nseparately, one to generate the 3D geometry of portraits with canonical pose,\nand the other to generate textures. The aligned 3D geometries also come with\nsemantic part segmentation, encoded as a semantic occupancy field (SOF). The\nSOF allows the rendering of consistent 2D semantic segmentation maps at\narbitrary views, which are then fused with the generated texture maps and\nstylized to a portrait photo using our semantic instance-wise (SIW) module.\nThrough extensive experiments, we show that our system can generate high\nquality portrait images with independently controllable geometry and texture\nattributes.

Different from previous work, our model\nis specifically designed to handle (also) point-cloud pairs with low overlap.\nIts key novelty is an overlap-attention block for early information exchange\nbetween the latent encodings of the two point clouds. In this way the\nsubsequent decoding of the latent representations into per-point features is\nconditioned on the respective other point cloud, and thus can predict which\npoints are not only salient, but also lie in the overlap region between the two\npoint clouds. The ability to focus on points that are relevant for matching\ngreatly improves performance: PREDATOR raises the rate of successful\nregistrations by more than 20% in the low-overlap scenario, and also sets a new\nstate of the art for the 3DMatch benchmark with 89% registration recall.",

          "description": "Extreme Learning Machine is a powerful classification method very competitive\nexisting classification methods. It is extremely fast at training.\nNevertheless, it cannot perform face verification tasks properly because face\nverification tasks require comparison of facial images of two individuals at\nthe same time and decide whether the two faces identify the same person. The\nstructure of Extreme Leaning Machine was not designed to feed two input data\nstreams simultaneously, thus, in 2-input scenarios Extreme Learning Machine\nmethods are normally applied using concatenated inputs. However, this setup\nconsumes two times more computational resources and it is not optimized for\nrecognition tasks where learning a separable distance metric is critical. For\nthese reasons, we propose and develop a Siamese Extreme Learning Machine\n(SELM). SELM was designed to be fed with two data streams in parallel\nsimultaneously. It utilizes a dual-stream Siamese condition in the extra\nSiamese layer to transform the data before passing it along to the hidden\nlayer. Moreover, we propose a Gender-Ethnicity-Dependent triplet feature\nexclusively trained on a variety of specific demographic groups. This feature\nenables learning and extracting of useful facial features of each group.\nExperiments were conducted to evaluate and compare the performances of SELM,\nExtreme Learning Machine, and DCNN. The experimental results showed that the\nproposed feature was able to perform correct classification at 97.87% accuracy\nand 99.45% AUC. They also showed that using SELM in conjunction with the\nproposed feature provided 98.31% accuracy and 99.72% AUC. They outperformed the\nwell-known DCNN and Extreme Leaning Machine methods by a wide margin.",

          "description": "Domain adaptation (DA) has drawn high interest for its capacity to adapt a\nmodel trained on labeled source data to perform well on unlabeled or weakly\nlabeled target data from a different domain. Most common DA techniques require\nconcurrent access to the input images of both the source and target domains.\nHowever, in practice, privacy concerns often impede the availability of source\nimages in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in medical\nimaging, where, for instance, the source and target images could come from\ndifferent clinical sites. We introduce a source-free domain adaptation for\nimage segmentation. Our formulation is based on minimizing a label-free entropy\nloss defined over target-domain data, which we further guide with a\ndomain-invariant prior on the segmentation regions. Many priors can be derived\nfrom anatomical information. Here, a class ratio prior is estimated from\nanatomical knowledge and integrated in the form of a Kullback Leibler (KL)\ndivergence in our overall loss function. Furthermore, we motivate our overall\nloss with an interesting link to maximizing the mutual information between the\ntarget images and their label predictions. We show the effectiveness of our\nprior aware entropy minimization in a variety of domain-adaptation scenarios,\nwith different modalities and applications, including spine, prostate, and\ncardiac segmentation. Our method yields comparable results to several state of\nthe art adaptation techniques, despite having access to much less information,\nas the source images are entirely absent in our adaptation phase. Our\nstraightforward adaptation strategy uses only one network, contrary to popular\nadversarial techniques, which are not applicable to a source-free DA setting.\nOur framework can be readily used in a breadth of segmentation problems, and\nour code is publicly available: https://github.com/mathilde-b/SFDA",

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging has been proposed as a\nscreening tool as it is a much cheaper and easier to apply imaging modality\nthan others that are traditionally used for pulmonary examinations, namely\nchest x-ray and computed tomography.

          "description": "Appearance and motion are two important sources of information in video\nobject segmentation (VOS). Previous methods mainly focus on using simplex\nsolutions, lowering the upper bound of feature collaboration among and across\nthese two cues. In this paper, we study a novel framework, termed the FSNet\n(Full-duplex Strategy Network), which designs a relational cross-attention\nmodule (RCAM) to achieve the bidirectional message propagation across embedding\nsubspaces. Furthermore, the bidirectional purification module (BPM) is\nintroduced to update the inconsistent features between the spatial-temporal\nembeddings, effectively improving the model robustness. By considering the\nmutual restraint within the full-duplex strategy, our FSNet performs the\ncross-modal feature-passing (i.e., transmission and receiving) simultaneously\nbefore the fusion and decoding stage, making it robust to various challenging\nscenarios (e.g., motion blur, occlusion) in VOS. Extensive experiments on five\npopular benchmarks (i.e., DAVIS$_{16}$, FBMS, MCL, SegTrack-V2, and\nDAVSOD$_{19}$) show that our FSNet outperforms other state-of-the-arts for both\nthe VOS and video salient object detection tasks.",

          "description": "Contrastive learning, which aims at minimizing the distance between positive\npairs while maximizing that of negative ones, has been widely and successfully\napplied in unsupervised feature learning, where the design of positive and\nnegative (pos/neg) pairs is one of its keys. In this paper, we attempt to\ndevise a feature-level data manipulation, differing from data augmentation, to\nenhance the generic contrastive self-supervised learning. To this end, we first\ndesign a visualization scheme for pos/neg score (Pos/neg score indicates cosine\nsimilarity of pos/neg pair.) distribution, which enables us to analyze,\ninterpret and understand the learning process. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst attempt of its kind. More importantly, leveraging this tool, we gain some\nsignificant observations, which inspire our novel Feature Transformation\nproposals including the extrapolation of positives. This operation creates\nharder positives to boost the learning because hard positives enable the model\nto be more view-invariant. Besides, we propose the interpolation among\nnegatives, which provides diversified negatives and makes the model more\ndiscriminative. It is the first attempt to deal with both challenges\nsimultaneously. Experiment results show that our proposed Feature\nTransformation can improve at least 6.0% accuracy on ImageNet-100 over MoCo\nbaseline, and about 2.0% accuracy on ImageNet-1K over the MoCoV2 baseline.\nTransferring to the downstream tasks successfully demonstrate our model is less\ntask-bias.

          "description": "The aortic vessel tree is composed of the aorta and its branching arteries,\nand plays a key role in supplying the whole body with blood. Aortic diseases,\nlike aneurysms or dissections, can lead to an aortic rupture, whose treatment\nwith open surgery is highly risky. Therefore, patients commonly undergo drug\ntreatment under constant monitoring, which requires regular inspections of the\nvessels through imaging. The standard imaging modality for diagnosis and\nmonitoring is computed tomography (CT), which can provide a detailed picture of\nthe aorta and its branching vessels if combined with a contrast agent,\nresulting in a CT angiography (CTA). Optimally, the whole aortic vessel tree\ngeometry from consecutive CTAs, are overlaid and compared. This allows to not\nonly detect changes in the aorta, but also more peripheral vessel tree changes,\ncaused by the primary pathology or newly developed. When performed manually,\nthis reconstruction requires slice by slice contouring, which could easily take\na whole day for a single aortic vessel tree and, hence, is not feasible in\nclinical practice. Automatic or semi-automatic vessel tree segmentation\nalgorithms, on the other hand, can complete this task in a fraction of the\nmanual execution time and run in parallel to the clinical routine of the\nclinicians. In this paper, we systematically review computing techniques for\nthe automatic and semi-automatic segmentation of the aortic vessel tree. The\nreview concludes with an in-depth discussion on how close these\nstate-of-the-art approaches are to an application in clinical practice and how\nactive this research field is, taking into account the number of publications,\ndatasets and challenges.",

          "description": "Rotating object detection has wide applications in aerial photographs, remote\nsensing images, UAVs, etc. At present, most of the rotating object detection\ndatasets focus on the field of remote sensing, and these images are usually\nshot in high-altitude scenes. However, image datasets captured at low-altitude\nareas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a\nlow-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research\nand development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD\nconsists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by\noriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the\nrotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting\ntasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the\nrotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating\nobject detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and\ntwo-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted\nhorizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor\nrefinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective\nstrategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the\nregression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the\nTS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely\nwith one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD\ndataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD\ndemonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "In recent years, deep learning based methods have shown success in essential\nmedical image analysis tasks such as segmentation. Post-processing and refining\nthe results of segmentation is a common practice to decrease the\nmisclassifications originating from the segmentation network. In addition to\nwidely used methods like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) which focus on the\nstructure of the segmented volume/area, a graph-based recent approach makes use\nof certain and uncertain points in a graph and refines the segmentation\naccording to a small graph convolutional network (GCN). However, there are two\ndrawbacks of the approach: most of the edges in the graph are assigned randomly\nand the GCN is trained independently from the segmentation network. To address\nthese issues, we define a new neighbor-selection mechanism according to feature\ndistances and combine the two networks in the training procedure. According to\nthe experimental results on pancreas segmentation from Computed Tomography (CT)\nimages, we demonstrate improvement in the quantitative measures. Also,\nexamining the dynamic neighbors created by our method, edges between\nsemantically similar image parts are observed. The proposed method also shows\nqualitative enhancements in the segmentation maps, as demonstrated in the\nvisual results.",

What is particularly interesting is that after replacing the\nnuclear norm with the $L_{2,1}$ norm proposed based on this decomposition, as\nthe upper bound of the nuclear norm, when the intermediate matrix $D$ in its\ndecomposition is close to the diagonal matrix, it will converge to the nuclear\nnorm, and is exactly equal, when the $D$ matrix is equal to the diagonal\nmatrix, to the nuclear norm, which ingeniously avoids the calculation of the\nsingular value of the matrix. To the best of our knowledge, there is no\nliterature to generalize and apply it to solve tensor complete problems.\nInspired by this, in this paper we propose a class of tensor minimization model\nbased on $L_{2,1}$ norm and CSVD-QR method for the tensor complete problem,\nwhich is convex and therefore has a global minimum solution.",

With a real-world\ndata-scarce scenario, we investigate approaches to utilize both COVID-19 and\nCAP lung ultrasound data to train the networks; comparing fine-tuning and\nunsupervised domain adaptation. Segmenting either type of lung condition at\ninference may support a range of clinical applications during evolving epidemic\nstages, but also demonstrates value in resource-constrained clinical scenarios.\nAdapting real clinical data acquired from COVID-19 patients to those from CAP\npatients significantly improved Dice scores from 0.60 to 0.87 (p < 0.001) and\nfrom 0.43 to 0.71 (p < 0.001), on independent COVID-19 and CAP test cases,\nrespectively. It is of practical value that the improvement was demonstrated\nwith only a small amount of data in both training and adaptation data sets, a\ncommon constraint for deploying machine learning models in clinical practice.\nInterestingly, we also report that the inverse adaptation, from labelled CAP\ndata to unlabeled COVID-19 data, did not demonstrate an improvement when tested\non either condition.

          "description": "Single image dehazing is a challenging task, for which the domain shift\nbetween synthetic training data and real-world testing images usually leads to\ndegradation of existing methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nimage dehazing framework collaborating with unlabeled real data. First, we\ndevelop a disentangled image dehazing network (DID-Net), which disentangles the\nfeature representations into three component maps, i.e. the latent haze-free\nimage, the transmission map, and the global atmospheric light estimate,\nrespecting the physical model of a haze process. Our DID-Net predicts the three\ncomponent maps by progressively integrating features across scales, and refines\neach map by passing an independent refinement network. Then a\ndisentangled-consistency mean-teacher network (DMT-Net) is employed to\ncollaborate unlabeled real data for boosting single image dehazing.\nSpecifically, we encourage the coarse predictions and refinements of each\ndisentangled component to be consistent between the student and teacher\nnetworks by using a consistency loss on unlabeled real data. We make comparison\nwith 13 state-of-the-art dehazing methods on a new collected dataset (Haze4K)\nand two widely-used dehazing datasets (i.e., SOTS and HazeRD), as well as on\nreal-world hazy images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method has\nobvious quantitative and qualitative improvements over the existing methods.",

          "description": "Labeling is onerous for crowd counting as it should annotate each individual\nin crowd images. Recently, several methods have been proposed for\nsemi-supervised crowd counting to reduce the labeling efforts. Given a limited\nlabeling budget, they typically select a few crowd images and densely label all\nindividuals in each of them. Despite the promising results, we argue the\nNone-or-All labeling strategy is suboptimal as the densely labeled individuals\nin each crowd image usually appear similar while the massive unlabeled crowd\nimages may contain entirely diverse individuals. To this end, we propose to\nbreak the labeling chain of previous methods and make the first attempt to\nreduce spatial labeling redundancy for semi-supervised crowd counting. First,\ninstead of annotating all the regions in each crowd image, we propose to\nannotate the representative ones only. We analyze the region representativeness\nfrom both vertical and horizontal directions, and formulate them as cluster\ncenters of Gaussian Mixture Models. Additionally, to leverage the rich\nunlabeled regions, we exploit the similarities among individuals in each crowd\nimage to directly supervise the unlabeled regions via feature propagation\ninstead of the error-prone label propagation employed in the previous methods.\nIn this way, we can transfer the original spatial labeling redundancy caused by\nindividual similarities to effective supervision signals on the unlabeled\nregions. Extensive experiments on the widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that\nour method can outperform previous best approaches by a large margin.",

          "description": "Geometry-aware modules are widely applied in recent deep learning\narchitectures for scene representation and rendering. However, these modules\nrequire intrinsic camera information that might not be obtained accurately. In\nthis paper, we propose a Spatial Transformation Routing (STR) mechanism to\nmodel the spatial properties without applying any geometric prior. The STR\nmechanism treats the spatial transformation as the message passing process, and\nthe relation between the view poses and the routing weights is modeled by an\nend-to-end trainable neural network. Besides, an Occupancy Concept Mapping\n(OCM) framework is proposed to provide explainable rationals for scene-fusion\nprocesses. We conducted experiments on several datasets and show that the\nproposed STR mechanism improves the performance of the Generative Query Network\n(GQN). The visualization results reveal that the routing process can pass the\nobserved information from one location of some view to the associated location\nin the other view, which demonstrates the advantage of the proposed model in\nterms of spatial cognition.",

          "description": "A few-shot semantic segmentation model is typically composed of a CNN\nencoder, a CNN decoder and a simple classifier (separating foreground and\nbackground pixels). Most existing methods meta-learn all three model components\nfor fast adaptation to a new class. However, given that as few as a single\nsupport set image is available, effective model adaption of all three\ncomponents to the new class is extremely challenging. In this work we propose\nto simplify the meta-learning task by focusing solely on the simplest\ncomponent, the classifier, whilst leaving the encoder and decoder to\npre-training. We hypothesize that if we pre-train an off-the-shelf segmentation\nmodel over a set of diverse training classes with sufficient annotations, the\nencoder and decoder can capture rich discriminative features applicable for any\nunseen classes, rendering the subsequent meta-learning stage unnecessary. For\nthe classifier meta-learning, we introduce a Classifier Weight Transformer\n(CWT) designed to dynamically adapt the supportset trained classifier's weights\nto each query image in an inductive way. Extensive experiments on two standard\nbenchmarks show that despite its simplicity, our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art alternatives, often by a large margin.Code is available on\nhttps://github.com/zhiheLu/CWTfor-FSS.",

An\nindispensable part of the health diet is dietary assessment. Traditional manual\nrecording methods are burdensome and contain substantial biases and errors.\nRecent advances in Artificial Intelligence, especially computer vision\ntechnologies, have made it possible to develop automatic dietary assessment\nsolutions, which are more convenient, less time-consuming and even more\naccurate to monitor daily food intake.\n\nScope and approach: This review presents one unified Vision-Based Dietary\nAssessment (VBDA) framework, which generally consists of three stages: food\nimage analysis, volume estimation and nutrient derivation. Vision-based food\nanalysis methods, including food recognition, detection and segmentation, are\nsystematically summarized, and methods of volume estimation and nutrient\nderivation are also given. The prosperity of deep learning makes VBDA gradually\nmove to an end-to-end implementation, which applies food images to a single\nnetwork to directly estimate the nutrition. The recently proposed end-to-end\nmethods are also discussed. We further analyze existing dietary assessment\ndatasets, indicating that one large-scale benchmark is urgently needed, and\nfinally highlight key challenges and future trends for VBDA.\n\nKey findings and conclusions: After thorough exploration, we find that\nmulti-task end-to-end deep learning approaches are one important trend of VBDA.\nDespite considerable research progress, many challenges remain for VBDA due to\nthe meal complexity. We also provide the latest ideas for future development of\nVBDA, e.g., fine-grained food analysis and accurate volume estimation. This\nsurvey aims to encourage researchers to propose more practical solutions for\nVBDA.",

Prior methods typically\nattempt to recover the human body shape using a parametric-based template that\nlacks the surface details. As such resulting body shape appears to be without\nclothing. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based framework that\ncombines the robustness of the parametric model with the flexibility of\nfree-form 3D deformation.

However tapping the\npotential of radar sensing to reconstruct 3D object shapes remains a great\nchallenge, due to the characteristics of radar data such as sparsity, low\nresolution, specularity, high noise, and multi-path induced shadow reflections\nand artifacts. In this paper we propose 3D Reconstruction and Imaging via\nmmWave Radar (3DRIMR), a deep learning based architecture that reconstructs 3D\nshape of an object in dense detailed point cloud format, based on sparse raw\nmmWave radar intensity data. The architecture consists of two back-to-back\nconditional GAN deep neural networks: the first generator network generates 2D\ndepth images based on raw radar intensity data, and the second generator\nnetwork outputs 3D point clouds based on the results of the first generator.\nThe architecture exploits both convolutional neural network's convolutional\noperation (that extracts local structure neighborhood information) and the\nefficiency and detailed geometry capture capability of point clouds (other than\ncostly voxelization of 3D space or distance fields).

The main goal of our proposal is to explore object boundary\ninformation to improve the overall segmentation performance. Unlike previous\nworks that combine boundary and segmentation features, or those that use\nboundary information to regularize semantic segmentation, we instead propose a\nnovel approach that embodies boundary information onto segmentation. For that,\nour semantic segmentation method uses two streams, which are combined through\nan attention gate, forming an end-to-end Y-model. To the best of our knowledge,\nours is the first work to show that boundary detection can improve semantic\nsegmentation when fused through a semantic fusion gate (attention model). We\nperformed an extensive evaluation of our method over public data sets.

          "description": "Visual retrieval system faces frequent model update and deployment. It is a\nheavy workload to re-extract features of the whole database every time.Feature\ncompatibility enables the learned new visual features to be directly compared\nwith the old features stored in the database.

          "description": "This paper investigates a valuable setting called few-shot unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (FS-UDA), which has not been sufficiently studied in the\nliterature. In this setting, the source domain data are labelled, but with\nfew-shot per category, while the target domain data are unlabelled. To address\nthe FS-UDA setting, we develop a general UDA model to solve the following two\nkey issues: the few-shot labeled data per category and the domain adaptation\nbetween support and query sets. Our model is general in that once trained it\nwill be able to be applied to various FS-UDA tasks from the same source and\ntarget domains. Inspired by the recent local descriptor based few-shot learning\n(FSL), our general UDA model is fully built upon local descriptors (LDs) for\nimage classification and domain adaptation. By proposing a novel concept called\nsimilarity patterns (SPs), our model not only effectively considers the spatial\nrelationship of LDs that was ignored in previous FSL methods, but also makes\nthe learned image similarity better serve the required domain alignment.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel IMage-to-class sparse Similarity Encoding\n(IMSE) method. It learns SPs to extract the local discriminative information\nfor classification and meanwhile aligns the covariance matrix of the SPs for\ndomain adaptation. Also, domain adversarial training and multi-scale local\nfeature matching are performed upon LDs. Extensive experiments conducted on a\nmulti-domain benchmark dataset DomainNet demonstrates the state-of-the-art\nperformance of our IMSE for the novel setting of FS-UDA. In addition, for FSL,\nour IMSE can also show better performance than most of recent FSL methods on\nminiImageNet.",

          "description": "Existing domain adaptation methods for crowd counting view each crowd image\nas a whole and reduce domain discrepancies on crowds and backgrounds\nsimultaneously. However, we argue that these methods are suboptimal, as crowds\nand backgrounds have quite different characteristics and backgrounds may vary\ndramatically in different crowd scenes (see Fig.~\\ref{teaser}). This makes\ncrowds not well aligned across domains together with backgrounds in a holistic\nmanner. To this end, we propose to untangle crowds and backgrounds from crowd\nimages and design fine-grained domain adaption methods for crowd counting.\nDifferent from other tasks which possess region-based fine-grained annotations\n(e.g., segments or bounding boxes), crowd counting only annotates one point on\neach human head, which impedes the implementation of fine-grained adaptation\nmethods. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective schema to learn\ncrowd segmentation from point-level crowd counting annotations in the context\nof Multiple Instance Learning. We further leverage the derived segments to\npropose a crowd-aware fine-grained domain adaptation framework for crowd\ncounting, which consists of two novel adaptation modules, i.e., Crowd Region\nTransfer (CRT) and Crowd Density Alignment (CDA). Specifically, the CRT module\nis designed to guide crowd features transfer across domains beyond background\ndistractions, and the CDA module dedicates to constraining the target-domain\ncrowd density distributions. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain\nsettings (i.e., Synthetic $\\rightarrow$ Real, Fixed $\\rightarrow$ Fickle,\nNormal $\\rightarrow$ BadWeather) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nmethod compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Semantic segmentation of medical images is an essential first step in\ncomputer-aided diagnosis systems for many applications. However, given many\ndisparate imaging modalities and inherent variations in the patient data, it is\ndifficult to consistently achieve high accuracy using modern deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs). This has led researchers to propose interactive image\nsegmentation techniques where a medical expert can interactively correct the\noutput of a DNN to the desired accuracy. However, these techniques often need\nseparate training data with the associated human interactions, and do not\ngeneralize to various diseases, and types of medical images. In this paper, we\nsuggest a novel conditional inference technique for DNNs which takes the\nintervention by a medical expert as test time constraints and performs\ninference conditioned upon these constraints. Our technique is generic can be\nused for medical images from any modality. Unlike other methods, our approach\ncan correct multiple structures simultaneously and add structures missed at\ninitial segmentation. We report an improvement of 13.3, 12.5, 17.8, 10.2, and\n12.4 times in user annotation time than full human annotation for the nucleus,\nmultiple cells, liver and tumor, organ, and brain segmentation respectively. We\nreport a time saving of 2.8, 3.0, 1.9, 4.4, and 8.6 fold compared to other\ninteractive segmentation techniques. Our method can be useful to clinicians for\ndiagnosis and post-surgical follow-up with minimal intervention from the\nmedical expert.

          "description": "Structured text understanding on Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) is a crucial\npart of Document Intelligence. Due to the complexity of content and layout in\nVRDs, structured text understanding has been a challenging task. Most existing\nstudies decoupled this problem into two sub-tasks: entity labeling and entity\nlinking, which require an entire understanding of the context of documents at\nboth token and segment levels. However, little work has been concerned with the\nsolutions that efficiently extract the structured data from different levels.\nThis paper proposes a unified framework named StrucTexT, which is flexible and\neffective for handling both sub-tasks. Specifically, based on the transformer,\nwe introduce a segment-token aligned encoder to deal with the entity labeling\nand entity linking tasks at different levels of granularity. Moreover, we\ndesign a novel pre-training strategy with three self-supervised tasks to learn\na richer representation. StrucTexT uses the existing Masked Visual Language\nModeling task and the new Sentence Length Prediction and Paired Boxes Direction\ntasks to incorporate the multi-modal information across text, image, and\nlayout.

          "description": "The growing number of action classes has posed a new challenge for video\nunderstanding, making Zero-Shot Action Recognition (ZSAR) a thriving direction.\nThe ZSAR task aims to recognize target (unseen) actions without training\nexamples by leveraging semantic representations to bridge seen and unseen\nactions. However, due to the complexity and diversity of actions, it remains\nchallenging to semantically represent action classes and transfer knowledge\nfrom seen data. In this work, we propose an ER-enhanced ZSAR model inspired by\nan effective human memory technique Elaborative Rehearsal (ER), which involves\nelaborating a new concept and relating it to known concepts. Specifically, we\nexpand each action class as an Elaborative Description (ED) sentence, which is\nmore discriminative than a class name and less costly than manual-defined\nattributes. Besides directly aligning class semantics with videos, we\nincorporate objects from the video as Elaborative Concepts (EC) to improve\nvideo semantics and generalization from seen actions to unseen actions. Our\nER-enhanced ZSAR model achieves state-of-the-art results on three existing\nbenchmarks. Moreover, we propose a new ZSAR evaluation protocol on the Kinetics\ndataset to overcome limitations of current benchmarks and demonstrate the first\ncase where ZSAR performance is comparable to few-shot learning baselines on\nthis more realistic setting. We will release our codes and collected EDs at\nhttps://github.com/DeLightCMU/ElaborativeRehearsal.",

          "description": "In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous\ndriving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may\ncompromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have\ndemonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in\ndetection precision of deep learning-based 3D object detection models. Although\ndriving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no\ncomprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning\nmodels and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial\nattacks, perturbation attacks and patch attacks, on the driving safety of\nvision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep\nlearning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in\nvision-based 3D object detection, Stereo R-CNN and DSGN. To evaluate driving\nsafety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving\nsafety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive\nevaluation experiments, we find that (1) the attack's impact on the driving\nsafety of autonomous vehicles and the attack's impact on the precision of 3D\nobject detectors are decoupled, and (2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger\nrobustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we\nfurther investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study.\nThe findings of this paper provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial\nattacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.",

The goal is to learn a robust model from a\nsingle source and expect it to generalize over many unknown distributions. This\nchallenging problem has been seldom investigated while existing solutions\nsuffer from various limitations such as the ignorance of uncertainty assessment\nand label augmentation. In this paper, we propose uncertainty-guided domain\ngeneralization to tackle the aforementioned limitations. The key idea is to\naugment the source capacity in both feature and label spaces, while the\naugmentation is guided by uncertainty assessment. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work to (1) quantify the generalization uncertainty from a\nsingle source and (2) leverage it to guide both feature and label augmentation\nfor robust generalization. The model training and deployment are effectively\norganized in a Bayesian meta-learning framework. We conduct extensive\ncomparisons and ablation study to validate our approach.

          "description": "Transfer learning allows the reuse of deep learning features on new datasets\nwith limited data. However, the resulting models could be unnecessarily large\nand thus inefficient. Although network pruning can be applied to improve\ninference efficiency, existing algorithms usually require fine-tuning and may\nnot be suitable for small datasets. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that\ntransforms the convolutional weights into the subspaces of orthonormal bases\nwhere a model is pruned. Using singular value decomposition, we decompose a\nconvolutional layer into two layers: a convolutional layer with the orthonormal\nbasis vectors as the filters, and a layer that we name \"BasisScalingConv\",\nwhich is responsible for rescaling the features and transforming them back to\nthe original space. As the filters in each transformed layer are linearly\nindependent with known relative importance, pruning can be more effective and\nstable, and fine tuning individual weights is unnecessary. Furthermore, as the\nnumbers of input and output channels of the original convolutional layer remain\nunchanged, basis pruning is applicable to virtually all network architectures.\nBasis pruning can also be combined with existing pruning algorithms for double\npruning to further increase the pruning capability. With less than 1% reduction\nin the classification accuracy, we can achieve pruning ratios up to 98.9% in\nparameters and 98.6% in FLOPs.",

          "description": "Image Retrieval is a fundamental task of obtaining images similar to the\nquery one from a database. A common image retrieval practice is to firstly\nretrieve candidate images via similarity search using global image features and\nthen re-rank the candidates by leveraging their local features. Previous\nlearning-based studies mainly focus on either global or local image\nrepresentation learning to tackle the retrieval task. In this paper, we abandon\nthe two-stage paradigm and seek to design an effective single-stage solution by\nintegrating local and global information inside images into compact image\nrepresentations. Specifically, we propose a Deep Orthogonal Local and Global\n(DOLG) information fusion framework for end-to-end image retrieval. It\nattentively extracts representative local information with multi-atrous\nconvolutions and self-attention at first. Components orthogonal to the global\nimage representation are then extracted from the local information. At last,\nthe orthogonal components are concatenated with the global representation as a\ncomplementary, and then aggregation is performed to generate the final\nrepresentation. The whole framework is end-to-end differentiable and can be\ntrained with image-level labels. Extensive experimental results validate the\neffectiveness of our solution and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art\nimage retrieval performances on Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.",

          "description": "Most of the existing works in supervised spatio-temporal video\nsuper-resolution (STVSR) heavily rely on a large-scale external dataset\nconsisting of paired low-resolution low-frame rate (LR-LFR)and high-resolution\nhigh-frame-rate (HR-HFR) videos. Despite their remarkable performance, these\nmethods make a prior assumption that the low-resolution video is obtained by\ndown-scaling the high-resolution video using a known degradation kernel, which\ndoes not hold in practical settings. Another problem with these methods is that\nthey cannot exploit instance-specific internal information of video at testing\ntime. Recently, deep internal learning approaches have gained attention due to\ntheir ability to utilize the instance-specific statistics of a video. However,\nthese methods have a large inference time as they require thousands of gradient\nupdates to learn the intrinsic structure of the data. In this work, we\npresentAdaptiveVideoSuper-Resolution (Ada-VSR) which leverages external, as\nwell as internal, information through meta-transfer learning and internal\nlearning, respectively. Specifically, meta-learning is employed to obtain\nadaptive parameters, using a large-scale external dataset, that can adapt\nquickly to the novel condition (degradation model) of the given test video\nduring the internal learning task, thereby exploiting external and internal\ninformation of a video for super-resolution. The model trained using our\napproach can quickly adapt to a specific video condition with only a few\ngradient updates, which reduces the inference time significantly.

          "description": "A lifespan face synthesis (LFS) model aims to generate a set of\nphoto-realistic face images of a person's whole life, given only one snapshot\nas reference. The generated face image given a target age code is expected to\nbe age-sensitive reflected by bio-plausible transformations of shape and\ntexture, while being identity preserving. This is extremely challenging because\nthe shape and texture characteristics of a face undergo separate and highly\nnonlinear transformations w.r.t. age. Most recent LFS models are based on\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) whereby age code conditional\ntransformations are applied to a latent face representation. They benefit\ngreatly from the recent advancements of GANs. However, without explicitly\ndisentangling their latent representations into the texture, shape and identity\nfactors, they are fundamentally limited in modeling the nonlinear age-related\ntransformation on texture and shape whilst preserving identity. In this work, a\nnovel LFS model is proposed to disentangle the key face characteristics\nincluding shape, texture and identity so that the unique shape and texture age\ntransformations can be modeled effectively. This is achieved by extracting\nshape, texture and identity features separately from an encoder. Critically,\ntwo transformation modules, one conditional convolution based and the other\nchannel attention based, are designed for modeling the nonlinear shape and\ntexture feature transformations respectively. This is to accommodate their\nrather distinct aging processes and ensure that our synthesized images are both\nage-sensitive and identity preserving. Extensive experiments show that our LFS\nmodel is clearly superior to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

AlexNet works show good sensitivity when\ntrained on non-augmented data. Other models demonstrate a value of less than\n60% when trained on non-augmented data.

Nevertheless, a plethora of other forms\nof communication is left unexplored. In fact, human communication originated in\ngestures and oftentimes is delivered through multimodal cues, e.g. \"go there\"\nwith a pointing gesture. To bridge the gap and fill in the missing dimension of\ncommunication in embodied agent navigation, we propose investigating the\neffects of using gestures as the communicative interface instead of verbal\ncues. Specifically, we develop a VR-based 3D simulation environment, named\nGes-THOR, based on AI2-THOR platform. In this virtual environment, a human\nplayer is placed in the same virtual scene and shepherds the artificial agent\nusing only gestures. The agent is tasked to solve the navigation problem guided\nby natural gestures with unknown semantics; we do not use any predefined\ngestures due to the diversity and versatile nature of human gestures. We argue\nthat learning the semantics of natural gestures is mutually beneficial to\nlearning the navigation task--learn to communicate and communicate to learn. In\na series of experiments, we demonstrate that human gesture cues, even without\npredefined semantics, improve the object-goal navigation for an embodied agent,\noutperforming various state-of-the-art methods.",

Image captioning bridges a gap between computer\nvision and natural language processing. Automated image captioning is used as a\ntool to eliminate the need for human agent for creating descriptive captions\nfor unseen images.Automated image captioning is challenging and yet\ninteresting. One reason is that AI based systems capable of generating\nsentences that describe an input image could be used in a wide variety of tasks\nbeyond generating captions for unseen images found on web or uploaded to social\nmedia.

          "description": "Point cloud segmentation is a fundamental task in 3D. Despite recent progress\non point cloud segmentation with the power of deep networks, current deep\nlearning methods based on the clean label assumptions may fail with noisy\nlabels. Yet, object class labels are often mislabeled in real-world point cloud\ndatasets. In this work, we take the lead in solving this issue by proposing a\nnovel Point Noise-Adaptive Learning (PNAL) framework. Compared to existing\nnoise-robust methods on image tasks, our PNAL is noise-rate blind, to cope with\nthe spatially variant noise rate problem specific to point clouds.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel point-wise confidence selection to obtain\nreliable labels based on the historical predictions of each point. A novel\ncluster-wise label correction is proposed with a voting strategy to generate\nthe best possible label taking the neighbor point correlations into\nconsideration. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of PNAL on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets. In\nparticular, even with $60\\%$ symmetric noisy labels, our proposed method\nproduces much better results than its baseline counterpart without PNAL and is\ncomparable to the ideal upper bound trained on a completely clean dataset.\nMoreover, we fully re-labeled the validation set of a popular but noisy\nreal-world scene dataset ScanNetV2 to make it clean, for rigorous experiment\nand future research.

Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines\nhow AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data\nin the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as\ndeepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current\nmultimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can\ndetect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to\ntheir reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in\nthis work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks' learning dynamics,\nemphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose\nContinual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the\nconcept of Continual Learning (CL), Representation Learning (RL), and Knowledge\nDistillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain adaptation\ntasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets, while\neffectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student model\nsetting.

As a result, synthesized images can often over-adapt to the\nreference domain, losing important structural characteristics and suffering\nfrom suboptimal visual quality. To solve these challenges, we propose a novel\nfrequency domain image translation (FDIT) framework, exploiting frequency\ninformation for enhancing the image generation process. Our key idea is to\ndecompose the image into low-frequency and high-frequency components, where the\nhigh-frequency feature captures object structure akin to the identity. Our\ntraining objective facilitates the preservation of frequency information in\nboth pixel space and Fourier spectral space. We broadly evaluate FDIT across\nfive large-scale datasets and multiple tasks including image translation and\nGAN inversion. Extensive experiments and ablations show that FDIT effectively\npreserves the identity of the source image, and produces photo-realistic\nimages. FDIT establishes state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average FID\nscore by 5.6% compared to the previous best method.",

Generative models have also been applied for the latter, in order to\nhave endless sources of data. In this paper, we propose a novel method that\ncombines the strengths of regularization and generative-based rehearsal\napproaches.

In the paper,\ninspired by the idea, we proposed a lightweight CNN using Lego filters for HAR.\nA set of lower-dimensional filters is used as Lego bricks to be stacked for\nconventional filters, which does not rely on any special network structure. The\nlocal loss function is used to train model. To our knowledge, this is the first\npaper that proposes lightweight CNN for HAR in ubiquitous and wearable\ncomputing arena. The experiment results on five public HAR datasets, UCI-HAR\ndataset, OPPORTUNITY dataset, UNIMIB-SHAR dataset, PAMAP2 dataset, and WISDM\ndataset collected from either smartphones or multiple sensor nodes, indicate\nthat our novel Lego CNN with local loss can greatly reduce memory and\ncomputation cost over CNN, while achieving higher accuracy. That is to say, the\nproposed model is smaller, faster and more accurate. Finally, we evaluate the\nactual performance on an Android smartphone.",

Progresses in this area, however, are often characterized by\ncomplicated methods, heavy computations, and lack of intuitive explanations. To\neffectively capture different spatial regions occupied by objects from\ndifferent categories, we propose an embarrassingly simple module, named\nclass-specific residual attention (CSRA). CSRA generates class-specific\nfeatures for every category by proposing a simple spatial attention score, and\nthen combines it with the class-agnostic average pooling feature. CSRA achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on multilabel recognition, and at the same time is\nmuch simpler than them. Furthermore, with only 4 lines of code, CSRA also leads\nto consistent improvement across many diverse pretrained models and datasets\nwithout any extra training.

          "description": "Automatic and accurate tumor segmentation on medical images is in high demand\nto assist physicians with diagnosis and treatment. However, it is difficult to\nobtain massive amounts of annotated training data required by the deep-learning\nmodels as the manual delineation process is often tedious and expertise\nrequired. Although self-supervised learning (SSL) scheme has been widely\nadopted to address this problem, most SSL methods focus only on global\nstructure information, ignoring the key distinguishing features of tumor\nregions: local intensity variation and large size distribution. In this paper,\nwe propose Scale-Aware Restoration (SAR), a SSL method for 3D tumor\nsegmentation. Specifically, a novel proxy task, i.e. scale discrimination, is\nformulated to pre-train the 3D neural network combined with the\nself-restoration task. Thus, the pre-trained model learns multi-level local\nrepresentations through multi-scale inputs. Moreover, an adversarial learning\nmodule is further introduced to learn modality invariant representations from\nmultiple unlabeled source datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethods on two downstream tasks: i) Brain tumor segmentation, ii) Pancreas\ntumor segmentation. Compared with the state-of-the-art 3D SSL methods, our\nproposed approach can significantly improve the segmentation accuracy.

In contrast to previous efforts which require to\nestablish cross-view correspondence based on noisy 2D pose estimates, it\ndirectly estimates and tracks 3D poses from a 3D voxel-based representation\nconstructed from multi-view images.

The deep features being distinguishing in\nclassification from the convolutional neural networks (CNN) are demonstrated in\nthis study to provide comprehensive interpretability for the proposed CAD\nsystem using pathological knowledge. Methods: In the experiment, a total of 186\nslides of WSIs were collected and classified into three categories:\nNon-Carcinoma, Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma\n(IDC). Instead of conducting pixel-wise classification into three classes\ndirectly, we designed a hierarchical framework with the multi-view scheme that\nperforms lesion detection for region proposal at higher magnification first and\nthen conducts lesion classification at lower magnification for each detected\nlesion. Results: The slide-level accuracy rate for three-category\nclassification reaches 90.8% (99/109) through 5-fold cross-validation and\nachieves 94.8% (73/77) on the testing set. The experimental results show that\nthe morphological characteristics and co-occurrence properties learned by the\ndeep learning models for lesion classification are accordant with the clinical\nrules in diagnosis. Conclusion: The pathological interpretability of the deep\nfeatures not only enhances the reliability of the proposed CAD system to gain\nacceptance from medical specialists, but also facilitates the development of\ndeep learning frameworks for various tasks in pathology.

To classify query\ninstances from novel classes encountered at test-time, they only require a\nsupport set composed of a few labelled samples. FSL benchmarks commonly assume\nthat those queries come from the same distribution as instances in the support\nset. However, in a realistic set-ting, data distribution is plausibly subject\nto change, a situation referred to as Distribution Shift (DS). The present work\naddresses the new and challenging problem of Few-Shot Learning under\nSupport/Query Shift (FSQS) i.e., when support and query instances are sampled\nfrom related but different distributions. Our contributions are the following.\nFirst, we release a testbed for FSQS, including datasets, relevant baselines\nand a protocol for a rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Second, we observe\nthat well-established FSL algorithms unsurprisingly suffer from a considerable\ndrop in accuracy when facing FSQS, stressing the significance of our study.\nFinally, we show that transductive algorithms can limit the inopportune effect\nof DS. In particular, we study both the role of Batch-Normalization and Optimal\nTransport (OT) in aligning distributions, bridging Unsupervised Domain\nAdaptation with FSL. This results in a new method that efficiently combines OT\nwith the celebrated Prototypical Networks. We bring compelling experiments\ndemonstrating the advantage of our method.

          "description": "In this paper, we build on a concept of self-supervision by taking RGB frames\nas input to learn to predict both action concepts and auxiliary descriptors\ne.g., object descriptors. So-called hallucination streams are trained to\npredict auxiliary cues, simultaneously fed into classification layers, and then\nhallucinated at the testing stage to aid network. We design and hallucinate two\ndescriptors, one leveraging four popular object detectors applied to training\nvideos, and the other leveraging image- and video-level saliency detectors. The\nfirst descriptor encodes the detector- and ImageNet-wise class prediction\nscores, confidence scores, and spatial locations of bounding boxes and frame\nindexes to capture the spatio-temporal distribution of features per video.\nAnother descriptor encodes spatio-angular gradient distributions of saliency\nmaps and intensity patterns. Inspired by the characteristic function of the\nprobability distribution, we capture four statistical moments on the above\nintermediate descriptors. As numbers of coefficients in the mean, covariance,\ncoskewness and cokurtotsis grow linearly, quadratically, cubically and\nquartically w.r.t. the dimension of feature vectors, we describe the covariance\nmatrix by its leading n' eigenvectors (so-called subspace) and we capture\nskewness/kurtosis rather than costly coskewness/cokurtosis.

          "description": "Multi-phase computed tomography (CT) images provide crucial complementary\ninformation for accurate liver tumor segmentation (LiTS). State-of-the-art\nmulti-phase LiTS methods usually fused cross-phase features through\nphase-weighted summation or channel-attention based concatenation. However,\nthese methods ignored the spatial (pixel-wise) relationships between different\nphases, hence leading to insufficient feature integration. In addition, the\nperformance of existing methods remains subject to the uncertainty in\nsegmentation, which is particularly acute in tumor boundary regions. In this\nwork, we propose a novel LiTS method to adequately aggregate multi-phase\ninformation and refine uncertain region segmentation. To this end, we introduce\na spatial aggregation module (SAM), which encourages per-pixel interactions\nbetween different phases, to make full use of cross-phase information.\nMoreover, we devise an uncertain region inpainting module (URIM) to refine\nuncertain pixels using neighboring discriminative features. Experiments on an\nin-house multi-phase CT dataset of focal liver lesions (MPCT-FLLs) demonstrate\nthat our method achieves promising liver tumor segmentation and outperforms\nstate-of-the-arts.",

          "description": "Head shapes play an important role in 3D character design. In this work, we\npropose SimpModeling, a novel sketch-based system for helping users, especially\namateur users, easily model 3D animalmorphic heads - a prevalent kind of heads\nin character design. Although sketching provides an easy way to depict desired\nshapes, it is challenging to infer dense geometric information from sparse line\ndrawings. Recently, deepnet-based approaches have been taken to address this\nchallenge and try to produce rich geometric details from very few strokes.\nHowever, while such methods reduce users' workload, they would cause less\ncontrollability of target shapes. This is mainly due to the uncertainty of the\nneural prediction. Our system tackles this issue and provides good\ncontrollability from three aspects: 1) we separate coarse shape design and\ngeometric detail specification into two stages and respectively provide\ndifferent sketching means; 2) in coarse shape designing, sketches are used for\nboth shape inference and geometric constraints to determine global geometry,\nand in geometric detail crafting, sketches are used for carving surface\ndetails; 3) in both stages, we use the advanced implicit-based shape inference\nmethods, which have strong ability to handle the domain gap between freehand\nsketches and synthetic ones used for training. Experimental results confirm the\neffectiveness of our method and the usability of our interactive system.

          "description": "In this paper, we argue that the unsatisfactory out-of-distribution (OOD)\ndetection performance of neural networks is mainly due to the SoftMax loss\nanisotropy and propensity to produce low entropy probability distributions in\ndisagreement with the principle of maximum entropy. Current out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection approaches usually do not directly fix the SoftMax loss\ndrawbacks, but rather build techniques to circumvent it. Unfortunately, those\nmethods usually produce undesired side effects (e.g., classification accuracy\ndrop, additional hyperparameters, slower inferences, and collecting extra\ndata). In the opposite direction, we propose replacing SoftMax loss with a\nnovel loss function that does not suffer from the mentioned weaknesses. The\nproposed IsoMax loss is isotropic (exclusively distance-based) and provides\nhigh entropy posterior probability distributions. Replacing the SoftMax loss by\nIsoMax loss requires no model or training changes. Additionally, the models\ntrained with IsoMax loss produce as fast and energy-efficient inferences as\nthose trained using SoftMax loss. Moreover, no classification accuracy drop is\nobserved. The proposed method does not rely on outlier/background data,\nhyperparameter tuning, temperature calibration, feature extraction, metric\nlearning, adversarial training, ensemble procedures, or generative models. Our\nexperiments showed that IsoMax loss works as a seamless SoftMax loss drop-in\nreplacement that significantly improves neural networks' OOD detection\nperformance. Hence, it may be used as a baseline OOD detection approach to be\ncombined with current or future OOD detection techniques to achieve even higher\nresults.",

          "description": "Detection transformers have recently shown promising object detection results\nand attracted increasing attention. However, how to develop effective domain\nadaptation techniques to improve its cross-domain performance remains\nunexplored and unclear. In this paper, we delve into this topic and empirically\nfind that direct feature distribution alignment on the CNN backbone only brings\nlimited improvements, as it does not guarantee domain-invariant sequence\nfeatures in the transformer for prediction. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel Sequence Feature Alignment (SFA) method that is specially designed for\nthe adaptation of detection transformers. Technically, SFA consists of a domain\nquery-based feature alignment (DQFA) module and a token-wise feature alignment\n(TDA) module. In DQFA, a novel domain query is used to aggregate and align\nglobal context from the token sequence of both domains. DQFA reduces the domain\ndiscrepancy in global feature representations and object relations when\ndeploying in the transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Meanwhile, TDA\naligns token features in the sequence from both domains, which reduces the\ndomain gaps in local and instance-level feature representations in the\ntransformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Besides, a novel bipartite\nmatching consistency loss is proposed to enhance the feature discriminability\nfor robust object detection. Experiments on three challenging benchmarks show\nthat SFA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptive object detection methods.\nCode has been made available at: https://github.com/encounter1997/SFA.",

          "description": "In this paper, we firstly present a dataset (X4K1000FPS) of 4K videos of 1000\nfps with the extreme motion to the research community for video frame\ninterpolation (VFI), and propose an extreme VFI network, called XVFI-Net, that\nfirst handles the VFI for 4K videos with large motion. The XVFI-Net is based on\na recursive multi-scale shared structure that consists of two cascaded modules\nfor bidirectional optical flow learning between two input frames (BiOF-I) and\nfor bidirectional optical flow learning from target to input frames (BiOF-T).\nThe optical flows are stably approximated by a complementary flow reversal\n(CFR) proposed in BiOF-T module. During inference, the BiOF-I module can start\nat any scale of input while the BiOF-T module only operates at the original\ninput scale so that the inference can be accelerated while maintaining highly\naccurate VFI performance. Extensive experimental results show that our XVFI-Net\ncan successfully capture the essential information of objects with extremely\nlarge motions and complex textures while the state-of-the-art methods exhibit\npoor performance. Furthermore, our XVFI-Net framework also performs comparably\non the previous lower resolution benchmark dataset, which shows a robustness of\nour algorithm as well. All source codes, pre-trained models, and proposed\nX4K1000FPS datasets are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/JihyongOh/XVFI.",

Recently, Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles (UAV) based applications have dominated aerial sensing research.\nHowever, a literature revision that combines both \"deep learning\" and \"UAV\nremote sensing\" thematics has not yet been conducted. The motivation for our\nwork was to present a comprehensive review of the fundamentals of Deep Learning\n(DL) applied in UAV-based imagery. We focused mainly on describing\nclassification and regression techniques used in recent applications with\nUAV-acquired data. For that, a total of 232 papers published in international\nscientific journal databases was examined. We gathered the published material\nand evaluated their characteristics regarding application, sensor, and\ntechnique used. We relate how DL presents promising results and has the\npotential for processing tasks associated with UAV-based image data. Lastly, we\nproject future perspectives, commentating on prominent DL paths to be explored\nin the UAV remote sensing field. Our revision consists of a friendly-approach\nto introduce, commentate, and summarize the state-of-the-art in UAV-based image\napplications with DNNs algorithms in diverse subfields of remote sensing,\ngrouping it in the environmental, urban, and agricultural contexts.",

To be able to\nimage even large specimens, techniques like multi-view light-sheet imaging\nrecord different orientations at each time point that can then be fused into a\nsingle high-quality volume. Based on measured point spread functions (PSF),\ndeconvolution and content fusion are able to largely revert the inevitable\ndegradation occurring during the imaging process. Classical multi-view\ndeconvolution and fusion methods mainly use iterative procedures and\ncontent-based averaging. Lately, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been\ndeployed to approach 3D single-view deconvolution microscopy, but the\nmulti-view case waits to be studied. We investigated the efficacy of CNN-based\nmulti-view deconvolution and fusion with two synthetic data sets that mimic\ndeveloping embryos and involve either two or four complementary 3D views.\nCompared with classical state-of-the-art methods, the proposed semi- and\nself-supervised models achieve competitive and superior deconvolution and\nfusion quality in the two-view and quad-view cases, respectively.",

          "description": "Recent deep generative models have achieved promising performance in image\ninpainting. However, it is still very challenging for a neural network to\ngenerate realistic image details and textures, due to its inherent spectral\nbias. By our understanding of how artists work, we suggest to adopt a\n`structure first detail next' workflow for image inpainting. To this end, we\npropose to build a Pyramid Generator by stacking several sub-generators, where\nlower-layer sub-generators focus on restoring image structures while the\nhigher-layer sub-generators emphasize image details. Given an input image, it\nwill be gradually restored by going through the entire pyramid in a bottom-up\nfashion. Particularly, our approach has a learning scheme of progressively\nincreasing hole size, which allows it to restore large-hole images. In\naddition, our method could fully exploit the benefits of learning with\nhigh-resolution images, and hence is suitable for high-resolution image\ninpainting. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets have validated\nthe effectiveness of our approach compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

Our work builds upon a recent\nsupervised 3D CNN-based descriptor extraction framework, namely, 3DSmoothNet,\nwhich leverages a voxel-based representation to parameterize the surrounding\ngeometry of interest points. Instead of using a predefined fixed-size local\nsupport in voxelization, which potentially limits the access of richer local\ngeometry information, we propose to learn the support size in a data-driven\nmanner. To this end, we design a differentiable voxelization module that can\nback-propagate gradients to the support size optimization. To optimize\ndescriptor similarity, the prior 3D CNN work and other supervised methods\nrequire abundant correspondence labels or pose annotations of point clouds for\ncrafting metric learning losses. Differently, we show that unsupervised\nlearning of descriptor similarity can be achieved by performing geometric\nregistration in networks.

In this paper, we introduce a new attention-based encoder,\nvision transformer, into salient object detection to ensure the globalization\nof the representations from shallow to deep layers. With the global view in\nvery shallow layers, the transformer encoder preserves more local\nrepresentations to recover the spatial details in final saliency maps. Besides,\nas each layer can capture a global view of its previous layer, adjacent layers\ncan implicitly maximize the representation differences and minimize the\nredundant features, making that every output feature of transformer layers\ncontributes uniquely for final prediction.

          "description": "Recent approaches to efficiently ensemble neural networks have shown that\nstrong robustness and uncertainty performance can be achieved with a negligible\ngain in parameters over the original network. However, these methods still\nrequire multiple forward passes for prediction, leading to a significant\ncomputational cost. In this work, we show a surprising result: the benefits of\nusing multiple predictions can be achieved `for free' under a single model's\nforward pass. In particular, we show that, using a multi-input multi-output\n(MIMO) configuration, one can utilize a single model's capacity to train\nmultiple subnetworks that independently learn the task at hand. By ensembling\nthe predictions made by the subnetworks, we improve model robustness without\nincreasing compute. We observe a significant improvement in negative\nlog-likelihood, accuracy, and calibration error on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet,\nand their out-of-distribution variants compared to previous methods.",

To assist advertisers in navigating such\nthird party libraries, we study the problem of automatically fetching relevant\nad images given the ad text (via a short textual query for images). Motivated\nby our observations in logged data on ad image search queries (given ad text),\nwe formulate a keyword extraction problem, where a keyword extracted from the\nad text (or its augmented version) serves as the ad image query. In this\ncontext, we propose VisualTextRank: an unsupervised method to (i) augment input\nad text using semantically similar ads, and (ii) extract the image query from\nthe augmented ad text. VisualTextRank builds on prior work on graph based\ncontext extraction (biased TextRank in particular) by leveraging both the text\nand image of similar ads for better keyword extraction, and using advertiser\ncategory specific biasing with sentence-BERT embeddings. Using data collected\nfrom the Verizon Media Native (Yahoo Gemini) ad platform's stock image search\nfeature for onboarding advertisers, we demonstrate the superiority of\nVisualTextRank compared to competitive keyword extraction baselines (including\nan $11\\%$ accuracy lift over biased TextRank). For the case when the stock\nimage library is restricted to English queries, we show the effectiveness of\nVisualTextRank on multilingual ads (translated to English) while leveraging\nsemantically similar English ads. Online tests with a simplified version of\nVisualTextRank led to a 28.7% increase in the usage of stock image search, and\na 41.6% increase in the advertiser onboarding rate in the Verizon Media Native\nad platform.",

          "description": "Contrastive learning has revolutionized self-supervised image representation\nlearning field, and recently been adapted to video domain. One of the greatest\nadvantages of contrastive learning is that it allows us to flexibly define\npowerful loss objectives as long as we can find a reasonable way to formulate\npositive and negative samples to contrast. However, existing approaches rely\nheavily on the short-range spatiotemporal salience to form clip-level\ncontrastive signals, thus limit themselves from using global context. In this\npaper, we propose a new video-level contrastive learning method based on\nsegments to formulate positive pairs. Our formulation is able to capture global\ncontext in a video, thus robust to temporal content change. We also incorporate\na temporal order regularization term to enforce the inherent sequential\nstructure of videos. Extensive experiments show that our video-level\ncontrastive learning framework (VCLR) is able to outperform previous\nstate-of-the-arts on five video datasets for downstream action classification,\naction localization and video retrieval.

          "description": "Parametric 3D models have enabled a wide variety of tasks in computer\ngraphics and vision, such as modeling human bodies, faces, and hands. However,\nthe construction of these parametric models is often tedious, as it requires\nheavy manual tweaking, and they struggle to represent additional complexity and\ndetails such as wrinkles or clothing. To this end, we propose Neural Parametric\nModels (NPMs), a novel, learned alternative to traditional, parametric 3D\nmodels, which does not require hand-crafted, object-specific constraints. In\nparticular, we learn to disentangle 4D dynamics into latent-space\nrepresentations of shape and pose, leveraging the flexibility of recent\ndevelopments in learned implicit functions. Crucially, once learned, our neural\nparametric models of shape and pose enable optimization over the learned spaces\nto fit to new observations, similar to the fitting of a traditional parametric\nmodel, e.g., SMPL. This enables NPMs to achieve a significantly more accurate\nand detailed representation of observed deformable sequences. We show that NPMs\nimprove notably over both parametric and non-parametric state of the art in\nreconstruction and tracking of monocular depth sequences of clothed humans and\nhands. Latent-space interpolation as well as shape/pose transfer experiments\nfurther demonstrate the usefulness of NPMs. Code is publicly available at\nhttps://pablopalafox.github.io/npms.",

The approach aims to overcome the view\ndependence of appearance-based relocalisation methods using point features or\nimages. During the map construction, we use a pre-trained neural network to\ndetect objects and estimate 6D poses from RGB-D data. An incremental\nprobabilistic model is used to aggregate estimates over time to create the\nobject map. Then in relocalisation, we use the same network to extract\nobjects-of-interest in the `lost' frames. Pairwise geometric matching finds\ncorrespondences between map and frame objects, and probabilistic absolute\norientation followed by application of iterative closest point to dense depth\nmaps and object centroids gives relocalisation.

In\nthis paper, we cast point cloud registration into a planning problem in\nreinforcement learning, which can seek the transformation between the source\nand target point clouds through trial and error. By modeling the point cloud\nregistration process as a Markov decision process (MDP), we develop a latent\ndynamic model of point clouds, consisting of a transformation network and\nevaluation network. The transformation network aims to predict the new\ntransformed feature of the point cloud after performing a rigid transformation\n(i.e., action) on it while the evaluation network aims to predict the alignment\nprecision between the transformed source point cloud and target point cloud as\nthe reward signal. Once the dynamic model of the point cloud is trained, we\nemploy the cross-entropy method (CEM) to iteratively update the planning policy\nby maximizing the rewards in the point cloud registration process. Thus, the\noptimal policy, i.e., the transformation between the source and target point\nclouds, can be obtained via gradually narrowing the search space of the\ntransformation.

          "description": "The proliferation of automated facial recognition in various commercial and\ngovernment sectors has caused significant privacy concerns for individuals. A\nrecent and popular approach to address these privacy concerns is to employ\nevasion attacks against the metric embedding networks powering facial\nrecognition systems. Face obfuscation systems generate imperceptible\nperturbations, when added to an image, cause the facial recognition system to\nmisidentify the user. The key to these approaches is the generation of\nperturbations using a pre-trained metric embedding network followed by their\napplication to an online system, whose model might be proprietary. This\ndependence of face obfuscation on metric embedding networks, which are known to\nbe unfair in the context of facial recognition, surfaces the question of\ndemographic fairness -- \\textit{are there demographic disparities in the\nperformance of face obfuscation systems?} To address this question, we perform\nan analytical and empirical exploration of the performance of recent face\nobfuscation systems that rely on deep embedding networks. We find that metric\nembedding networks are demographically aware; they cluster faces in the\nembedding space based on their demographic attributes. We observe that this\neffect carries through to the face obfuscation systems: faces belonging to\nminority groups incur reduced utility compared to those from majority groups.\nFor example, the disparity in average obfuscation success rate on the online\nFace++ API can reach up to 20 percentage points. Further, for some demographic\ngroups, the average perturbation size increases by up to 17\\% when choosing a\ntarget identity belonging to a different demographic group versus the same\ndemographic group. Finally, we present a simple analytical model to provide\ninsights into these phenomena.",

In this paper, we study a novel setting of this problem:\nmodel-free single-object tracking (SOT), which takes the object state in the\nfirst frame as input, and jointly solves state estimation and tracking in\nsubsequent frames. The main purpose for this new setting is to break the strong\nlimitation of the popular \"detection and tracking\" scheme in multi-object\ntracking. Moreover, we notice that shape completion by overlaying the point\nclouds, which is a by-product of our proposed task, not only improves the\nperformance of state estimation but also has numerous applications. As no\nbenchmark for this task is available so far, we construct a new dataset\nLiDAR-SOT and corresponding evaluation protocols based on the Waymo Open\ndataset.

Our quantitative and qualitative results prove the effectiveness of our\nSOTracker and reveal the challenging cases for SOT in point clouds, including\nthe sparsity of LiDAR data, abrupt motion variation, etc. Finally, we also\nexplore how the proposed task and algorithm may benefit other autonomous\ndriving applications, including simulating LiDAR scans, generating motion data,\nand annotating optical flow.

          "description": "Current state-of-the-art object detectors can have significant performance\ndrop when deployed in the wild due to domain gaps with training data.\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a promising approach to adapt models\nfor new domains/environments without any expensive label cost. However, without\nground truth labels, most prior works on UDA for object detection tasks can\nonly perform coarse image-level and/or feature-level adaptation by using\nadversarial learning methods. In this work, we show that such adversarial-based\nmethods can only reduce the domain style gap, but cannot address the domain\ncontent distribution gap that is shown to be important for object detectors. To\novercome this limitation, we propose the Cross-Domain Semi-Supervised Learning\n(CDSSL) framework by leveraging high-quality pseudo labels to learn better\nrepresentations from the target domain directly. To enable SSL for cross-domain\nobject detection, we propose fine-grained domain transfer,\nprogressive-confidence-based label sharpening and imbalanced sampling strategy\nto address two challenges: (i) non-identical distribution between source and\ntarget domain data, (ii) error amplification/accumulation due to noisy pseudo\nlabeling on the target domain. Experiment results show that our proposed\napproach consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance (2.2% - 9.5%\nbetter than prior best work on mAP) under various domain gap scenarios. The\ncode will be released.",

In addition to widely studied additive noise based\nperturbations, adversarial examples can also be created by applying a per pixel\nspatial drift on input images. While spatial transformation based adversarial\nexamples look more natural to human observers due to absence of additive noise,\nthey still possess visible distortions caused by spatial transformations. Since\nthe human vision is more sensitive to the distortions in the luminance compared\nto those in chrominance channels, which is one of the main ideas behind the\nlossy visual multimedia compression standards, we propose a spatial\ntransformation based perturbation method to create adversarial examples by only\nmodifying the color components of an input image.

          "description": "We introduce a new efficient framework, the Unified Context Network (UniCon),\nfor robust active speaker detection (ASD). Traditional methods for ASD usually\noperate on each candidate's pre-cropped face track separately and do not\nsufficiently consider the relationships among the candidates. This potentially\nlimits performance, especially in challenging scenarios with low-resolution\nfaces, multiple candidates, etc. Our solution is a novel, unified framework\nthat focuses on jointly modeling multiple types of contextual information:\nspatial context to indicate the position and scale of each candidate's face,\nrelational context to capture the visual relationships among the candidates and\ncontrast audio-visual affinities with each other, and temporal context to\naggregate long-term information and smooth out local uncertainties. Based on\nsuch information, our model optimizes all candidates in a unified process for\nrobust and reliable ASD. A thorough ablation study is performed on several\nchallenging ASD benchmarks under different settings. In particular, our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin of about 15% mean Average\nPrecision (mAP) absolute on two challenging subsets: one with three candidate\nspeakers, and the other with faces smaller than 64 pixels.

          "description": "Single online handwritten Chinese character recognition~(single OLHCCR) has\nachieved prominent performance. However, in real application scenarios, users\nalways write multiple Chinese characters to form one complete sentence and the\ncontextual information within these characters holds the significant potential\nto improve the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of sentence-level OLHCCR. In\nthis work, we first propose a simple and straightforward end-to-end network,\nnamely vanilla compositional network~(VCN) to tackle the sentence-level OLHCCR.\nIt couples convolutional neural network with sequence modeling architecture to\nexploit the handwritten character's previous contextual information. Although\nVCN performs much better than the state-of-the-art single OLHCCR model, it\nexposes high fragility when confronting with not well written characters such\nas sloppy writing, missing or broken strokes. To improve the robustness of\nsentence-level OLHCCR, we further propose a novel deep spatial-temporal fusion\nnetwork~(DSTFN). It utilizes a pre-trained autoregresssive framework as the\nbackbone component, which projects each Chinese character into word embeddings,\nand integrates the spatial glyph features of handwritten characters and their\ncontextual information multiple times at multi-layer fusion module. We also\nconstruct a large-scale sentence-level handwriting dataset, named as CSOHD to\nevaluate models. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that DSTFN achieves\nthe state-of-the-art performance, which presents strong robustness compared\nwith VCN and exiting single OLHCCR models. The in-depth empirical analysis and\ncase studies indicate that DSTFN can significantly improve the efficiency of\nhandwriting input, with the handwritten Chinese character with incomplete\nstrokes being recognized precisely.",

          "description": "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent networks are frequently used for\ntasks involving time sequential data such as speech recognition. However, it is\ndifficult to deploy these networks on hardware to achieve high throughput and\nlow latency because the fully-connected structure makes LSTM networks a\nmemory-bounded algorithm. Previous work in LSTM accelerators either exploited\nweight spatial sparsity or temporal sparsity. In this paper, we present a new\naccelerator called \"Spartus\" that exploits spatio-temporal sparsity to achieve\nultra-low latency inference. The spatial sparsity was induced using our\nproposed pruning method called Column-Balanced Targeted Dropout (CBTD) that\nleads to structured sparse weight matrices benefiting workload balance. It\nachieved up to 96% weight sparsity with negligible accuracy difference for an\nLSTM network trained on a TIMIT phone recognition task. To induce temporal\nsparsity in LSTM, we create the DeltaLSTM by extending the previous DeltaGRU\nmethod to the LSTM network. This combined sparsity saves on weight memory\naccess and associated arithmetic operations simultaneously. Spartus was\nimplemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7100 FPGA. The per-sample latency for a single\nDeltaLSTM layer of 1024 neurons running on Spartus is 1 us. Spartus achieved\n9.4 TOp/s effective batch-1 throughput and 1.1 TOp/J energy efficiency, which\nare respectively 4X and 7X higher than the previous state-of-the-art.",

          "description": "The advancements in deep learning technologies have produced immense\ncontribution to biomedical image analysis applications. With breast cancer\nbeing the common deadliest disease among women, early detection is the key\nmeans to improve survivability. Medical imaging like ultrasound presents an\nexcellent visual representation of the functioning of the organs; however, for\nany radiologist analysing such scans is challenging and time consuming which\ndelays the diagnosis process. Although various deep learning based approaches\nare proposed that achieved promising results, the present article introduces an\nefficient residual cross-spatial attention guided inception U-Net (RCA-IUnet)\nmodel with minimal training parameters for tumor segmentation using breast\nultrasound imaging to further improve the segmentation performance of varying\ntumor sizes. The RCA-IUnet model follows U-Net topology with residual inception\ndepth-wise separable convolution and hybrid pooling (max pooling and spectral\npooling) layers. In addition, cross-spatial attention filters are added to\nsuppress the irrelevant features and focus on the target structure. The\nsegmentation performance of the proposed model is validated on two publicly\navailable datasets using standard segmentation evaluation metrics, where it\noutperformed the other state-of-the-art segmentation models.",

          "description": "Online hashing methods usually learn the hash functions online, aiming to\nefficiently adapt to the data variations in the streaming environment. However,\nwhen the hash functions are updated, the binary codes for the whole database\nhave to be updated to be consistent with the hash functions, resulting in the\ninefficiency in the online image retrieval process. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel online hashing framework without updating binary codes. In the proposed\nframework, the hash functions are fixed and a parametric similarity function\nfor the binary codes is learnt online to adapt to the streaming data.\nSpecifically, a parametric similarity function that has a bilinear form is\nadopted and a metric learning algorithm is proposed to learn the similarity\nfunction online based on the characteristics of the hashing methods. The\nexperiments on two multi-label image datasets show that our method is\ncompetitive or outperforms the state-of-the-art online hashing methods in terms\nof both accuracy and efficiency for multi-label image retrieval.",

          "description": "The intellectual property (IP) of Deep neural networks (DNNs) can be easily\n``stolen'' by surrogate model attack. There has been significant progress in\nsolutions to protect the IP of DNN models in classification tasks. However,\nlittle attention has been devoted to the protection of DNNs in image processing\ntasks. By utilizing consistent invisible spatial watermarks, one recent work\nfirst considered model watermarking for deep image processing networks and\ndemonstrated its efficacy in many downstream tasks. Nevertheless, it highly\ndepends on the hypothesis that the embedded watermarks in the network outputs\nare consistent. When the attacker uses some common data augmentation attacks\n(e.g., rotate, crop, and resize) during surrogate model training, it will\ntotally fail because the underlying watermark consistency is destroyed. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose a new watermarking methodology, namely\n``structure consistency'', based on which a new deep structure-aligned model\nwatermarking algorithm is designed. Specifically, the embedded watermarks are\ndesigned to be aligned with physically consistent image structures, such as\nedges or semantic regions. Experiments demonstrate that our method is much more\nrobust than the baseline method in resisting data augmentation attacks for\nmodel IP protection. Besides that, we further test the generalization ability\nand robustness of our method to a broader range of circumvention attacks.",

          "description": "Recent research shows deep neural networks are vulnerable to different types\nof attacks, such as adversarial attack, data poisoning attack and backdoor\nattack. Among them, backdoor attack is the most cunning one and can occur in\nalmost every stage of deep learning pipeline. Therefore, backdoor attack has\nattracted lots of interests from both academia and industry. However, most\nexisting backdoor attack methods are either visible or fragile to some\neffortless pre-processing such as common data transformations. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a robust and invisible backdoor attack called ``Poison\nInk''. Concretely, we first leverage the image structures as target poisoning\nareas, and fill them with poison ink (information) to generate the trigger\npattern. As the image structure can keep its semantic meaning during the data\ntransformation, such trigger pattern is inherently robust to data\ntransformations. Then we leverage a deep injection network to embed such\ntrigger pattern into the cover image to achieve stealthiness. Compared to\nexisting popular backdoor attack methods, Poison Ink outperforms both in\nstealthiness and robustness. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate\nPoison Ink is not only general to different datasets and network architectures,\nbut also flexible for different attack scenarios. Besides, it also has very\nstrong resistance against many state-of-the-art defense techniques.",

          "description": "Video captioning combines video understanding and language generation.\nDifferent from image captioning that describes a static image with details of\nalmost every object, video captioning usually considers a sequence of frames\nand biases towards focused objects, e.g., the objects that stay in focus\nregardless of the changing background. Therefore, detecting and properly\naccommodating focused objects is critical in video captioning. To enforce the\ndescription of focused objects and achieve controllable video captioning, we\npropose an Object-Oriented Non-Autoregressive approach (O2NA), which performs\ncaption generation in three steps: 1) identify the focused objects and predict\ntheir locations in the target caption; 2) generate the related attribute words\nand relation words of these focused objects to form a draft caption; and 3)\ncombine video information to refine the draft caption to a fluent final\ncaption. Since the focused objects are generated and located ahead of other\nwords, it is difficult to apply the word-by-word autoregressive generation\nprocess; instead, we adopt a non-autoregressive approach. The experiments on\ntwo benchmark datasets, i.e., MSR-VTT and MSVD, demonstrate the effectiveness\nof O2NA, which achieves results competitive with the state-of-the-arts but with\nboth higher diversity and higher inference speed.",

          "description": "Recently, much progress has been made in unsupervised restoration learning.\nHowever, existing methods more or less rely on some assumptions on the signal\nand/or degradation model, which limits their practical performance. How to\nconstruct an optimal criterion for unsupervised restoration learning without\nany prior knowledge on the degradation model is still an open question. Toward\nanswering this question, this work proposes a criterion for unsupervised\nrestoration learning based on the optimal transport theory. This criterion has\nfavorable properties, e.g., approximately maximal preservation of the\ninformation of the signal, whilst achieving perceptual reconstruction.\nFurthermore, though a relaxed unconstrained formulation is used in practical\nimplementation, we show that the relaxed formulation in theory has the same\nsolution as the original constrained formulation. Experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world data, including realistic photographic, microscopy, depth, and raw\ndepth images, demonstrate that the proposed method even compares favorably with\nsupervised methods, e.g., approaching the PSNR of supervised methods while\nhaving better perceptual quality. Particularly, for spatially correlated noise\nand realistic microscopy images, the proposed method not only achieves better\nperceptual quality but also has higher PSNR than supervised methods. Besides,\nit shows remarkable superiority in harsh practical conditions with complex\nnoise, e.g., raw depth images.",

          "description": "In this work, we aim to address the challenging task of open set recognition\n(OSR). Many recent OSR methods rely on auto-encoders to extract class-specific\nfeatures by a reconstruction strategy, requiring the network to restore the\ninput image on pixel-level. This strategy is commonly over-demanding for OSR\nsince class-specific features are generally contained in target objects, not in\nall pixels. To address this shortcoming, here we discard the pixel-level\nreconstruction strategy and pay more attention to improving the effectiveness\nof class-specific feature extraction. We propose a mutual information-based\nmethod with a streamlined architecture, Maximal Mutual Information Open Set\nRecognition (M2IOSR). The proposed M2IOSR only uses an encoder to extract\nclass-specific features by maximizing the mutual information between the given\ninput and its latent features across multiple scales. Meanwhile, to further\nreduce the open space risk, latent features are constrained to class\nconditional Gaussian distributions by a KL-divergence loss function. In this\nway, a strong function is learned to prevent the network from mapping different\nobservations to similar latent features and help the network extract\nclass-specific features with desired statistical characteristics. The proposed\nmethod significantly improves the performance of baselines and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results on several benchmarks consistently.

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification (UDA re-ID) aims at\ntransferring the labeled source domain's knowledge to improve the model's\ndiscriminability on the unlabeled target domain. From a novel perspective, we\nargue that the bridging between the source and target domains can be utilized\nto tackle the UDA re-ID task, and we focus on explicitly modeling appropriate\nintermediate domains to characterize this bridging. Specifically, we propose an\nIntermediate Domain Module (IDM) to generate intermediate domains'\nrepresentations on-the-fly by mixing the source and target domains' hidden\nrepresentations using two domain factors. Based on the \"shortest geodesic path\"\ndefinition, i.e., the intermediate domains along the shortest geodesic path\nbetween the two extreme domains can play a better bridging role, we propose two\nproperties that these intermediate domains should satisfy. To ensure these two\nproperties to better characterize appropriate intermediate domains, we enforce\nthe bridge losses on intermediate domains' prediction space and feature space,\nand enforce a diversity loss on the two domain factors. The bridge losses aim\nat guiding the distribution of appropriate intermediate domains to keep the\nright distance to the source and target domains. The diversity loss serves as a\nregularization to prevent the generated intermediate domains from being\nover-fitting to either of the source and target domains. Our proposed method\noutperforms the state-of-the-arts by a large margin in all the common UDA re-ID\ntasks, and the mAP gain is up to 7.7% on the challenging MSMT17 benchmark.

We study a new challenging assembly task, designing and\nconstructing a bridge without a blueprint. In this task, the robot needs to\nfirst design a feasible bridge architecture for arbitrarily wide cliffs and\nthen manipulate the blocks reliably to construct a stable bridge according to\nthe proposed design. In this paper, we propose a bi-level approach to tackle\nthis task. At the high level, the system learns a bridge blueprint policy in a\nphysical simulator using deep reinforcement learning and curriculum learning. A\npolicy is represented as an attention-based neural network with object-centric\ninput, which enables generalization to different numbers of blocks and cliff\nwidths. For low-level control, we implement a motion-planning-based policy for\nreal-robot motion control, which can be directly combined with a trained\nblueprint policy for real-world bridge construction without tuning. In our\nfield study, our bi-level robot system demonstrates the capability of\nmanipulating blocks to construct a diverse set of bridges with different\narchitectures.",

          "description": "Video abnormal event detection (VAD) is a vital semi-supervised task that\nrequires learning with only roughly labeled normal videos, as anomalies are\noften practically unavailable. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) enable\ngreat progress in VAD, existing solutions typically suffer from two issues: (1)\nThe precise and comprehensive localization of video events is ignored. (2) The\nvideo semantics and temporal context are under-explored. To address those\nissues, we are motivated by the prevalent cloze test in education and propose a\nnovel approach named visual cloze completion (VCC), which performs VAD by\nlearning to complete \"visual cloze tests\" (VCTs). Specifically, VCC first\nlocalizes each video event and encloses it into a spatio-temporal cube (STC).\nTo achieve both precise and comprehensive localization, appearance and motion\nare used as mutually complementary cues to mark the object region associated\nwith each video event. For each marked region, a normalized patch sequence is\nextracted from temporally adjacent frames and stacked into the STC. By\ncomparing each patch and the patch sequence of a STC to a visual \"word\" and\n\"sentence\" respectively, we can deliberately erase a certain \"word\" (patch) to\nyield a VCT. DNNs are then trained to infer the erased patch by video\nsemantics, so as to complete the VCT. To fully exploit the temporal context,\neach patch in STC is alternatively erased to create multiple VCTs, and the\nerased patch's optical flow is also inferred to integrate richer motion clues.\nMeanwhile, a new DNN architecture is designed as a model-level solution to\nutilize video semantics and temporal context. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat VCC achieves state-of-the-art VAD performance. Our codes and results are\nopen at \\url{https://github.com/yuguangnudt/VEC_VAD/tree/VCC}",

          "description": "The recently proposed Detection Transformer (DETR) model successfully applies\nTransformer to objects detection and achieves comparable performance with\ntwo-stage object detection frameworks, such as Faster-RCNN. However, DETR\nsuffers from its slow convergence. Training DETR from scratch needs 500 epochs\nto achieve a high accuracy. To accelerate its convergence, we propose a simple\nyet effective scheme for improving the DETR framework, namely Spatially\nModulated Co-Attention (SMCA) mechanism. The core idea of SMCA is to conduct\nlocation-aware co-attention in DETR by constraining co-attention responses to\nbe high near initially estimated bounding box locations. Our proposed SMCA\nincreases DETR's convergence speed by replacing the original co-attention\nmechanism in the decoder while keeping other operations in DETR unchanged.\nFurthermore, by integrating multi-head and scale-selection attention designs\ninto SMCA, our fully-fledged SMCA can achieve better performance compared to\nDETR with a dilated convolution-based backbone (45.6 mAP at 108 epochs vs. 43.3\nmAP at 500 epochs). We perform extensive ablation studies on COCO dataset to\nvalidate SMCA. Code is released at https://github.com/gaopengcuhk/SMCA-DETR .",

          "description": "For deep learning methods of image super-resolution, the most critical issue\nis whether the paired low and high resolution images for training accurately\nreflect the sampling process of real cameras. Low and high resolution\n(LR$\\sim$HR) image pairs synthesized by existing degradation models (\\eg,\nbicubic downsampling) deviate from those in reality; thus the super-resolution\nCNN trained by these synthesized LR$\\sim$HR image pairs does not perform well\nwhen being applied to real images. In this paper, we propose a novel method to\ncapture a large set of realistic LR$\\sim$HR image pairs using real cameras.The\ndata acquisition is carried out under controllable lab conditions with minimum\nhuman intervention and at high throughput (about 500 image pairs per hour). The\nhigh level of automation makes it easy to produce a set of real LR$\\sim$HR\ntraining image pairs for each camera. Our innovation is to shoot images\ndisplayed on an ultra-high quality screen at different resolutions.There are\nthree distinctive advantages with our method that allow us to collect\nhigh-quality training datasets for image super-resolution. First, as the LR and\nHR images are taken of a 3D planar surface (the screen) the registration\nproblem fits exactly to a homography model. Second, we can display special\nmarkers on the image margin to further improve the registration\nprecision.Third, the displayed digital image file can be exploited as a\nreference to optimize the high frequency content of the restored image.\nExperimental results show that training a super-resolution CNN by our\nLR$\\sim$HR dataset has superior restoration performance than training it by\nexisting datasets on real world images at the inference stage.",

However, most prognostic models are either based on\nhistology or genomics alone and do not address how histology and genomics can\nbe integrated to develop joint image-omic prognostic models. Additionally\nidentifying explainable morphological and molecular descriptors from these\nmodels that govern such prognosis is of interest. We used multimodal deep\nlearning to integrate gigapixel whole slide pathology images, RNA-seq\nabundance, copy number variation, and mutation data from 5,720 patients across\n14 major cancer types. Our interpretable, weakly-supervised, multimodal deep\nlearning algorithm is able to fuse these heterogeneous modalities for\npredicting outcomes and discover prognostic features from these modalities that\ncorroborate with poor and favorable outcomes via multimodal interpretability.\nWe compared our model with unimodal deep learning models trained on histology\nslides and molecular profiles alone, and demonstrate performance increase in\nrisk stratification on 9 out of 14 cancers. In addition, we analyze morphologic\nand molecular markers responsible for prognostic predictions across all cancer\ntypes. All analyzed data, including morphological and molecular correlates of\npatient prognosis across the 14 cancer types at a disease and patient level are\npresented in an interactive open-access database\n(this http URL) to allow for further exploration and\nprognostic biomarker discovery.

          "description": "The current state-of-the-art image-sentence retrieval methods implicitly\nalign the visual-textual fragments, like regions in images and words in\nsentences, and adopt attention modules to highlight the relevance of\ncross-modal semantic correspondences. However, the retrieval performance\nremains unsatisfactory due to a lack of consistent representation in both\nsemantics and structural spaces. In this work, we propose to address the above\nissue from two aspects: (i) constructing intrinsic structure (along with\nrelations) among the fragments of respective modalities, e.g., \"dog $\\to$ play\n$\\to$ ball\" in semantic structure for an image, and (ii) seeking explicit\ninter-modal structural and semantic correspondence between the visual and\ntextual modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel Structured Multi-modal\nFeature Embedding and Alignment (SMFEA) model for image-sentence retrieval. In\norder to jointly and explicitly learn the visual-textual embedding and the\ncross-modal alignment, SMFEA creates a novel multi-modal structured module with\na shared context-aware referral tree. In particular, the relations of the\nvisual and textual fragments are modeled by constructing Visual Context-aware\nStructured Tree encoder (VCS-Tree) and Textual Context-aware Structured Tree\nencoder (TCS-Tree) with shared labels, from which visual and textual features\ncan be jointly learned and optimized. We utilize the multi-modal tree structure\nto explicitly align the heterogeneous image-sentence data by maximizing the\nsemantic and structural similarity between corresponding inter-modal tree\nnodes. Extensive experiments on Microsoft COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in comparison to the\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Expensive bounding-box annotations have limited the development of object\ndetection task. Thus, it is necessary to focus on more challenging task of\nfew-shot object detection. It requires the detector to recognize objects of\nnovel classes with only a few training samples. Nowadays, many existing popular\nmethods based on meta-learning have achieved promising performance, such as\nMeta R-CNN series. However, only a single category of support data is used as\nthe attention to guide the detecting of query images each time. Their relevance\nto each other remains unexploited. Moreover, a lot of recent works treat the\nsupport data and query images as independent branch without considering the\nrelationship between them. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic\nrelevance learning model, which utilizes the relationship between all support\nimages and Region of Interest (RoI) on the query images to construct a dynamic\ngraph convolutional network (GCN). By adjusting the prediction distribution of\nthe base detector using the output of this GCN, the proposed model can guide\nthe detector to improve the class representation implicitly. Comprehensive\nexperiments have been conducted on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO dataset. The proposed\nmodel achieves the best overall performance, which shows its effectiveness of\nlearning more generalized features.

          "description": "Recently proposed fine-grained 3D visual grounding is an essential and\nchallenging task, whose goal is to identify the 3D object referred by a natural\nlanguage sentence from other distractive objects of the same category. Existing\nworks usually adopt dynamic graph networks to indirectly model the\nintra/inter-modal interactions, making the model difficult to distinguish the\nreferred object from distractors due to the monolithic representations of\nvisual and linguistic contents. In this work, we exploit Transformer for its\nnatural suitability on permutation-invariant 3D point clouds data and propose a\nTransRefer3D network to extract entity-and-relation aware multimodal context\namong objects for more discriminative feature learning. Concretely, we devise\nan Entity-aware Attention (EA) module and a Relation-aware Attention (RA)\nmodule to conduct fine-grained cross-modal feature matching. Facilitated by\nco-attention operation, our EA module matches visual entity features with\nlinguistic entity features while RA module matches pair-wise visual relation\nfeatures with linguistic relation features, respectively. We further integrate\nEA and RA modules into an Entity-and-Relation aware Contextual Block (ERCB) and\nstack several ERCBs to form our TransRefer3D for hierarchical multimodal\ncontext modeling. Extensive experiments on both Nr3D and Sr3D datasets\ndemonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing\napproaches by up to 10.6% and claims the new state-of-the-art.

          "description": "The task of video-based commonsense captioning aims to generate event-wise\ncaptions and meanwhile provide multiple commonsense descriptions (e.g.,\nattribute, effect and intention) about the underlying event in the video. Prior\nworks explore the commonsense captions by using separate networks for different\ncommonsense types, which is time-consuming and lacks mining the interaction of\ndifferent commonsense. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Reasoning Network\n(HybridNet) to endow the neural networks with the capability of semantic-level\nreasoning and word-level reasoning. Firstly, we develop multi-commonsense\nlearning for semantic-level reasoning by jointly training different commonsense\ntypes in a unified network, which encourages the interaction between the clues\nof multiple commonsense descriptions, event-wise captions and videos. Then,\nthere are two steps to achieve the word-level reasoning: (1) a memory module\nrecords the history predicted sequence from the previous generation processes;\n(2) a memory-routed multi-head attention (MMHA) module updates the word-level\nattention maps by incorporating the history information from the memory module\ninto the transformer decoder for word-level reasoning. Moreover, the multimodal\nfeatures are used to make full use of diverse knowledge for commonsense\nreasoning.

          "description": "Semantic segmentation is a crucial image understanding task, where each pixel\nof image is categorized into a corresponding label. Since the pixel-wise\nlabeling for ground-truth is tedious and labor intensive, in practical\napplications, many works exploit the synthetic images to train the model for\nreal-word image semantic segmentation, i.e., Synthetic-to-Real Semantic\nSegmentation (SRSS). However, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained\non the source synthetic data may not generalize well to the target real-world\ndata. In this work, we propose two simple yet effective texture randomization\nmechanisms, Global Texture Randomization (GTR) and Local Texture Randomization\n(LTR), for Domain Generalization based SRSS. GTR is proposed to randomize the\ntexture of source images into diverse unreal texture styles. It aims to\nalleviate the reliance of the network on texture while promoting the learning\nof the domain-invariant cues. In addition, we find the texture difference is\nnot always occurred in entire image and may only appear in some local areas.\nTherefore, we further propose a LTR mechanism to generate diverse local regions\nfor partially stylizing the source images. Finally, we implement a\nregularization of Consistency between GTR and LTR (CGL) aiming to harmonize the\ntwo proposed mechanisms during training. Extensive experiments on five publicly\navailable datasets (i.e., GTA5, SYNTHIA, Cityscapes, BDDS and Mapillary) with\nvarious SRSS settings (i.e., GTA5/SYNTHIA to Cityscapes/BDDS/Mapillary)\ndemonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art\nmethods for domain generalization based SRSS.",

          "description": "One-stage long-tailed recognition methods improve the overall performance in\na \"seesaw\" manner, i.e., either sacrifice the head's accuracy for better tail\nclassification or elevate the head's accuracy even higher but ignore the tail.\nExisting algorithms bypass such trade-off by a multi-stage training process:\npre-training on imbalanced set and fine-tuning on balanced set. Though\nachieving promising performance, not only are they sensitive to the\ngeneralizability of the pre-trained model, but also not easily integrated into\nother computer vision tasks like detection and segmentation, where pre-training\nof classifiers solely is not applicable.

          "description": "Fourier single-pixel imaging (FSI) is a branch of single-pixel imaging\ntechniques. It uses Fourier basis patterns as structured patterns for spatial\ninformation acquisition in the Fourier domain. However, the spatial resolution\nof the image reconstructed by FSI mainly depends on the number of Fourier\ncoefficients sampled. The reconstruction of a high-resolution image typically\nrequires a number of Fourier coefficients to be sampled, and therefore takes a\nlong data acquisition time. Here we propose a new sampling strategy for FSI. It\nallows FSI to reconstruct a clear and sharp image with a reduced number of\nmeasurements. The core of the proposed sampling strategy is to perform a\nvariable density sampling in the Fourier space and, more importantly, the\ndensity with respect to the importance of Fourier coefficients is subject to a\none-dimensional Gaussian function. Combined with compressive sensing, the\nproposed sampling strategy enables better reconstruction quality than\nconventional sampling strategies, especially when the sampling ratio is low. We\nexperimentally demonstrate compressive FSI combined with the proposed sampling\nstrategy is able to reconstruct a sharp and clear image of 256-by-256 pixels\nwith a sampling ratio of 10%.

          "description": "Image-based navigation is widely considered the next frontier of minimally\ninvasive surgery. It is believed that image-based navigation will increase the\naccess to reproducible, safe, and high-precision surgery as it may then be\nperformed at acceptable costs and effort. This is because image-based\ntechniques avoid the need of specialized equipment and seamlessly integrate\nwith contemporary workflows. Further, it is expected that image-based\nnavigation will play a major role in enabling mixed reality environments and\nautonomous, robotic workflows. A critical component of image guidance is 2D/3D\nregistration, a technique to estimate the spatial relationships between 3D\nstructures, e.g., volumetric imagery or tool models, and 2D images thereof,\nsuch as fluoroscopy or endoscopy. While image-based 2D/3D registration is a\nmature technique, its transition from the bench to the bedside has been\nrestrained by well-known challenges, including brittleness of the optimization\nobjective, hyperparameter selection, and initialization, difficulties around\ninconsistencies or multiple objects, and limited single-view performance. One\nreason these challenges persist today is that analytical solutions are likely\ninadequate considering the complexity, variability, and high-dimensionality of\ngeneric 2D/3D registration problems. The recent advent of machine\nlearning-based approaches to imaging problems that, rather than specifying the\ndesired functional mapping, approximate it using highly expressive parametric\nmodels holds promise for solving some of the notorious challenges in 2D/3D\nregistration. In this manuscript, we review the impact of machine learning on\n2D/3D registration to systematically summarize the recent advances made by\nintroduction of this novel technology. Grounded in these insights, we then\noffer our perspective on the most pressing needs, significant open problems,\nand possible next steps.",

The HR-Kidney dataset presented in this work\nbridges this gap by providing 1.7 TB of artefact-corrected synchrotron\nradiation-based X-ray phase-contrast microtomography images of whole mouse\nkidneys and validated segmentations of 33 729 glomeruli, which represents a 1-2\norders of magnitude increase over currently available biomedical datasets. The\ndataset further contains the underlying raw data, classical segmentations of\nrenal vasculature and uriniferous tubules, as well as true 3D manual\nannotations.

So far, these approaches have focused\non extracting information associated with annotations.

We show that these\nrepresentations are able to identify a variety of morphological characteristics\nacross three cancer types: Breast, colon, and lung. This is supported by 1) the\nseparation of morphologic characteristics in the latent space; 2) the ability\nto classify tissue type with logistic regression using latent representations,\nwith an AUC of 0.97 and 85% accuracy, comparable to supervised deep models; 3)\nthe ability to predict the presence of tumor in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using\nmultiple instance learning (MIL), achieving an AUC of 0.98 and 94% accuracy.\n\nOur results show that our model captures distinct phenotypic characteristics\nof real tissue samples, paving the way for further understanding of tumor\nprogression and tumor micro-environment, and ultimately refining\nhistopathological classification for diagnosis and treatment.

          "description": "Human vision is often adversely affected by complex environmental factors,\nespecially in night vision scenarios. Thus, infrared cameras are often\nleveraged to help enhance the visual effects via detecting infrared radiation\nin the surrounding environment, but the infrared videos are undesirable due to\nthe lack of detailed semantic information. In such a case, an effective\nvideo-to-video translation method from the infrared domain to the visible light\ncounterpart is strongly needed by overcoming the intrinsic huge gap between\ninfrared and visible fields. To address this challenging problem, we propose an\ninfrared-to-visible (I2V) video translation method I2V-GAN to generate\nfine-grained and spatial-temporal consistent visible light videos by given\nunpaired infrared videos. Technically, our model capitalizes on three types of\nconstraints: 1)adversarial constraint to generate synthetic frames that are\nsimilar to the real ones, 2)cyclic consistency with the introduced perceptual\nloss for effective content conversion as well as style preservation, and\n3)similarity constraints across and within domains to enhance the content and\nmotion consistency in both spatial and temporal spaces at a fine-grained level.\nFurthermore, the current public available infrared and visible light datasets\nare mainly used for object detection or tracking, and some are composed of\ndiscontinuous images which are not suitable for video tasks. Thus, we provide a\nnew dataset for I2V video translation, which is named IRVI. Specifically, it\nhas 12 consecutive video clips of vehicle and monitoring scenes, and both\ninfrared and visible light videos could be apart into 24352 frames.\nComprehensive experiments validate that I2V-GAN is superior to the compared\nSOTA methods in the translation of I2V videos with higher fluency and finer\nsemantic details. The code and IRVI dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/BIT-DA/I2V-GAN.",

          "description": "Graph convolutional networks have significantly improved 3D human pose\nestimation by representing the human skeleton as an undirected graph. However,\nthis representation fails to reflect the articulated characteristic of human\nskeletons as the hierarchical orders among the joints are not explicitly\npresented. In this paper, we propose to represent the human skeleton as a\ndirected graph with the joints as nodes and bones as edges that are directed\nfrom parent joints to child joints. By so doing, the directions of edges can\nexplicitly reflect the hierarchical relationships among the nodes. Based on\nthis representation, we further propose a spatial-temporal conditional directed\ngraph convolution to leverage varying non-local dependence for different poses\nby conditioning the graph topology on input poses. Altogether, we form a\nU-shaped network, named U-shaped Conditional Directed Graph Convolutional\nNetwork, for 3D human pose estimation from monocular videos. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive experiments on two\nchallenging large-scale benchmarks: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Both\nquantitative and qualitative results show that our method achieves top\nperformance. Also, ablation studies show that directed graphs can better\nexploit the hierarchy of articulated human skeletons than undirected graphs,\nand the conditional connections can yield adaptive graph topologies for\ndifferent poses.",

In this paper, we first\nintroduce the truncated Huber penalty function which shows strong flexibility\nunder different parameter settings. A generalized framework is then proposed\nwith the introduced truncated Huber penalty function. When combined with its\nstrong flexibility, our framework is able to achieve diverse smoothing natures\nwhere contradictive smoothing behaviors can even be achieved. It can also yield\nthe smoothing behavior that can seldom be achieved by previous methods, and\nsuperior performance is thus achieved in challenging cases.

Since detailed semantic information is\nnot captured by clicks, directly training with click labels leads to poor\nsegmentation predictions. To mitigate this problem, we design a novel memory\nflow knowledge distillation strategy to exploit temporal information (named\nmemory flow) in abundant unlabeled video frames, by distilling the neighboring\npredictions to the target frame via estimated motion. Moreover, we adopt\nvanilla knowledge distillation for model compression. In this case, WeClick\nlearns compact video semantic segmentation models with the low-cost click\nannotations during the training phase yet achieves real-time and accurate\nmodels during the inference period.

The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)\nmetric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a\nsingle human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:\nthe ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence\n(e.g., `yeah' and `yes'). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative\ngain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct\nanswers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually\napplicable uncertain answers such as `I don't know. Crafting a model that\nexcels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should\nanswer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To\naddress this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that\ncan merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep\nmost MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG\nstate-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%). Moreover, our approach won\nthe recent Visual Dialog 2020 challenge. Source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/idansc/mrr-ndcg.",

          "description": "In this paper, we present an efficient and robust deep learning solution for\nnovel view synthesis of complex scenes. In our approach, a 3D scene is\nrepresented as a light field, i.e., a set of rays, each of which has a\ncorresponding color when reaching the image plane. For efficient novel view\nrendering, we adopt a 4D parameterization of the light field, where each ray is\ncharacterized by a 4D parameter. We then formulate the light field as a 4D\nfunction that maps 4D coordinates to corresponding color values. We train a\ndeep fully connected network to optimize this implicit function and memorize\nthe 3D scene. Then, the scene-specific model is used to synthesize novel views.\nDifferent from previous light field approaches which require dense view\nsampling to reliably render novel views, our method can render novel views by\nsampling rays and querying the color for each ray from the network directly,\nthus enabling high-quality light field rendering with a sparser set of training\nimages. Our method achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis results while\nmaintaining an interactive frame rate.",

          "description": "Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a challenging problem when\ngiven image category labels but requires to learn object localization models.\nOptimizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification tends to\nactivate local discriminative regions while ignoring complete object extent,\ncausing the partial activation issue. In this paper, we argue that partial\nactivation is caused by the intrinsic characteristics of CNN, where the\nconvolution operations produce local receptive fields and experience difficulty\nto capture long-range feature dependency among pixels. We introduce the token\nsemantic coupled attention map (TS-CAM) to take full advantage of the\nself-attention mechanism in visual transformer for long-range dependency\nextraction. TS-CAM first splits an image into a sequence of patch tokens for\nspatial embedding, which produce attention maps of long-range visual dependency\nto avoid partial activation. TS-CAM then re-allocates category-related\nsemantics for patch tokens, enabling each of them to be aware of object\ncategories. TS-CAM finally couples the patch tokens with the semantic-agnostic\nattention map to achieve semantic-aware localization. Experiments on the\nILSVRC/CUB-200-2011 datasets show that TS-CAM outperforms its CNN-CAM\ncounterparts by 7.1%/27.1% for WSOL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

          "description": "Neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in classification\nand regression tasks on chest X-rays. In order to establish trust in the\nclinical routine, the networks' prediction mechanism needs to be interpretable.\nOne principal approach to interpretation is feature attribution. Feature\nattribution methods identify the importance of input features for the output\nprediction. Building on Information Bottleneck Attribution (IBA) method, for\neach prediction we identify the chest X-ray regions that have high mutual\ninformation with the network's output. Original IBA identifies input regions\nthat have sufficient predictive information. We propose Inverse IBA to identify\nall informative regions. Thus all predictive cues for pathologies are\nhighlighted on the X-rays, a desirable property for chest X-ray diagnosis.\nMoreover, we propose Regression IBA for explaining regression models. Using\nRegression IBA we observe that a model trained on cumulative severity score\nlabels implicitly learns the severity of different X-ray regions. Finally, we\npropose Multi-layer IBA to generate higher resolution and more detailed\nattribution/saliency maps. We evaluate our methods using both human-centric\n(ground-truth-based) interpretability metrics, and human-independent feature\nimportance metrics on NIH Chest X-ray8 and BrixIA datasets.

          "description": "Contrastive learning is effective at learning useful representations without\nsupervision. Yet contrastive learning is susceptible to shortcuts -- i.e., it\nmay learn shortcut features irrelevant to the downstream task and discard\nrelevant information. Past work has addressed this limitation via handcrafted\ndata augmentations that eliminate the shortcut. However, handcrafted\naugmentations are infeasible for data modalities that are not interpretable by\nhumans (e.g., radio signals). Further, even when the modality is interpretable\n(e.g., RGB), sometimes eliminating the shortcut information may be undesirable.\nFor example, in multi-attribute classification, information related to one\nattribute may act as a shortcut around other attributes. This paper presents\nreconstructive contrastive learning (RCL), a framework for learning\nunsupervised representations that are robust to shortcuts. The key idea is to\nforce the learned representation to reconstruct the input, which naturally\ncounters potential shortcuts. Extensive experiments verify that RCL is highly\nrobust to shortcuts and outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive learning\nmethods on both RGB and RF datasets for a variety of tasks.",

          "description": "Due to the domain discrepancy in visual domain adaptation, the performance of\nsource model degrades when bumping into the high data density near decision\nboundary in target domain. A common solution is to minimize the Shannon Entropy\nto push the decision boundary away from the high density area. However, entropy\nminimization also leads to severe reduction of prediction diversity, and\nunfortunately brings harm to the domain adaptation. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the prediction discriminability and diversity by studying the\nstructure of the classification output matrix of a randomly selected data\nbatch. We find by theoretical analysis that the prediction discriminability and\ndiversity could be separately measured by the Frobenius-norm and rank of the\nbatch output matrix. The nuclear-norm is an upperbound of the former, and a\nconvex approximation of the latter. Accordingly, we propose Batch Nuclear-norm\nMaximization and Minimization, which performs nuclear-norm maximization on the\ntarget output matrix to enhance the target prediction ability, and nuclear-norm\nminimization on the source batch output matrix to increase applicability of the\nsource domain knowledge. We further approximate the nuclear-norm by\nL_{1,2}-norm, and design multi-batch optimization for stable solution on large\nnumber of categories. The fast approximation method achieves O(n^2)\ncomputational complexity and better convergence property.

          "description": "Recent progress on salient object detection (SOD) mainly benefits from\nmulti-scale learning, where the high-level and low-level features collaborate\nin locating salient objects and discovering fine details, respectively.\nHowever, most efforts are devoted to low-level feature learning by fusing\nmulti-scale features or enhancing boundary representations. High-level\nfeatures, which although have long proven effective for many other tasks, yet\nhave been barely studied for SOD. In this paper, we tap into this gap and show\nthat enhancing high-level features is essential for SOD as well. To this end,\nwe introduce an Extremely-Downsampled Network (EDN), which employs an extreme\ndownsampling technique to effectively learn a global view of the whole image,\nleading to accurate salient object localization. To accomplish better\nmulti-level feature fusion, we construct the Scale-Correlated Pyramid\nConvolution (SCPC) to build an elegant decoder for recovering object details\nfrom the above extreme downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDN\nachieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time speed. Our efficient\nEDN-Lite also achieves competitive performance with a speed of 316fps. Hence,\nthis work is expected to spark some new thinking in SOD. Full training and\ntesting code will be available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/EDN.",

Moreover,\nwe investigate the effect of pretraining and data imbalance on the\ninterpretability of learned features.

          "description": "Depleting lake ice can serve as an indicator for climate change, just like\nsea level rise or glacial retreat. Several Lake Ice Phenological (LIP) events\nserve as sentinels to understand the regional and global climate change. Hence,\nit is useful to monitor long-term lake freezing and thawing patterns. In this\npaper we report a case study for the Oberengadin region of Switzerland, where\nthere are several small- and medium-sized mountain lakes. We observe the LIP\nevents, such as freeze-up, break-up and ice cover duration, across two decades\n(2000-2020) from optical satellite images. We analyse time-series of MODIS\nimagery by estimating spatially resolved maps of lake ice for these Alpine\nlakes with supervised machine learning (and additionally cross-check with VIIRS\ndata when available). To train the classifier we rely on reference data\nannotated manually based on webcam images. From the ice maps we derive\nlong-term LIP trends. Since the webcam data is only available for two winters,\nwe also validate our results against the operational MODIS and VIIRS snow\nproducts. We find a change in complete freeze duration of -0.76 and -0.89 days\nper annum for lakes Sils and Silvaplana, respectively. Furthermore, we observe\nplausible correlations of the LIP trends with climate data measured at nearby\nmeteorological stations. We notice that mean winter air temperature has\nnegative correlation with the freeze duration and break-up events, and positive\ncorrelation with the freeze-up events. Additionally, we observe strong negative\ncorrelation of sunshine during the winter months with the freeze duration and\nbreak-up events.",

To\npursue a high attack transferability, one plausible way is to find a common\nproperty across detectors, which facilitates the discovery of common\nweaknesses. We are the first to suggest that the relevance map from\ninterpreters for detectors is such a property. Based on it, we design a\nRelevance Attack on Detectors (RAD), which achieves a state-of-the-art\ntransferability, exceeding existing results by above 20%. On MS COCO, the\ndetection mAPs for all 8 black-box architectures are more than halved and the\nsegmentation mAPs are also significantly influenced.

To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-level feature\noptimization framework to improve the generalization and temporal modeling\nability of learned video representations. Concretely, high-level features\nobtained from naive and prototypical contrastive learning are utilized to build\ndistribution graphs, guiding the process of low-level and mid-level feature\nlearning.

          "description": "Real world traffic sign recognition is an important step towards building\nautonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to\nadversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and\ngenerate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based\nattack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of\nthese algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)\niteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast\nmoving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally\nwithout considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,\nthis paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world\nroad sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)\nwe leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip\nthose zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural\nperturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a\nsingle perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance\nof the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function\nthat can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real\nworld data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the\nattack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a\nquarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also\nprovides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.\nWe provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility:\nhttps://github.com/AdvAttack/RoadSignAttack.",

In this work, we\npresent a strategy for learning a calibrated predictive distribution over\nsemantic maps, where the probability associated with each prediction reflects\nits ground truth correctness likelihood. To this end, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage, cascaded approach for calibrated adversarial refinement: (i) a\nstandard segmentation network is trained with categorical cross entropy to\npredict a pixelwise probability distribution over semantic classes and (ii) an\nadversarially trained stochastic network is used to model the inter-pixel\ncorrelations to refine the output of the first network into coherent samples.\nImportantly, to calibrate the refinement network and prevent mode collapse, the\nexpectation of the samples in the second stage is matched to the probabilities\npredicted in the first. We demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the\napproach by achieving state-of-the-art results on the multigrader LIDC dataset\nand on a modified Cityscapes dataset with injected ambiguities.

The proposed approach takes the source\nimage in the spatial domain, automatically selects the best frequencies from\nthe frequency domain, and transmits the inverse-transform image to the main\nneural network. Remarkably, such a simple add-on layer dramatically improves\nthe performance of the main network regardless of its design. We observe that\nthe light networks gain a noticeable boost in the performance metrics; whereas,\nthe training of the heavy ones converges faster when our adaptive layer is\nallowed to \"learn\" alongside the main architecture.

          "description": "Quantifying uncertainty in medical image segmentation applications is\nessential, as it is often connected to vital decision-making. Compelling\nattempts have been made in quantifying the uncertainty in image segmentation\narchitectures, e.g. to learn a density segmentation model conditioned on the\ninput image. Typical work in this field restricts these learnt densities to be\nstrictly Gaussian. In this paper, we propose to use a more flexible approach by\nintroducing Normalizing Flows (NFs), which enables the learnt densities to be\nmore complex and facilitate more accurate modeling for uncertainty. We prove\nthis hypothesis by adopting the Probabilistic U-Net and augmenting the\nposterior density with an NF, allowing it to be more expressive. Our\nqualitative as well as quantitative (GED and IoU) evaluations on the\nmulti-annotated and single-annotated LIDC-IDRI and Kvasir-SEG segmentation\ndatasets, respectively, show a clear improvement. This is mostly apparent in\nthe quantification of aleatoric uncertainty and the increased predictive\nperformance of up to 14 percent. This result strongly indicates that a more\nflexible density model should be seriously considered in architectures that\nattempt to capture segmentation ambiguity through density modeling. The benefit\nof this improved modeling will increase human confidence in annotation and\nsegmentation, and enable eager adoption of the technology in practice.",

In this setting, the attacker\nonly has query access to the model and only receives the top-1 class label\nwithout confidence information. Creating small physical stickers that are\nrobust to environmental variation is difficult in the discrete and\ndiscontinuous hard-label space because the attack must both design a small\nshape to perturb within and find robust noise to fill it with. Unfortunately,\nwe find that existing $\\ell_2$ or $\\ell_\\infty$ minimizing hard-label attacks\ndo not easily extend to finding such robust physical perturbation attacks.\nThus, we propose GRAPHITE, the first algorithm for hard-label physical attacks\non computer vision models. We show that \"survivability\", an estimate of\nphysical variation robustness, can be used in new ways to generate small masks\nand is a sufficiently smooth function to optimize with gradient-free\noptimization. We use GRAPHITE to attack a traffic sign classifier and a\npublicly-available Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) tool using only\nquery access. We evaluate both tools in real-world field tests to measure its\nphysical-world robustness. We successfully cause a Stop sign to be\nmisclassified as a Speed Limit 30 km/hr sign in 95.7% of physical images and\ncause errors in 75% of physical images for the ALPR tool.",

However,\nimbalanced class distributions still limit the wide applicability of these\nmodels due to degradation in performance. To solve this problem, in this paper,\nwe concentrate on the study of cross entropy which mostly ignores output scores\non incorrect classes. This work discovers that neutralizing predicted\nprobabilities on incorrect classes improves the prediction accuracy for\nimbalanced image classification. This paper proposes a simple but effective\nloss named complement cross entropy based on this finding. The proposed loss\nmakes the ground truth class overwhelm the other classes in terms of softmax\nprobability, by neutralizing probabilities of incorrect classes, without\nadditional training procedures. Along with it, this loss facilitates the models\nto learn key information especially from samples on minority classes.

          "description": "To remove the effects of adversarial perturbations, preprocessing defenses\nsuch as pixel discretization are appealing due to their simplicity but have so\nfar been shown to be ineffective except on simple datasets such as MNIST,\nleading to the belief that pixel discretization approaches are doomed to\nfailure as a defense technique. This paper revisits the pixel discretization\napproaches. We hypothesize that the reason why existing approaches have failed\nis that they have used a fixed codebook for the entire dataset. In particular,\nwe find that can lead to situations where images become more susceptible to\nadversarial perturbations and also suffer significant loss of accuracy after\ndiscretization. We propose a novel image preprocessing technique called\nEssential Features that uses an adaptive codebook that is based on per-image\ncontent and threat model. Essential Features adaptively selects a separable set\nof color clusters for each image to reduce the color space while preserving the\npertinent features of the original image, maximizing both separability and\nrepresentation of colors. Additionally, to limit the adversary's ability to\ninfluence the chosen color clusters, Essential Features takes advantage of\nspatial correlation with an adaptive blur that moves pixels closer to their\noriginal value without destroying original edge information. We design several\nadaptive attacks and find that our approach is more robust than previous\nbaselines on $L_\\infty$ and $L_2$ bounded attacks for several challenging\ndatasets including CIFAR-10, GTSRB, RESISC45, and ImageNet.",

          "description": "Enhancing the visibility in extreme low-light environments is a challenging\ntask. Under nearly lightless condition, existing image denoising methods could\neasily break down due to significantly low SNR. In this paper, we\nsystematically study the noise statistics in the imaging pipeline of CMOS\nphotosensors, and formulate a comprehensive noise model that can accurately\ncharacterize the real noise structures. Our novel model considers the noise\nsources caused by digital camera electronics which are largely overlooked by\nexisting methods yet have significant influence on raw measurement in the dark.\nIt provides a way to decouple the intricate noise structure into different\nstatistical distributions with physical interpretations. Moreover, our noise\nmodel can be used to synthesize realistic training data for learning-based\nlow-light denoising algorithms. In this regard, although promising results have\nbeen shown recently with deep convolutional neural networks, the success\nheavily depends on abundant noisy clean image pairs for training, which are\ntremendously difficult to obtain in practice. Generalizing their trained models\nto images from new devices is also problematic. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple low-light denoising datasets -- including a newly collected one in\nthis work covering various devices -- show that a deep neural network trained\nwith our proposed noise formation model can reach surprisingly-high accuracy.\nThe results are on par with or sometimes even outperform training with paired\nreal data, opening a new door to real-world extreme low-light photography.",

Compared to hand-labeled datasets, weak or inexact labels\ncan be acquired in large quantities at significantly lower cost and can provide\nuseful training signals for data-hungry models such as deep neural networks. We\nconsider weak labels in the form of pseudo-labels and propose a semi-weakly\nsupervised contrastive learning (SWCL) framework for representation learning\nusing semi-weakly annotated images. Specifically, we train a semi-supervised\nmodel to propagate labels from a small dataset consisting of diverse\nimage-level annotations to a large unlabeled dataset. Using the propagated\nlabels, we generate a patch-level dataset for pretraining and formulate a\nmulti-label contrastive learning objective to capture position-specific\nfeatures encoded in each patch. We empirically validate the transfer learning\nperformance of SWCL on seven public retinal fundus datasets, covering three\ndisease classification tasks and two anatomical structure segmentation tasks.\nOur experiment results suggest that, under very low data regime, large-scale\nImageNet pretraining on improved architecture remains a very strong baseline,\nand recently proposed self-supervised methods falter in segmentation tasks,\npossibly due to the strong invariant constraint imposed.

To apply it to real-time monitoring, a system needs\nnot only to describe events accurately but also to produce the captions as soon\nas possible. Low-latency captioning is needed to realize such functionality,\nbut this research area for online video captioning has not been pursued yet.\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to optimize each caption's output timing\nbased on a trade-off between latency and caption quality. An audio-visual\nTrans-former is trained to generate ground-truth captions using only a small\nportion of all video frames, and to mimic outputs of a pre-trained Transformer\nto which all the frames are given. A CNN-based timing detector is also trained\nto detect a proper output timing, where the captions generated by the two\nTrans-formers become sufficiently close to each other. With the jointly trained\nTransformer and timing detector, a caption can be generated in the early stages\nof an event-triggered video clip, as soon as an event happens or when it can be\nforecasted. Experiments with the ActivityNet Captions dataset show that our\napproach achieves 94% of the caption quality of the upper bound given by the\npre-trained Transformer using the entire video clips, using only 28% of frames\nfrom the beginning.",

Current text-aware image captioning models are not\nable to generate distinctive captions according to various information needs.\nTo explore how to generate personalized text-aware captions, we define a new\nchallenging task, namely Question-controlled Text-aware Image Captioning\n(Qc-TextCap). With questions as control signals, this task requires models to\nunderstand questions, find related scene texts and describe them together with\nobjects fluently in human language. Based on two existing text-aware captioning\ndatasets, we automatically construct two datasets, ControlTextCaps and\nControlVizWiz to support the task.

To address these issues, we propose a general\nframework called Learning Compatible Embeddings (LCE) which is applicable for\nboth cross model compatibility and compatible training in\ndirect/forward/backward manners. Our compatibility is achieved by aligning\nclass centers between models directly or via a transformation, and restricting\nmore compact intra-class distributions for the new model.

          "description": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) has constantly been a vital topic in video\nanalysis. As anomalies are often rare, it is typically addressed under a\nsemi-supervised setup, which requires a training set with pure normal videos.\nTo avoid exhausted manual labeling, we are inspired by how humans sense\nanomalies and propose a hominine framework that enables both unsupervised and\nend-to-end VAD. The framework is based on two key observations: 1) Human\nperception is usually local, i.e. focusing on local foreground and its context\nwhen sensing anomalies. Thus, we propose to impose locality-awareness by\nlocalizing foreground with generic knowledge, and a region localization\nstrategy is designed to exploit local context. 2) Frequently-occurred events\nwill mould humans' definition of normality, which motivates us to devise a\nsurrogate training paradigm. It trains a deep neural network (DNN) to learn a\nsurrogate task with unlabeled videos, and frequently-occurred events will play\na dominant role in \"moulding\" the DNN. In this way, a training loss gap will\nautomatically manifest rarely-seen novel events as anomalies. For\nimplementation, we explore various surrogate tasks as well as both classic and\nemerging DNN models. Extensive evaluations on commonly-used VAD benchmarks\njustify the framework's applicability to different surrogate tasks or DNN\nmodels, and demonstrate its astonishing effectiveness: It not only outperforms\nexisting unsupervised solutions by a wide margin (8% to 10% AUROC gain), but\nalso achieves comparable or even superior performance to state-of-the-art\nsemi-supervised counterparts.",

          "description": "We present MedicDeepLabv3+, a convolutional neural network that is the first\ncompletely automatic method to segment brain hemispheres in magnetic resonance\n(MR) images of rodents with lesions. MedicDeepLabv3+ improves the\nstate-of-the-art DeepLabv3+ with an advanced decoder, incorporating spatial\nattention layers and additional skip connections that, as we show in our\nexperiments, lead to more precise segmentations. MedicDeepLabv3+ requires no MR\nimage preprocessing, such as bias-field correction or registration to a\ntemplate, produces segmentations in less than a second, and its GPU memory\nrequirements can be adjusted based on the available resources. Using a large\ndataset of 723 MR rat brain images, we evaluated our MedicDeepLabv3+, two\nstate-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (DeepLabv3+, UNet) and three\napproaches that were specifically designed for skull-stripping rodent MR images\n(Demon, RATS and RBET). In our experiments, MedicDeepLabv3+ outperformed the\nother methods, yielding an average Dice coefficient of 0.952 and 0.944 in the\nbrain and contralateral hemisphere regions. Additionally, we show that despite\nlimiting the GPU memory and the training data to only three images, our\nMedicDeepLabv3+ also provided satisfactory segmentations. In conclusion, our\nmethod, publicly available at https://github.com/jmlipman/MedicDeepLabv3Plus,\nyielded excellent results in multiple scenarios, demonstrating its capability\nto reduce human workload in rodent neuroimaging studies.",

          "description": "Existing video copy detection methods generally measure video similarity\nbased on spatial similarities between key frames, neglecting the latent\nsimilarity in temporal dimension, so that the video similarity is biased\ntowards spatial information. There are methods modeling unified video\nsimilarity in an end-to-end way, but losing detailed partial alignment\ninformation, which causes the incapability of copy segments localization. To\naddress the above issues, we propose the Video Similarity and Alignment\nLearning (VSAL) approach, which jointly models spatial similarity, temporal\nsimilarity and partial alignment. To mitigate the spatial similarity bias, we\nmodel the temporal similarity as the mask map predicted from frame-level\nspatial similarity, where each element indicates the probability of frame pair\nlying right on the partial alignments. To further localize partial copies, the\nstep map is learned from the spatial similarity where the elements indicate\nextending directions of the current partial alignments on the spatial-temporal\nsimilarity map. Obtained from the mask map, the start points extend out into\npartial optimal alignments following instructions of the step map. With the\nsimilarity and alignment learning strategy, VSAL achieves the state-of-the-art\nF1-score on VCDB core dataset. Furthermore, we construct a new benchmark of\npartial video copy detection and localization by adding new segment-level\nannotations for FIVR-200k dataset, where VSAL also achieves the best\nperformance, verifying its effectiveness in more challenging situations.

          "description": "Most existing neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms are dedicated to\nthe downstream tasks, e.g., image classification in computer vision. However,\nextensive experiments have shown that, prominent neural architectures, such as\nResNet in computer vision and LSTM in natural language processing, are\ngenerally good at extracting patterns from the input data and perform well on\ndifferent downstream tasks. These observations inspire us to ask: Is it\nnecessary to use the performance of specific downstream tasks to evaluate and\nsearch for good neural architectures? Can we perform NAS effectively and\nefficiently while being agnostic to the downstream task? In this work, we\nattempt to affirmatively answer the above two questions and improve the\nstate-of-the-art NAS solution by proposing a novel and generic NAS framework,\ntermed Generic NAS (GenNAS). GenNAS does not use task-specific labels but\ninstead adopts \\textit{regression} on a set of manually designed synthetic\nsignal bases for architecture evaluation. Such a self-supervised regression\ntask can effectively evaluate the intrinsic power of an architecture to capture\nand transform the input signal patterns, and allow more sufficient usage of\ntraining samples. We then propose an automatic task search to optimize the\ncombination of synthetic signals using limited downstream-task-specific labels,\nfurther improving the performance of GenNAS. We also thoroughly evaluate\nGenNAS's generality and end-to-end NAS performance on all search spaces, which\noutperforms almost all existing works with significant speedup.",

In this work, we\nexplore unsupervised domain adaptation in retinal vessel segmentation by using\nentropy-based adversarial learning and transfer normalization layer to train a\nsegmentation network, which generalizes well across domains and requires no\nannotation of the target domain. Specifically, first, an entropy-based\nadversarial learning strategy is developed to reduce the distribution\ndiscrepancy between the source and target domains while also achieving the\nobjective of entropy minimization on the target domain. In addition, a new\ntransfer normalization layer is proposed to further boost the transferability\nof the deep network.

          "description": "Human pose information is a critical component in many downstream image\nprocessing tasks, such as activity recognition and motion tracking. Likewise, a\npose estimator for the illustrated character domain would provide a valuable\nprior for assistive content creation tasks, such as reference pose retrieval\nand automatic character animation. But while modern data-driven techniques have\nsubstantially improved pose estimation performance on natural images, little\nwork has been done for illustrations. In our work, we bridge this domain gap by\nefficiently transfer-learning from both domain-specific and task-specific\nsource models. Additionally, we upgrade and expand an existing illustrated pose\nestimation dataset, and introduce two new datasets for classification and\nsegmentation subtasks. We then apply the resultant state-of-the-art character\npose estimator to solve the novel task of pose-guided illustration retrieval.\nAll data, models, and code will be made publicly available.",

          "description": "Transformers with powerful global relation modeling abilities have been\nintroduced to fundamental computer vision tasks recently. As a typical example,\nthe Vision Transformer (ViT) directly applies a pure transformer architecture\non image classification, by simply splitting images into tokens with a fixed\nlength, and employing transformers to learn relations between these tokens.\nHowever, such naive tokenization could destruct object structures, assign grids\nto uninterested regions such as background, and introduce interference signals.\nTo mitigate the above issues, in this paper, we propose an iterative and\nprogressive sampling strategy to locate discriminative regions. At each\niteration, embeddings of the current sampling step are fed into a transformer\nencoder layer, and a group of sampling offsets is predicted to update the\nsampling locations for the next step. The progressive sampling is\ndifferentiable. When combined with the Vision Transformer, the obtained PS-ViT\nnetwork can adaptively learn where to look. The proposed PS-ViT is both\neffective and efficient. When trained from scratch on ImageNet, PS-ViT performs\n3.8% higher than the vanilla ViT in terms of top-1 accuracy with about\n$4\\times$ fewer parameters and $10\\times$ fewer FLOPs.

In this paper, we tackle this issue by\nconducting a systematic cross-modal analysis of sensor-algorithm combinations\ntypically used in robotics. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art\nperson detectors for 2D range data, 3D lidar, and RGB-D data as well as\nselected combinations thereof in a challenging industrial use-case.\n\nWe further address the related problems of data scarcity in the industrial\ntarget domain, and that recent research on human detection in 3D point clouds\nhas mostly focused on autonomous driving scenarios. To leverage these\nmethodological advances for robotics applications, we utilize a simple, yet\neffective multi-sensor transfer learning strategy by extending a strong\nimage-based RGB-D detector to provide cross-modal supervision for lidar\ndetectors in the form of weak 3D bounding box labels.\n\nOur results show a large variance among the different approaches in terms of\ndetection performance, generalization, frame rates and computational\nrequirements.

Such a heatmap-based localization approach via\nTransformer conforms to the principle of Activation\nMaximization~\\cite{erhan2009visualizing}. And the revealed dependencies are\nimage-specific and fine-grained, which also can provide evidence of how the\nmodel handles special cases, e.g., occlusion. The experiments show that\nTransPose achieves 75.8 AP and 75.0 AP on COCO validation and test-dev sets,\nwhile being more lightweight and faster than mainstream CNN architectures. The\nTransPose model also transfers very well on MPII benchmark, achieving superior\nperformance on the test set when fine-tuned with small training costs. Code and\npre-trained models are publicly\navailable\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/yangsenius/TransPose}}.",

          "description": "ObjectGoal Navigation (ObjectNav) is an embodied task wherein agents are to\nnavigate to an object instance in an unseen environment. Prior works have shown\nthat end-to-end ObjectNav agents that use vanilla visual and recurrent modules,\ne.g. a CNN+RNN, perform poorly due to overfitting and sample inefficiency. This\nhas motivated current state-of-the-art methods to mix analytic and learned\ncomponents and operate on explicit spatial maps of the environment. We instead\nre-enable a generic learned agent by adding auxiliary learning tasks and an\nexploration reward. Our agents achieve 24.5% success and 8.1% SPL, a 37% and 8%\nrelative improvement over prior state-of-the-art, respectively, on the Habitat\nObjectNav Challenge. From our analysis, we propose that agents will act to\nsimplify their visual inputs so as to smooth their RNN dynamics, and that\nauxiliary tasks reduce overfitting by minimizing effective RNN dimensionality;\ni.e. a performant ObjectNav agent that must maintain coherent plans over long\nhorizons does so by learning smooth, low-dimensional recurrent dynamics.

          "description": "Domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer the knowledge learned from a source\ndomain to an unlabeled target domain. Some recent works tackle source-free\ndomain adaptation (SFDA) where only a source pre-trained model is available for\nadaptation to the target domain. However, those methods do not consider keeping\nsource performance which is of high practical value in real world applications.\nIn this paper, we propose a new domain adaptation paradigm called Generalized\nSource-free Domain Adaptation (G-SFDA), where the learned model needs to\nperform well on both the target and source domains, with only access to current\nunlabeled target data during adaptation. First, we propose local structure\nclustering (LSC), aiming to cluster the target features with its semantically\nsimilar neighbors, which successfully adapts the model to the target domain in\nthe absence of source data. Second, we propose sparse domain attention (SDA),\nit produces a binary domain specific attention to activate different feature\nchannels for different domains, meanwhile the domain attention will be utilized\nto regularize the gradient during adaptation to keep source information. In the\nexperiments, for target performance our method is on par with or better than\nexisting DA and SFDA methods, specifically it achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance (85.4%) on VisDA, and our method works well for all domains after\nadapting to single or multiple target domains.

          "description": "In the classic setting of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), the labeled\nsource data are available in the training phase. However, in many real-world\nscenarios, owing to some reasons such as privacy protection and information\nsecurity, the source data is inaccessible, and only a model trained on the\nsource domain is available. This paper proposes a novel deep clustering method\nfor this challenging task. Aiming at the dynamical clustering at feature-level,\nwe introduce extra constraints hidden in the geometric structure between data\nto assist the process. Concretely, we propose a geometry-based constraint,\nnamed semantic consistency on the nearest neighborhood (SCNNH), and use it to\nencourage robust clustering. To reach this goal, we construct the nearest\nneighborhood for every target data and take it as the fundamental clustering\nunit by building our objective on the geometry. Also, we develop a more\nSCNNH-compliant structure with an additional semantic credibility constraint,\nnamed semantic hyper-nearest neighborhood (SHNNH). After that, we extend our\nmethod to this new geometry. Extensive experiments on three challenging UDA\ndatasets indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. The\nproposed method has significant improvement on all datasets (as we adopt SHNNH,\nthe average accuracy increases by over 3.0% on the large-scaled dataset).

An example of this is\nthe impingement of jet fires, where the heat fluxes of the flame could reach\nnearby equipment and dramatically increase the probability of a domino effect\nwith catastrophic results. Because of this, the characterization of such fire\naccidents is important from a risk management point of view. One such\ncharacterization would be the segmentation of different radiation zones within\nthe flame, so this paper presents an exploratory research regarding several\ntraditional computer vision and Deep Learning segmentation approaches to solve\nthis specific problem. A data set of propane jet fires is used to train and\nevaluate the different approaches and given the difference in the distribution\nof the zones and background of the images, different loss functions, that seek\nto alleviate data imbalance, are also explored. Additionally, different metrics\nare correlated to a manual ranking performed by experts to make an evaluation\nthat closely resembles the expert's criteria. The Hausdorff Distance and\nAdjusted Random Index were the metrics with the highest correlation and the\nbest results were obtained from the UNet architecture with a Weighted\nCross-Entropy Loss.

          "description": "Domain shift is one of the most salient challenges in medical computer\nvision. Due to immense variability in scanners' parameters and imaging\nprotocols, even images obtained from the same person and the same scanner could\ndiffer significantly. We address variability in computed tomography (CT) images\ncaused by different convolution kernels used in the reconstruction process, the\ncritical domain shift factor in CT. The choice of a convolution kernel affects\npixels' granularity, image smoothness, and noise level. We analyze a dataset of\npaired CT images, where smooth and sharp images were reconstructed from the\nsame sinograms with different kernels, thus providing identical anatomy but\ndifferent style. Though identical predictions are desired, we show that the\nconsistency, measured as the average Dice between predictions on pairs, is just\n0.54. We propose Filtered Back-Projection Augmentation (FBPAug), a simple and\nsurprisingly efficient approach to augment CT images in sinogram space\nemulating reconstruction with different kernels. We apply the proposed method\nin a zero-shot domain adaptation setup and show that the consistency boosts\nfrom 0.54 to 0.92 outperforming other augmentation approaches.

Unsupervised methods that can adapt to domain shift are highly\ndesirable as they allow effective utilization of the source data without\nrequiring additional annotated training data from the target. Practically,\nobtaining sufficient amount of annotated data from the target domain can be\nboth infeasible and extremely expensive. In this work, we address the domain\nshift problem for the object detection task. Our approach relies on gradually\nremoving the domain shift between the source and the target domains. The key\ningredients to our approach are -- (a) mapping the source to the target domain\non pixel-level; (b) training a teacher network on the mapped source and the\nunannotated target domain using adversarial feature alignment; and (c) finally\ntraining a student network using the pseudo-labels obtained from the teacher.\nExperimentally, when tested on challenging scenarios involving domain shift, we\nconsistently obtain significantly large performance gains over various recent\nstate of the art approaches.",

          "description": "General object detectors use powerful backbones that uniformly extract\nfeatures from images for enabling detection of a vast amount of object types.\nHowever, utilization of such backbones in object detection applications\ndeveloped for specific object types can unnecessarily over-process an extensive\namount of background. In addition, they are agnostic to object scales, thus\nredundantly process all image regions at the same resolution. In this work we\nintroduce BLT-net, a new low-computation two-stage object detection\narchitecture designed to process images with a significant amount of background\nand objects of variate scales. BLT-net reduces computations by separating\nobjects from background using a very lite first-stage. BLT-net then efficiently\nmerges obtained proposals to further decrease processed background and then\ndynamically reduces their resolution to minimize computations. Resulting image\nproposals are then processed in the second-stage by a highly accurate model. We\ndemonstrate our architecture on the pedestrian detection problem, where objects\nare of different sizes, images are of high resolution and object detection is\nrequired to run in real-time. We show that our design reduces computations by a\nfactor of x4-x7 on the Citypersons and Caltech datasets with respect to leading\npedestrian detectors, on account of a small accuracy degradation. This method\ncan be applied on other object detection applications in scenes with a\nconsiderable amount of background and variate object sizes to reduce\ncomputations.",

The method uses density-based spatial\nclustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to detect the robots and a\nsingle k-dimensional ($k - d$) tree to accurately keep track of them as they\nmove in an indoor arena. Robust detections and tracks are maintained in the\nface of event camera noise and lack of events (due to robots moving slowly or\nstopping). An off-the-shelf RGB camera-based tracking system was used to\nprovide ground truth. Experiments including up to 4 robots are performed to\nstudy the effect of i) varying DBSCAN parameters, ii) the event accumulation\ntime, iii) the number of robots in the arena, iv) the speed of the robots, and\nv) variation in ambient light conditions on the detection and tracking\nperformance. The experimental results showed 100% detection and tracking\nfidelity in the face of event camera noise and robots stopping for tests\ninvolving up to 3 robots (and upwards of 93% for 4 robots).

          "description": "Image fusion aims at estimating a high-resolution spectral image from a\nlow-spatial-resolution hyperspectral image and a low-spectral-resolution\nmultispectral image. In this regard, compressive spectral imaging (CSI) has\nemerged as an acquisition framework that captures the relevant information of\nspectral images using a reduced number of measurements. Recently, various image\nfusion methods from CSI measurements have been proposed. However, these methods\nexhibit high running times and face the challenging task of choosing\nsparsity-inducing bases. In this paper, a deep network under the algorithm\nunrolling approach is proposed for fusing spectral images from compressive\nmeasurements. This architecture, dubbed LADMM-Net, casts each iteration of a\nlinearized version of the alternating direction method of multipliers into a\nprocessing layer whose concatenation deploys a deep network. The linearized\napproach enables obtaining fusion estimates without resorting to costly matrix\ninversions. Furthermore, this approach exploits the benefits of learnable\ntransforms to estimate the image details included in both the auxiliary\nvariable and the Lagrange multiplier. Finally, the performance of the proposed\ntechnique is evaluated on two spectral image databases and one dataset captured\nat the laboratory. Extensive simulations show that the proposed method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art approaches that fuse spectral images from\ncompressive measurements.",

However, despite its\nsignificance, this problem remains rather unexplored, with a few exceptions\nthat considered unsupervised semantic segmentation on small-scale datasets with\na narrow visual domain. In this paper, we make a first attempt to tackle the\nproblem on datasets that have been traditionally utilized for the supervised\ncase. To achieve this, we introduce a two-step framework that adopts a\npredetermined mid-level prior in a contrastive optimization objective to learn\npixel embeddings. This marks a large deviation from existing works that relied\non proxy tasks or end-to-end clustering. Additionally, we argue about the\nimportance of having a prior that contains information about objects, or their\nparts, and discuss several possibilities to obtain such a prior in an\nunsupervised manner.\n\nExperimental evaluation shows that our method comes with key advantages over\nexisting works. First, the learned pixel embeddings can be directly clustered\nin semantic groups using K-Means on PASCAL. Under the fully unsupervised\nsetting, there is no precedent in solving the semantic segmentation task on\nsuch a challenging benchmark. Second, our representations can improve over\nstrong baselines when transferred to new datasets, e.g. COCO and DAVIS. The\ncode is available.",

Similar to other\nbiometric tasks, we expect systems can benefit from additional modalities. We\nhypothesize that adding modalities to FIW, which contains only still-images,\nwill improve performance. Thus, to narrow the gap between research and reality\nand enhance the power of kinship recognition systems, we extend FIW with\nmultimedia (MM) data (i.e., video, audio, and text captions). Specifically, we\nintroduce the first publicly available multi-task MM kinship dataset. To build\nFIW MM, we developed machinery to automatically collect, annotate, and prepare\nthe data, requiring minimal human input and no financial cost. The proposed MM\ncorpus allows the problem statements to be more realistic template-based\nprotocols. We show significant improvements in all benchmarks with the added\nmodalities.

In\nthis study, we introduce a class of network models that have a small memory\nfootprint in terms of their computational graphs. To this end, the graph is\ndesigned to contain loops by iteratively executing a single network building\nblock. Furthermore, the trade-off between accuracy and latency of these\nso-called iterative neural networks is improved by adding multiple intermediate\noutputs during both training and inference. We show state-of-the-art results\nfor semantic segmentation on the CamVid and Cityscapes datasets that are\nespecially demanding in terms of computational resources. In ablation studies,\nthe improvement of network training by intermediate network outputs as well as\nthe trade-off between weight sharing over iterations and the network size are\ninvestigated.",

          "description": "Brain age estimation based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an active\nresearch area in early diagnosis of some neurodegenerative diseases (e.g.\nAlzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, etc.) for elderly people or brain\nunderdevelopment for the young group. Deep learning methods have achieved the\nstate-of-the-art performance in many medical image analysis tasks, including\nbrain age estimation. However, the performance and generalisability of the deep\nlearning model are highly dependent on the quantity and quality of the training\ndata set. Both collecting and annotating brain MRI data are extremely\ntime-consuming. In this paper, to overcome the data scarcity problem, we\npropose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based image synthesis method.\nDifferent from the existing GAN-based methods, we integrate a task-guided\nbranch (a regression model for age estimation) to the end of the generator in\nGAN. By adding a task-guided loss to the conventional GAN loss, the learned\nlow-dimensional latent space and the synthesised images are more task-specific.\nIt helps to boost the performance of the down-stream task by combining the\nsynthesised images and real images for model training. The proposed method was\nevaluated on a public brain MRI data set for age estimation. Our proposed\nmethod outperformed (statistically significant) a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork based regression model and the GAN-based image synthesis method without\nthe task-guided branch. More importantly, it enables the identification of\nage-related brain regions in the image space. The code is available on GitHub\n(https://github.com/ruizhe-l/tgb-gan).",

In this paper, we introduce a novel Dual-Level Collaborative\nTransformer (DLCT) network to realize the complementary advantages of the two\nfeatures. Concretely, in DLCT, these two features are first processed by a\nnovelDual-way Self Attenion (DWSA) to mine their intrinsic properties, where a\nComprehensive Relation Attention component is also introduced to embed the\ngeometric information. In addition, we propose a Locality-Constrained Cross\nAttention module to address the semantic noises caused by the direct fusion of\nthese two features, where a geometric alignment graph is constructed to\naccurately align and reinforce region and grid features. To validate our model,\nwe conduct extensive experiments on the highly competitive MS-COCO dataset, and\nachieve new state-of-the-art performance on both local and online test sets,\ni.e., 133.8% CIDEr-D on Karpathy split and 135.4% CIDEr on the official split.\nCode is available at https://github.com/luo3300612/image-captioning-DLCT.",

          "description": "Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic\ndisease in over 200 countries, influencing billions of humans. To control the\ninfection, identifying and separating the infected people is the most crucial\nstep. The main diagnostic tool is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain\nReaction (RT-PCR) test. Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high\nenough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a\nvaluable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the\npatients in the early-stage with high sensitivity. However, the chest CT scan\ntest is usually time-consuming, requiring about 21.5 minutes per case. This\npaper develops a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to\nperform real-time and explainable COVID-19 chest CT diagnosis. To train our JCS\nsystem, we construct a large scale COVID-19 Classification and Segmentation\n(COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 chest CT images of 400 COVID-19 patients and\n350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chest CT images of 200 patients are annotated with\nfine-grained pixel-level labels of opacifications, which are increased\nattenuation of the lung parenchyma. We also have annotated lesion counts,\nopacification areas, and locations and thus benefit various diagnosis aspects.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed JCS diagnosis system is\nvery efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an\naverage sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 93.0% on the classification\ntest set, and 78.5% Dice score on the segmentation test set of our COVID-CS\ndataset.

          "description": "Automated red blood cell (RBC) classification on blood smear images helps\nhematologists to analyze RBC lab results in a reduced time and cost. However,\noverlapping cells can cause incorrect predicted results, and so they have to be\nseparated into multiple single RBCs before classifying. To classify multiple\nclasses with deep learning, imbalance problems are common in medical imaging\nbecause normal samples are always higher than rare disease samples. This paper\npresents a new method to segment and classify RBCs from blood smear images,\nspecifically to tackle cell overlapping and data imbalance problems. Focusing\non overlapping cell separation, our segmentation process first estimates\nellipses to represent RBCs. The method detects the concave points and then\nfinds the ellipses using directed ellipse fitting. The accuracy from 20 blood\nsmear images was 0.889. Classification requires balanced training datasets.\nHowever, some RBC types are rare. The imbalance ratio of this dataset was\n34.538 for 12 RBC classes from 20,875 individual RBC samples. The use of\nmachine learning for RBC classification with an imbalanced dataset is hence\nmore challenging than many other applications. We analyzed techniques to deal\nwith this problem. The best accuracy and F1-score were 0.921 and 0.8679,\nrespectively, using EfficientNet-B1 with augmentation. Experimental results\nshowed that the weight balancing technique with augmentation had the potential\nto deal with imbalance problems by improving the F1-score on minority classes,\nwhile data augmentation significantly improved the overall classification\nperformance.",

          "description": "Photoelastic techniques have a long tradition in both qualitative and\nquantitative analysis of the stresses in granular materials. Over the last two\ndecades, computational methods for reconstructing forces between particles from\ntheir photoelastic response have been developed by many different experimental\nteams. Unfortunately, all of these methods are computationally expensive. This\nlimits their use for processing extensive data sets that capture the time\nevolution of granular ensembles consisting of a large number of particles. In\nthis paper, we present a novel approach to this problem which leverages the\npower of convolutional neural networks to recognize complex spatial patterns.\nThe main drawback of using neural networks is that training them usually\nrequires a large labeled data set which is hard to obtain experimentally. We\nshow that this problem can be successfully circumvented by pretraining the\nnetworks on a large synthetic data set and then fine-tuning them on much\nsmaller experimental data sets. Due to our current lack of experimental data,\nwe demonstrate the potential of our method by changing the size of the\nconsidered particles which alters the exhibited photoelastic patterns more than\ntypical experimental errors.",

Hence, in this paper, we have investigated a range of deep\nconvolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) architectures to further\nimprove the accuracy of cross-spectral iris recognition methods. Moreover,\nunlike the existing works in the literature, we introduce a resolution\ndifference into the classical cross-spectral matching problem domain. We have\ndeveloped two different techniques using the conditional generative adversarial\nnetwork (cGAN) as a backbone architecture for cross-spectral iris matching. In\nthe first approach, we simultaneously address the cross-resolution and\ncross-spectral matching problem by training a cGAN that jointly translates\ncross-resolution as well as cross-spectral tasks to the same resolution and\nwithin the same spectrum. In the second approach, we design a coupled\ngenerative adversarial network (cpGAN) architecture consisting of a pair of\ncGAN modules that project the VIS and NIR iris images into a low-dimensional\nembedding domain to ensure maximum pairwise similarity between the feature\nvectors from the two iris modalities of the same subject.",

          "description": "The quality of images captured by smartphones is an important specification\nsince smartphones are becoming ubiquitous as primary capturing devices. The\ntraditional image signal processing (ISP) pipeline in a smartphone camera\nconsists of several image processing steps performed sequentially to\nreconstruct a high quality sRGB image from the raw sensor data. These steps\nconsist of demosaicing, denoising, white balancing, gamma correction, colour\nenhancement, etc. Since each of them are performed sequentially using\nhand-crafted algorithms, the residual error from each processing module\naccumulates in the final reconstructed signal. Thus, the traditional ISP\npipeline has limited reconstruction quality in terms of generalizability across\ndifferent lighting conditions and associated noise levels while capturing the\nimage. Deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have\nbecome popular in solving many image-related tasks such as image denoising,\ncontrast enhancement, super resolution, deblurring, etc. Furthermore, recent\napproaches for the RAW to sRGB conversion using deep learning methods have also\nbeen published, however, their immense complexity in terms of their memory\nrequirement and number of Mult-Adds make them unsuitable for mobile camera ISP.\nIn this paper we propose DelNet - a single end-to-end deep learning model - to\nlearn the entire ISP pipeline within reasonable complexity for smartphone\ndeployment. Del-Net is a multi-scale architecture that uses spatial and channel\nattention to capture global features like colour, as well as a series of\nlightweight modified residual attention blocks to help with denoising. For\nvalidation, we provide results to show the proposed Del-Net achieves compelling\nreconstruction quality.",

          "description": "Image-based virtual try-on is challenging in fitting a target in-shop clothes\ninto a reference person under diverse human poses. Previous works focus on\npreserving clothing details ( e.g., texture, logos, patterns ) when\ntransferring desired clothes onto a target person under a fixed pose. However,\nthe performances of existing methods significantly dropped when extending\nexisting methods to multi-pose virtual try-on. In this paper, we propose an\nend-to-end Semantic Prediction Guidance multi-pose Virtual Try-On Network\n(SPG-VTON), which could fit the desired clothing into a reference person under\narbitrary poses. Concretely, SPG-VTON is composed of three sub-modules. First,\na Semantic Prediction Module (SPM) generates the desired semantic map. The\npredicted semantic map provides more abundant guidance to locate the desired\nclothes region and produce a coarse try-on image. Second, a Clothes Warping\nModule (CWM) warps in-shop clothes to the desired shape according to the\npredicted semantic map and the desired pose. Specifically, we introduce a\nconductible cycle consistency loss to alleviate the misalignment in the clothes\nwarping process. Third, a Try-on Synthesis Module (TSM) combines the coarse\nresult and the warped clothes to generate the final virtual try-on image,\npreserving details of the desired clothes and under the desired pose. Besides,\nwe introduce a face identity loss to refine the facial appearance and maintain\nthe identity of the final virtual try-on result at the same time. We evaluate\nthe proposed method on the most massive multi-pose dataset (MPV) and the\nDeepFashion dataset. The qualitative and quantitative experiments show that\nSPG-VTON is superior to the state-of-the-art methods and is robust to the data\nnoise, including background and accessory changes, i.e., hats and handbags,\nshowing good scalability to the real-world scenario.",

          "description": "In real-life applications, machine learning models often face scenarios where\nthere is a change in data distribution between training and test domains. When\nthe aim is to make predictions on distributions different from those seen at\ntraining, we incur in a domain generalization problem. Methods to address this\nissue learn a model using data from multiple source domains, and then apply\nthis model to the unseen target domain. Our hypothesis is that when training\nwith multiple domains, conflicting gradients within each mini-batch contain\ninformation specific to the individual domains which is irrelevant to the\nothers, including the test domain. If left untouched, such disagreement may\ndegrade generalization performance. In this work, we characterize the\nconflicting gradients emerging in domain shift scenarios and devise novel\ngradient agreement strategies based on gradient surgery to alleviate their\neffect. We validate our approach in image classification tasks with three\nmulti-domain datasets, showing the value of the proposed agreement strategy in\nenhancing the generalization capability of deep learning models in domain shift\nscenarios.",

          "description": "Footprints are left, or obtained, in a variety of scenarios from crime scenes\nto anthropological investigations. Determining the sex of a footprint can be\nuseful in screening such impressions and attempts have been made to do so using\nsingle or multi landmark distances, shape analyses and via the density of\nfriction ridges. Here we explore the relative importance of different\ncomponents in sexing two-dimensional foot impressions namely, size, shape and\ntexture. We use a machine learning approach and compare this to more\ntraditional methods of discrimination. Two datasets are used, a pilot data set\ncollected from students at Bournemouth University (N=196) and a larger data set\ncollected by podiatrists at Sheffield NHS Teaching Hospital (N=2677). Our\nconvolutional neural network can sex a footprint with accuracy of around 90% on\na test set of N=267 footprint images using all image components, which is\nbetter than an expert can achieve. However, the quality of the impressions\nimpacts on this success rate, but the results are promising and in time it may\nbe possible to create an automated screening algorithm in which practitioners\nof whatever sort (medical or forensic) can obtain a first order sexing of a\ntwo-dimensional footprint.",

          "description": "State-of-the-art deep face recognition methods are mostly trained with a\nsoftmax-based multi-class classification framework. Despite being popular and\neffective, these methods still have a few shortcomings that limit empirical\nperformance. In this paper, we first identify the discrepancy between training\nand evaluation in the existing multi-class classification framework and then\ndiscuss the potential limitations caused by the \"competitive\" nature of softmax\nnormalization. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a novel binary\nclassification training framework, termed SphereFace2. In contrast to existing\nmethods, SphereFace2 circumvents the softmax normalization, as well as the\ncorresponding closed-set assumption. This effectively bridges the gap between\ntraining and evaluation, enabling the representations to be improved\nindividually by each binary classification task. Besides designing a specific\nwell-performing loss function, we summarize a few general principles for this\n\"one-vs-all\" binary classification framework so that it can outperform current\ncompetitive methods. We conduct comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks\nto demonstrate that SphereFace2 can consistently outperform current\nstate-of-the-art deep face recognition methods.",

          "description": "Sparse coding has been incorporated in models of the visual cortex for its\ncomputational advantages and connection to biology. But how the level of\nsparsity contributes to performance on visual tasks is not well understood. In\nthis work, sparse coding has been integrated into an existing hierarchical V2\nmodel (Hosoya and Hyv\\\"arinen, 2015), but replacing the Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA) with an explicit sparse coding in which the degree of sparsity\ncan be controlled. After training, the sparse coding basis functions with a\nhigher degree of sparsity resembled qualitatively different structures, such as\ncurves and corners. The contributions of the models were assessed with image\nclassification tasks, including object classification, and tasks associated\nwith mid-level vision including figure-ground classification, texture\nclassification, and angle prediction between two line stimuli. In addition, the\nmodels were assessed in comparison to a texture sensitivity measure that has\nbeen reported in V2 (Freeman et al., 2013), and a deleted-region inference\ntask. The results from the experiments show that while sparse coding performed\nworse than ICA at classifying images, only sparse coding was able to better\nmatch the texture sensitivity level of V2 and infer deleted image regions, both\nby increasing the degree of sparsity in sparse coding. Higher degrees of\nsparsity allowed for inference over larger deleted image regions. The mechanism\nthat allows for this inference capability in sparse coding is described here.",

At present, the methods for detecting coronary artery stenoses\nand evaluating the degree of it in coronary angiograms are either subjective or\nnot efficient enough. Two vascular stenoses detection methods in coronary\nangiograms are proposed to assist the diagnosis. The first one is an automatic\nmethod, which can automatically segment the entire coronary vessels and mark\nthe stenoses. The second one is an interactive method. With this method, the\nuser only needs to give a start point and an end point to detect the stenoses\nof a certain vascular segment.

The proposed automatic method and interactive method are\neffective in various angiograms and can complement each other in clinical\npractice.

          "description": "Weakly-supervised object detection (WSOD) has emerged as an inspiring recent\ntopic to avoid expensive instance-level object annotations. However, the\nbounding boxes of most existing WSOD methods are mainly determined by\nprecomputed proposals, thereby being limited in precise object localization. In\nthis paper, we defend the problem setting for improving localization\nperformance by leveraging the bounding box regression knowledge from a\nwell-annotated auxiliary dataset. First, we use the well-annotated auxiliary\ndataset to explore a series of learnable bounding box adjusters (LBBAs) in a\nmulti-stage training manner, which is class-agnostic. Then, only LBBAs and a\nweakly-annotated dataset with non-overlapped classes are used for training\nLBBA-boosted WSOD. As such, our LBBAs are practically more convenient and\neconomical to implement while avoiding the leakage of the auxiliary\nwell-annotated dataset. In particular, we formulate learning bounding box\nadjusters as a bi-level optimization problem and suggest an EM-like multi-stage\ntraining algorithm. Then, a multi-stage scheme is further presented for\nLBBA-boosted WSOD. Additionally, a masking strategy is adopted to improve\nproposal classification. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our\nmethod. Our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art WSOD methods and\nknowledge transfer model with similar problem setting.

Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that ghosting artifacts caused\nby large foreground motion are mainly low-frequency signals and the details are\nmainly high-frequency signals. In this work, we propose a novel\nfrequency-guided end-to-end deep neural network (FHDRNet) to conduct HDR fusion\nin the frequency domain, and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to\ndecompose inputs into different frequency bands. The low-frequency signals are\nused to avoid specific ghosting artifacts, while the high-frequency signals are\nused for preserving details. Using a U-Net as the backbone, we propose two\nnovel modules: merging module and frequency-guided upsampling module. The\nmerging module applies the attention mechanism to the low-frequency components\nto deal with the ghost caused by large foreground motion. The frequency-guided\nupsampling module reconstructs details from multiple frequency-specific\ncomponents with rich details. In addition, a new RAW dataset is created for\ntraining and evaluating multi-frame HDR imaging algorithms in the RAW domain.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on public datasets and our RAW dataset,\nshowing that the proposed FHDRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

The past decade has seen the rise of semi-automatic tools to assist\nwith rating and more recently fully automatic tools for microbleed detection.\nIn this work, we explore the use of nnU-Net as a fully automated tool for\nmicrobleed segmentation. Data was provided by the ``Where is VALDO?'' challenge\nof MICCAI 2021. The final method consists of nnU-Net in the ``3D full\nresolution U-Net'' configuration trained on all data (fold = `all'). No\npost-processing options of nnU-Net were used. Self-evaluation on the training\ndata showed an estimated Dice of 0.80, false discovery rate of 0.16, and false\nnegative rate of 0.15. Final evaluation on the test set of the VALDO challenge\nis pending. Visual inspection of the results showed that most of the reported\nfalse positives could be an actual microbleed that might have been missed\nduring visual rating.

          "description": "Noisy labels are commonly found in real-world data, which cause performance\ndegradation of deep neural networks. Cleaning data manually is labour-intensive\nand time-consuming. Previous research mostly focuses on enhancing\nclassification models against noisy labels, while the robustness of deep metric\nlearning (DML) against noisy labels remains less well-explored. In this paper,\nwe bridge this important gap by proposing Probabilistic Ranking-based Instance\nSelection with Memory (PRISM) approach for DML. PRISM calculates the\nprobability of a label being clean, and filters out potentially noisy samples.\nSpecifically, we propose three methods to calculate this probability: 1)\nAverage Similarity Method (AvgSim), which calculates the average similarity\nbetween potentially noisy data and clean data; 2) Proxy Similarity Method\n(ProxySim), which replaces the centers maintained by AvgSim with the proxies\ntrained by proxy-based method; and 3) von Mises-Fisher Distribution Similarity\n(vMF-Sim), which estimates a von Mises-Fisher distribution for each data class.\nWith such a design, the proposed approach can deal with challenging DML\nsituations in which the majority of the samples are noisy. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy dataset show that the\nproposed approach achieves up to 8.37% higher Precision@1 compared with the\nbest performing state-of-the-art baseline approaches, within reasonable\ntraining time.",

          "description": "We propose Region-wise (RW) loss for biomedical image segmentation.\nRegion-wise loss is versatile, can simultaneously account for class imbalance\nand pixel importance, and it can be easily implemented as the pixel-wise\nmultiplication between the softmax output and a RW map. We show that, under the\nproposed Region-wise loss framework, certain loss functions, such as Active\nContour and Boundary loss, can be reformulated similarly with appropriate RW\nmaps, thus revealing their underlying similarities and a new perspective to\nunderstand these loss functions. We investigate the observed optimization\ninstability caused by certain RW maps, such as Boundary loss distance maps, and\nwe introduce a mathematically-grounded principle to avoid such instability.\nThis principle provides excellent adaptability to any dataset and practically\nensures convergence without extra regularization terms or optimization tricks.\nFollowing this principle, we propose a simple version of boundary distance maps\ncalled rectified RW maps that, as we demonstrate in our experiments, achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance with similar or better Dice coefficients and\nHausdorff distances than Dice, Focal, and Boundary losses in three distinct\nsegmentation tasks. We quantify the optimization instability provided by\nBoundary loss distance maps, and we empirically show that our rectified RW maps\nare stable to optimize.

          "description": "Designing a 3D game scene is a tedious task that often requires a substantial\namount of work. Typically, this task involves synthesis, coloring, and\nplacement of 3D models within the game scene. To lessen this workload, we can\napply machine learning to automate some aspects of the game scene development.\nEarlier research has already tackled automated generation of the game scene\nbackground with machine learning. However, model auto-coloring remains an\nunderexplored problem. The automatic coloring of a 3D model is a challenging\ntask, especially when dealing with the digital representation of a colorful,\nmultipart object. In such a case, we have to ``understand'' the object's\ncomposition and coloring scheme of each part. Existing single-stage methods\nhave their own caveats such as the need for segmentation of the object or\ngenerating individual parts that have to be assembled together to yield the\nfinal model. We address these limitations by proposing a two-stage training\napproach to synthesize auto-colored 3D models. In the first stage, we obtain a\n3D point cloud representing a 3D object, whilst in the second stage, we assign\ncolors to points within such cloud. Next, by leveraging the so-called\ntriangulation trick, we generate a 3D mesh in which the surfaces are colored\nbased on interpolation of colored points representing vertices of a given mesh\ntriangle. This approach allows us to generate a smooth coloring scheme.\nExperimental evaluation shows that our two-stage approach gives better results\nin terms of shape reconstruction and coloring when compared to traditional\nsingle-stage techniques.",

          "description": "Vision transformers have recently received explosive popularity, but huge\ncomputational cost is still a severe issue. Recent efficient designs for vision\ntransformers follow two pipelines, namely, structural compression based on\nlocal spatial prior and non-structural token pruning. However, rough token\npruning breaks the spatial structure that is indispensable for local spatial\nprior. To take advantage of both two pipelines, this work seeks to dynamically\nidentify uninformative tokens for each instance and trim down both the training\nand inference complexity while maintain complete spatial structure and\ninformation flow. To achieve this goal, we propose Evo-ViT, a self-motivated\nslow-fast token evolution method for vision transformers. Specifically, we\nconduct unstructured instance-wise token selection by taking advantage of the\nglobal class attention that is unique to vision transformers. Then, we propose\nto update information tokens and placeholder tokens that contribute little to\nthe final prediction with different computational properties, namely, slow-fast\nupdating. Thanks to the slow-fast updating mechanism that guarantees\ninformation flow and spatial structure, our Evo-ViT can accelerate vanilla\ntransformers of both flat and deep-narrow structures from the very beginning of\nthe training process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\ncan significantly reduce the computational costs of vision transformers while\nmaintaining comparable performance on image classification. For example, our\nmethod accelerates DeiT-S by over 60% throughput while only sacrificing 0.4%\ntop-1 accuracy.",

          "description": "Current face recognition tasks are usually carried out on high-quality face\nimages, but in reality, most face images are captured under unconstrained or\npoor conditions, e.g., by video surveillance. Existing methods are featured by\nlearning data uncertainty to avoid overfitting the noise, or by adding margins\nto the angle or cosine space of the normalized softmax loss to penalize the\ntarget logit, which enforces intra-class compactness and inter-class\ndiscrepancy. In this paper, we propose a deep Rival Penalized Competitive\nLearning (RPCL) for deep face recognition in low-resolution (LR) images.\nInspired by the idea of the RPCL, our method further enforces regulation on the\nrival logit, which is defined as the largest non-target logit for an input\nimage. Different from existing methods that only consider penalization on the\ntarget logit, our method not only strengthens the learning towards the target\nlabel, but also enforces a reverse direction, i.e., becoming de-learning, away\nfrom the rival label. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nimproves the existing state-of-the-art methods to be very robust for LR face\nrecognition.",

          "description": "Recent image generation models show remarkable generation performance.\nHowever, they mirror strong location preference in datasets, which we call\nspatial bias. Therefore, generators render poor samples at unseen locations and\nscales. We argue that the generators rely on their implicit positional encoding\nto render spatial content. From our observations, the generator's implicit\npositional encoding is translation-variant, making the generator spatially\nbiased. To address this issue, we propose injecting explicit positional\nencoding at each scale of the generator. By learning the spatially unbiased\ngenerator, we facilitate the robust use of generators in multiple tasks, such\nas GAN inversion, multi-scale generation, generation of arbitrary sizes and\naspect ratios. Furthermore, we show that our method can also be applied to\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic models.",

          "description": "Motion forecasting plays a significant role in various domains (e.g.,\nautonomous driving, human-robot interaction), which aims to predict future\nmotion sequences given a set of historical observations. However, the observed\nelements may be of different levels of importance. Some information may be\nirrelevant or even distracting to the forecasting in certain situations. To\naddress this issue, we propose a generic motion forecasting framework (named\nRAIN) with dynamic key information selection and ranking based on a hybrid\nattention mechanism. The general framework is instantiated to handle\nmulti-agent trajectory prediction and human motion forecasting tasks,\nrespectively. In the former task, the model learns to recognize the relations\nbetween agents with a graph representation and to determine their relative\nsignificance. In the latter task, the model learns to capture the temporal\nproximity and dependency in long-term human motions. We also propose an\neffective double-stage training pipeline with an alternating training strategy\nto optimize the parameters in different modules of the framework. We validate\nthe framework on both synthetic simulations and motion forecasting benchmarks\nin different domains, demonstrating that our method not only achieves\nstate-of-the-art forecasting performance, but also provides interpretable and\nreasonable hybrid attention weights.",

          "description": "We focus on tackling weakly supervised semantic segmentation with\nscribble-level annotation. The regularized loss has been proven to be an\neffective solution for this task. However, most existing regularized losses\nonly leverage static shallow features (color, spatial information) to compute\nthe regularized kernel, which limits its final performance since such static\nshallow features fail to describe pair-wise pixel relationship in complicated\ncases. In this paper, we propose a new regularized loss which utilizes both\nshallow and deep features that are dynamically updated in order to aggregate\nsufficient information to represent the relationship of different pixels.\nMoreover, in order to provide accurate deep features, we adopt vision\ntransformer as the backbone and design a feature consistency head to train the\npair-wise feature relationship. Unlike most approaches that adopt multi-stage\ntraining strategy with many bells and whistles, our approach can be directly\ntrained in an end-to-end manner, in which the feature consistency head and our\nregularized loss can benefit from each other.

To deal with dynamic environments, computer vision researchers\nusually apply some learning-based object detectors to remove these dynamic\nobjects. However, these object detectors are computationally too expensive for\nmobile robot on-board processing. In practical applications, these objects\noutput noisy sounds that can be effectively detected by on-board sound source\nlocalization. The directional information of the sound source object can be\nefficiently obtained by direction of sound arrival (DoA) estimation, but depth\nestimation is difficult. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel\naudio-visual fusion approach that fuses sound source direction into the RGB-D\nimage and thus removes the effect of dynamic obstacles on the multi-robot SLAM\nsystem.

A\nstraightforward solution is to search an architecture from scratch for each\ndeployment scenario, which however is computation-intensive and impractical. To\naddress this, we present a novel and general framework, called Elastic\nArchitecture Search (EAS), permitting instant specializations at runtime for\ndiverse tasks with various resource constraints. To this end, we first propose\nto effectively train the over-parameterized network via a task dropout strategy\nto disentangle the tasks during training.

Tractography constructs complex neuronal fibers\nin three dimensions that exhibit the geometry of white matter pathways in the\nbrain. However, most tractography analysis methods are time consuming and\nintractable. We develop a computational geometry-based tractography\nrepresentation that aims to simplify the connectivity of white matter fibers.\nGiven the trajectories of neuronal fiber pathways, we model the evolution of\ntrajectories that encodes geometrically significant events and calculate their\npoint correspondence in the 3D brain space. Trajectory inter-distance is used\nas a parameter to control the granularity of the model that allows local or\nglobal representation of the tractogram. Using diffusion MRI data from\nAlzheimer's patient study, we extract tractography features from our model for\ndistinguishing the Alzheimer's subject from the normal control. Software\nimplementation of our algorithm is available on GitHub.",

          "description": "Given a reference object of an unknown type in an image, human observers can\neffortlessly find the objects of the same category in another image and\nprecisely tell their visual boundaries. Such visual cognition capability of\nhumans seems absent from the current research spectrum of computer vision.\nExisting segmentation networks, for example, rely on a humongous amount of\nlabeled data, which is laborious and costly to collect and annotate; besides,\nthe performance of segmentation networks tend to downgrade as the number of the\ncategory increases. In this paper, we introduce a novel Reference semantic\nsegmentation Network (Ref-Net) to conduct visual boundary knowledge\ntranslation. Ref-Net contains a Reference Segmentation Module (RSM) and a\nBoundary Knowledge Translation Module (BKTM). Inspired by the human recognition\nmechanism, RSM is devised only to segment the same category objects based on\nthe features of the reference objects. BKTM, on the other hand, introduces two\nboundary discriminator branches to conduct inner and outer boundary\nsegmentation of the target objectin an adversarial manner, and translate the\nannotated boundary knowledge of open-source datasets into the segmentation\nnetwork. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with tens of finely-grained\nannotated samples as guidance, Ref-Net achieves results on par with fully\nsupervised methods on six datasets.",

          "description": "Recent advance in diffusion models incorporates the Stochastic Differential\nEquation (SDE), which brings the state-of-the art performance on image\ngeneration tasks. This paper improves such diffusion models by analyzing the\nmodel at the zero diffusion time. In real datasets, the score function diverges\nas the diffusion time ($t$) decreases to zero, and this observation leads an\nargument that the score estimation fails at $t=0$ with any neural network\nstructure. Subsequently, we introduce Unbounded Diffusion Model (UDM) that\nresolves the score diverging problem with an easily applicable modification to\nany diffusion models. Additionally, we introduce a new SDE that overcomes the\ntheoretic and practical limitations of Variance Exploding SDE. On top of that,\nthe introduced Soft Truncation method improves the sample quality by mitigating\nthe loss scale issue that happens at $t=0$. We further provide a theoretic\nresult of the proposed method to uncover the behind mechanism of the diffusion\nmodels.",

Once\ntrained, the (DNN)^ model is able to quickly lay any input graph out. We\nexperiment (DNN)^2 and statistically compare it to optimization-based and\nregular graph layout algorithms.

The core idea\nof CDR is to leverage information collected from other domains to alleviate the\ntwo problems in one domain. Over the last decade, many efforts have been\nengaged for cross-domain recommendation. Recently, with the development of deep\nlearning and neural networks, a large number of methods have emerged. However,\nthere is a limited number of systematic surveys on CDR, especially regarding\nthe latest proposed methods as well as the recommendation scenarios and\nrecommendation tasks they address. In this survey paper, we first proposed a\ntwo-level taxonomy of cross-domain recommendation which classifies different\nrecommendation scenarios and recommendation tasks. We then introduce and\nsummarize existing cross-domain recommendation approaches under different\nrecommendation scenarios in a structured manner. We also organize datasets\ncommonly used.

Unfortunately, DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks\nthat affect virtually all state-of-the-art models. These attacks make small\nimperceptible modifications to inputs that are sufficient to induce the DNNs to\nproduce the wrong classification.\n\nIn this paper we propose a novel, lightweight adversarial correction and/or\ndetection mechanism for image classifiers that relies on undervolting (running\na chip at a voltage that is slightly below its safe margin). We propose using\ncontrolled undervolting of the chip running the inference process in order to\nintroduce a limited number of compute errors. We show that these errors disrupt\nthe adversarial input in a way that can be used either to correct the\nclassification or detect the input as adversarial.

Musical rhythm comprises complex hierarchical relationships\nacross time, rendering its analysis intrinsically challenging and at times\nsubjective.

The\nproposed system does not need to be primed with a time signature in order to\nperform downbeat tracking, and is instead able to estimate meter and adjust the\npredictions over time. Additionally, we propose an information gate strategy to\nsignificantly decrease the computational cost of particle filtering during the\ninference step, making the system much faster than previous sampling-based\nmethods.

To answer these\nquestions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a\nnew English-French dataset comprising supporting context words for 14K\ntranslations that professional translators found useful for pronoun\ndisambiguation. Using SCAT, we perform an in-depth analysis of the context used\nto disambiguate, examining positional and lexical characteristics of the\nsupporting words.

It is well known that\nthe spike protein contains most of the information/variation pertaining to\ncoronavirus variants.\n\nIn this paper, we use spike sequences to classify different variants of the\ncoronavirus in humans. We show that preserving the order of the amino acids\nhelps the underlying classifiers to achieve better performance. We also show\nthat we can train our model to outperform the baseline algorithms using only a\nsmall number of training samples ($1\\%$ of the data). Finally, we show the\nimportance of the different amino acids which play a key role in identifying\nvariants and how they coincide with those reported by the USA's Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC).",

          "description": "In applied multivariate statistics, estimating the number of latent\ndimensions or the number of clusters is a fundamental and recurring problem.\nOne common diagnostic is the scree plot, which shows the largest eigenvalues of\nthe data matrix; the user searches for a \"gap\" or \"elbow\" in the decreasing\neigenvalues; unfortunately, these patterns can hide beneath the bias of the\nsample eigenvalues. This methodological problem is conceptually difficult\nbecause, in many situations, there is only enough signal to detect a subset of\nthe $k$ population dimensions/eigenvectors. In this situation, one could argue\nthat the correct choice of $k$ is the number of detectable dimensions. We\nalleviate these problems with cross-validated eigenvalues. Under a large class\nof random graph models, without any parametric assumptions, we provide a\np-value for each sample eigenvector. It tests the null hypothesis that this\nsample eigenvector is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the true latent\ndimensions. This approach naturally adapts to problems where some dimensions\nare not statistically detectable. In scenarios where all $k$ dimensions can be\nestimated, we prove that our procedure consistently estimates $k$. In\nsimulations and a data example, the proposed estimator compares favorably to\nalternative approaches in both computational and statistical performance.",

          "description": "A point cloud serves as a representation of the surface of a\nthree-dimensional (3D) shape. Deep generative models have been adapted to model\ntheir variations typically using a map from a ball-like set of latent\nvariables. However, previous approaches did not pay much attention to the\ntopological structure of a point cloud, despite that a continuous map cannot\nexpress the varying numbers of holes and intersections. Moreover, a point cloud\nis often composed of multiple subparts, and it is also difficult to express. In\nthis study, we propose ChartPointFlow, a flow-based generative model with\nmultiple latent labels for 3D point clouds. Each label is assigned to points in\nan unsupervised manner. Then, a map conditioned on a label is assigned to a\ncontinuous subset of a point cloud, similar to a chart of a manifold. This\nenables our proposed model to preserve the topological structure with clear\nboundaries, whereas previous approaches tend to generate blurry point clouds\nand fail to generate holes. The experimental results demonstrate that\nChartPointFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of generation and\nreconstruction compared with other point cloud generators.

We present iGibson 2.0,\nan open-source simulation environment that supports the simulation of a more\ndiverse set of household tasks through three key innovations. First, iGibson\n2.0 supports object states, including temperature, wetness level, cleanliness\nlevel, and toggled and sliced states, necessary to cover a wider range of\ntasks. Second, iGibson 2.0 implements a set of predicate logic functions that\nmap the simulator states to logic states like Cooked or Soaked. Additionally,\ngiven a logic state, iGibson 2.0 can sample valid physical states that satisfy\nit. This functionality can generate potentially infinite instances of tasks\nwith minimal effort from the users. The sampling mechanism allows our scenes to\nbe more densely populated with small objects in semantically meaningful\nlocations. Third, iGibson 2.0 includes a virtual reality (VR) interface to\nimmerse humans in its scenes to collect demonstrations. As a result, we can\ncollect demonstrations from humans on these new types of tasks, and use them\nfor imitation learning. We evaluate the new capabilities of iGibson 2.0 to\nenable robot learning of novel tasks, in the hope of demonstrating the\npotential of this new simulator to support new research in embodied AI. iGibson\n2.0 and its new dataset will be publicly available at\nthis http URL",

To\ninvestigate the potential new definitions of impact subtypes based on\nkinematics, 3,161 head impacts from various sources including simulation,\ncollege football, mixed martial arts, and car racing were collected.

          "description": "Imitating human demonstrations is a promising approach to endow robots with\nvarious manipulation capabilities. While recent advances have been made in\nimitation learning and batch (offline) reinforcement learning, a lack of\nopen-source human datasets and reproducible learning methods make assessing the\nstate of the field difficult. In this paper, we conduct an extensive study of\nsix offline learning algorithms for robot manipulation on five simulated and\nthree real-world multi-stage manipulation tasks of varying complexity, and with\ndatasets of varying quality. Our study analyzes the most critical challenges\nwhen learning from offline human data for manipulation. Based on the study, we\nderive a series of lessons including the sensitivity to different algorithmic\ndesign choices, the dependence on the quality of the demonstrations, and the\nvariability based on the stopping criteria due to the different objectives in\ntraining and evaluation. We also highlight opportunities for learning from\nhuman datasets, such as the ability to learn proficient policies on\nchallenging, multi-stage tasks beyond the scope of current reinforcement\nlearning methods, and the ability to easily scale to natural, real-world\nmanipulation scenarios where only raw sensory signals are available. We have\nopen-sourced our datasets and all algorithm implementations to facilitate\nfuture research and fair comparisons in learning from human demonstration data.\nCodebase, datasets, trained models, and more available at\nhttps://arise-initiative.github.io/robomimic-web/",

Our focus is on using the hybridization of Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN) and Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique\n(SMOTE) to address class imbalanced problems. We propose a novel two-phase\noversampling approach that has the synergy of SMOTE and GAN.

We named it SMOTified-GAN as GAN works on\npre-sampled minority data produced by SMOTE rather than randomly generating the\nsamples itself. The experimental results prove the sample quality of minority\nclass(es) has been improved in a variety of tested benchmark datasets. Its\nperformance is improved by up to 9\\% from the next best algorithm tested on\nF1-score measurements.

Given a dictionary of functions, these methods\napproximate the projection of the action of the operator on the\nfinite-dimensional subspace spanned by the dictionary. We propose the Tunable\nSymmetric Subspace Decomposition algorithm to refine the dictionary, balancing\nits expressiveness and accuracy. Expressiveness corresponds to the ability of\nthe dictionary to describe the evolution of as many observables as possible and\naccuracy corresponds to the ability to correctly predict their evolution. Based\non the observation that Koopman-invariant subspaces give rise to exact\npredictions, we reason that prediction accuracy is a function of the degree of\ninvariance of the subspace generated by the dictionary and provide a\ndata-driven measure to measure invariance proximity. The proposed algorithm\niteratively prunes the initial functional space to identify a refined\ndictionary of functions that satisfies the desired level of accuracy while\nretaining as much of the original expressiveness as possible. We provide a full\ncharacterization of the algorithm properties and show that it generalizes both\nExtended Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Symmetric Subspace Decomposition.\nSimulations on planar systems show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in\nproducing Koopman approximations of tunable accuracy that capture relevant\ninformation about the dynamical system.",

Low density separators can be used to obtain\na partition of a set of data based on their allocations to the different sides\nof the separators. The proposed method is based on applying stochastic gradient\ndescent to the integrated density on the hyperplane with respect to a\nconvolution of the underlying distribution and a smoothing kernel. In the case\nwhere the bandwidth of the smoothing kernel is decreased towards zero, the bias\nof these updates with respect to the true underlying density tends to zero, and\nconvergence to a minimiser of the density on the hyperplane can be obtained. A\npost-processing of the partition induced by a collection of low-density\nhyperplanes yields an efficient and accurate clustering method which is capable\nof automatically selecting an appropriate number of clusters.

In this paper, we 1) highlight that the effect of\noverestimation bias on learning efficiency is environment-dependent; 2) propose\na generalization of Q-learning, called \\emph{Maxmin Q-learning}, which provides\na parameter to flexibly control bias; 3) show theoretically that there exists a\nparameter choice for Maxmin Q-learning that leads to unbiased estimation with a\nlower approximation variance than Q-learning; and 4) prove the convergence of\nour algorithm in the tabular case, as well as convergence of several previous\nQ-learning variants, using a novel Generalized Q-learning framework. We\nempirically verify that our algorithm better controls estimation bias in toy\nenvironments, and that it achieves superior performance on several benchmark\nproblems.",

This is useful\nbecause complexity can be significantly reduced and the treatment of\nlarge-scale data sets can be facilitated. In this paper, we find a low-rank\nrepresentation for a given tensor by solving a Bayesian inference problem. This\nis achieved by dividing the overall inference problem into sub-problems where\nwe sequentially infer the posterior distribution of one tensor decomposition\ncomponent at a time. This leads to a probabilistic interpretation of the\nwell-known iterative algorithm alternating linear scheme (ALS). In this way,\nthe consideration of measurement noise is enabled, as well as the incorporation\nof application-specific prior knowledge and the uncertainty quantification of\nthe low-rank tensor estimate.

          "description": "Asynchronous Q-learning aims to learn the optimal action-value function (or\nQ-function) of a Markov decision process (MDP), based on a single trajectory of\nMarkovian samples induced by a behavior policy. Focusing on a\n$\\gamma$-discounted MDP with state space $\\mathcal{S}$ and action space\n$\\mathcal{A}$, we demonstrate that the $\\ell_{\\infty}$-based sample complexity\nof classical asynchronous Q-learning --- namely, the number of samples needed\nto yield an entrywise $\\varepsilon$-accurate estimate of the Q-function --- is\nat most on the order of $\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\min}(1-\\gamma)^5\\varepsilon^2}+\n\\frac{t_{mix}}{\\mu_{\\min}(1-\\gamma)}$ up to some logarithmic factor, provided\nthat a proper constant learning rate is adopted.

The first term of this bound\nmatches the sample complexity in the synchronous case with independent samples\ndrawn from the stationary distribution of the trajectory. The second term\nreflects the cost taken for the empirical distribution of the Markovian\ntrajectory to reach a steady state, which is incurred at the very beginning and\nbecomes amortized as the algorithm runs.

The purpose of this study is to predict new\ncases and deaths rate one, three and seven-day ahead during the next 100 days.\nThe motivation for predicting every n days (instead of just every day) is the\ninvestigation of the possibility of computational cost reduction and still\nachieving reasonable performance. Such a scenario may be encountered real-time\nforecasting of time series. Six different deep learning methods are examined on\nthe data adopted from the WHO website.

          "description": "GNNs have been proven to perform highly effective in various node-level,\nedge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks in several domains. Existing\napproaches mainly focus on static graphs. However, many graphs change over time\nwith their edge may disappear, or node or edge attribute may alter from one\ntime to the other. It is essential to consider such evolution in representation\nlearning of nodes in time varying graphs. In this paper, we propose a Temporal\nMultilayered Position-aware Graph Neural Network (TMP-GNN), a node embedding\napproach for dynamic graph that incorporates the interdependence of temporal\nrelations into embedding computation. We evaluate the performance of TMP-GNN on\ntwo different representations of temporal multilayered graphs. The performance\nis assessed against the most popular GNNs on node-level prediction tasks. Then,\nwe incorporate TMP-GNN into a deep learning framework to estimate missing data\nand compare the performance with their corresponding competent GNNs from our\nformer experiment, and a baseline method. Experimental results on four\nreal-world datasets yield up to 58% of lower ROC AUC for pairwise node\nclassification task, and 96% of lower MAE in missing feature estimation,\nparticularly for graphs with a relatively high number of nodes and lower mean\ndegree of connectivity.",

While imaging\ntechniques may discard the reflection coefficients for being dominant and\nuninformative for imaging, these parameters are made use of for boundary\ndetection. The learned model is verified through independent clinical human\ntrials by using a head imaging system with a 16-element antenna array that\nworks across the band 0.7-1.6 GHz.

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have boosted the performance for many\ngraph-related tasks. Despite the great success, recent studies have shown that\nGNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where adversaries can\nmislead the GNNs' prediction by modifying graphs. On the other hand, the\nexplanation of GNNs (GNNExplainer) provides a better understanding of a trained\nGNN model by generating a small subgraph and features that are most influential\nfor its prediction. In this paper, we first perform empirical studies to\nvalidate that GNNExplainer can act as an inspection tool and have the potential\nto detect the adversarial perturbations for graphs. This finding motivates us\nto further initiate a new problem investigation: Whether a graph neural network\nand its explanations can be jointly attacked by modifying graphs with malicious\ndesires? It is challenging to answer this question since the goals of\nadversarial attacks and bypassing the GNNExplainer essentially contradict each\nother. In this work, we give a confirmative answer to this question by\nproposing a novel attack framework (GEAttack), which can attack both a GNN\nmodel and its explanations by simultaneously exploiting their vulnerabilities.\nExtensive experiments on two explainers (GNNExplainer and PGExplainer) under\nvarious real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.",

Recent work on graph\nsimilarity learning has considered either global-level graph-graph interactions\nor low-level node-node interactions, however ignoring the rich cross-level\ninteractions (e.g., between each node of one graph and the other whole graph).\nIn this paper, we propose a multi-level graph matching network (MGMN) framework\nfor computing the graph similarity between any pair of graph-structured objects\nin an end-to-end fashion. In particular, the proposed MGMN consists of a\nnode-graph matching network for effectively learning cross-level interactions\nbetween each node of one graph and the other whole graph, and a siamese graph\nneural network to learn global-level interactions between two input graphs.\nFurthermore, to compensate for the lack of standard benchmark datasets, we have\ncreated and collected a set of datasets for both the graph-graph classification\nand graph-graph regression tasks with different sizes in order to evaluate the\neffectiveness and robustness of our models. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MGMN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models\non both the graph-graph classification and graph-graph regression tasks.\nCompared with previous work, MGMN also exhibits stronger robustness as the\nsizes of the two input graphs increase.",

However, it is\nchallenging to make full use of the complementarity among\nspatial-spectral-temporal domain features for emotion recognition, as well as\nmodel the heterogeneity and correlation among multi-modal signals. In this\npaper, we propose a novel two-stream heterogeneous graph recurrent neural\nnetwork, named HetEmotionNet, fusing multi-modal physiological signals for\nemotion recognition. Specifically, HetEmotionNet consists of the\nspatial-temporal stream and the spatial-spectral stream, which can fuse\nspatial-spectral-temporal domain features in a unified framework. Each stream\nis composed of the graph transformer network for modeling the heterogeneity,\nthe graph convolutional network for modeling the correlation, and the gated\nrecurrent unit for capturing the temporal domain or spectral domain dependency.\nExtensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed\nmodel achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines.",

          "description": "Time-series data are one of the fundamental types of raw data representation\nused in data-driven techniques. In machine condition monitoring, time-series\nvibration data are overly used in data mining for deep neural networks.\nTypically, vibration data is converted into images for classification using\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs), and scalograms are the most effective form of\nimage representation. However, the DNN classifiers require huge labeled\ntraining samples to reach their optimum performance. So, many forms of data\naugmentation techniques are applied to the classifiers to compensate for the\nlack of training samples. However, the scalograms are graphical representations\nwhere the existing augmentation techniques suffer because they either change\nthe graphical meaning or have too much noise in the samples that change the\nphysical meaning. In this study, a data augmentation technique named ensemble\naugmentation is proposed to overcome this limitation. This augmentation method\nuses the power of white noise added in ensembles to the original samples to\ngenerate real-like samples. After averaging the signal with ensembles, a new\nsignal is obtained that contains the characteristics of the original signal.\nThe parameters for the ensemble augmentation are validated using a simulated\nsignal. The proposed method is evaluated using 10 class bearing vibration data\nusing three state-of-the-art Transfer Learning (TL) models, namely,\nInception-V3, MobileNet-V2, and ResNet50. Augmented samples are generated in\ntwo increments: the first increment generates the same number of fake samples\nas the training samples, and in the second increment, the number of samples is\nincreased gradually. The outputs from the proposed method are compared with no\naugmentation, augmentations using deep convolution generative adversarial\nnetwork (DCGAN), and several geometric transformation-based augmentations...",

          "description": "This paper considers the multi-agent linear least-squares problem in a\nserver-agent network. In this problem, the system comprises multiple agents,\neach having a set of local data points, that are connected to a server. The\ngoal for the agents is to compute a linear mathematical model that optimally\nfits the collective data points held by all the agents, without sharing their\nindividual local data points. This goal can be achieved, in principle, using\nthe server-agent variant of the traditional iterative gradient-descent method.\nThe gradient-descent method converges linearly to a solution, and its rate of\nconvergence is lower bounded by the conditioning of the agents' collective data\npoints. If the data points are ill-conditioned, the gradient-descent method may\nrequire a large number of iterations to converge.\n\nWe propose an iterative pre-conditioning technique that mitigates the\ndeleterious effect of the conditioning of data points on the rate of\nconvergence of the gradient-descent method. We rigorously show that the\nresulting pre-conditioned gradient-descent method, with the proposed iterative\npre-conditioning, achieves superlinear convergence when the least-squares\nproblem has a unique solution. In general, the convergence is linear with\nimproved rate of convergence in comparison to the traditional gradient-descent\nmethod and the state-of-the-art accelerated gradient-descent methods.

In our model, there are $N$ independent $2$-state Markov\nprocesses that may be observed and accessed for accruing rewards.

          "description": "Deep neural network (DNN) models have achieved phenomenal success for\napplications in many domains, ranging from academic research in science and\nengineering to industry and business. The modeling power of DNN is believed to\nhave come from the complexity and over-parameterization of the model, which on\nthe other hand has been criticized for the lack of interpretation. Although\ncertainly not true for every application, in some applications, especially in\neconomics, social science, healthcare industry, and administrative decision\nmaking, scientists or practitioners are resistant to use predictions made by a\nblack-box system for multiple reasons. One reason is that a major purpose of a\nstudy can be to make discoveries based upon the prediction function, e.g., to\nreveal the relationships between measurements. Another reason can be that the\ntraining dataset is not large enough to make researchers feel completely sure\nabout a purely data-driven result. Being able to examine and interpret the\nprediction function will enable researchers to connect the result with existing\nknowledge or gain insights about new directions to explore. Although classic\nstatistical models are much more explainable, their accuracy often falls\nconsiderably below DNN. In this paper, we propose an approach to fill the gap\nbetween relatively simple explainable models and DNN such that we can more\nflexibly tune the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. Our main\nidea is a mixture of discriminative models that is trained with the guidance\nfrom a DNN. Although mixtures of discriminative models have been studied\nbefore, our way of generating the mixture is quite different.",

          "description": "With the growing use of ML in highly consequential domains, quantifying\ndisparity with respect to protected attributes, e.g., gender, race, etc., is\nimportant. While quantifying disparity is essential, sometimes the needs of an\noccupation may require the use of certain features that are critical in a way\nthat any disparity that can be explained by them might need to be exempted.\nE.g., in hiring a software engineer for a safety-critical application,\ncoding-skills may be weighed strongly, whereas name, zip code, or reference\nletters may be used only to the extent that they do not add disparity. In this\nwork, we propose an information-theoretic decomposition of the total disparity\n(a quantification inspired from counterfactual fairness) into two components: a\nnon-exempt component which quantifies the part that cannot be accounted for by\nthe critical features, and an exempt component that quantifies the remaining\ndisparity. This decomposition allows one to check if the disparity arose purely\ndue to the critical features (inspired from the business necessity defense of\ndisparate impact law) and also enables selective removal of the non-exempt\ncomponent if desired. We arrive at this decomposition through canonical\nexamples that lead to a set of desirable properties (axioms) that a measure of\nnon-exempt disparity should satisfy. Our proposed measure satisfies all of\nthem. Our quantification bridges ideas of causality, Simpson's paradox, and a\nbody of work from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition.\nWe also obtain an impossibility result showing that no observational measure\ncan satisfy all the desirable properties, leading us to relax our goals and\nexamine observational measures that satisfy only some of them. We perform case\nstudies to show how one can audit/train models while reducing non-exempt\ndisparity.",

The\nlearner and the adversary then play in this game. The learner's goal is to play\nso as to minimize the maximum coordinate of the cumulative vector-valued loss.\nThe resulting one-shot game is not convex-concave, and so the minimax theorem\ndoes not apply.

Numerous works have been proposed\nto utilize textual data for social and anti-social behaviour analysis, by\npredicting the contexts mostly for highly-resourced languages like English.\nHowever, some languages are under-resourced, e.g., South Asian languages like\nBengali, that lack computational resources for accurate natural language\nprocessing (NLP).

Important(most and least) terms are then identified using\nsensitivity analysis and layer-wise relevance propagation(LRP), before\nproviding human-interpretable explanations.

In this situation, it is crucial to perform\nefficient and fast diagnosis. The reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction\n(RTPCR) test is conducted to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2. This test is\ntime-consuming and instead chest CT (or Chest X-ray) can be used for a fast and\naccurate diagnosis. Automated diagnosis is considered to be important as it\nreduces human effort and provides accurate and low-cost tests. The\ncontributions of our research are three-fold. First, it is aimed to analyse the\nbehaviour and performance of variant vision models ranging from Inception to\nNAS networks with the appropriate fine-tuning procedure. Second, the behaviour\nof these models is visually analysed by plotting CAMs for individual networks\nand determining classification performance with AUCROC curves. Thirdly, stacked\nensembles techniques are imparted to provide higher generalisation on combining\nthe fine-tuned models, in which six ensemble neural networks are designed by\ncombining the existing fine-tuned networks. Implying these stacked ensembles\nprovides a great generalization to the models. The ensemble model designed by\ncombining all the fine-tuned networks obtained a state-of-the-art accuracy\nscore of 99.17%. The precision and recall for the COVID-19 class are 99.99% and\n89.79% respectively, which resembles the robustness of the stacked ensembles.",

We derive a new distillation objective, implementing\nit as a data augmentation scheme.

          "description": "The characterization of diffusion processes is a keystone in our\nunderstanding of a variety of physical phenomena. Many of these deviate from\nBrownian motion, giving rise to anomalous diffusion. Various theoretical models\nexists nowadays to describe such processes, but their application to\nexperimental setups is often challenging, due to the stochastic nature of the\nphenomena and the difficulty to harness reliable data. The latter often\nconsists on short and noisy trajectories, which are hard to characterize with\nusual statistical approaches. In recent years, we have witnessed an impressive\neffort to bridge theory and experiments by means of supervised machine learning\ntechniques, with astonishing results. In this work, we explore the use of\nunsupervised methods in anomalous diffusion data. We show that the main\ndiffusion characteristics can be learnt without the need of any labelling of\nthe data. We use such method to discriminate between anomalous diffusion models\nand extract their physical parameters. Moreover, we explore the feasibility of\nfinding novel types of diffusion, in this case represented by compositions of\nexisting diffusion models. At last, we showcase the use of the method in\nexperimental data and demonstrate its advantages for cases where supervised\nlearning is not applicable.",

          "description": "Transformer neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results for\nunstructured data such as text and images but their adoption for\ngraph-structured data has been limited. This is partly due to the difficulty in\nincorporating complex structural information in the basic transformer\nframework. We propose a simple yet powerful extension to the transformer -\nresidual edge channels. The resultant framework, which we call Edge-augmented\nGraph Transformer (EGT), can directly accept, process and output structural\ninformation as well as node information. This simple addition allows us to use\nglobal self-attention, the key element of transformers, directly for graphs and\ncomes with the benefit of long-range interaction among nodes. Moreover, the\nedge channels allow the structural information to evolve from layer to layer,\nand prediction tasks on edges can be derived directly from these channels. In\naddition to that, we introduce positional encodings based on Singular Value\nDecomposition which can improve the performance of EGT. Our framework, which\nrelies on global node feature aggregation, achieves better performance compared\nto Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), which rely on local feature aggregation\nwithin a neighborhood. We verify the performance of EGT in a supervised\nlearning setting on a wide range of experiments on benchmark datasets. Our\nfindings indicate that convolutional aggregation is not an essential inductive\nbias for graphs and global self-attention can serve as a flexible and adaptive\nalternative to graph convolution.",

To solve this\nproblem using reinforcement learning (RL), the dimension of state/action spaces\nscales with the number of EVs and is thus very large and time-varying. This\ndimensionality issue affects the efficiency and convergence properties of\ngeneric RL algorithms. We develop aggregation schemes that are based on the\nemergency of EV charging, namely the laxity value. A least-laxity first (LLF)\nrule is adopted to consider only the total charging power of the EVCS which\nensures the feasibility of individual EV schedules. In addition, we propose an\nequivalent state aggregation that can guarantee to attain the same optimal\npolicy.

          "description": "Recent studies unveil the vulnerabilities of deep ranking models, where an\nimperceptible perturbation can trigger dramatic changes in the ranking result.\nWhile previous attempts focus on manipulating absolute ranks of certain\ncandidates, the possibility of adjusting their relative order remains\nunder-explored. In this paper, we formulate a new adversarial attack against\ndeep ranking systems, i.e., the Order Attack, which covertly alters the\nrelative order among a selected set of candidates according to an\nattacker-specified permutation, with limited interference to other unrelated\ncandidates. Specifically, it is formulated as a triplet-style loss imposing an\ninequality chain reflecting the specified permutation. However, direct\noptimization of such white-box objective is infeasible in a real-world attack\nscenario due to various black-box limitations. To cope with them, we propose a\nShort-range Ranking Correlation metric as a surrogate objective for black-box\nOrder Attack to approximate the white-box method. The Order Attack is evaluated\non the Fashion-MNIST and Stanford-Online-Products datasets under both white-box\nand black-box threat models. The black-box attack is also successfully\nimplemented on a major e-commerce platform. Comprehensive experimental\nevaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, revealing a\nnew type of ranking model vulnerability.",

          "description": "User response prediction, which aims to predict the probability that a user\nwill provide a predefined positive response in a given context such as clicking\non an ad or purchasing an item, is crucial to many industrial applications such\nas online advertising, recommender systems, and search ranking. However, due to\nthe high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these\ntasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies\nin predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing\nfeature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order\ncross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing\nmethods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model\narchitecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with\nequal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel\narchitecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross\nnetwork's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at\nthe vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of\ndifferent cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head\nattention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to\nperform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed\nmodel can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets. The results have robustly\ndemonstrated that our proposed model DCAP achieves superior prediction\nperformance compared with the state-of-the-art models.",

          "description": "Finding the similarities and differences between groups of datasets is a\nfundamental analysis task. For high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction\n(DR) methods are often used to find the characteristics of each group. However,\nexisting DR methods provide limited capability and flexibility for such\ncomparative analysis as each method is designed only for a narrow analysis\ntarget, such as identifying factors that most differentiate groups. This paper\npresents an interactive DR framework where we integrate our new DR method,\ncalled ULCA (unified linear comparative analysis), with an interactive visual\ninterface. ULCA unifies two DR schemes, discriminant analysis and contrastive\nlearning, to support various comparative analysis tasks. To provide flexibility\nfor comparative analysis, we develop an optimization algorithm that enables\nanalysts to interactively refine ULCA results. Additionally, the interactive\nvisualization interface facilitates interpretation and refinement of the ULCA\nresults. We evaluate ULCA and the optimization algorithm to show their\nefficiency as well as present multiple case studies using real-world datasets\nto demonstrate the usefulness of this framework.",

To provide phase information and account for\ninaccuracies in the dictionary-based representation, we also let the network\noutput a direct prediction, which we then use to resynthesize the audio signals\nfor the individual instruments.

          "description": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can achieve promising results with outrageous\nlarge amount of parameters but constant computation cost, and thus it has\nbecome a trend in model scaling. Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring\nquality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this\nwork, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe\nthat load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,\ncontrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely\nactivated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can\nsignificantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step\nforward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits\nexperts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This\nstrategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,\nand our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is\nmore effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$\ntrillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in\ncomparison with the recent SOTAs on $2048$ TPU cores. The proposed giant model\nachieves substantial speedup in convergence over the same-size baseline.",

Among many\nothers, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) exclusively use chemical energy stored\nin their battery packs for propulsion. Hence, it becomes important to\nunderstand how much energy can be consumed by such vehicles in various traffic\nscenarios towards effective energy management. To address this challenge, we\npropose a novel framework in this paper by leveraging the federated learning\napproaches for modelling energy consumption for BEVs (Fed-BEV).

          "description": "Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws\nincreasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem\nby trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead\nof the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting\nmight make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely\nimbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a\nnovel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP),\nwhich always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all\nintervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably\nintroduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose\nanother criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects\nthe best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during\ninference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly\nnegligible. As far as we are aware, this work is the first to delve into such a\nclassification task and ends up with a promising solution for count interval\npartition. Following the above two theoretically demonstrated criterions, we\npropose a simple yet effective model termed Uniform Error Partition Network\n(UEPNet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging\ndatasets.

Differently, for SGD with momentum, we demonstrate it is the two\nhyperparameters together, the learning rate and the momentum coefficient, that\nplay the significant role for the linear rate of convergence in non-convex\noptimization. Our analysis is based on the use of a hyperparameters-dependent\nstochastic differential equation (hp-dependent SDE) that serves as a continuous\nsurrogate for SGD with momentum. Similarly, we establish the linear convergence\nfor the continuous-time formulation of SGD with momentum and obtain an explicit\nexpression for the optimal linear rate by analyzing the spectrum of the\nKramers-Fokker-Planck operator. By comparison, we demonstrate how the optimal\nlinear rate of convergence and the final gap for SGD only about the learning\nrate varies with the momentum coefficient increasing from zero to one when the\nmomentum is introduced.

Based on a database of 19 characteristics for more\nthan 200 disasters worldwide, a fusion approach at the decision level was used.\nThis technique allows the collected multimodal data to share a common semantic\nspace that facilitates the prediction of individual variables. Each fused\nnumerical vector was fed into an unsupervised clustering algorithm called\nSelf-Organizing-Maps (SOM). The trained SOM serves as a predictor for future\ncases, allowing predicting consequences such as total deaths, total people\naffected, and total damage, and provides specific recommendations for\nassessments in the shelter and housing sector.

Improving predictive accuracy is therefore extremely valuable.\nData science researchers design algorithms, models, and approaches to improve\nprediction.

          "description": "Ill-posed linear inverse problems appear in many scientific setups, and are\ntypically addressed by solving optimization problems, which are composed of\ndata fidelity and prior terms. Recently, several works have considered a\nback-projection (BP) based fidelity term as an alternative to the common least\nsquares (LS), and demonstrated excellent results for popular inverse problems.\nThese works have also empirically shown that using the BP term, rather than the\nLS term, requires fewer iterations of optimization algorithms. In this paper,\nwe examine the convergence rate of the projected gradient descent (PGD)\nalgorithm for the BP objective. Our analysis allows to identify an inherent\nsource for its faster convergence compared to using the LS objective, while\nmaking only mild assumptions. We also analyze the more general proximal\ngradient method under a relaxed contraction condition on the proximal mapping\nof the prior. This analysis further highlights the advantage of BP when the\nlinear measurement operator is badly conditioned. Numerical experiments with\nboth $\\ell_1$-norm and GAN-based priors corroborate our theoretical results.",

          "description": "Recent studies in multi-agent communicative reinforcement learning (MACRL)\ndemonstrate that multi-agent coordination can be significantly improved when\ncommunication between agents is allowed. Meanwhile, advances in adversarial\nmachine learning (ML) have shown that ML and reinforcement learning (RL) models\nare vulnerable to a variety of attacks that significantly degrade the\nperformance of learned behaviours. However, despite the obvious and growing\nimportance, the combination of adversarial ML and MACRL remains largely\nuninvestigated. In this paper, we make the first step towards conducting\nmessage attacks on MACRL methods. In our formulation, one agent in the\ncooperating group is taken over by an adversary and can send malicious messages\nto disrupt a deployed MACRL-based coordinated strategy during the deployment\nphase. We further our study by developing a defence method via message\nreconstruction. Finally, we address the resulting arms race, i.e., we consider\nthe ability of the malicious agent to adapt to the changing and improving\ndefensive communicative policies of the benign agents. Specifically, we model\nthe adversarial MACRL problem as a two-player zero-sum game and then utilize\nPolicy-Space Response Oracle to achieve communication robustness. Empirically,\nwe demonstrate that MACRL methods are vulnerable to message attacks while our\ndefence method the game-theoretic framework can effectively improve the\nrobustness of MACRL.",

In this\nwork, we demonstrate that convolutional neural network (CNN) can learn from the\ncoefficients of local reduced density matrices to estimate the physical\nparameters of the many-body Hamiltonians, such as coupling strengths and\nmagnetic fields, provided the states as the ground states. We propose QubismNet\nthat consists of two main parts: the Qubism map that visualizes the ground\nstates (or the purified reduced density matrices) as images, and a CNN that\nmaps the images to the target physical parameters. By assuming certain\nconstraints on the training set for the sake of balance, QubismNet exhibits\nimpressive powers of learning and generalization on several quantum spin\nmodels. While the training samples are restricted to the states from certain\nranges of the parameters, QubismNet can accurately estimate the parameters of\nthe states beyond such training regions. For instance, our results show that\nQubismNet can estimate the magnetic fields near the critical point by learning\nfrom the states away from the critical vicinity.

          "description": "The stochastic nature of photovoltaic (PV) power has led both academia and\nindustry to a large amount of research work aiming at the development of\naccurate PV power forecasting models. However, most of those models are based\non machine learning algorithms and are considered as black boxes which do not\nprovide any insight or explanation about their predictions. Therefore, their\ndirect implementation in environments, where transparency is required, and the\ntrust associated with their predictions may be questioned. To this end, we\npropose a two stage probabilistic forecasting framework able to generate highly\naccurate, reliable, and sharp forecasts yet offering full transparency on both\nthe point forecasts and the prediction intervals (PIs). In the first stage, we\nexploit natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) for yielding probabilistic\nforecasts while in the second stage, we calculate the Shapley additive\nexplanation (SHAP) values in order to fully understand why a prediction was\nmade. To highlight the performance and the applicability of the proposed\nframework, real data from two PV parks located in Southern Germany are\nemployed. Initially, the natural gradient boosting is thoroughly compared with\ntwo state-of-the-art algorithms, namely Gaussian process and lower upper bound\nestimation, in a wide range of forecasting metrics. Secondly, a detailed\nanalysis of the model's complex nonlinear relationships and interaction effects\nbetween the various features is presented. The latter allows us to interpret\nthe model, identify some learned physical properties, explain individual\npredictions, reduce the computational requirements for the training without\njeopardizing the model accuracy, detect possible bugs, and gain trust in the\nmodel. Finally, we conclude that the model was able to develop nonlinear\nrelationships following human logic and intuition based on learned physical\nproperties.",

As the Internet of Things (IoT)\nevolves towards a more transient and opportunistic execution paradigm, reducing\nenergy storage costs will be key for its economic and ecologic viability.\nHowever, decreasing energy storage in harvesting systems introduces reliability\nissues. Transducers only produce intermittent energy at low voltage and current\nlevels, making guaranteed task completion a challenge. Existing ad hoc methods\novercome this by buffering enough energy either for single tasks, incurring\nlarge data-retention overheads, or for one full application cycle, requiring a\nlarge energy buffer. We present Julienning: an automated method for optimizing\nthe total energy cost of batteryless applications. Using a custom specification\nmodel, developers can describe transient applications as a set of atomically\nexecuted kernels with explicit data dependencies. Our optimization flow can\npartition data- and energy-intensive applications into multiple execution\ncycles with bounded energy consumption. By leveraging interkernel data\ndependencies, these energy-bounded execution cycles minimize the number of\nsystem activations and nonvolatile data transfers, and thus the total energy\noverhead. We validate our methodology with two batteryless cameras running\nenergy-intensive machine learning applications.

The ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) Kaggle competition\nwas the largest building energy meter machine learning competition ever held\nwith 4,370 participants who submitted 39,403 predictions. The test data set\nincluded two years of hourly electricity, hot water, chilled water, and steam\nreadings from 2,380 meters in 1,448 buildings at 16 locations.

This analysis reveals the\nlimitations for machine learning using the standard model inputs of historical\nmeter, weather, and basic building metadata. The types of error are classified\naccording to the amount of time errors occur in each instance, abrupt versus\ngradual behavior, the magnitude of error, and whether the error existed on\nsingle buildings or several buildings at once from a single location. The\nresults show machine learning models have errors within a range of\nacceptability on 79.1% of the test data. Lower magnitude model errors occur in\n16.1% of the test data. These discrepancies can likely be addressed through\nadditional training data sources or innovations in machine learning.

          "description": "Training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a strict Lipschitz\nconstraint under the l_{2} norm is useful for provable adversarial robustness,\ninterpretable gradients and stable training. While 1-Lipschitz CNNs can be\ndesigned by enforcing a 1-Lipschitz constraint on each layer, training such\nnetworks requires each layer to have an orthogonal Jacobian matrix (for all\ninputs) to prevent gradients from vanishing during backpropagation. A layer\nwith this property is said to be Gradient Norm Preserving (GNP). To construct\nexpressive GNP activation functions, we first prove that the Jacobian of any\nGNP piecewise linear function is only allowed to change via Householder\ntransformations for the function to be continuous. Building on this result, we\nintroduce a class of nonlinear GNP activations with learnable Householder\ntransformations called Householder activations. A householder activation\nparameterized by the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ outputs $(\\mathbf{I} -\n2\\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{v}^{T})\\mathbf{z}$ for its input $\\mathbf{z}$ if\n$\\mathbf{v}^{T}\\mathbf{z} \\leq 0$; otherwise it outputs $\\mathbf{z}$. Existing\nGNP activations such as $\\mathrm{MaxMin}$ can be viewed as special cases of\n$\\mathrm{HH}$ activations for certain settings of these transformations. Thus,\nnetworks with $\\mathrm{HH}$ activations have higher expressive power than those\nwith $\\mathrm{MaxMin}$ activations. Although networks with $\\mathrm{HH}$\nactivations have nontrivial provable robustness against adversarial attacks, we\nfurther boost their robustness by (i) introducing a certificate regularization\nand (ii) relaxing orthogonalization of the last layer of the network. Our\nexperiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our regularized networks with\n$\\mathrm{HH}$ activations lead to significant improvements in both the standard\nand provable robust accuracy over the prior works (gain of 3.65\\% and 4.46\\% on\nCIFAR-100 respectively).",

          "description": "Nowadays many financial derivatives, such as American or Bermudan options,\nare of early exercise type. Often the pricing of early exercise options gives\nrise to high-dimensional optimal stopping problems, since the dimension\ncorresponds to the number of underlying assets. High-dimensional optimal\nstopping problems are, however, notoriously difficult to solve due to the\nwell-known curse of dimensionality. In this work, we propose an algorithm for\nsolving such problems, which is based on deep learning and computes, in the\ncontext of early exercise option pricing, both approximations of an optimal\nexercise strategy and the price of the considered option. The proposed\nalgorithm can also be applied to optimal stopping problems that arise in other\nareas where the underlying stochastic process can be efficiently simulated. We\npresent numerical results for a large number of example problems, which include\nthe pricing of many high-dimensional American and Bermudan options, such as\nBermudan max-call options in up to 5000 dimensions. Most of the obtained\nresults are compared to reference values computed by exploiting the specific\nproblem design or, where available, to reference values from the literature.\nThese numerical results suggest that the proposed algorithm is highly effective\nin the case of many underlyings, in terms of both accuracy and speed.",

The recently\nproposed Swarm Learning (SL) provides a decentralized machine-learning approach\nuniting edge computing and blockchain-based coordination without the need for a\ncentral coordinator. This paper proposes a Swarm-Federated Deep Learning\nframework in the IoV system (IoV-SFDL) that integrates SL into the FDL\nframework. The IoV-SFDL organizes vehicles to generate local SL models with\nadjacent vehicles based on the blockchain empowered SL, then aggregates the\nglobal FDL model among different SL groups with a proposed credibility weights\nprediction algorithm. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared\nwith the baseline frameworks, the proposed IoV-SFDL framework achieves a 16.72%\nreduction in edge-to-global communication overhead while improving about 5.02%\nin model performance with the same training iterations.",

Our first contribution is to\nformalize the problem in various settings and to explicitly model subtle\naspects such as the proper or improper nature of the learning, learner's\nrandomness, and whether (or not) adversary's attack can depend on it. Our main\nresult shows that when the budget of the adversary scales sublinearly with the\nsample complexity, (improper) PAC learnability and certification are\nachievable; in contrast, when the adversary's budget grows linearly with the\nsample complexity, the adversary can potentially drive up the expected 0-1 loss\nto one. We also study distribution-specific PAC learning in the same attack\nmodel and show that proper learning with certification is possible for learning\nhalf spaces under natural distributions. Finally, we empirically study the\nrobustness of K nearest neighbour, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron,\nand convolutional neural network on real data sets against targeted-poisoning\nattacks. Our experimental results show that many models, especially\nstate-of-the-art neural networks, are indeed vulnerable to these strong\nattacks.

          "description": "Using simulation to predict the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous\nmaterials has applications ranging from topology optimization to multi-scale\nstructural analysis. However, full-fidelity simulation techniques such as\nFinite Element Analysis can be prohibitively computationally expensive when\nthey are used to explore the massive input parameter space of heterogeneous\nmaterials. Therefore, there has been significant recent interest in machine\nlearning-based models that, once trained, can predict mechanical behavior at a\nfraction of the computational cost. Over the past several years, research in\nthis area has been focused mainly on predicting single Quantities of Interest\n(QoIs). However, there has recently been an increased interest in a more\nchallenging problem: predicting full-field QoI (e.g., displacement/strain\nfields, damage fields) for mechanical problems. Due to the added complexity of\nfull-field information, network architectures that perform well on single QoI\nproblems may perform poorly in the full-field QoI problem setting. The work\npresented in this paper is twofold. First, we made a significant extension to\nthe Mechanical MNIST dataset designed to enable the investigation of full field\nQoI prediction. Specifically, we added Finite Element simulation results of\nquasi-static brittle fracture in a heterogeneous material captured with the\nphase-field method. Second, we established strong baseline performance for\npredicting full-field QoI with MultiRes-WNet architecture. In addition to\npresenting the results in this paper, we have released our model implementation\nand the Mechanical MNIST Crack Path dataset under open-source licenses. We\nanticipate that future researchers will directly use our model architecture on\nrelated datasets and potentially design models that exceed the baseline\nperformance for predicting full-field QoI established in this paper.",

          "description": "Scientific machine learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems\nand PDE discoveries in computational physics. One caveat of current methods\nhowever is the need for large amounts of (clean) data in order to recover full\nsystem responses or underlying physical models. Bayesian methods may be\nparticularly promising to overcome these challenges as they are naturally less\nsensitive to sparse and noisy data. In this paper, we propose to use Bayesian\nneural networks (BNN) in order to: 1) Recover the full system states from\nmeasurement data (e.g. temperature, velocity field, etc.). We use Hamiltonian\nMonte-Carlo to sample the posterior distribution of a deep and dense BNN, and\nshow that it is possible to accurately capture physics of varying complexity\nwithout overfitting. 2) Recover the parameters in the underlying partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) governing the physical system. Using the trained\nBNN as a surrogate of the system response, we generate datasets of derivatives\npotentially comprising the latent PDE of the observed system and perform a\nBayesian linear regression (BLR) between the successive derivatives in space\nand time to recover the original PDE parameters. We take advantage of the\nconfidence intervals on the BNN outputs and introduce the spatial derivative\nvariance into the BLR likelihood to discard the influence of highly uncertain\nsurrogate data points, which allows for more accurate parameter discovery. We\ndemonstrate our approach on a handful of example applied to physics and\nnon-linear dynamics.",

However,\nit remains challenging to acquire novel classes in an online fashion for the\nsegmentation task, mainly due to its continuously-evolving semantic label\nspace, partial pixelwise ground-truth annotations, and constrained data\navailability. To ad- dress this, we propose an incremental learning strategy\nthat can fast adapt deep segmentation models without catastrophic forgetting,\nusing a streaming input data with pixel annotations on the novel classes only.\nTo this end, we develop a uni ed learning strategy based on the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) framework, which integrates an iterative\nrelabeling strategy that lls in the missing labels and a rehearsal-based\nincremental learning step that balances the stability-plasticity of the model.\nMoreover, our EM algorithm adopts an adaptive sampling method to select\ninformative train- ing data and a class-balancing training strategy in the\nincremental model updates, both improving the e cacy of model learning. We\nvalidate our approach on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, and the\nresults demonstrate its superior performance over the existing incremental\nmethods.",

For classification, the outputs of these learners are typically\ncombined by majority voting, which often represents the bottleneck of a\nhardware accelerator for ensemble inference. In this work, we present a novel\narchitecture that allows obtaining a majority decision in a number of clock\ncycles that is logarithmic in the number of inputs.

          "description": "In the current deep learning based recommendation system, the embedding\nmethod is generally employed to complete the conversion from the\nhigh-dimensional sparse feature vector to the low-dimensional dense feature\nvector. However, as the dimension of the input vector of the embedding layer is\ntoo large, the addition of the embedding layer significantly slows down the\nconvergence speed of the entire neural network, which is not acceptable in\nreal-world scenarios. In addition, as the interaction between users and items\nincreases and the relationship between items becomes more complicated, the\nembedding method proposed for sequence data is no longer suitable for graphic\ndata in the current real environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the\nDual-modal Graph Embedding Method (DGEM) to solve these problems. DGEM includes\ntwo modes, static and dynamic. We first construct the item graph to extract the\ngraph structure and use random walk of unequal probability to capture the\nhigh-order proximity between the items. Then we generate the graph embedding\nvector through the Skip-Gram model, and finally feed the downstream deep neural\nnetwork for the recommendation task. The experimental results show that DGEM\ncan mine the high-order proximity between items and enhance the expression\nability of the recommendation model.

          "description": "Tuning the hyperparameters in the differentially private stochastic gradient\ndescent (DPSGD) is a fundamental challenge. Unlike the typical SGD, private\ndatasets cannot be used many times for hyperparameter search in DPSGD; e.g.,\nvia a grid search. Therefore, there is an essential need for algorithms that,\nwithin a given search space, can find near-optimal hyperparameters for the best\nachievable privacy-utility tradeoffs efficiently. We formulate this problem\ninto a general optimization framework for establishing a desirable\nprivacy-utility tradeoff, and systematically study three cost-effective\nalgorithms for being used in the proposed framework: evolutionary, Bayesian,\nand reinforcement learning. Our experiments, for hyperparameter tuning in DPSGD\nconducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, show that these three algorithms\nsignificantly outperform the widely used grid search baseline. As this paper\noffers a first-of-a-kind framework for hyperparameter tuning in DPSGD, we\ndiscuss existing challenges and open directions for future studies.

Pathfinder returns draws from the\napproximation with the lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the\ntrue posterior. We evaluate Pathfinder on a wide range of posterior\ndistributions, demonstrating that its approximate draws are better than those\nfrom automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) and comparable to\nthose produced by short chains of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as\nmeasured by 1-Wasserstein distance.

To better understand the challenges\narising from irregular data distribution, in this paper we provide the first\nstudy on the problem of DP-SCO with heavy-tailed data in the high dimensional\nspace. In the first part we focus on the problem over some polytope constraint\n(such as the $\\ell_1$-norm ball). We show that if the loss function is smooth\nand its gradient has bounded second order moment, it is possible to get a (high\nprobability) error bound (excess population risk) of $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{\\log\nd}{(n\\epsilon)^\\frac{1}{3}})$ in the $\\epsilon$-DP model, where $n$ is the\nsample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the underlying space. Next, for\nLASSO, if the data distribution that has bounded fourth-order moments, we\nimprove the bound to $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{\\log d}{(n\\epsilon)^\\frac{2}{5}})$ in the\n$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP model. In the second part of the paper, we study sparse\nlearning with heavy-tailed data. We first revisit the sparse linear model and\npropose a truncated DP-IHT method whose output could achieve an error of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{s^{*2}\\log d}{n\\epsilon})$, where $s^*$ is the sparsity of the\nunderlying parameter. Then we study a more general problem over the sparsity\n({\\em i.e.,} $\\ell_0$-norm) constraint, and show that it is possible to achieve\nan error of $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{s^{*\\frac{3}{2}}\\log d}{n\\epsilon})$, which is\nalso near optimal up to a factor of $\\tilde{O}{(\\sqrt{s^*})}$, if the loss\nfunction is smooth and strongly convex.",

          "description": "The activation function is at the heart of a deep neural networks\nnonlinearity; the choice of the function has great impact on the success of\ntraining. Currently, many practitioners prefer the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)\ndue to its simplicity and reliability, despite its few drawbacks. While most\nprevious functions proposed to supplant ReLU have been hand-designed, recent\nwork on learning the function during training has shown promising results. In\nthis paper we propose an adaptive piecewise linear activation function, the\nPiecewise Linear Unit (PiLU), which can be learned independently for each\ndimension of the neural network. We demonstrate how PiLU is a generalised\nrectifier unit and note its similarities with the Adaptive Piecewise Linear\nUnits, namely adaptive and piecewise linear. Across a distribution of 30\nexperiments, we show that for the same model architecture, hyperparameters, and\npre-processing, PiLU significantly outperforms ReLU: reducing classification\nerror by 18.53% on CIFAR-10 and 13.13% on CIFAR-100, for a minor increase in\nthe number of neurons. Further work should be dedicated to exploring\ngeneralised piecewise linear units, as well as verifying these results across\nother challenging domains and larger problems.",

          "description": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are formulated as minimax game\nproblems, whereby generators attempt to approach real data distributions by\nvirtue of adversarial learning against discriminators. The intrinsic problem\ncomplexity poses the challenge to enhance the performance of generative\nnetworks. In this work, we aim to boost model learning from the perspective of\nnetwork architectures, by incorporating recent progress on automated\narchitecture search into GANs. To this end, we propose a fully differentiable\nsearch framework for generative adversarial networks, dubbed alphaGAN. The\nsearching process is formalized as solving a bi-level minimax optimization\nproblem, in which the outer-level objective aims for seeking a suitable network\narchitecture towards pure Nash Equilibrium conditioned on the generator and the\ndiscriminator network parameters optimized with a traditional GAN loss in the\ninner level. The entire optimization performs a first-order method by\nalternately minimizing the two-level objective in a fully differentiable\nmanner, enabling architecture search to be completed in an enormous search\nspace. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets show that our\nalgorithm can obtain high-performing architectures only with 3-GPU hours on a\nsingle GPU in the search space comprised of approximate 2 ? 1011 possible\nconfigurations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis on the behavior of the\nsearching process and the properties of searched architectures, which would\nbenefit further research on architectures for generative models.

Feature similarity includes both the\ninvariance of marginal distributions and the closeness of conditional\ndistributions given the desired response $y$ (e.g., class labels).\nUnfortunately, traditional methods always learn such features without fully\ntaking into consideration the information in $y$, which in turn may lead to a\nmismatch of the conditional distributions or the mix-up of discriminative\nstructures underlying data distributions. In this work, we introduce the\nrecently proposed von Neumann conditional divergence to improve the\ntransferability across multiple domains. We show that this new divergence is\ndifferentiable and eligible to easily quantify the functional dependence\nbetween features and $y$. Given multiple source tasks, we integrate this\ndivergence to capture discriminative information in $y$ and design novel\nlearning objectives assuming those source tasks are observed either\nsimultaneously or sequentially. In both scenarios, we obtain favorable\nperformance against state-of-the-art methods in terms of smaller generalization\nerror on new tasks and less catastrophic forgetting on source tasks (in the\nsequential setup).",

In particular, Forests dominate\nother methods in tabular data, that is, when the feature space is unstructured,\nso that the signal is invariant to a permutation of the feature indices.\nHowever, in structured data lying on a manifold (such as images, text, and\nspeech) deep networks (Networks), specifically convolutional deep networks\n(ConvNets), tend to outperform Forests. We conjecture that at least part of the\nreason for this is that the input to Networks is not simply the feature\nmagnitudes, but also their indices. In contrast, naive Forest implementations\nfail to explicitly consider feature indices. A recently proposed Forest\napproach demonstrates that Forests, for each node, implicitly sample a random\nmatrix from some specific distribution. These Forests, like some classes of\nNetworks, learn by partitioning the feature space into convex polytopes\ncorresponding to linear functions. We build on that approach and show that one\ncan choose distributions in a manifold-aware fashion to incorporate feature\nlocality. We demonstrate the empirical performance on data whose features live\non three different manifolds: a torus, images, and time-series. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate its strength in multivariate simulated settings and also show\nsuperiority in predicting surgical outcome in epilepsy patients and predicting\nmovement direction from raw stereotactic EEG data from non-motor brain regions.\nIn all simulations and real data, Manifold Oblique Random Forest (MORF)\nalgorithm outperforms approaches that ignore feature space structure and\nchallenges the performance of ConvNets.

          "description": "Background: Accurate diagnosis of skull base tumors is essential for\nproviding personalized surgical treatment strategies. Intraoperative diagnosis\ncan be challenging due to tumor diversity and lack of intraoperative pathology\nresources.\n\nObjective: To develop an independent and parallel intraoperative pathology\nworkflow that can provide rapid and accurate skull base tumor diagnoses using\nlabel-free optical imaging and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMethod: We used a fiber laser-based, label-free, non-consumptive,\nhigh-resolution microscopy method ($<$ 60 sec per 1 $\\times$ 1 mm$^\\text{2}$),\ncalled stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a consecutive, multicenter\ncohort of skull base tumor patients. SRH images were then used to train a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) model using three representation learning\nstrategies: cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised\ncontrastive learning. Our trained CNN models were tested on a held-out,\nmulticenter SRH dataset.\n\nResults: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of both benign and\nmalignant skull base tumors. Of the three representation learning strategies,\nsupervised contrastive learning most effectively learned the distinctive and\ndiagnostic SRH image features for each of the skull base tumor types. In our\nmulticenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy\nof 91.5%, self-supervised contrastive learning 83.9%, and supervised\ncontrastive learning 96.6%. Our trained model was able to identify tumor-normal\nmargins and detect regions of microscopic tumor infiltration in whole-slide SRH\nimages.\n\nConclusion: SRH with AI models trained using contrastive representation\nlearning can provide rapid and accurate intraoperative diagnosis of skull base\ntumors.",

          "description": "We study several simplified dark matter (DM) models and their signatures at\nthe LHC using neural networks. We focus on the usual monojet plus missing\ntransverse energy channel, but to train the algorithms we organize the data in\n2D histograms instead of event-by-event arrays. This results in a large\nperformance boost to distinguish between standard model (SM) only and SM plus\nnew physics signals. We use the kinematic monojet features as input data which\nallow us to describe families of models with a single data sample. We found\nthat the neural network performance does not depend on the simulated number of\nbackground events if they are presented as a function of $S/\\sqrt{B}$, where\n$S$ and $B$ are the number of signal and background events per histogram,\nrespectively. This provides flexibility to the method, since testing a\nparticular model in that case only requires knowing the new physics monojet\ncross section. Furthermore, we also discuss the network performance under\nincorrect assumptions about the true DM nature. Finally, we propose multimodel\nclassifiers to search and identify new signals in a more general way, for the\nnext LHC run.",

          "description": "Forecast evaluation plays a key role in how empirical evidence shapes the\ndevelopment of the discipline. Domain experts are interested in error measures\nrelevant for their decision making needs. Such measures may produce unreliable\nresults. Although reliability properties of several metrics have already been\ndiscussed, it has hardly been quantified in an objective way. We propose a\nmeasure named Rank Stability, which evaluates how much the rankings of an\nexperiment differ in between similar datasets, when the models and errors are\nconstant. We use this to study the evaluation setup of the M5. We find that the\nevaluation setup of the M5 is less reliable than other measures. The main\ndrivers of instability are hierarchical aggregation and scaling.\nPrice-weighting reduces the stability of all tested error measures. Scale\nnormalization of the M5 error measure results in less stability than other\nscale-free errors. Hierarchical levels taken separately are less stable with\nmore aggregation, and their combination is even less stable than individual\nlevels. We also show positive tradeoffs of retaining aggregation importance\nwithout affecting stability. Aggregation and stability can be linked to the\ninfluence of much debated magic numbers. Many of our findings can be applied to\ngeneral hierarchical forecast benchmarking.",

          "description": "Quantization is a technique for reducing deep neural networks (DNNs) training\nand inference times, which is crucial for training in resource constrained\nenvironments or time critical inference applications. State-of-the-art (SOTA)\nquantization approaches focus on post-training quantization, i.e. quantization\nof pre-trained DNNs for speeding up inference. Very little work on quantized\ntraining exists, which neither al-lows dynamic intra-epoch precision switches\nnor em-ploys an information theory based switching heuristic. Usually, existing\napproaches require full precision refinement afterwards and enforce a global\nword length across the whole DNN. This leads to suboptimal quantization\nmappings and resource usage. Recognizing these limits, we introduce MARViN, a\nnew quantized training strategy using information theory-based intra-epoch\nprecision switching, which decides on a per-layer basis which precision should\nbe used in order to minimize quantization-induced information loss. Note that\nany quantization must leave enough precision such that future learning steps do\nnot suffer from vanishing gradients.

          "description": "Recent state-of-the-art artificial agents lack the ability to adapt rapidly\nto new tasks, as they are trained exclusively for specific objectives and\nrequire massive amounts of interaction to learn new skills. Meta-reinforcement\nlearning (meta-RL) addresses this challenge by leveraging knowledge learned\nfrom training tasks to perform well in previously unseen tasks. However,\ncurrent meta-RL approaches limit themselves to narrow parametric task\ndistributions, ignoring qualitative differences between tasks that occur in the\nreal world. In this paper, we introduce TIGR, a Task-Inference-based meta-RL\nalgorithm using Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and gated Recurrent units,\ndesigned for tasks in non-parametric environments. We employ a generative model\ninvolving a GMM to capture the multi-modality of the tasks. We decouple the\npolicy training from the task-inference learning and efficiently train the\ninference mechanism on the basis of an unsupervised reconstruction objective.\nWe provide a benchmark with qualitatively distinct tasks based on the\nhalf-cheetah environment and demonstrate the superior performance of TIGR\ncompared to state-of-the-art meta-RL approaches in terms of sample efficiency\n(3-10 times faster), asymptotic performance, and applicability in\nnon-parametric environments with zero-shot adaptation.",

          "description": "Multivariate time series anomaly detection is a very common problem in the\nfield of failure prevention. Fast prevention means lower repair costs and\nlosses. The amount of sensors in novel industry systems makes the anomaly\ndetection process quite difficult for humans. Algorithms which automates the\nprocess of detecting anomalies are crucial in modern failure-prevention\nsystems. Therefore, many machine and deep learning models have been designed to\naddress this problem. Mostly, they are autoencoder-based architectures with\nsome generative adversarial elements. In this work, a framework is shown which\nincorporates neuroevolution methods to boost the anomaly-detection scores of\nnew and already known models. The presented approach adapts evolution\nstrategies for evolving ensemble model, in which every single model works on a\nsubgroup of data sensors. The next goal of neuroevolution is to optimise\narchitecture and hyperparameters like window size, the number of layers, layer\ndepths, etc. The proposed framework shows that it is possible to boost most of\nthe anomaly detection deep learning models in a reasonable time and a fully\nautomated mode. The tests were run on SWAT and WADI datasets. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first approach in which an ensemble deep learning anomaly detection\nmodel is built in a fully automatic way using a neuroevolution strategy.",

Multiple defenses have been proposed to increase the robustness of\nDNNs. In general, these defenses have high overhead, some require\nattack-specific re-training of the model or careful tuning to adapt to\ndifferent attacks.\n\nThis paper presents HASI, a hardware-accelerated defense that uses a process\nwe call stochastic inference to detect adversarial inputs. We show that by\ncarefully injecting noise into the model at inference time, we can\ndifferentiate adversarial inputs from benign ones. HASI uses the output\ndistribution characteristics of noisy inference compared to a non-noisy\nreference to detect adversarial inputs. We show an adversarial detection rate\nof 86% when applied to VGG16 and 93% when applied to ResNet50, which exceeds\nthe detection rate of the state of the art approaches, with a much lower\noverhead.

Thus, it's rarely enough to address an application by formulating a\nmodel, solving the resulting optimization problem and presenting the solution\nas the answer. One would need to confirm that the model is suitable, i.e.,\n\"good,\" and this can, at least in part, be achieved by considering a family of\noptimization problems constructed by perturbing parameters of concern. The\nresulting sensitivity analysis uncovers troubling situations with unstable\nsolutions, which we referred to as \"bad\" models, and indicates better model\nformulations. Embedding an actual problem of interest within a family of\nproblems is also a primary path to optimality conditions as well as\ncomputationally attractive, alternative problems, which under ideal\ncircumstances, and when properly tuned, may even furnish the minimum value of\nthe actual problem. The tuning of these alternative problems turns out to be\nintimately tied to finding multipliers in optimality conditions and thus\nemerges as a main component of several optimization algorithms. In fact, the\ntuning amounts to solving certain dual optimization problems. In this tutorial,\nwe'll discuss the opportunities and insights afforded by this broad\nperspective.",

          "description": "In CS literature, the efforts can be divided into two groups: finding a\nmeasurement matrix that preserves the compressed information at the maximum\nlevel, and finding a reconstruction algorithm for the compressed information.\nIn the traditional CS setup, the measurement matrices are selected as random\nmatrices, and optimization-based iterative solutions are used to recover the\nsignals. However, when we handle large signals, using random matrices become\ncumbersome especially when it comes to iterative optimization-based solutions.\nEven though recent deep learning-based solutions boost the reconstruction\naccuracy performance while speeding up the recovery, still jointly learning the\nwhole measurement matrix is a difficult process. In this work, we introduce a\nseparable multi-linear learning of the CS matrix by representing it as the\nsummation of arbitrary number of tensors. For a special case where the CS\noperation is set as a single tensor multiplication, the model is reduced to the\nlearning-based separable CS; while a dense CS matrix can be approximated and\nlearned as the summation of multiple tensors. Both cases can be used in CS of\ntwo or multi-dimensional signals e.g., images, multi-spectral images, videos,\netc. Structural CS matrices can also be easily approximated and learned in our\nmulti-linear separable learning setup with structural tensor sum\nrepresentation. Hence, our learnable generalized tensor summation CS operation\nencapsulates most CS setups including separable CS, non-separable CS\n(traditional vector-matrix multiplication), structural CS, and CS of the\nmulti-dimensional signals. For both gray-scale and RGB images, the proposed\nscheme surpasses most state-of-the-art solutions, especially in lower\nmeasurement rates. Although the performance gain remains limited from tensor to\nthe sum of tensor representation for gray-scale images, it becomes significant\nin the RGB case.",

          "description": "Active learning (AL) aims at reducing labeling effort by identifying the most\nvaluable unlabeled data points from a large pool. Traditional AL frameworks\nhave two limitations: First, they perform data selection in a multi-round\nmanner, which is time-consuming and impractical. Second, they usually assume\nthat there are a small amount of labeled data points available in the same\ndomain as the data in the unlabeled pool. Recent work proposes a solution for\none-round active learning based on data utility learning and optimization,\nwhich fixes the first issue but still requires the initially labeled data\npoints in the same domain. In this paper, we propose $\\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ as a\nsolution that solves both issues. Specifically, $\\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ leverages the\nidea of domain adaptation (DA) to train a data utility model which can\neffectively predict the utility for any given unlabeled data in the target\ndomain once labeled. The trained data utility model can then be used to select\nhigh-utility data and at the same time, provide an estimate for the utility of\nthe selected data. Our algorithm does not rely on any feedback from annotators\nin the target domain and hence, can be used to perform zero-round active\nlearning or warm-start existing multi-round active learning strategies. Our\nexperiments show that $\\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ outperforms the existing\nstate-of-the-art AL strategies equipped with domain adaptation over various\ndomain shift settings (e.g., real-to-real data and synthetic-to-real data).\nParticularly, $\\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ is applicable to the scenario where source and\ntarget labels have mismatches, which is not supported by the existing works.",

          "description": "The goal of representation learning is different from the ultimate objective\nof machine learning such as decision making, it is therefore very difficult to\nestablish clear and direct objectives for training representation learning\nmodels. It has been argued that a good representation should disentangle the\nunderlying variation factors, yet how to translate this into training\nobjectives remains unknown. This paper presents an attempt to establish direct\ntraining criterions and design principles for developing good representation\nlearning models. We propose that a good representation learning model should be\nmaximally expressive, i.e., capable of distinguishing the maximum number of\ninput configurations. We formally define expressiveness and introduce the\nmaximum expressiveness (MEXS) theorem of a general learning model. We propose\nto train a model by maximizing its expressiveness while at the same time\nincorporating general priors such as model smoothness. We present a conscience\ncompetitive learning algorithm which encourages the model to reach its MEXS\nwhilst at the same time adheres to model smoothness prior. We also introduce a\nlabel consistent training (LCT) technique to boost model smoothness by\nencouraging it to assign consistent labels to similar samples. We present\nextensive experimental results to show that our method can indeed design\nrepresentation learning models capable of developing representations that are\nas good as or better than state of the art. We also show that our technique is\ncomputationally efficient, robust against different parameter settings and can\nwork effectively on a variety of datasets.

Therefore, the information present in a speech such\nas message, emotion, language, speaker is due to the combined effect of both\nexcitation source and vocal tract system. However, there is very less\nutilization of excitation source features to recognize emotion. In our earlier\nwork, we have proposed a novel method to extract glottal closure instants\n(GCIs) known as epochs. In this paper, we have explored epoch features namely\ninstantaneous pitch, phase and strength of epochs for discriminating emotions.\nWe have combined the excitation source features and the well known\nMale-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features to develop an emotion\nrecognition system with improved performance. DNN-HMM speaker adaptive models\nhave been developed using MFCC, epoch and combined features. IEMOCAP emotional\ndatabase has been used to evaluate the models. The average accuracy for emotion\nrecognition system when using MFCC and epoch features separately is 59.25% and\n54.52% respectively.

The Fisheries and Aquatic Department (FAD) of\nthe United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) issued a report\nwhich indicated that the annual losses due to IUU fishing reached $25 Billion.\nThis imposes negative impacts on the future-biodiversity of the marine\necosystem and domestic Gross National Product (GNP). Hence, robust interception\nmechanisms are increasingly needed for detecting and pursuing the unrelenting\nillegal fishing incidents in maritime territories. This article addresses the\nproblem of coordinating the motion of a fleet of marine vessels (pursuers) to\ncatch an IUU vessel while still in local waters. The problem is formulated as a\npursuer-evader problem that is tackled within an ML framework. One or more\npursuers, such as law enforcement vessels, intercept an evader (i.e., the\nillegal fishing ship) using an online reinforcement learning mechanism that is\nbased on a value iteration process. It employs real-time navigation\nmeasurements of the evader ship as well as those of the pursuing vessels and\nreturns back model-free interception strategies.",

We analyze the decoding error both\nin the random and adversarial straggler setting, when optimal decoding\ncoefficients are used. We show that in the random setting, our schemes achieve\nan error to the gradient that decays exponentially in the replication factor.\nIn the adversarial setting, the error is nearly a factor of two smaller than\nany existing code with similar performance in the random setting. We show\nconvergence bounds both in the random and adversarial setting for gradient\ndescent under standard assumptions using our codes. In the random setting, our\nconvergence rate improves upon block-box bounds. In the adversarial setting, we\nshow that gradient descent can converge down to a noise floor that scales\nlinearly with the adversarial error to the gradient. We demonstrate empirically\nthat our schemes achieve near-optimal error in the random setting and converge\nfaster than algorithms which do not use the optimal decoding coefficients.",

          "description": "Random reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) digital rocks from\ntwo-dimensional (2D) slices is crucial for elucidating the microstructure of\nrocks and its effects on pore-scale flow in terms of numerical modeling, since\nmassive samples are usually required to handle intrinsic uncertainties. Despite\nremarkable advances achieved by traditional process-based methods, statistical\napproaches and recently famous deep learning-based models, few works have\nfocused on producing several kinds of rocks with one trained model and allowing\nthe reconstructed samples to satisfy certain given properties, such as\nporosity. To fill this gap, we propose a new framework, named RockGPT, which is\ncomposed of VQ-VAE and conditional GPT, to synthesize 3D samples based on a\nsingle 2D slice from the perspective of video generation. The VQ-VAE is\nutilized to compress high-dimensional input video, i.e., the sequence of\ncontinuous rock slices, to discrete latent codes and reconstruct them. In order\nto obtain diverse reconstructions, the discrete latent codes are modeled using\nconditional GPT in an autoregressive manner, while incorporating conditional\ninformation from a given slice, rock type, and porosity. We conduct two\nexperiments on five kinds of rocks, and the results demonstrate that RockGPT\ncan produce different kinds of rocks with the same model, and the reconstructed\nsamples can successfully meet certain specified porosities. In a broader sense,\nthrough leveraging the proposed conditioning scheme, RockGPT constitutes an\neffective way to build a general model to produce multiple kinds of rocks\nsimultaneously that also satisfy user-defined properties.",

Most of these ML techniques employ\ncentralized learning (CL) schemes and assume the availability of datasets at a\nparameter server (PS), demanding the transmission of data from edge devices,\nsuch as mobile phones, to the PS. Exploiting the data generated at the edge,\nfederated learning (FL) has been proposed recently as a distributed learning\nscheme, in which each device computes the model parameters and sends them to\nthe PS for model aggregation while the datasets are kept intact at the edge.\nThus, FL is more communication-efficient and privacy-preserving than CL and\napplicable to the wireless communication scenarios, wherein the data are\ngenerated at the edge devices. This article presents the recent advances in\nFL-based training for physical layer design problems.

          "description": "Adversarial robustness of deep learning models has gained much traction in\nthe last few years. Various attacks and defenses are proposed to improve the\nadversarial robustness of modern-day deep learning architectures. While all\nthese approaches help improve the robustness, one promising direction for\nimproving adversarial robustness is un-explored, i.e., the complex topology of\nthe neural network architecture. In this work, we answer the following\nquestion: \"Can the complex topology of a neural network give adversarial\nrobustness without any form of adversarial training?\" empirically by\nexperimenting with different hand-crafted and NAS based architectures. Our\nfindings show that, for small-scale attacks, NAS-based architectures are more\nrobust for small-scale datasets and simple tasks than hand-crafted\narchitectures. However, as the dataset's size or the task's complexity\nincrease, hand-crafted architectures are more robust than NAS-based\narchitectures. We perform the first large scale study to understand adversarial\nrobustness purely from an architectural perspective. Our results show that\nrandom sampling in the search space of DARTS (a popular NAS method) with simple\nensembling can improve the robustness to PGD attack by nearly ~12\\%. We show\nthat NAS, which is popular for SoTA accuracy, can provide adversarial accuracy\nas a free add-on without any form of adversarial training. Our results show\nthat leveraging the power of neural network topology with methods like\nensembles can be an excellent way to achieve adversarial robustness without any\nform of adversarial training. We also introduce a metric that can be used to\ncalculate the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness.",

          "description": "Leveraging weak or noisy supervision for building effective machine learning\nmodels has long been an important research problem. Its importance has further\nincreased recently due to the growing need for large-scale datasets to train\ndeep learning models. Weak or noisy supervision could originate from multiple\nsources including non-expert annotators or automatic labeling based on\nheuristics or user interaction signals. There is an extensive amount of\nprevious work focusing on leveraging noisy labels. Most notably, recent work\nhas shown impressive gains by using a meta-learned instance re-weighting\napproach where a meta-learning framework is used to assign instance weights to\nnoisy labels. In this paper, we extend this approach via posing the problem as\nlabel correction problem within a meta-learning framework. We view the label\ncorrection procedure as a meta-process and propose a new meta-learning based\nframework termed MLC (Meta Label Correction) for learning with noisy labels.\nSpecifically, a label correction network is adopted as a meta-model to produce\ncorrected labels for noisy labels while the main model is trained to leverage\nthe corrected labeled. Both models are jointly trained by solving a bi-level\noptimization problem. We run extensive experiments with different label noise\nlevels and types on both image recognition and text classification tasks. We\ncompare the reweighing and correction approaches showing that the correction\nframing addresses some of the limitation of reweighting. We also show that the\nproposed MLC approach achieves large improvements over previous methods in many\nsettings.",

          "description": "This survey is meant to provide an introduction to linear models and the\ntheories behind them. Our goal is to give a rigorous introduction to the\nreaders with prior exposure to ordinary least squares. In machine learning, the\noutput is usually a nonlinear function of the input. Deep learning even aims to\nfind a nonlinear dependence with many layers which require a large amount of\ncomputation. However, most of these algorithms build upon simple linear models.\nWe then describe linear models from different views and find the properties and\ntheories behind the models. The linear model is the main technique in\nregression problems and the primary tool for it is the least squares\napproximation which minimizes a sum of squared errors. This is a natural choice\nwhen we're interested in finding the regression function which minimizes the\ncorresponding expected squared error. This survey is primarily a summary of\npurpose, significance of important theories behind linear models, e.g.,\ndistribution theory, minimum variance estimator. We first describe ordinary\nleast squares from three different points of view upon which we disturb the\nmodel with random noise and Gaussian noise. By Gaussian noise, the model gives\nrise to the likelihood so that we introduce a maximum likelihood estimator. It\nalso develops some distribution theories via this Gaussian disturbance. The\ndistribution theory of least squares will help us answer various questions and\nintroduce related applications. We then prove least squares is the best\nunbiased linear model in the sense of mean squared error and most importantly,\nit actually approaches the theoretical limit. We end up with linear models with\nthe Bayesian approach and beyond.",

          "description": "Covid-19 detection at an early stage can aid in an effective treatment and\nisolation plan to prevent its spread. Recently, transfer learning has been used\nfor Covid-19 detection using X-ray, ultrasound, and CT scans. One of the major\nlimitations inherent to these proposed methods is limited labeled dataset size\nthat affects the reliability of Covid-19 diagnosis and disease progression. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that how we can augment limited X-ray images data by\nusing Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to train the\nlast layer of the pre-trained deep learning models to mitigate the bias of\ntransfer learning for Covid-19 detection. We transfer learned various\npre-trained deep learning models including AlexNet, ZFNet, VGG-16, ResNet-18,\nand GoogLeNet, and fine-tune the last layer by using CLAHE-augmented dataset.\nThe experiment results reveal that the CLAHE-based augmentation to various\npre-trained deep learning models significantly improves the model efficiency.\nThe pre-trained VCG-16 model with CLAHEbased augmented images achieves a\nsensitivity of 95% using 15 epochs. AlexNet works show good sensitivity when\ntrained on non-augmented data. Other models demonstrate a value of less than\n60% when trained on non-augmented data. Our results reveal that the sample bias\ncan negatively impact the performance of transfer learning which is\nsignificantly improved by using CLAHE-based augmentation.",

          "description": "Recent works in self-supervised learning have advanced the state-of-the-art\nby relying on the contrastive learning paradigm, which learns representations\nby pushing positive pairs, or similar examples from the same class, closer\ntogether while keeping negative pairs far apart. Despite the empirical\nsuccesses, theoretical foundations are limited -- prior analyses assume\nconditional independence of the positive pairs given the same class label, but\nrecent empirical applications use heavily correlated positive pairs (i.e., data\naugmentations of the same image). Our work analyzes contrastive learning\nwithout assuming conditional independence of positive pairs using a novel\nconcept of the augmentation graph on data. Edges in this graph connect\naugmentations of the same data, and ground-truth classes naturally form\nconnected sub-graphs. We propose a loss that performs spectral decomposition on\nthe population augmentation graph and can be succinctly written as a\ncontrastive learning objective on neural net representations. Minimizing this\nobjective leads to features with provable accuracy guarantees under linear\nprobe evaluation. By standard generalization bounds, these accuracy guarantees\nalso hold when minimizing the training contrastive loss. Empirically, the\nfeatures learned by our objective can match or outperform several strong\nbaselines on benchmark vision datasets. In all, this work provides the first\nprovable analysis for contrastive learning where guarantees for linear probe\nevaluation can apply to realistic empirical settings.",

          "description": "Node embedding learns a low-dimensional representation for each node in the\ngraph. Recent progress on node embedding shows that proximity matrix\nfactorization methods gain superb performance and scale to large graphs with\nmillions of nodes. Existing approaches first define a proximity matrix and then\nlearn the embeddings that fit the proximity by matrix factorization. Most\nexisting matrix factorization methods adopt the same proximity for different\ntasks, while it is observed that different tasks and datasets may require\ndifferent proximity, limiting their representation power.\n\nMotivated by this, we propose {\\em Lemane}, a framework with trainable\nproximity measures, which can be learned to best suit the datasets and tasks at\nhand automatically. Our method is end-to-end, which incorporates differentiable\nSVD in the pipeline so that the parameters can be trained via backpropagation.\nHowever, this learning process is still expensive on large graphs. To improve\nthe scalability, we train proximity measures only on carefully subsampled\ngraphs, and then apply standard proximity matrix factorization on the original\ngraph using the learned proximity. Note that, computing the learned proximities\nfor each pair is still expensive for large graphs, and existing techniques for\ncomputing proximities are not applicable to the learned proximities. Thus, we\npresent generalized push techniques to make our solution scalable to large\ngraphs with millions of nodes. Extensive experiments show that our proposed\nsolution outperforms existing solutions on both link prediction and node\nclassification tasks on almost all datasets.",

Post-processing and refining\nthe results of segmentation is a common practice to decrease the\nmisclassifications originating from the segmentation network. In addition to\nwidely used methods like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) which focus on the\nstructure of the segmented volume/area, a graph-based recent approach makes use\nof certain and uncertain points in a graph and refines the segmentation\naccording to a small graph convolutional network (GCN).

To address\nthese issues, we define a new neighbor-selection mechanism according to feature\ndistances and combine the two networks in the training procedure. According to\nthe experimental results on pancreas segmentation from Computed Tomography (CT)\nimages, we demonstrate improvement in the quantitative measures. Also,\nexamining the dynamic neighbors created by our method, edges between\nsemantically similar image parts are observed.

          "description": "The aortic vessel tree is composed of the aorta and its branching arteries,\nand plays a key role in supplying the whole body with blood. Aortic diseases,\nlike aneurysms or dissections, can lead to an aortic rupture, whose treatment\nwith open surgery is highly risky. Therefore, patients commonly undergo drug\ntreatment under constant monitoring, which requires regular inspections of the\nvessels through imaging. The standard imaging modality for diagnosis and\nmonitoring is computed tomography (CT), which can provide a detailed picture of\nthe aorta and its branching vessels if combined with a contrast agent,\nresulting in a CT angiography (CTA). Optimally, the whole aortic vessel tree\ngeometry from consecutive CTAs, are overlaid and compared. This allows to not\nonly detect changes in the aorta, but also more peripheral vessel tree changes,\ncaused by the primary pathology or newly developed. When performed manually,\nthis reconstruction requires slice by slice contouring, which could easily take\na whole day for a single aortic vessel tree and, hence, is not feasible in\nclinical practice. Automatic or semi-automatic vessel tree segmentation\nalgorithms, on the other hand, can complete this task in a fraction of the\nmanual execution time and run in parallel to the clinical routine of the\nclinicians. In this paper, we systematically review computing techniques for\nthe automatic and semi-automatic segmentation of the aortic vessel tree. The\nreview concludes with an in-depth discussion on how close these\nstate-of-the-art approaches are to an application in clinical practice and how\nactive this research field is, taking into account the number of publications,\ndatasets and challenges.",

          "description": "Quantum classification and hypothesis testing are two tightly related\nsubjects, the main difference being that the former is data driven: how to\nassign to quantum states $\\rho(x)$ the corresponding class $c$ (or hypothesis)\nis learnt from examples during training, where $x$ can be either tunable\nexperimental parameters or classical data \"embedded\" into quantum states. Does\nthe model generalize? This is the main question in any data-driven strategy,\nnamely the ability to predict the correct class even of previously unseen\nstates. Here we establish a link between quantum machine learning\nclassification and quantum hypothesis testing (state and channel\ndiscrimination) and then show that the accuracy and generalization capability\nof quantum classifiers depend on the (R\\'enyi) mutual informations $I(C{:}Q)$\nand $I_2(X{:}Q)$ between the quantum state space $Q$ and the classical\nparameter space $X$ or class space $C$. Based on the above characterization, we\nthen show how different properties of $Q$ affect classification accuracy and\ngeneralization, such as the dimension of the Hilbert space, the amount of\nnoise, and the amount of neglected information from $X$ via, e.g., pooling\nlayers. Moreover, we introduce a quantum version of the Information Bottleneck\nprinciple that allows us to explore the various tradeoffs between accuracy and\ngeneralization. Finally, in order to check our theoretical predictions, we\nstudy the classification of the quantum phases of an Ising spin chain, and we\npropose the Variational Quantum Information Bottleneck (VQIB) method to\noptimize quantum embeddings of classical data to favor generalization.",

          "description": "Coronaviruses constitute a family of viruses that gives rise to respiratory\ndiseases. As COVID-19 is highly contagious, early diagnosis of COVID-19 is\ncrucial for an effective treatment strategy. However, the RT-PCR test which is\nconsidered to be a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suffers from a\nhigh false-negative rate. Chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis has emerged as a\nfeasible and effective diagnostic technique towards this objective. In this\nwork, we propose the COVID-19 classification problem as a three-class\nclassification problem to distinguish between COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia\nclasses. We propose a three-stage framework, named COV-ELM. Stage one deals\nwith preprocessing and transformation while stage two deals with feature\nextraction. These extracted features are passed as an input to the ELM at the\nthird stage, resulting in the identification of COVID-19. The choice of ELM in\nthis work has been motivated by its faster convergence, better generalization\ncapability, and shorter training time in comparison to the conventional\ngradient-based learning algorithms. As bigger and diverse datasets become\navailable, ELM can be quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based\ncompetitor models. The proposed model achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95\nand the overall sensitivity of ${0.94 \\pm 0.02} at a 95% confidence interval.\nWhen compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the COV-ELM is\nfound to outperform its competitors in this three-class classification\nscenario. Further, LIME has been integrated with the proposed COV-ELM model to\ngenerate annotated CXR images. The annotations are based on the superpixels\nthat have contributed to distinguish between the different classes. It was\nobserved that the superpixels correspond to the regions of the human lungs that\nare clinically observed in COVID-19 and Pneumonia cases.",

          "description": "While classic control theory offers state of the art solutions in many\nproblem scenarios, it is often desired to improve beyond the structure of such\nsolutions and surpass their limitations. To this end, residual policy learning\n(RPL) offers a formulation to improve existing controllers with reinforcement\nlearning (RL) by learning an additive \"residual\" to the output of a given\ncontroller. However, the applicability of such an approach highly depends on\nthe structure of the controller. Often, internal feedback signals of the\ncontroller limit an RL algorithm to adequately change the policy and, hence,\nlearn the task. We propose a new formulation that addresses these limitations\nby also modifying the feedback signals to the controller with an RL policy and\nshow superior performance of our approach on a contact-rich peg-insertion task\nunder position and orientation uncertainty. In addition, we use a recent\nCartesian impedance control architecture as the control framework which can be\navailable to us as a black-box while assuming no knowledge about its\ninput/output structure, and show the difficulties of standard RPL. Furthermore,\nwe introduce an adaptive curriculum for the given task to gradually increase\nthe task difficulty in terms of position and orientation uncertainty.

Existing approaches are often limited to a narrow\nset of policy levers or objectives that are hard to measure, do not yield\nexplicit optimal policies, or do not consider strategic behavior, for example.\nHence, it remains challenging to optimize policy in real-world scenarios. Here\nwe show that the AI Economist framework enables effective, flexible, and\ninterpretable policy design using two-level reinforcement learning (RL) and\ndata-driven simulations. We validate our framework on optimizing the stringency\nof US state policies and Federal subsidies during a pandemic, e.g., COVID-19,\nusing a simulation fitted to real data. We find that log-linear policies\ntrained using RL significantly improve social welfare, based on both public\nhealth and economic outcomes, compared to past outcomes. Their behavior can be\nexplained, e.g., well-performing policies respond strongly to changes in\nrecovery and vaccination rates. They are also robust to calibration errors,\ne.g., infection rates that are over or underestimated. As of yet, real-world\npolicymaking has not seen adoption of machine learning methods at large,\nincluding RL and AI-driven simulations. Our results show the potential of AI to\nguide policy design and improve social welfare amidst the complexity of the\nreal world.",

          "description": "Requirements Engineering (RE) is the initial step towards building a software\nsystem. The success or failure of a software project is firmly tied to this\nphase, based on communication among stakeholders using natural language. The\nproblem with natural language is that it can easily lead to different\nunderstandings if it is not expressed precisely by the stakeholders involved,\nwhich results in building a product different from the expected one. Previous\nwork proposed to enhance the quality of the software requirements detecting\nlanguage errors based on ISO 29148 requirements language criteria. The existing\nsolutions apply classical Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect them. NLP\nhas some limitations, such as domain dependability which results in poor\ngeneralization capability. Therefore, this work aims to improve the previous\nwork by creating a manually labeled dataset and using ensemble learning, Deep\nLearning (DL), and techniques such as word embeddings and transfer learning to\novercome the generalization problem that is tied with classical NLP and improve\nprecision and recall metrics using a manually labeled dataset. The current\nfindings show that the dataset is unbalanced and which class examples should be\nadded more. It is tempting to train algorithms even if the dataset is not\nconsiderably representative. Whence, the results show that models are\noverfitting; in Machine Learning this issue is solved by adding more instances\nto the dataset, improving label quality, removing noise, and reducing the\nlearning algorithms complexity, which is planned for this research.",

          "description": "System identification aims to build models of dynamical systems from data.\nTraditionally, choosing the model requires the designer to balance between two\ngoals of conflicting nature; the model must be rich enough to capture the\nsystem dynamics, but not so flexible that it learns spurious random effects\nfrom the dataset. It is typically observed that the model validation\nperformance follows a U-shaped curve as the model complexity increases. Recent\ndevelopments in machine learning and statistics, however, have observed\nsituations where a \"double-descent\" curve subsumes this U-shaped\nmodel-performance curve. With a second decrease in performance occurring beyond\nthe point where the model has reached the capacity of interpolating - i.e.,\n(near) perfectly fitting - the training data. To the best of our knowledge,\nsuch phenomena have not been studied within the context of dynamic systems. The\npresent paper aims to answer the question: \"Can such a phenomenon also be\nobserved when estimating parameters of dynamic systems?\" We show that the\nanswer is yes, verifying such behavior experimentally both for artificially\ngenerated and real-world datasets.",

          "description": "Extreme Learning Machine is a powerful classification method very competitive\nexisting classification methods. It is extremely fast at training.\nNevertheless, it cannot perform face verification tasks properly because face\nverification tasks require comparison of facial images of two individuals at\nthe same time and decide whether the two faces identify the same person. The\nstructure of Extreme Leaning Machine was not designed to feed two input data\nstreams simultaneously, thus, in 2-input scenarios Extreme Learning Machine\nmethods are normally applied using concatenated inputs. However, this setup\nconsumes two times more computational resources and it is not optimized for\nrecognition tasks where learning a separable distance metric is critical. For\nthese reasons, we propose and develop a Siamese Extreme Learning Machine\n(SELM). SELM was designed to be fed with two data streams in parallel\nsimultaneously. It utilizes a dual-stream Siamese condition in the extra\nSiamese layer to transform the data before passing it along to the hidden\nlayer. Moreover, we propose a Gender-Ethnicity-Dependent triplet feature\nexclusively trained on a variety of specific demographic groups. This feature\nenables learning and extracting of useful facial features of each group.\nExperiments were conducted to evaluate and compare the performances of SELM,\nExtreme Learning Machine, and DCNN. The experimental results showed that the\nproposed feature was able to perform correct classification at 97.87% accuracy\nand 99.45% AUC. They also showed that using SELM in conjunction with the\nproposed feature provided 98.31% accuracy and 99.72% AUC. They outperformed the\nwell-known DCNN and Extreme Leaning Machine methods by a wide margin.",

          "description": "The elastic properties of materials derive from their electronic and atomic\nnature. However, simulating bulk materials fully at these scales is not\nfeasible, so that typically homogenized continuum descriptions are used\ninstead. A seamless and lossless transition of the constitutive description of\nthe elastic response of materials between these two scales has been so far\nelusive. Here we show how this problem can be overcome by using Artificial\nIntelligence (AI). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained, by\ntaking the structure image of a nanoporous material as input and the\ncorresponding elasticity tensor, calculated from Molecular Statics (MS), as\noutput. Trained with the atomistic data, the CNN model captures the size- and\npore-dependency of the material's elastic properties which, on the physics\nside, can stem from surfaces and non-local effects. Such effects are often\nignored in upscaling from atomistic to classical continuum theory. To\ndemonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the trained CNN model, a Finite\nElement Method (FEM) based result of an elastically deformed nanoporous beam\nequipped with the CNN as constitutive law is compared with that by a full\natomistic simulation. The good agreement between the atomistic simulations and\nthe FEM-AI combination for a system with size and surface effects establishes a\nnew lossless scale bridging approach to such problems. The trained CNN model\ndeviates from the atomistic result by 9.6\\% for porosity scenarios of up to\n90\\% but it is about 230 times faster than the MS calculation and does not\nrequire to change simulation methods between different scales. The efficiency\nof the CNN evaluation together with the preservation of important atomistic\neffects makes the trained model an effective atomistically-informed\nconstitutive model for macroscopic simulations of nanoporous materials and\nsolving of inverse problems.",

However, typical\nCATE learners assume all confounding variables are measured in order for the\nCATE to be identifiable.

What is particularly interesting is that after replacing the\nnuclear norm with the $L_{2,1}$ norm proposed based on this decomposition, as\nthe upper bound of the nuclear norm, when the intermediate matrix $D$ in its\ndecomposition is close to the diagonal matrix, it will converge to the nuclear\nnorm, and is exactly equal, when the $D$ matrix is equal to the diagonal\nmatrix, to the nuclear norm, which ingeniously avoids the calculation of the\nsingular value of the matrix.

To find these waveforms we apply a shift-invariant\nk-means algorithm to segments of spatially filtered signals to learn codebooks\nof prototypical waveforms. The frequency of the cluster labels from the\ncodebooks is then used to train a binary classifier that predicts the class\n(preictal or interictal) of a test ECoG segment. We use the Matthews\ncorrelation coefficient to evaluate the performance of the classifier and the\nquality of the codebooks. We found that our method finds recurrent\nnon-sinusoidal waveforms that could be used to build interpretable features for\nseizure prediction and that are also physiologically meaningful.",

          "description": "Euler k-means (EulerK) first maps data onto the unit hyper-sphere surface of\nequi-dimensional space via a complex mapping which induces the robust Euler\nkernel and next employs the popular $k$-means. Consequently, besides enjoying\nthe virtues of k-means such as simplicity and scalability to large data sets,\nEulerK is also robust to noises and outliers. Although so, the centroids\ncaptured by EulerK deviate from the unit hyper-sphere surface and thus in\nstrict distributional sense, actually are outliers. This weird phenomenon also\noccurs in some generic kernel clustering methods. Intuitively, using such\noutlier-like centroids should not be quite reasonable but it is still seldom\nattended. To eliminate the deviation, we propose two Rectified Euler k-means\nmethods, i.e., REK1 and REK2, which retain the merits of EulerK while acquire\nreal centroids residing on the mapped space to better characterize the data\nstructures. Specifically, REK1 rectifies EulerK by imposing the constraint on\nthe centroids while REK2 views each centroid as the mapped image from a\npre-image in the original space and optimizes these pre-images in Euler kernel\ninduced space. Undoubtedly, our proposed REKs can methodologically be extended\nto solve problems of such a category. Finally, the experiments validate the\neffectiveness of REK1 and REK2.",

However, most studies are oriented toward\nmonolingual data in languages with abundant training samples. This has left the\nmore common multilingual settings and lesser-spoken languages relatively\nunexplored. Thus, we present a GNN that incorporates cross-lingual word\nembeddings for detecting events in multilingual data streams. The first exploit\nis to make the GNN work with multilingual data. For this, we outline a\nconstruction strategy that aligns messages in different languages at both the\nnode and semantic levels. Relationships between messages are established by\nmerging entities that are the same but are referred to in different languages.\nNon-English message representations are converted into English semantic space\nvia the cross-lingual word embeddings. The resulting message graph is then\nuniformly encoded by a GNN model. In special cases where a lesser-spoken\nlanguage needs to be detected, a novel cross-lingual knowledge distillation\nframework, called CLKD, exploits prior knowledge learned from similar threads\nin English to make up for the paucity of annotated data. Experiments on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets show the framework to be highly effective at\ndetection in both multilingual data and in languages where training samples are\nscarce.",

Being able to accurately measure the\nanomalous exponent associated with a given particle trajectory, thus\ndetermining whether the particle subdiffuses, superdiffuses or performs normal\ndiffusion is of key importance to understand the diffusion process. Also, it is\noften important to trustingly identify the model behind the trajectory, as this\ngives a large amount of information on the system dynamics. Both aspects are\nparticularly difficult when the input data are short and noisy trajectories. It\nis even more difficult if one cannot guarantee that the trajectories output in\nexperiments is homogeneous, hindering the statistical methods based on\nensembles of trajectories. We present a data-driven method able to infer the\nanomalous exponent and to identify the type of anomalous diffusion process\nbehind single, noisy and short trajectories, with good accuracy.

To date, prior studies in embodied agent\nnavigation have only demonstrated that human languages facilitate communication\nby instructions in natural languages. Nevertheless, a plethora of other forms\nof communication is left unexplored. In fact, human communication originated in\ngestures and oftentimes is delivered through multimodal cues, e.g. \"go there\"\nwith a pointing gesture. To bridge the gap and fill in the missing dimension of\ncommunication in embodied agent navigation, we propose investigating the\neffects of using gestures as the communicative interface instead of verbal\ncues. Specifically, we develop a VR-based 3D simulation environment, named\nGes-THOR, based on AI2-THOR platform. In this virtual environment, a human\nplayer is placed in the same virtual scene and shepherds the artificial agent\nusing only gestures. The agent is tasked to solve the navigation problem guided\nby natural gestures with unknown semantics; we do not use any predefined\ngestures due to the diversity and versatile nature of human gestures. We argue\nthat learning the semantics of natural gestures is mutually beneficial to\nlearning the navigation task--learn to communicate and communicate to learn.

          "description": "Understanding a controller's performance in different scenarios is crucial\nfor robots that are going to be deployed in safety-critical tasks. If we do not\nhave a model of the dynamics of the world, which is often the case in complex\ndomains, we may need to approximate a performance function of the robot based\non its interaction with the environment. Such a performance function gives us\ninsights into the behaviour of the robot, allowing us to fine-tune the\ncontroller with manual interventions. In high-dimensionality systems, where the\nactionstate space is large, fine-tuning a controller is non-trivial. To\novercome this problem, we propose a performance function whose domain is\ndefined by external features and parameters of the controller. Attainment\nregions are defined over such a domain defined by feature-parameter pairs, and\nserve the purpose of enabling prediction of successful execution of the task.\nThe use of the feature-parameter space -in contrast to the action-state space-\nallows us to adapt, explain and finetune the controller over a simpler (i.e.,\nlower dimensional space). When the robot successfully executes the task, we use\nthe attainment regions to gain insights into the limits of the controller, and\nits robustness. When the robot fails to execute the task, we use the regions to\ndebug the controller and find adaptive and counterfactual changes to the\nsolutions. Another advantage of this approach is that we can generalise through\nthe use of Gaussian processes regression of the performance function in the\nhigh-dimensional space. To test our approach, we demonstrate learning an\napproximation to the performance function in simulation, with a mobile robot\ntraversing different terrain conditions. Then, with a sample-efficient method,\nwe propagate the attainment regions to a physical robot in a similar\nenvironment.",

          "description": "Stress is a physiological state that hampers mental health and has serious\nconsequences to physical health. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased\nstress levels among people across the globe. Therefore, continuous monitoring\nand detection of stress are necessary. The recent advances in wearable devices\nhave allowed the monitoring of several physiological signals related to stress.\nAmong them, wrist-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are most popular due\nto their convenient usage. And the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is the\nmost prevalent sensor in almost all consumer-grade wrist-worn smartwatches.\nTherefore, this paper focuses on using a wrist-based PPG sensor that collects\nBlood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals to detect stress which may be applicable for\nconsumer-grade wristwatches. Moreover, state-of-the-art works have used either\nclassical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted\nfeatures or have used deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) which automatically extracts features. This paper proposes a\nnovel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features\nand the automatically extracted features by CNN to detect stress using the BVP\nsignal. Evaluation on the benchmark WESAD dataset shows that, for 3-class\nclassification (Baseline vs. Stress vs. Amusement), our proposed H-CNN\noutperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 5% and 7% accuracy, and\n10% and 7% macro F1 score, respectively. Also for 2-class classification\n(Stress vs. Non-stress), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers\nand normal CNN by 3% and ~5% accuracy, and ~3% and ~7% macro F1 score,\nrespectively.",

Secondly, Word2vec is applied to the classified texts resulting in\nEurocentric, non-Eurocentric and global representations of the data for the\nthree target languages. This comparative analysis demonstrates not only the\nefficacy of the classification method but also highlights geographic, temporal\nand linguistic differences in the disinformation-related media.

          "description": "A new machine learning (ML) technique termed as federated learning (FL) aims\nto preserve data at the edge devices and to only exchange ML model parameters\nin the learning process. FL not only reduces the communication needs but also\nhelps to protect the local privacy. Although FL has these advantages, it can\nstill experience large communication latency when there are massive edge\ndevices connected to the central parameter server (PS) and/or millions of model\nparameters involved in the learning process. Over-the-air computation (AirComp)\nis capable of computing while transmitting data by allowing multiple devices to\nsend data simultaneously by using analog modulation. To achieve good\nperformance in FL through AirComp, user scheduling plays a critical role. In\nthis paper, we investigate and compare different user scheduling policies,\nwhich are based on various criteria such as wireless channel conditions and the\nsignificance of model updates. Receiver beamforming is applied to minimize the\nmean-square-error (MSE) of the distortion of function aggregation result via\nAirComp. Simulation results show that scheduling based on the significance of\nmodel updates has smaller fluctuations in the training process while scheduling\nbased on channel condition has the advantage on energy efficiency.",

          "description": "The merit of ensemble learning lies in having different outputs from many\nindividual models on a single input, i.e., the diversity of the base models.\nThe high quality of diversity can be achieved when each model is specialized to\ndifferent subsets of the whole dataset. Moreover, when each model explicitly\nknows to which subsets it is specialized, more opportunities arise to improve\ndiversity. In this paper, we propose an advanced ensemble method, called\nAuxiliary class based Multiple Choice Learning (AMCL), to ultimately specialize\neach model under the framework of multiple choice learning (MCL). The\nadvancement of AMCL is originated from three novel techniques which control the\nframework from different directions: 1) the concept of auxiliary class to\nprovide more distinct information through the labels, 2) the strategy, named\nmemory-based assignment, to determine the association between the inputs and\nthe models, and 3) the feature fusion module to achieve generalized features.\nTo demonstrate the performance of our method compared to all variants of MCL\nmethods, we conduct extensive experiments on the image classification and\nsegmentation tasks. Overall, the performance of AMCL exceeds all others in most\nof the public datasets trained with various networks as members of the\nensembles.",

We evaluate\nthe performance of the proposed GCN model on graph databases and compare it\nwith Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Artificial\nNeural Network (ANN). The proposed GCN approach is further augmented with the\nshortest path and eigenvector centrality attribute to significantly improve the\naccuracy of sales prediction.

          "description": "Since the rapid outbreak of Covid-19 and with no approved vaccines to date,\nprofound research interest has emerged to understand the innate immune response\nto viruses. This understanding can help to inhibit virus replication, prolong\nadaptive immune response, accelerated virus clearance, and tissue recovery, a\nkey milestone to propose a vaccine to combat coronaviruses (CoVs), e.g.,\nCovid-19. Although an innate immune system triggers inflammatory responses\nagainst CoVs upon recognition of viruses, however, a vaccine is the ultimate\nprotection against CoV spread. The development of this vaccine is\ntime-consuming and requires a deep understanding of the innate immune response\nsystem. In this work, we propose a graph neural network-based model that\nexploits the interactions between pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), i.e.,\nthe human immune response system. These interactions can help to recognize\npathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to predict the activation\nrequirements of each PRR. The immune response information of each PRR is\nderived from combining its historical PAMPs activation coupled with the modeled\neffect on the same from PRRs in its neighborhood. On one hand, this work can\nhelp to understand how long Covid-19 can confer immunity where a strong immune\nresponse means people already been infected can safely return to work. On the\nother hand, this GNN-based understanding can also abode well for vaccine\ndevelopment efforts. Our proposal has been evaluated using CoVs immune response\ndataset, with results showing an average IFNs activation prediction accuracy of\n90%, compared to 85% using feed-forward neural networks.",

Sadly, providing a human with\nan explanation for each outcome is not conceivable when dealing with an\nimportant number of daily predictions. To address this problem, we propose an\noriginal data-mining method rooted in Subgroup Discovery, a pattern mining\ntechnique with the natural ability to group objects that share similar\nexplanations of their black box predictions and provide a description for each\ngroup. We evaluate this approach and present our preliminary results which give\nus good hope towards an effective OCE's adoption. We believe that this approach\nprovides a new way to address the problem of model agnostic outcome\nexplanation.",

          "description": "Institutional investors have been increasing the allocation of the illiquid\nalternative assets such as private equity funds in their portfolios, yet there\nexists a very limited literature on cash flow forecasting of illiquid\nalternative assets. The net cash flow of private equity funds typically follow\na J-curve pattern, however the timing and the size of the contributions and\ndistributions depend on the investment opportunities. In this paper, we develop\na benchmark model and present two novel approaches (direct vs. indirect) to\npredict the cash flows of private equity funds. We introduce a sliding window\napproach to apply on our cash flow data because different vintage year funds\ncontain different lengths of cash flow information. We then pass the data to an\nLSTM/ GRU model to predict the future cash flows either directly or indirectly\n(based on the benchmark model). We further integrate macroeconomic indicators\ninto our data, which allows us to consider the impact of market environment on\ncash flows and to apply stress testing. Our results indicate that the direct\nmodel is easier to implement compared to the benchmark model and the indirect\nmodel, but still the predicted cash flows align better with the actual cash\nflows. We also show that macroeconomic variables improve the performance of the\ndirect model whereas the impact is not obvious on the indirect model.",

To address this issue, several studies have been\nconducted for hate speech detection in European languages, whereas little\nattention has been paid to low-resource South Asian languages, making the\nsocial media vulnerable for millions of users. In particular, to the best of\nour knowledge, no study has been conducted for hate speech detection in Roman\nUrdu text, which is widely used in the sub-continent. In this study, we have\nscrapped more than 90,000 tweets and manually parsed them to identify 5,000\nRoman Urdu tweets. Subsequently, we have employed an iterative approach to\ndevelop guidelines and used them for generating the Hate Speech Roman Urdu 2020\ncorpus.

As another\ncontribution, we have used five supervised learning techniques, including a\ndeep learning technique, to evaluate and compare their effectiveness for hate\nspeech detection. The results show that Logistic Regression outperformed all\nother techniques, including deep learning techniques for the two levels of\nclassification, by achieved an F1 score of 0.906 for distinguishing between\nNeutral-Hostile tweets, and 0.756 for distinguishing between Offensive-Hate\nspeech tweets.",

          "description": "Quantum computing offers the potential of exponential speedups for certain\nclassical computations. Over the last decade, many quantum machine learning\n(QML) algorithms have been proposed as candidates for such exponential\nimprovements. However, two issues unravel the hope of exponential speedup for\nsome of these QML algorithms: the data-loading problem and, more recently, the\nstunning dequantization results of Tang et al. A third issue, namely the\nfault-tolerance requirements of most QML algorithms, has further hindered their\npractical realization. The quantum topological data analysis (QTDA) algorithm\nof Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi was one of the first QML algorithms that\nconvincingly offered an expected exponential speedup. From the outset, it did\nnot suffer from the data-loading problem. A recent result has also shown that\nthe generalized problem solved by this algorithm is likely classically\nintractable, and would therefore be immune to any dequantization efforts.\nHowever, the QTDA algorithm of Lloyd et~al. has a time complexity of\n$O(n^4/(\\epsilon^2 \\delta))$ (where $n$ is the number of data points,\n$\\epsilon$ is the error tolerance, and $\\delta$ is the smallest nonzero\neigenvalue of the restricted Laplacian) and requires fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputing, which has not yet been achieved. In this paper, we completely\noverhaul the QTDA algorithm to achieve an improved exponential speedup and\ndepth complexity of $O(n\\log(1/(\\delta\\epsilon)))$. Our approach includes three\nkey innovations: (a) an efficient realization of the combinatorial Laplacian as\na sum of Pauli operators; (b) a quantum rejection sampling approach to restrict\nthe superposition to the simplices in the complex; and (c) a stochastic rank\nestimation method to estimate the Betti numbers. We present a theoretical error\nanalysis, and the circuit and computational time and depth complexities for\nBetti number estimation.",

To overcome these limitations, we utilized\ncontrastive self-supervised learning to exploit the large variety of unlabeled\nfundus images in the publicly available EyePACS dataset. We pre-trained an\nencoder of a U-Net, which we later fine-tuned on several retinal vessel and\nlesion segmentation datasets.

Furthermore, when fine-tuned on a downstream blood vessel\nsegmentation task, such pre-trained networks achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on images from different datasets. Additionally, the pre-training\nalso leads to shorter training times and an improved few-shot performance on\nboth blood vessel and lesion segmentation tasks.

          "description": "Piecewise linear neural networks can be split into subfunctions, each with\nits own activation pattern, domain, and empirical error. Empirical error for\nthe full network can be written as an expectation over empirical error of\nsubfunctions. Constructing a generalization bound on subfunction empirical\nerror indicates that the more densely a subfunction is surrounded by training\nsamples in representation space, the more reliable its predictions are.\nFurther, it suggests that models with fewer activation regions generalize\nbetter, and models that abstract knowledge to a greater degree generalize\nbetter, all else equal. We propose not only a theoretical framework to reason\nabout subfunction error bounds but also a pragmatic way of approximately\nevaluating it, which we apply to predicting which samples the network will not\nsuccessfully generalize to. We test our method on detection of\nmisclassification and out-of-distribution samples, finding that it performs\ncompetitively in both cases. In short, some network activation patterns are\nassociated with higher reliability than others, and these can be identified\nusing subfunction error bounds.",

          "description": "Answering complex First-Order Logical (FOL) queries on large-scale incomplete\nknowledge graphs (KGs) is an important yet challenging task. Recent advances\nembed logical queries and KG entities in the vector space and conduct query\nanswering via dense similarity search. However, most of the designed logical\noperators in existing works do not satisfy the axiomatic system of classical\nlogic. Moreover, these logical operators are parameterized so that they require\na large number of complex FOL queries as training data, which are often arduous\nor even inaccessible to collect in most real-world KGs. In this paper, we\npresent FuzzQE, a fuzzy logic based query embedding framework for answering FOL\nqueries over KGs. FuzzQE follows fuzzy logic to define logical operators in a\nprincipled and learning free manner. Extensive experiments on two benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that FuzzQE achieves significantly better performance in\nanswering FOL queries compared to the state-of-the-art methods. In addition,\nFuzzQE trained with only KG link prediction without any complex queries can\nachieve comparable performance with the systems trained with all FOL queries.",

To address these issues, self-supervised learning (SSL),\nwhich extracts informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks\nwithout relying on manual labels, has become a promising and trending learning\nparadigm for graph data. Different from SSL on other domains like computer\nvision and natural language processing, SSL on graphs has an exclusive\nbackground, design ideas, and taxonomies. Under the umbrella of graph\nself-supervised learning, we present a timely and comprehensive review of the\nexisting approaches which employ SSL techniques for graph data. We construct a\nunified framework that mathematically formalizes the paradigm of graph SSL.\nAccording to the objectives of pretext tasks, we divide these approaches into\nfour categories: generation-based, auxiliary property-based, contrast-based,\nand hybrid approaches. We further conclude the applications of graph SSL across\nvarious research fields and summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation\nbenchmark, performance comparison and open-source codes of graph SSL.

At the same time, current economic methodology is limited by a lack of\ncounterfactual data, simplistic behavioral models, and limited opportunities to\nexperiment with policies and evaluate behavioral responses. Here we show that\nmachine-learning-based economic simulation is a powerful policy and mechanism\ndesign framework to overcome these limitations. The AI Economist is a\ntwo-level, deep RL framework that trains both agents and a social planner who\nco-adapt, providing a tractable solution to the highly unstable and novel\ntwo-level RL challenge. From a simple specification of an economy, we learn\nrational agent behaviors that adapt to learned planner policies and vice versa.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of the AI Economist on the problem of optimal\ntaxation. In simple one-step economies, the AI Economist recovers the optimal\ntax policy of economic theory. In complex, dynamic economies, the AI Economist\nsubstantially improves both utilitarian social welfare and the trade-off\nbetween equality and productivity over baselines. It does so despite emergent\ntax-gaming strategies, while accounting for agent interactions and behavioral\nchange more accurately than economic theory. These results demonstrate for the\nfirst time that two-level, deep RL can be used for understanding and as a\ncomplement to theory for economic design, unlocking a new computational\nlearning-based approach to understanding economic policy.",

In addition, examples for diagnosing COVID-19 are\nprovided, using LogNNet trained on a publicly available database from the\nIsraeli Ministry of Health. The service concept has been developed, which uses\nthe data of the express test for COVID-19 and reaches the classification\naccuracy of ~ 95% with the ~ 0.6 kB of RAM used on Arduino microcontrollers.

          "description": "Neural networks and other machine learning models compute continuous\nrepresentations, while humans communicate mostly through discrete symbols.\nReconciling these two forms of communication is desirable for generating\nhuman-readable interpretations or learning discrete latent variable models,\nwhile maintaining end-to-end differentiability. Some existing approaches (such\nas the Gumbel-Softmax transformation) build continuous relaxations that are\ndiscrete approximations in the zero-temperature limit, while others (such as\nsparsemax transformations and the Hard Concrete distribution) produce\ndiscrete/continuous hybrids. In this paper, we build rigorous theoretical\nfoundations for these hybrids, which we call \"mixed random variables.\" Our\nstarting point is a new \"direct sum\" base measure defined on the face lattice\nof the probability simplex. From this measure, we introduce new entropy and\nKullback-Leibler divergence functions that subsume the discrete and\ndifferential cases and have interpretations in terms of code optimality. Our\nframework suggests two strategies for representing and sampling mixed random\nvariables, an extrinsic (\"sample-and-project\") and an intrinsic one (based on\nface stratification). We experiment with both approaches on an emergent\ncommunication benchmark and on modeling MNIST and Fashion-MNIST data with\nvariational auto-encoders with mixed latent variables.",

          "description": "Few-Shot Learning (FSL) algorithms have made substantial progress in learning\nnovel concepts with just a handful of labelled data. To classify query\ninstances from novel classes encountered at test-time, they only require a\nsupport set composed of a few labelled samples. FSL benchmarks commonly assume\nthat those queries come from the same distribution as instances in the support\nset. However, in a realistic set-ting, data distribution is plausibly subject\nto change, a situation referred to as Distribution Shift (DS). The present work\naddresses the new and challenging problem of Few-Shot Learning under\nSupport/Query Shift (FSQS) i.e., when support and query instances are sampled\nfrom related but different distributions. Our contributions are the following.\nFirst, we release a testbed for FSQS, including datasets, relevant baselines\nand a protocol for a rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Second, we observe\nthat well-established FSL algorithms unsurprisingly suffer from a considerable\ndrop in accuracy when facing FSQS, stressing the significance of our study.\nFinally, we show that transductive algorithms can limit the inopportune effect\nof DS. In particular, we study both the role of Batch-Normalization and Optimal\nTransport (OT) in aligning distributions, bridging Unsupervised Domain\nAdaptation with FSL. This results in a new method that efficiently combines OT\nwith the celebrated Prototypical Networks. We bring compelling experiments\ndemonstrating the advantage of our method. Our work opens an exciting line of\nresearch by providing a testbed and strong baselines. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ebennequin/meta-domain-shift.",

In this work, we show a surprising result: the benefits of\nusing multiple predictions can be achieved `for free' under a single model's\nforward pass. In particular, we show that, using a multi-input multi-output\n(MIMO) configuration, one can utilize a single model's capacity to train\nmultiple subnetworks that independently learn the task at hand. By ensembling\nthe predictions made by the subnetworks, we improve model robustness without\nincreasing compute.

          "description": "Recently, much progress has been made in unsupervised restoration learning.\nHowever, existing methods more or less rely on some assumptions on the signal\nand/or degradation model, which limits their practical performance. How to\nconstruct an optimal criterion for unsupervised restoration learning without\nany prior knowledge on the degradation model is still an open question. Toward\nanswering this question, this work proposes a criterion for unsupervised\nrestoration learning based on the optimal transport theory. This criterion has\nfavorable properties, e.g., approximately maximal preservation of the\ninformation of the signal, whilst achieving perceptual reconstruction.\nFurthermore, though a relaxed unconstrained formulation is used in practical\nimplementation, we show that the relaxed formulation in theory has the same\nsolution as the original constrained formulation. Experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world data, including realistic photographic, microscopy, depth, and raw\ndepth images, demonstrate that the proposed method even compares favorably with\nsupervised methods, e.g., approaching the PSNR of supervised methods while\nhaving better perceptual quality. Particularly, for spatially correlated noise\nand realistic microscopy images, the proposed method not only achieves better\nperceptual quality but also has higher PSNR than supervised methods. Besides,\nit shows remarkable superiority in harsh practical conditions with complex\nnoise, e.g., raw depth images.",

          "description": "Expensive bounding-box annotations have limited the development of object\ndetection task. Thus, it is necessary to focus on more challenging task of\nfew-shot object detection. It requires the detector to recognize objects of\nnovel classes with only a few training samples.

To address this issue, we propose a dynamic\nrelevance learning model, which utilizes the relationship between all support\nimages and Region of Interest (RoI) on the query images to construct a dynamic\ngraph convolutional network (GCN). By adjusting the prediction distribution of\nthe base detector using the output of this GCN, the proposed model can guide\nthe detector to improve the class representation implicitly.

While individual biological signals such\nas Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electrodermal Activity (EDA) have been widely\nused for emotion recognition with machine learning methods, multimodal\napproaches generally fuse extracted features or final classification/regression\nresults to boost performance. To enhance multimodal learning, we present a\nnovel attentive cross-modal connection to share information between\nconvolutional neural networks responsible for learning individual modalities.\nSpecifically, these connections improve emotion classification by sharing\nintermediate representations among EDA and ECG and apply attention weights to\nthe shared information, thus learning more effective multimodal embeddings. We\nperform experiments on the WESAD dataset to identify the best configuration of\nthe proposed method for emotion classification. Our experiments show that the\nproposed approach is capable of learning strong multimodal representations and\noutperforms a number of baselines methods.",

Expecting non-IID data\ndistribution, we focus on the issue of accelerating the learning of a\nparticular class of critical object (CO), that may harm the nominal operation\nof an autonomous vehicle. This can be done through proper allocation of the\nwireless resources for addressing learner and data heterogeneity. Thus, we\npropose a reactive method for the allocation of wireless resources, that\nhappens dynamically each FL round, and is based on each learner's contribution\nto the general model. In addition to this, we explore the use of static methods\nthat remain constant across all rounds. Since we expect partial work from each\nlearner, we use the FedProx FL algorithm, in the task of computer vision. For\ntesting, we construct a non-IID data distribution of the MNIST and FMNIST\ndatasets among four types of learners, in scenarios that represent the quickly\nchanging environment. The results show that proactive measures are effective\nand versatile at improving system accuracy, and quickly learning the CO class\nwhen underrepresented in the network.

While a\nsimple reduction allows one to apply a low-regret algorithm to obtain an\n$\\epsilon$-optimal policy and achieve the worst-case optimal rate, it is\nunknown whether low-regret algorithms can obtain the instance-optimal rate for\npolicy identification. We show that this is not possible -- there exists a\nfundamental tradeoff between achieving low regret and identifying an\n$\\epsilon$-optimal policy at the instance-optimal rate.\n\nMotivated by our negative finding, we propose a new measure of\ninstance-dependent sample complexity for PAC tabular reinforcement learning\nwhich explicitly accounts for the attainable state visitation distributions in\nthe underlying MDP. We then propose and analyze a novel, planning-based\nalgorithm which attains this sample complexity -- yielding a complexity which\nscales with the suboptimality gaps and the ``reachability'' of a state.

          "description": "Linear layouts are a graph visualization method that can be used to capture\nan entry pattern in an adjacency matrix of a given graph. By reordering the\nnode indices of the original adjacency matrix, linear layouts provide knowledge\nof latent graph structures. Conventional linear layout methods commonly aim to\nfind an optimal reordering solution based on predefined features of a given\nmatrix and loss function. However, prior knowledge of the appropriate features\nto use or structural patterns in a given adjacency matrix is not always\navailable. In such a case, performing the reordering based on data-driven\nfeature extraction without assuming a specific structure in an adjacency matrix\nis preferable. Recently, a neural-network-based matrix reordering method called\nDeepTMR has been proposed to perform this function. However, it is limited to a\ntwo-mode reordering (i.e., the rows and columns are reordered separately) and\nit cannot be applied in the one-mode setting (i.e., the same node order is used\nfor reordering both rows and columns), owing to the characteristics of its\nmodel architecture. In this study, we extend DeepTMR and propose a new one-mode\nlinear layout method referred to as AutoLL. We developed two types of neural\nnetwork models, AutoLL-D and AutoLL-U, for reordering directed and undirected\nnetworks, respectively. To perform one-mode reordering, these AutoLL models\nhave specific encoder architectures, which extract node features from an\nobserved adjacency matrix. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations of the proposed approach, and the experimental results demonstrate\nits effectiveness.",

Policies learned through\nself-play may adopt arbitrary conventions and implicitly rely on multi-step\nreasoning based on fragile assumptions about other agents' actions and thus\nfail when paired with humans or independently trained agents at test time. To\naddress this, we present off-belief learning (OBL). At each timestep OBL agents\nfollow a policy $\\pi_1$ that is optimized assuming past actions were taken by a\ngiven, fixed policy ($\\pi_0$), but assuming that future actions will be taken\nby $\\pi_1$. When $\\pi_0$ is uniform random, OBL converges to an optimal policy\nthat does not rely on inferences based on other agents' behavior (an optimal\ngrounded policy). OBL can be iterated in a hierarchy, where the optimal policy\nfrom one level becomes the input to the next, thereby introducing multi-level\ncognitive reasoning in a controlled manner. Unlike existing approaches, which\nmay converge to any equilibrium policy, OBL converges to a unique policy,\nmaking it suitable for zero-shot coordination (ZSC).

For MA, before each training epoch, we use the\noutputs of the generator to expand the incomplete samples on the fly, and then\ndetermine a special reconstruction loss for these augmented samples.

          "description": "At present, high-dimensional global optimization problems with time-series\nmodels have received much attention from engineering fields. Since it was\nproposed, Bayesian optimization has quickly become a popular and promising\napproach for solving global optimization problems. However, the standard\nBayesian optimization algorithm is insufficient to solving the global optimal\nsolution when the model is high-dimensional. Hence, this paper presents a novel\nhigh dimensional Bayesian optimization algorithm by considering dimension\nreduction and different dimension fill-in strategies. Most existing literature\nabout Bayesian optimization algorithms did not discuss the sampling strategies\nto optimize the acquisition function. This study proposed a new sampling method\nbased on both the multi-armed bandit and random search methods while optimizing\nthe acquisition function. Besides, based on the time-dependent or\ndimension-dependent characteristics of the model, the proposed algorithm can\nreduce the dimension evenly. Then, five different dimension fill-in strategies\nwere discussed and compared in this study. Finally, to increase the final\naccuracy of the optimal solution, the proposed algorithm adds a local search\nbased on a series of Adam-based steps at the final stage. Our computational\nexperiments demonstrated that the proposed Bayesian optimization algorithm\ncould achieve reasonable solutions with excellent performances for high\ndimensional global optimization problems with a time-series optimal control\nmodel.",

Beyond mere adjacency matrices, many real networks also\ninvolve vertex covariates that carry key information about underlying block\nstructure in graphs. To assess the effects of such covariates on block\nrecovery, we present a comparative analysis of two model-based spectral\nalgorithms for clustering vertices in stochastic blockmodel graphs with vertex\ncovariates. The first algorithm uses only the adjacency matrix, and directly\nestimates the block assignments. The second algorithm incorporates both the\nadjacency matrix and the vertex covariates into the estimation of block\nassignments, and moreover quantifies the explicit impact of the vertex\ncovariates on the resulting estimate of the block assignments. We employ\nChernoff information to analytically compare the algorithms' performance and\nderive the information-theoretic Chernoff ratio for certain models of interest.\nAnalytic results and simulations suggest that the second algorithm is often\npreferred: we can often better estimate the induced block assignments by first\nestimating the effect of vertex covariates. In addition, real data examples\nalso indicate that the second algorithm has the advantages of revealing\nunderlying block structure and taking observed vertex heterogeneity into\naccount in real applications. Our findings emphasize the importance of\ndistinguishing between observed and unobserved factors that can affect block\nstructure in graphs.",

Similarly, FMMformers decompose the\nattention into near-field and far-field attention, modeling the near-field\nattention by a banded matrix and the far-field attention by a low-rank matrix.\nComputing the attention matrix for FMMformers requires linear complexity in\ncomputational time and memory footprint with respect to the sequence length. In\ncontrast, standard transformers suffer from quadratic complexity. We analyze\nand validate the advantage of FMMformers over the standard transformer on the\nLong Range Arena and language modeling benchmarks. FMMformers can even\noutperform the standard transformer in terms of accuracy by a significant\nmargin. For instance, FMMformers achieve an average classification accuracy of\n$60.74\\%$ over the five Long Range Arena tasks, which is significantly better\nthan the standard transformer's average accuracy of $58.70\\%$.",

          "description": "The design of additive imperceptible perturbations to the inputs of deep\nclassifiers to maximize their misclassification rates is a central focus of\nadversarial machine learning. An alternative approach is to synthesize\nadversarial examples from scratch using GAN-like structures, albeit with the\nuse of large amounts of training data. By contrast, this paper considers\none-shot synthesis of adversarial examples; the inputs are synthesized from\nscratch to induce arbitrary soft predictions at the output of pre-trained\nmodels, while simultaneously maintaining high similarity to specified inputs.\nTo this end, we present a problem that encodes objectives on the distance\nbetween the desired and output distributions of the trained model and the\nsimilarity between such inputs and the synthesized examples. We prove that the\nformulated problem is NP-complete. Then, we advance a generative approach to\nthe solution in which the adversarial examples are obtained as the output of a\ngenerative network whose parameters are iteratively updated by optimizing\nsurrogate loss functions for the dual-objective. We demonstrate the generality\nand versatility of the framework and approach proposed through applications to\nthe design of targeted adversarial attacks, generation of decision boundary\nsamples, and synthesis of low confidence classification inputs. The approach is\nfurther extended to an ensemble of models with different soft output\nspecifications. The experimental results verify that the targeted and\nconfidence reduction attack methods developed perform on par with\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.",

          "description": "Approximate message passing (AMP) is a low-cost iterative\nparameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with\nnon-Gaussian distributions. However, AMP only applies to independent\nidentically distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable\n(e.g. perform poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially\nfor ill-conditioned ones. Orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP) was proposed for\ngeneral right-unitarily-invariant matrices to handle this difficulty. However,\nthe Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP requires a high-complexity linear minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE) estimator. This limits the application of OAMP/VAMP to\nlarge-scale systems.\n\nTo solve the disadvantages of AMP and OAMP/VAMP, this paper proposes a memory\nAMP (MAMP) framework under an orthogonality principle, which guarantees the\nasymptotic IID Gaussianity of estimation errors in MAMP. We present an\northogonalization procedure for the local memory estimators to realize the\nrequired orthogonality for MAMP. Furthermore, we propose a Bayes-optimal MAMP\n(BO-MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is proposed for interference\nsuppression. The complexity of BO-MAMP is comparable to AMP. A state evolution\nis derived to asymptotically characterize the performance of BO-MAMP. Based on\nstate evolution, the relaxation parameters and damping vector in BO-MAMP are\noptimized. For all right-unitarily-invariant matrices, the optimized BO-MAMP\nconverges to the high-complexity OAMP/VAMP, and thus is Bayes-optimal if it has\na unique fixed point. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity\nand accuracy of the theoretical results.",

We propose a behavior-based, unsupervised\nframework comprising two methods of lateral movement detection on enterprise\nnetworks: one aimed at generic lateral movement via either exploit or\nauthenticated connections, and one targeting the specific techniques of process\ninjection and hijacking. The first method is based on the premise that the role\nof a system---the functions it performs on the network---determines the roles\nof the systems it should make connections with. The adversary meanwhile might\nmove between any systems whatever, possibly seeking out systems with unusual\nroles that facilitate certain accesses. We use unsupervised learning to cluster\nsystems according to role and identify connections to systems with novel roles\nas potentially malicious. The second method is based on the premise that the\ntemporal patterns of inter-system processes that facilitate these connections\ndepend on the roles of the systems involved. If a process is compromised by an\nattacker, these normal patterns might be disrupted in discernible ways.

          "description": "The increasing popularity of deep neural network (DNN) applications demands\nhigh computing power and efficient hardware accelerator architecture. DNN\naccelerators use a large number of processing elements (PEs) and on-chip memory\nfor storing weights and other parameters. As the communication backbone of a\nDNN accelerator, networks-on-chip (NoC) play an important role in supporting\nvarious dataflow patterns and enabling processing with communication\nparallelism in a DNN accelerator. However, the widely used mesh-based NoC\narchitectures inherently cannot support the efficient one-to-many and\nmany-to-one traffic largely existing in DNN workloads. In this paper, we\npropose a modified mesh architecture with a one-way/two-way streaming bus to\nspeedup one-to-many (multicast) traffic, and the use of gather packets to\nsupport many-to-one (gather) traffic. The analysis of the runtime latency of a\nconvolutional layer shows that the two-way streaming architecture achieves\nbetter improvement than the one-way streaming architecture for an Output\nStationary (OS) dataflow architecture. The simulation results demonstrate that\nthe gather packets can help to reduce the runtime latency up to 1.8 times and\nnetwork power consumption up to 1.7 times, compared with the repetitive unicast\nmethod on modified mesh architectures supporting two-way streaming.",

          "description": "In a recent work arXiv:2008.08601, Halverson, Maiti and Stoner proposed a\ndescription of neural networks in terms of a Wilsonian effective field theory.\nThe infinite-width limit is mapped to a free field theory, while finite $N$\ncorrections are taken into account by interactions (non-Gaussian terms in the\naction). In this paper, we study two related aspects of this correspondence.\nFirst, we comment on the concepts of locality and power-counting in this\ncontext. Indeed, these usual space-time notions may not hold for neural\nnetworks (since inputs can be arbitrary), however, the renormalization group\nprovides natural notions of locality and scaling. Moreover, we comment on\nseveral subtleties, for example, that data components may not have a\npermutation symmetry: in that case, we argue that random tensor field theories\ncould provide a natural generalization. Second, we improve the perturbative\nWilsonian renormalization from arXiv:2008.08601 by providing an analysis in\nterms of the nonperturbative renormalization group using the Wetterich-Morris\nequation. An important difference with usual nonperturbative RG analysis is\nthat only the effective (IR) 2-point function is known, which requires setting\nthe problem with care. Our aim is to provide a useful formalism to investigate\nneural networks behavior beyond the large-width limit (i.e.~far from Gaussian\nlimit) in a nonperturbative fashion. A major result of our analysis is that\nchanging the standard deviation of the neural network weight distribution can\nbe interpreted as a renormalization flow in the space of networks. We focus on\ntranslations invariant kernels and provide preliminary numerical results.",

          "description": "One of the challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is\ndesigning efficient learning algorithms for a large system in which each agent\nhas only limited or partial information of the entire system. In this system,\nit is desirable to learn policies of a decentralized type. A recent and\npromising paradigm to analyze such decentralized MARL is to take network\nstructures into consideration. While exciting progress has been made to analyze\ndecentralized MARL with the network of agents, often found in social networks\nand team video games, little is known theoretically for decentralized MARL with\nthe network of states, frequently used for modeling self-driving vehicles,\nride-sharing, and data and traffic routing.\n\nThis paper proposes a framework called localized training and decentralized\nexecution to study MARL with network of states, with homogeneous (a.k.a.\nmean-field type) agents. Localized training means that agents only need to\ncollect local information in their neighboring states during the training\nphase; decentralized execution implies that, after the training stage, agents\ncan execute the learned decentralized policies, which only requires knowledge\nof the agents' current states. The key idea is to utilize the homogeneity of\nagents and regroup them according to their states, thus the formulation of a\nnetworked Markov decision process with teams of agents, enabling the update of\nthe Q-function in a localized fashion. In order to design an efficient and\nscalable reinforcement learning algorithm under such a framework, we adopt the\nactor-critic approach with over-parameterized neural networks, and establish\nthe convergence and sample complexity for our algorithm, shown to be scalable\nwith respect to the size of both agents and states.",

          "description": "Hybrid FSO/RF system requires an efficient FSO and RF link switching\nmechanism to improve the system capacity by realizing the complementary\nbenefits of both the links. The dynamics of network conditions, such as fog,\ndust, and sand storms compound the link switching problem and control\ncomplexity. To address this problem, we initiate the study of deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) for link switching of hybrid FSO/RF systems.\nSpecifically, in this work, we focus on actor-critic called Actor/Critic-FSO/RF\nand Deep-Q network (DQN) called DQN-FSO/RF for FSO/RF link switching under\natmospheric turbulences. To formulate the problem, we define the state, action,\nand reward function of a hybrid FSO/RF system. DQN-FSO/RF frequently updates\nthe deployed policy that interacts with the environment in a hybrid FSO/RF\nsystem, resulting in high switching costs. To overcome this, we lift this\nproblem to ensemble consensus-based representation learning for deep\nreinforcement called DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF. The proposed novel DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF\nDRL approach uses consensus learned features representations based on an\nensemble of asynchronous threads to update the deployed policy. Experimental\nresults corroborate that the proposed DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF's consensus-learned\nfeatures switching achieves better performance than Actor/Critic-FSO/RF,\nDQN-FSO/RF, and MyOpic for FSO/RF link switching while keeping the switching\ncost significantly low.",

          "description": "In this paper, we argue that the unsatisfactory out-of-distribution (OOD)\ndetection performance of neural networks is mainly due to the SoftMax loss\nanisotropy and propensity to produce low entropy probability distributions in\ndisagreement with the principle of maximum entropy. Current out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection approaches usually do not directly fix the SoftMax loss\ndrawbacks, but rather build techniques to circumvent it. Unfortunately, those\nmethods usually produce undesired side effects (e.g., classification accuracy\ndrop, additional hyperparameters, slower inferences, and collecting extra\ndata). In the opposite direction, we propose replacing SoftMax loss with a\nnovel loss function that does not suffer from the mentioned weaknesses. The\nproposed IsoMax loss is isotropic (exclusively distance-based) and provides\nhigh entropy posterior probability distributions. Replacing the SoftMax loss by\nIsoMax loss requires no model or training changes. Additionally, the models\ntrained with IsoMax loss produce as fast and energy-efficient inferences as\nthose trained using SoftMax loss. Moreover, no classification accuracy drop is\nobserved. The proposed method does not rely on outlier/background data,\nhyperparameter tuning, temperature calibration, feature extraction, metric\nlearning, adversarial training, ensemble procedures, or generative models. Our\nexperiments showed that IsoMax loss works as a seamless SoftMax loss drop-in\nreplacement that significantly improves neural networks' OOD detection\nperformance. Hence, it may be used as a baseline OOD detection approach to be\ncombined with current or future OOD detection techniques to achieve even higher\nresults.",

          "description": "Detection transformers have recently shown promising object detection results\nand attracted increasing attention. However, how to develop effective domain\nadaptation techniques to improve its cross-domain performance remains\nunexplored and unclear. In this paper, we delve into this topic and empirically\nfind that direct feature distribution alignment on the CNN backbone only brings\nlimited improvements, as it does not guarantee domain-invariant sequence\nfeatures in the transformer for prediction. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel Sequence Feature Alignment (SFA) method that is specially designed for\nthe adaptation of detection transformers. Technically, SFA consists of a domain\nquery-based feature alignment (DQFA) module and a token-wise feature alignment\n(TDA) module. In DQFA, a novel domain query is used to aggregate and align\nglobal context from the token sequence of both domains. DQFA reduces the domain\ndiscrepancy in global feature representations and object relations when\ndeploying in the transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Meanwhile, TDA\naligns token features in the sequence from both domains, which reduces the\ndomain gaps in local and instance-level feature representations in the\ntransformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Besides, a novel bipartite\nmatching consistency loss is proposed to enhance the feature discriminability\nfor robust object detection. Experiments on three challenging benchmarks show\nthat SFA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptive object detection methods.\nCode has been made available at: https://github.com/encounter1997/SFA.",

This is a practically relevant and\nchallenging problem which current methods are able to solve only under strong\nassumptions on the training set. Here we propose a new method that requires\nminimal assumptions on the data, and prove reconstruction rates that depend on\nthe number of training points and the noise level. We show that, in the regime\nof \"many\" training data, the method is minimax optimal. The proposed method\nemploys a type of convolutional neural networks (U-nets) and empirical risk\nminimization in order to \"fit\" the unknown operator. In a nutshell, our\napproach is based on two ideas: the first is to relate U-nets to multiscale\ndecompositions such as wavelets, thereby linking them to the existing theory,\nand the second is to use the hierarchical structure of U-nets and the low\nnumber of parameters of convolutional neural nets to prove entropy bounds that\nare practically useful. A significant difference with the existing works on\nneural networks in nonparametric statistics is that we use them to approximate\noperators and not functions, which we argue is mathematically more natural and\ntechnically more convenient.",

          "description": "Over the last few decades, artificial intelligence research has made\ntremendous strides, but it still heavily relies on fixed datasets in stationary\nenvironments. Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines\nhow AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data\nin the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as\ndeepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current\nmultimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can\ndetect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to\ntheir reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in\nthis work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks' learning dynamics,\nemphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose\nContinual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the\nconcept of Continual Learning (CL), Representation Learning (RL), and Knowledge\nDistillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain adaptation\ntasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets, while\neffectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student model\nsetting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method is\nefficient at domain adaptation to detect low-quality deepfakes videos and\nGAN-generated images from several datasets, outperforming the-state-of-art\nbaseline methods.",

We then\nuse our new technique along with these connections to prove several new\nstructural results in these areas, including:\n\n$\\bullet$ A function is a positive definite Manhattan kernel if and only if\nit is a completely monotone function. These kernels are widely used across\nmachine learning; one example is the Laplace kernel which is widely used in\nmachine learning for chemistry.\n\n$\\bullet$ A function transforms Manhattan distances to Manhattan distances if\nand only if it is a Bernstein function.

          "description": "Catastrophic forgetting (CF) happens whenever a neural network overwrites\npast knowledge while being trained on new tasks. Common techniques to handle CF\ninclude regularization of the weights (using, e.g., their importance on past\ntasks), and rehearsal strategies, where the network is constantly re-trained on\npast data. Generative models have also been applied for the latter, in order to\nhave endless sources of data. In this paper, we propose a novel method that\ncombines the strengths of regularization and generative-based rehearsal\napproaches. Our generative model consists of a normalizing flow (NF), a\nprobabilistic and invertible neural network, trained on the internal embeddings\nof the network. By keeping a single NF conditioned on the task, we show that\nour memory overhead remains constant. In addition, exploiting the invertibility\nof the NF, we propose a simple approach to regularize the network's embeddings\nwith respect to past tasks. We show that our method performs favorably with\nrespect to state-of-the-art approaches in the literature, with bounded\ncomputational power and memory overheads.",

          "description": "Software testing is often hindered where it is impossible or impractical to\ndetermine the correctness of the behaviour or output of the software under test\n(SUT), a situation known as the oracle problem. An example of an area facing\nthe oracle problem is automatic image classification, using machine learning to\nclassify an input image as one of a set of predefined classes. An approach to\nsoftware testing that alleviates the oracle problem is metamorphic testing\n(MT). While traditional software testing examines the correctness of individual\ntest cases, MT instead examines the relations amongst multiple executions of\ntest cases and their outputs. These relations are called metamorphic relations\n(MRs): if an MR is found to be violated, then a fault must exist in the SUT.\nThis paper examines the problem of classifying images containing visually\nhidden markers called Artcodes, and applies MT to verify and enhance the\ntrained classifiers. This paper further examines two MRs, Separation and\nOcclusion, and reports on their capability in verifying the image\nclassification using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in conjunction with\nthree other statistical analysis methods: t-test (for unequal variances),\nKruskal-Wallis test, and Dunnett's test. In addition to our previously-studied\nclassifier, that used Random Forests, we introduce a new classifier that uses a\nsupport vector machine, and present its MR-augmented version. Experimental\nevaluations across a number of performance metrics show that the augmented\nclassifiers can achieve better performance than non-augmented classifiers. This\npaper also analyses how the enhanced performance is obtained.",

          "description": "Contrastive learning has revolutionized self-supervised image representation\nlearning field, and recently been adapted to video domain. One of the greatest\nadvantages of contrastive learning is that it allows us to flexibly define\npowerful loss objectives as long as we can find a reasonable way to formulate\npositive and negative samples to contrast. However, existing approaches rely\nheavily on the short-range spatiotemporal salience to form clip-level\ncontrastive signals, thus limit themselves from using global context. In this\npaper, we propose a new video-level contrastive learning method based on\nsegments to formulate positive pairs. Our formulation is able to capture global\ncontext in a video, thus robust to temporal content change. We also incorporate\na temporal order regularization term to enforce the inherent sequential\nstructure of videos. Extensive experiments show that our video-level\ncontrastive learning framework (VCLR) is able to outperform previous\nstate-of-the-arts on five video datasets for downstream action classification,\naction localization and video retrieval.

          "description": "Unsupervised learning is just at a tipping point where it could really take\noff. Among these approaches, contrastive learning has seen tremendous progress\nand led to state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we construct a novel\nprobabilistic graphical model that effectively incorporates the low rank\npromoting prior into the framework of contrastive learning, referred to as\nLORAC. In contrast to the existing conventional self-supervised approaches that\nonly considers independent learning, our hypothesis explicitly requires that\nall the samples belonging to the same instance class lie on the same subspace\nwith small dimension. This heuristic poses particular joint learning\nconstraints to reduce the degree of freedom of the problem during the search of\nthe optimal network parameterization. Most importantly, we argue that the low\nrank prior employed here is not unique, and many different priors can be\ninvoked in a similar probabilistic way, corresponding to different hypotheses\nabout underlying truth behind the contrastive features.

          "description": "This paper presents Sinsy, a deep neural network (DNN)-based singing voice\nsynthesis (SVS) system. In recent years, DNNs have been utilized in statistical\nparametric SVS systems, and DNN-based SVS systems have demonstrated better\nperformance than conventional hidden Markov model-based ones. SVS systems are\nrequired to synthesize a singing voice with pitch and timing that strictly\nfollow a given musical score. Additionally, singing expressions that are not\ndescribed on the musical score, such as vibrato and timing fluctuations, should\nbe reproduced. The proposed system is composed of four modules: a time-lag\nmodel, a duration model, an acoustic model, and a vocoder, and singing voices\ncan be synthesized taking these characteristics of singing voices into account.\nTo better model a singing voice, the proposed system incorporates improved\napproaches to modeling pitch and vibrato and better training criteria into the\nacoustic model. In addition, we incorporated PeriodNet, a non-autoregressive\nneural vocoder with robustness for the pitch, into our systems to generate a\nhigh-fidelity singing voice waveform. Moreover, we propose automatic pitch\ncorrection techniques for DNN-based SVS to synthesize singing voices with\ncorrect pitch even if the training data has out-of-tune phrases. Experimental\nresults show our system can synthesize a singing voice with better timing, more\nnatural vibrato, and correct pitch, and it can achieve better mean opinion\nscores in subjective evaluation tests.",

          "description": "Accurate forecasting of traffic conditions is critical for improving safety,\nstability, and efficiency of a city transportation system. In reality, it is\nchallenging to produce accurate traffic forecasts due to the complex and\ndynamic spatiotemporal correlations. Most existing works only consider partial\ncharacteristics and features of traffic data, and result in unsatisfactory\nperformances on modeling and forecasting. In this paper, we propose a periodic\nspatial-temporal deep neural network (PSTN) with three pivotal modules to\nimprove the forecasting performance of traffic conditions through a novel\nintegration of three types of information. First, the historical traffic\ninformation is folded and fed into a module consisting of a graph convolutional\nnetwork and a temporal convolutional network. Second, the recent traffic\ninformation together with the historical output passes through the second\nmodule consisting of a graph convolutional network and a gated recurrent unit\nframework. Finally, a multi-layer perceptron is applied to process the\nauxiliary road attributes and output the final predictions. Experimental\nresults on two publicly accessible real-world urban traffic data sets show that\nthe proposed PSTN outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks by significant\nmargins for short-term traffic conditions forecasting",

For this purpose, we re-frame the formalism of Neural Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODEs) to the constraints of spintronics: few measured\noutputs, multiple inputs and internal parameters. We demonstrate with\nSpin-Neural ODEs an acceleration factor over 200 compared to micromagnetic\nsimulations for a complex problem -- the simulation of a reservoir computer\nmade of magnetic skyrmions (20 minutes compared to three days). In a second\nrealization, we show that we can predict the noisy response of experimental\nspintronic nano-oscillators to varying inputs after training Spin-Neural ODEs\non five milliseconds of their measured response to different excitations.\nSpin-Neural ODE is a disruptive tool for developing spintronic applications in\ncomplement to micromagnetic simulations, which are time-consuming and cannot\nfit experiments when noise or imperfections are present.

          "description": "Federated Learning (FL) has evolved as a promising technique to handle\ndistributed machine learning across edge devices. A single neural network (NN)\nthat optimises a global objective is generally learned in most work in FL,\nwhich could be suboptimal for edge devices. Although works finding a NN\npersonalised for edge device specific tasks exist, they lack generalisation\nand/or convergence guarantees. In this paper, a novel communication efficient\nFL algorithm for personalised learning in a wireless setting with guarantees is\npresented. The algorithm relies on finding a ``better`` empirical estimate of\nlosses at each device, using a weighted average of the losses across different\ndevices. It is devised from a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bound on the\ntrue loss in terms of the proposed empirical loss and is bounded by (i) the\nRademacher complexity, (ii) the discrepancy, (iii) and a penalty term. Using a\nsigned gradient feedback to find a personalised NN at each device, it is also\nproven to converge in a Rayleigh flat fading (in the uplink) channel, at a rate\nof the order max{1/SNR,1/sqrt(T)} Experimental results show that the proposed\nalgorithm outperforms locally trained devices as well as the conventionally\nused FedAvg and FedSGD algorithms under practical SNR regimes.",

          "description": "The exploration/exploitation trade-off is an inherent challenge in\ndata-driven and adaptive control. Though this trade-off has been studied for\nmulti-armed bandits, reinforcement learning (RL) for finite Markov chains, and\nRL for linear control systems; it is less well-studied for learning-based\ncontrol of nonlinear control systems. A significant theoretical challenge in\nthe nonlinear setting is that, unlike the linear case, there is no explicit\ncharacterization of an optimal controller for a given set of cost and system\nparameters. We propose in this paper the use of a finite-horizon oracle\ncontroller with perfect knowledge of all system parameters as a reference for\noptimal control actions. First, this allows us to propose a new regret notion\nwith respect to this oracle finite-horizon controller. Second, this allows us\nto develop learning-based policies that we prove achieve low regret (i.e.,\nsquare-root regret up to a log-squared factor) with respect to this oracle\nfinite-horizon controller. This policy is developed in the context of\nlearning-based model predictive control (LBMPC). We conduct a statistical\nanalysis to prove finite sample concentration bounds for the estimation step of\nour policy, and then we perform a control-theoretic analysis using techniques\nfrom MPC- and optimization-theory to show this policy ensures closed-loop\nstability and achieves low regret. We conclude with numerical experiments on a\nmodel of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems that show\nthe low regret of our policy in a setting where the cost function is\npartially-unknown to the controller.",

It is therefore an open\nresearch topic whether and how neural network-based architectures can be\ndeployed for systematic reasoning. Many studies have shown evidence for poor\ngeneralization, but they often work with abstract data or are limited to\nsingle-channel input.

To investigate\ncompositional generalization in a multimodal setting, we generate an extensible\ndataset with multimodal input sequences from simulation. We investigate the\ninfluence of the underlying training data distribution on compostional\ngeneralization in a minimal LSTM-based network trained in a supervised, time\ncontinuous setting. We find compositional generalization to fail in simple\nsetups while improving with the number of objects, actions, and particularly\nwith a lot of color overlaps between objects.

          "description": "In modern deep learning, there is a recent and growing literature on the\ninterplay between large-width asymptotics for deep Gaussian neural networks\n(NNs), i.e. deep NNs with Gaussian-distributed weights, and classes of Gaussian\nstochastic processes (SPs). Such an interplay has proved to be critical in\nseveral contexts of practical interest, e.g. Bayesian inference under Gaussian\nSP priors, kernel regression for infinite-wide deep NNs trained via gradient\ndescent, and information propagation within infinite-wide NNs. Motivated by\nempirical analysis, showing the potential of replacing Gaussian distributions\nwith Stable distributions for the NN's weights, in this paper we investigate\nlarge-width asymptotics for (fully connected) feed-forward deep Stable NNs,\ni.e. deep NNs with Stable-distributed weights. First, we show that as the width\ngoes to infinity jointly over the NN's layers, a suitable rescaled deep Stable\nNN converges weakly to a Stable SP whose distribution is characterized\nrecursively through the NN's layers. Because of the non-triangular NN's\nstructure, this is a non-standard asymptotic problem, to which we propose a\nnovel and self-contained inductive approach, which may be of independent\ninterest. Then, we establish sup-norm convergence rates of a deep Stable NN to\na Stable SP, quantifying the critical difference between the settings of\n``joint growth\" and ``sequential growth\" of the width over the NN's layers.

We show that these\nrepresentations are able to identify a variety of morphological characteristics\nacross three cancer types: Breast, colon, and lung. This is supported by 1) the\nseparation of morphologic characteristics in the latent space; 2) the ability\nto classify tissue type with logistic regression using latent representations,\nwith an AUC of 0.97 and 85% accuracy, comparable to supervised deep models; 3)\nthe ability to predict the presence of tumor in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using\nmultiple instance learning (MIL), achieving an AUC of 0.98 and 94% accuracy.\n\nOur results show that our model captures distinct phenotypic characteristics\nof real tissue samples, paving the way for further understanding of tumor\nprogression and tumor micro-environment, and ultimately refining\nhistopathological classification for diagnosis and treatment.

          "description": "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent networks are frequently used for\ntasks involving time sequential data such as speech recognition. However, it is\ndifficult to deploy these networks on hardware to achieve high throughput and\nlow latency because the fully-connected structure makes LSTM networks a\nmemory-bounded algorithm. Previous work in LSTM accelerators either exploited\nweight spatial sparsity or temporal sparsity. In this paper, we present a new\naccelerator called \"Spartus\" that exploits spatio-temporal sparsity to achieve\nultra-low latency inference. The spatial sparsity was induced using our\nproposed pruning method called Column-Balanced Targeted Dropout (CBTD) that\nleads to structured sparse weight matrices benefiting workload balance. It\nachieved up to 96% weight sparsity with negligible accuracy difference for an\nLSTM network trained on a TIMIT phone recognition task. To induce temporal\nsparsity in LSTM, we create the DeltaLSTM by extending the previous DeltaGRU\nmethod to the LSTM network. This combined sparsity saves on weight memory\naccess and associated arithmetic operations simultaneously. Spartus was\nimplemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7100 FPGA. The per-sample latency for a single\nDeltaLSTM layer of 1024 neurons running on Spartus is 1 us. Spartus achieved\n9.4 TOp/s effective batch-1 throughput and 1.1 TOp/J energy efficiency, which\nare respectively 4X and 7X higher than the previous state-of-the-art.",

Such methods\ncritically rely on those embeddings having a similar structure, but it was\nrecently shown that the separate training in different languages causes\ndepartures from this assumption. In this paper, we propose an alternative\napproach that does not have this limitation, while requiring a weak seed\ndictionary (e.g., a list of identical words) as the only form of supervision.\nRather than aligning two fixed embedding spaces, our method works by fixing the\ntarget language embeddings, and learning a new set of embeddings for the source\nlanguage that are aligned with them. To that end, we use an extension of\nskip-gram that leverages translated context words as anchor points, and\nincorporates self-learning and iterative restarts to reduce the dependency on\nthe initial dictionary. Our approach outperforms conventional mapping methods\non bilingual lexicon induction, and obtains competitive results in the\ndownstream XNLI task.",

Since the\nJeffreys divergence between the ubiquitous Gaussian Mixture Models are not\navailable in closed-form, many techniques with various pros and cons have been\nproposed in the literature to either (i) estimate, (ii) approximate, or (iii)\nlower and/or upper bound this divergence. In this work, we propose a simple yet\nfast heuristic to approximate the Jeffreys divergence between two univariate\nGMMs of arbitrary number of components. The heuristic relies on converting GMMs\ninto pairs of dually parameterized probability densities belonging to\nexponential families. In particular, we consider Exponential-Polynomial\nDensities, and design a goodness-of-fit criterion to measure the dissimilarity\nbetween a GMM and a EPD which is a generalization of the Hyv\\\"arinen\ndivergence. This criterion allows one to select the orders of the EPDs to\napproximate the GMMs. We demonstrate experimentally that the computational time\nof our heuristic improves over the stochastic Monte Carlo estimation baseline\nby several orders of magnitude while approximating reasonably well the Jeffreys\ndivergence, specially when the univariate mixtures have a small number of\nmodes.",

This preset and universal Gaussian noise variance is\nsuboptimal since different data points have different margins and the local\nproperties of the base model vary across the input examples.

          "description": "The early detection of cancer is a challenging problem in medicine. The blood\nsera of cancer patients are enriched with heterogeneous secretory lipid bound\nextracellular vesicles (EVs), which present a complex repertoire of information\nand biomarkers, representing their cell of origin, that are being currently\nstudied in the field of liquid biopsy and cancer screening. Vibrational\nspectroscopies provide non-invasive approaches for the assessment of structural\nand biophysical properties in complex biological samples. In this study,\nmultiple Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on the EVs extracted\nfrom the blood sera of 9 patients consisting of four different cancer subtypes\n(colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and pancreatic\ncancer) and five healthy patients (controls). FTIR(Fourier Transform Infrared)\nspectroscopy measurements were performed as a complementary approach to Raman\nanalysis, on two of the four cancer subtypes.\n\nThe AdaBoost Random Forest Classifier, Decision Trees, and Support Vector\nMachines (SVM) distinguished the baseline corrected Raman spectra of cancer EVs\nfrom those of healthy controls (18 spectra) with a classification accuracy of\ngreater than 90% when reduced to a spectral frequency range of 1800 to 1940\ninverse cm, and subjected to a 0.5 training/testing split. FTIR classification\naccuracy on 14 spectra showed an 80% classification accuracy. Our findings\ndemonstrate that basic machine learning algorithms are powerful tools to\ndistinguish the complex vibrational spectra of cancer patient EVs from those of\nhealthy patients. These experimental methods hold promise as valid and\nefficient liquid biopsy for machine intelligence-assisted early cancer\nscreening.",

The required smoothing properties can be different or even\ncontradictive among different tasks. Nevertheless, the inherent smoothing\nnature of one smoothing operator is usually fixed and thus cannot meet the\nvarious requirements of different applications. In this paper, we first\nintroduce the truncated Huber penalty function which shows strong flexibility\nunder different parameter settings. A generalized framework is then proposed\nwith the introduced truncated Huber penalty function. When combined with its\nstrong flexibility, our framework is able to achieve diverse smoothing natures\nwhere contradictive smoothing behaviors can even be achieved. It can also yield\nthe smoothing behavior that can seldom be achieved by previous methods, and\nsuperior performance is thus achieved in challenging cases. These together\nenable our framework capable of a range of applications and able to outperform\nthe state-of-the-art approaches in several tasks, such as image detail\nenhancement, clip-art compression artifacts removal, guided depth map\nrestoration, image texture removal, etc. In addition, an efficient numerical\nsolution is provided and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed even the\noptimization framework is non-convex and non-smooth.

The active inference\nframework, an approach to sequential decision making recently developed in\nneuroscience for understanding human and animal behaviour, is distinguished by\nits sophisticated strategy for resolving the exploration-exploitation\ntrade-off. This makes active inference an exciting alternative to already\nestablished bandit algorithms. Here we derive an efficient and scalable\napproximate active inference algorithm and compare it to two state-of-the-art\nbandit algorithms: Bayesian upper confidence bound and optimistic Thompson\nsampling. This comparison is done on two types of bandit problems: a stationary\nand a dynamic switching bandit. Our empirical evaluation shows that the active\ninference algorithm does not produce efficient long-term behaviour in\nstationary bandits. However, in the more challenging switching bandit problem\nactive inference performs substantially better than the two state-of-the-art\nbandit algorithms. The results open exciting venues for further research in\ntheoretical and applied machine learning, as well as lend additional\ncredibility to active inference as a general framework for studying human and\nanimal behaviour.",

          "description": "Recent work has made significant progress in helping users to automate single\ndata preparation steps, such as string-transformations and table-manipulation\noperators (e.g., Join, GroupBy, Pivot, etc.). We in this work propose to\nautomate multiple such steps end-to-end, by synthesizing complex data pipelines\nwith both string transformations and table-manipulation operators. We propose a\nnovel \"by-target\" paradigm that allows users to easily specify the desired\npipeline, which is a significant departure from the traditional by-example\nparadigm. Using by-target, users would provide input tables (e.g., csv or json\nfiles), and point us to a \"target table\" (e.g., an existing database table or\nBI dashboard) to demonstrate how the output from the desired pipeline would\nschematically \"look like\". While the problem is seemingly underspecified, our\nunique insight is that implicit table constraints such as FDs and keys can be\nexploited to significantly constrain the space to make the problem tractable.\nWe develop an Auto-Pipeline system that learns to synthesize pipelines using\nreinforcement learning and search.

          "description": "Assessing an AI agent that can converse in human language and understand\nvisual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor\ncorrect syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,\nwhere an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)\nmetric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a\nsingle human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:\nthe ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence\n(e.g., `yeah' and `yes'). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative\ngain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct\nanswers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually\napplicable uncertain answers such as `I don't know. Crafting a model that\nexcels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should\nanswer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To\naddress this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that\ncan merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep\nmost MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG\nstate-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%).

Especially for image classification tasks, many\nstate-of-the-art tools to explain such classifiers rely on visual highlighting\nof important areas of the input data. Contrary, counterfactual explanation\nsystems try to enable a counterfactual reasoning by modifying the input image\nin a way such that the classifier would have made a different prediction. By\ndoing so, the users of counterfactual explanation systems are equipped with a\ncompletely different kind of explanatory information. However, methods for\ngenerating realistic counterfactual explanations for image classifiers are\nstill rare. Especially in medical contexts, where relevant information often\nconsists of textural and structural information, high-quality counterfactual\nimages have the potential to give meaningful insights into decision processes.\nIn this work, we present GANterfactual, an approach to generate such\ncounterfactual image explanations based on adversarial image-to-image\ntranslation techniques. Additionally, we conduct a user study to evaluate our\napproach in an exemplary medical use case. Our results show that, in the chosen\nmedical use-case, counterfactual explanations lead to significantly better\nresults regarding mental models, explanation satisfaction, trust, emotions, and\nself-efficacy than two state-of-the-art systems that work with saliency maps,\nnamely LIME and LRP.",

          "description": "Recommender systems research tends to evaluate model performance offline and\non randomly sampled targets, yet the same systems are later used to predict\nuser behavior sequentially from a fixed point in time. Simulating online\nrecommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy\nbetween online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline\nevaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model\nis deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how\nomitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads\nto false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation\nprotocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal\ncontext. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal\ncontext in existing models: we introduce it in a multi-objective approach to\ntraditionally time-unaware recommender systems and confirm its advantage via\nthe proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we validate that the Pareto Fronts\nobtained with the added objective dominate those produced by state-of-the-art\nmodels that are only optimized for accuracy on three real-world publicly\navailable datasets. The results show that including our temporal objective can\nimprove recall@20 by up to 20%.",

          "description": "While safe reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for many practical\napplications like robotics or autonomous cars, current approaches require\nspecifying constraints in mathematical form. Such specifications demand domain\nexpertise, limiting the adoption of safe RL. In this paper, we propose learning\nto interpret natural language constraints for safe RL. To this end, we first\nintroduce HazardWorld, a new multi-task benchmark that requires an agent to\noptimize reward while not violating constraints specified in free-form text. We\nthen develop an agent with a modular architecture that can interpret and adhere\nto such textual constraints while learning new tasks. Our model consists of (1)\na constraint interpreter that encodes textual constraints into spatial and\ntemporal representations of forbidden states, and (2) a policy network that\nuses these representations to produce a policy achieving minimal constraint\nviolations during training. Across different domains in HazardWorld, we show\nthat our method achieves higher rewards (up to11x) and fewer constraint\nviolations (by 1.8x) compared to existing approaches. However, in terms of\nabsolute performance, HazardWorld still poses significant challenges for agents\nto learn efficiently, motivating the need for future work.",

          "description": "Deep learning for recommendation data is the one of the most pervasive and\nchallenging AI workload in recent times. State-of-the-art recommendation models\nare one of the largest models rivalling the likes of GPT-3 and Switch\nTransformer. Challenges in deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) stem from\nlearning dense embeddings for each of the categorical values. These embedding\ntables in industrial scale models can be as large as hundreds of terabytes.\nSuch large models lead to a plethora of engineering challenges, not to mention\nprohibitive communication overheads, and slower training and inference times.\nOf these, slower inference time directly impacts user experience. Model\ncompression for DLRM is gaining traction and the community has recently shown\nimpressive compression results. In this paper, we present Random Offset Block\nEmbedding Array (ROBE) as a low memory alternative to embedding tables which\nprovide orders of magnitude reduction in memory usage while maintaining\naccuracy and boosting execution speed. ROBE is a simple fundamental approach in\nimproving both cache performance and the variance of randomized hashing, which\ncould be of independent interest in itself. We demonstrate that we can\nsuccessfully train DLRM models with same accuracy while using $1000 \\times$\nless memory. A $1000\\times$ compressed model directly results in faster\ninference without any engineering. In particular, we show that we can train\nDLRM model using ROBE Array of size 100MB on a single GPU to achieve AUC of\n0.8025 or higher as required by official MLPerf CriteoTB benchmark DLRM model\nof 100GB while achieving about $2.7\\times$ (170\\%) improvement in inference\nthroughput.",

For Gaussian measurements, there are\nclassical tools such as factor analysis or principal component analysis with a\nwell-established theory and fast algorithms. Generalized Linear Latent Variable\nmodels (GLLVM) generalize such factor models to non-Gaussian responses.\nHowever, current algorithms for estimating model parameters in GLLVMs require\nintensive computation and do not scale to large datasets with thousands of\nobservational units or responses. In this article, we propose a new approach\nfor fitting GLLVMs to such high-volume, high-dimensional datasets. We\napproximate the likelihood using penalized quasi-likelihood and use a Newton\nmethod and Fisher scoring to learn the model parameters. Our method greatly\nreduces the computation time and can be easily parallelized, enabling\nfactorization at unprecedented scale using commodity hardware.

          "description": "In clinical practice and biomedical research, measurements are often\ncollected sparsely and irregularly in time while the data acquisition is\nexpensive and inconvenient. Examples include measurements of spine bone mineral\ndensity, cancer growth through mammography or biopsy, a progression of\ndefective vision, or assessment of gait in patients with neurological\ndisorders. Since the data collection is often costly and inconvenient,\nestimation of progression from sparse observations is of great interest for\npractitioners.\n\nFrom the statistical standpoint, such data is often analyzed in the context\nof a mixed-effect model where time is treated as both a fixed-effect\n(population progression curve) and a random-effect (individual variability).\nAlternatively, researchers analyze Gaussian processes or functional data where\nobservations are assumed to be drawn from a certain distribution of processes.\nThese models are flexible but rely on probabilistic assumptions, require very\ncareful implementation, specific to the given problem, and tend to be slow in\npractice.\n\nIn this study, we propose an alternative elementary framework for analyzing\nlongitudinal data, relying on matrix completion. Our method yields estimates of\nprogression curves by iterative application of the Singular Value\nDecomposition.

As it relies on existing tools\nfor matrix algebra it is efficient and easy to implement.\n\nWe apply our methods to understand trends of progression of motor impairment\nin children with Cerebral Palsy.

Unlike\nprevious methods, we use alteration along three orthogonal axes to pre-train\nTransformer Encoders on a large amount of unlabeled speech. The model learns\nthrough the reconstruction of acoustic frames from their altered counterpart,\nwhere we use a stochastic policy to alter along various dimensions: time,\nfrequency, and magnitude. TERA can be used for speech representations\nextraction or fine-tuning with downstream models. We evaluate TERA on several\ndownstream tasks, including phoneme classification, keyword spotting, speaker\nrecognition, and speech recognition. We present a large-scale comparison of\nvarious self-supervised models. TERA achieves strong performance in the\ncomparison by improving upon surface features and outperforming previous\nmodels. In our experiments, we study the effect of applying different\nalteration techniques, pre-training on more data, and pre-training on various\nfeatures.

As\ndesigning reward functions can be extremely challenging, a more promising\napproach is to directly learn reward functions from human teachers.\nImportantly, data from human teachers can be collected either passively or\nactively in a variety of forms: passive data sources include demonstrations,\n(e.g., kinesthetic guidance), whereas preferences (e.g., comparative rankings)\nare actively elicited. Prior research has independently applied reward learning\nto these different data sources. However, there exist many domains where\nmultiple sources are complementary and expressive. Motivated by this general\nproblem, we present a framework to integrate multiple sources of information,\nwhich are either passively or actively collected from human users. In\nparticular, we present an algorithm that first utilizes user demonstrations to\ninitialize a belief about the reward function, and then actively probes the\nuser with preference queries to zero-in on their true reward. This algorithm\nnot only enables us combine multiple data sources, but it also informs the\nrobot when it should leverage each type of information.

In this paper, we analyze and assess this potential, in particular,\nfocusing on video comments as a source of feedback. In a case study, we\nanalyzed 4505 comments on a vision video from YouTube. We found that the video\nsolicited 2770 comments from 2660 viewers in four days. This is more than 50%\nof all comments the video received in four years. Even though only a certain\nfraction of these comments are relevant to RE, the relevant comments address\ntypical intentions and topics of user feedback, such as feature request or\nproblem report. Besides the typical user feedback categories, we found more\nthan 300 comments that address the topic safety, which has not appeared in\nprevious analyses of user feedback. In an automated analysis, we compared the\nperformance of three machine learning algorithms on classifying the video\ncomments. Despite certain differences, the algorithms classified the video\ncomments well. Based on these findings, we conclude that the use of vision\nvideos for CrowdRE has a large potential.

On MS COCO, the\ndetection mAPs for all 8 black-box architectures are more than halved and the\nsegmentation mAPs are also significantly influenced. Given the great\ntransferability of RAD, we generate the first adversarial dataset for object\ndetection and instance segmentation, i.e., Adversarial Objects in COntext\n(AOCO), which helps to quickly evaluate and improve the robustness of\ndetectors.",

          "description": "The physical, black-box hard-label setting is arguably the most realistic\nthreat model for cyber-physical vision systems. In this setting, the attacker\nonly has query access to the model and only receives the top-1 class label\nwithout confidence information. Creating small physical stickers that are\nrobust to environmental variation is difficult in the discrete and\ndiscontinuous hard-label space because the attack must both design a small\nshape to perturb within and find robust noise to fill it with. Unfortunately,\nwe find that existing $\\ell_2$ or $\\ell_\\infty$ minimizing hard-label attacks\ndo not easily extend to finding such robust physical perturbation attacks.\nThus, we propose GRAPHITE, the first algorithm for hard-label physical attacks\non computer vision models. We show that \"survivability\", an estimate of\nphysical variation robustness, can be used in new ways to generate small masks\nand is a sufficiently smooth function to optimize with gradient-free\noptimization. We use GRAPHITE to attack a traffic sign classifier and a\npublicly-available Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) tool using only\nquery access. We evaluate both tools in real-world field tests to measure its\nphysical-world robustness. We successfully cause a Stop sign to be\nmisclassified as a Speed Limit 30 km/hr sign in 95.7% of physical images and\ncause errors in 75% of physical images for the ALPR tool.",

These affine-invariant algorithms are trivial\nto construct, require no hand-tuning, and can easily be implemented in parallel\ncomputing environments. Empirical tests show that Ensemble Slice Sampling can\nimprove efficiency by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional\nMCMC methods on a broad range of highly correlated target distributions. In\ncases of strongly multimodal target distributions, Ensemble Slice Sampling can\nsample efficiently even in high dimensions.

Compelling\nattempts have been made in quantifying the uncertainty in image segmentation\narchitectures, e.g. to learn a density segmentation model conditioned on the\ninput image. Typical work in this field restricts these learnt densities to be\nstrictly Gaussian. In this paper, we propose to use a more flexible approach by\nintroducing Normalizing Flows (NFs), which enables the learnt densities to be\nmore complex and facilitate more accurate modeling for uncertainty. We prove\nthis hypothesis by adopting the Probabilistic U-Net and augmenting the\nposterior density with an NF, allowing it to be more expressive. Our\nqualitative as well as quantitative (GED and IoU) evaluations on the\nmulti-annotated and single-annotated LIDC-IDRI and Kvasir-SEG segmentation\ndatasets, respectively, show a clear improvement. This is mostly apparent in\nthe quantification of aleatoric uncertainty and the increased predictive\nperformance of up to 14 percent. This result strongly indicates that a more\nflexible density model should be seriously considered in architectures that\nattempt to capture segmentation ambiguity through density modeling. The benefit\nof this improved modeling will increase human confidence in annotation and\nsegmentation, and enable eager adoption of the technology in practice.",

          "description": "Contrastive learning is effective at learning useful representations without\nsupervision. Yet contrastive learning is susceptible to shortcuts -- i.e., it\nmay learn shortcut features irrelevant to the downstream task and discard\nrelevant information. Past work has addressed this limitation via handcrafted\ndata augmentations that eliminate the shortcut. However, handcrafted\naugmentations are infeasible for data modalities that are not interpretable by\nhumans (e.g., radio signals). Further, even when the modality is interpretable\n(e.g., RGB), sometimes eliminating the shortcut information may be undesirable.\nFor example, in multi-attribute classification, information related to one\nattribute may act as a shortcut around other attributes. This paper presents\nreconstructive contrastive learning (RCL), a framework for learning\nunsupervised representations that are robust to shortcuts. The key idea is to\nforce the learned representation to reconstruct the input, which naturally\ncounters potential shortcuts. Extensive experiments verify that RCL is highly\nrobust to shortcuts and outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive learning\nmethods on both RGB and RF datasets for a variety of tasks.",

Not only acquiring a\nclean and fully labeled dataset in multi-label learning is extremely expensive,\nbut also many of the actual labels are corrupted or missing due to the\nautomated or non-expert annotation techniques. Noisy label data decrease the\nprediction performance drastically. In this paper, we propose a novel Gold\nAsymmetric Loss Correction with Single-Label Regulators (GALC-SLR) that\noperates robust against noisy labels. GALC-SLR estimates the noise confusion\nmatrix using single-label samples, then constructs an asymmetric loss\ncorrection via estimated confusion matrix to avoid overfitting to the noisy\nlabels. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art\noriginal asymmetric loss multi-label classifier under all corruption levels,\nshowing mean average precision improvement up to 28.67% on a real world dataset\nof MS-COCO, yielding a better generalization of the unseen data and increased\nprediction performance.",

          "description": "Real world traffic sign recognition is an important step towards building\nautonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to\nadversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and\ngenerate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based\nattack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of\nthese algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)\niteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast\nmoving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally\nwithout considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,\nthis paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world\nroad sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)\nwe leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip\nthose zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural\nperturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a\nsingle perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance\nof the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function\nthat can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real\nworld data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the\nattack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a\nquarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also\nprovides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.\nWe provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility:\nhttps://github.com/AdvAttack/RoadSignAttack.",

Deep learning is emerging as a\npromising technique to analyze these data, particularly in soft sensor\nmodeling. The strong representational capabilities of complex data and the\nflexibility it offers from an architectural perspective make it a topic of\nactive applied research in industrial settings. However, the successful\napplications of deep learning in soft sensing are still not widely integrated\nin factory control systems, because most of the research on soft sensing do not\nhave access to large scale industrial data which are varied, noisy and\nincomplete. The results published in most research papers are therefore not\neasily reproduced when applied to the variety of data in industrial settings.\nHere we provide manufacturing data sets that are much larger and more complex\nthan public open soft sensor data. Moreover, the data sets are from Seagate\nfactories on active service with only necessary anonymization, so that they\nreflect the complex and noisy nature of real-world data. We introduce a\nvariance weighted multi-headed auto-encoder classification model that fits well\ninto the high-dimensional and highly imbalanced data.

          "description": "Reasoning about the future -- understanding how decisions in the present time\naffect outcomes in the future -- is one of the central challenges for\nreinforcement learning (RL), especially in highly-stochastic or partially\nobservable environments. While predicting the future directly is hard, in this\nwork we introduce a method that allows an agent to \"look into the future\"\nwithout explicitly predicting it. Namely, we propose to allow an agent, during\nits training on past experience, to observe what \\emph{actually} happened in\nthe future at that time, while enforcing an information bottleneck to avoid the\nagent overly relying on this privileged information. This gives our agent the\nopportunity to utilize rich and useful information about the future trajectory\ndynamics in addition to the present. Our method, Policy Gradients Incorporating\nthe Future (PGIF), is easy to implement and versatile, being applicable to\nvirtually any policy gradient algorithm. We apply our proposed method to a\nnumber of off-the-shelf RL algorithms and show that PGIF is able to achieve\nhigher reward faster in a variety of online and offline RL domains, as well as\nsparse-reward and partially observable environments.",

          "description": "For reinforcement learning (RL), it is challenging for an agent to master a\ntask that requires a specific series of actions due to sparse rewards. To solve\nthis problem, reverse curriculum generation (RCG) provides a reverse expansion\napproach that automatically generates a curriculum for the agent to learn. More\nspecifically, RCG adapts the initial state distribution from the neighborhood\nof a goal to a distance as training proceeds. However, the initial state\ndistribution generated for each iteration might be biased, thus making the\npolicy overfit or slowing down the reverse expansion rate. While training RCG\nfor actor-critic (AC) based RL algorithms, this poor generalization and slow\nconvergence might be induced by the tight coupling between an AC pair.\nTherefore, we propose a parallelized approach that simultaneously trains\nmultiple AC pairs and periodically exchanges their critics.

          "description": "To remove the effects of adversarial perturbations, preprocessing defenses\nsuch as pixel discretization are appealing due to their simplicity but have so\nfar been shown to be ineffective except on simple datasets such as MNIST,\nleading to the belief that pixel discretization approaches are doomed to\nfailure as a defense technique. This paper revisits the pixel discretization\napproaches. We hypothesize that the reason why existing approaches have failed\nis that they have used a fixed codebook for the entire dataset. In particular,\nwe find that can lead to situations where images become more susceptible to\nadversarial perturbations and also suffer significant loss of accuracy after\ndiscretization. We propose a novel image preprocessing technique called\nEssential Features that uses an adaptive codebook that is based on per-image\ncontent and threat model. Essential Features adaptively selects a separable set\nof color clusters for each image to reduce the color space while preserving the\npertinent features of the original image, maximizing both separability and\nrepresentation of colors. Additionally, to limit the adversary's ability to\ninfluence the chosen color clusters, Essential Features takes advantage of\nspatial correlation with an adaptive blur that moves pixels closer to their\noriginal value without destroying original edge information. We design several\nadaptive attacks and find that our approach is more robust than previous\nbaselines on $L_\\infty$ and $L_2$ bounded attacks for several challenging\ndatasets including CIFAR-10, GTSRB, RESISC45, and ImageNet.",

For a large-scale\ngraph with low sparsity, a node's adjacency vector is a long and sparse\nrepresentation, limiting the practical utilization of existing machine learning\nmethods on nodal features.

This paper proposes a\nhyperparameter-free, extensible, and explainable whole graph embedding method,\ncombining the DHC (Degree, H-index and Coreness) theorem and Shannon Entropy\n(E), abbreviated as DHC-E. The new whole graph embedding scheme can obtain a\ntrade-off between the simplicity and the quality under some supervised\nclassification learning tasks, using molecular, social, and brain networks. In\naddition, the proposed approach has a good performance in lower-dimensional\ngraph visualization.

          "description": "Federated learning is a machine learning technique that enables training\nacross decentralized data. Recently, federated learning has become an active\narea of research due to the increased concerns over privacy and security. In\nlight of this, a variety of open source federated learning libraries have been\ndeveloped and released. We introduce FedJAX, a JAX-based open source library\nfor federated learning simulations that emphasizes ease-of-use in research.\nWith its simple primitives for implementing federated learning algorithms,\nprepackaged datasets, models and algorithms, and fast simulation speed, FedJAX\naims to make developing and evaluating federated algorithms faster and easier\nfor researchers. Our benchmark results show that FedJAX can be used to train\nmodels with federated averaging on the EMNIST dataset in a few minutes and the\nStack Overflow dataset in roughly an hour with standard hyperparmeters using\nTPUs.",

          "description": "Networks are landmarks of many complex phenomena where interweaving\ninteractions between different agents transform simple local rule-sets into\nnonlinear emergent behaviors. While some recent studies unveil associations\nbetween the network structure and the underlying dynamical process, identifying\nstochastic nonlinear dynamical processes continues to be an outstanding\nproblem. Here we develop a simple data-driven framework based on\noperator-theoretic techniques to identify and control stochastic nonlinear\ndynamics taking place over large-scale networks. The proposed approach requires\nno prior knowledge of the network structure and identifies the underlying\ndynamics solely using a collection of two-step snapshots of the states. This\ndata-driven system identification is achieved by using the Koopman operator to\nfind a low dimensional representation of the dynamical patterns that evolve\nlinearly. Further, we use the global linear Koopman model to solve critical\ncontrol problems by applying to model predictive control (MPC)--typically, a\nchallenging proposition when applied to large networks. We show that our\nproposed approach tackles this by converting the original nonlinear programming\ninto a more tractable optimization problem that is both convex and with far\nfewer variables.",

          "description": "Linear classifiers with random convolution kernels are computationally\nefficient methods that need no design or domain knowledge. Unlike deep neural\nnetworks, there is no need to hand-craft a network architecture; the kernels\nare randomly generated and only the linear classifier needs training. A\nrecently proposed method, RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transforms (ROCKETs), has\nshown high accuracy across a range of time-series data sets. Here we propose a\nmulti-scale version of this method, using both high- and low-frequency\ncomponents. We apply our methods to inter-burst detection in a cohort of\npreterm EEG recorded from 36 neonates <30 weeks gestational age. Two features\nfrom the convolution of 10,000 random kernels are combined using ridge\nregression. The proposed multi-scale ROCKET method out-performs the method\nwithout scale: median (interquartile range, IQR) Matthews correlation\ncoefficient (MCC) of 0.859 (0.815 to 0.874) for multi-scale versus 0.841 (0.807\nto 0.865) without scale, p<0.001.

To date, more than 100 contact tracing applications have been\npublished to slow down the spread of highly contagious Covid-19.

          "description": "Machine learning (ML) models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial\nexamples. Applications of ML to voice biometrics authentication are no\nexception. Yet, the implications of audio adversarial examples on these\nreal-world systems remain poorly understood given that most research targets\nlimited defenders who can only listen to the audio samples. Conflating\ndetectability of an attack with human perceptibility, research has focused on\nmethods that aim to produce imperceptible adversarial examples which humans\ncannot distinguish from the corresponding benign samples. We argue that this\nperspective is coarse for two reasons: 1. Imperceptibility is impossible to\nverify; it would require an experimental process that encompasses variations in\nlistener training, equipment, volume, ear sensitivity, types of background\nnoise etc, and 2. It disregards pipeline-based detection clues that realistic\ndefenders leverage. This results in adversarial examples that are ineffective\nin the presence of knowledgeable defenders. Thus, an adversary only needs an\naudio sample to be plausible to a human. We thus introduce surreptitious\nadversarial examples, a new class of attacks that evades both human and\npipeline controls. In the white-box setting, we instantiate this class with a\njoint, multi-stage optimization attack. Using an Amazon Mechanical Turk user\nstudy, we show that this attack produces audio samples that are more\nsurreptitious than previous attacks that aim solely for imperceptibility.\nLastly we show that surreptitious adversarial examples are challenging to\ndevelop in the black-box setting.",

          "description": "Estimating Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) is of utmost importance for\ndeveloping Cyber-Physical and Safety-Critical Systems. The system's scheduler\nuses the estimated WCET to schedule each task of these systems, and failure may\nlead to catastrophic events. It is thus imperative to build provably reliable\nsystems. WCET is available to us in the last stage of systems development when\nthe hardware is available and the application code is compiled on it. Different\nmethodologies measure the WCET, but none of them give early insights on WCET,\nwhich is crucial for system development. If the system designers overestimate\nWCET in the early stage, then it would lead to the overqualified system, which\nwill increase the cost of the final product, and if they underestimate WCET in\nthe early stage, then it would lead to financial loss as the system would not\nperform as expected. This paper estimates early WCET using Deep Neural Networks\nas an approximate predictor model for hardware architecture and compiler. This\nmodel predicts the WCET based on the source code without compiling and running\non the hardware architecture. Our WCET prediction model is created using the\nPytorch framework. The resulting WCET is too erroneous to be used as an upper\nbound on the WCET. However, getting these results in the early stages of system\ndevelopment is an essential prerequisite for the system's dimensioning and\nconfiguration of the hardware setup.",

However, there are open questions around the\nrobustness of these methods to various factors, including physiological ECG\nnoise. In this study we generate clean and noisy versions of an ECG dataset\nbefore applying Symmetric Projection Attractor Reconstruction (SPAR) and\nscalogram image transformations. A pretrained convolutional neural network is\ntrained using transfer learning to classify these image transforms. For the\nclean ECG dataset, F1 scores for SPAR attractor and scalogram transforms were\n0.70 and 0.79, respectively, and the scores decreased by less than 0.05 for the\nnoisy ECG datasets. Notably, when the network trained on clean data was used to\nclassify the noisy datasets, performance decreases of up to 0.18 in F1 scores\nwere seen. However, when the network trained on the noisy data was used to\nclassify the clean dataset, the performance decrease was less than 0.05. We\nconclude that physiological ECG noise impacts classification using deep\nlearning methods and careful consideration should be given to the inclusion of\nnoisy ECG signals in the training data when developing supervised networks for\nECG classification.",

Most of the existing approaches address the energy disaggregation\nproblem by conventional techniques such as sparse coding, non-negative matrix\nfactorization, and hidden Markov model. Recent advances reveal that deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) can get favorable performance for NILM since DNNs can\ninherently learn the discriminative signatures of the different appliances. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method named adversarial energy disaggregation\n(AED) based on DNNs. We introduce the idea of adversarial learning into NILM,\nwhich is new for the energy disaggregation task. Our method trains a generator\nand multiple discriminators via an adversarial fashion.

          "description": "The decentralized nature of federated learning, that often leverages the\npower of edge devices, makes it vulnerable to attacks against privacy and\nsecurity. The privacy risk for a peer is that the model update she computes on\nher private data may, when sent to the model manager, leak information on those\nprivate data. Even more obvious are security attacks, whereby one or several\nmalicious peers return wrong model updates in order to disrupt the learning\nprocess and lead to a wrong model being learned. In this paper we build a\nfederated learning framework that offers privacy to the participating peers as\nwell as security against Byzantine and poisoning attacks. Our framework\nconsists of several protocols that provide strong privacy to the participating\npeers via unlinkable anonymity and that are rationally sustainable based on the\nco-utility property. In other words, no rational party is interested in\ndeviating from the proposed protocols. We leverage the notion of co-utility to\nbuild a decentralized co-utile reputation management system that provides\nincentives for parties to adhere to the protocols. Unlike privacy protection\nvia differential privacy, our approach preserves the values of model updates\nand hence the accuracy of plain federated learning; unlike privacy protection\nvia update aggregation, our approach preserves the ability to detect bad model\nupdates while substantially reducing the computational overhead compared to\nmethods based on homomorphic encryption.",

In this paper, we report a\nstudy using data captured from audience interactions with an interactive TV\nshow to model and predict engagement. We find that temporal metrics, including\noverall time spent on the experience and the interval between events, are\npredictive of engagement.

To access the knowledge\nstored in mask-based LMs, we can use cloze-style questions and let the model\nfill in the blank. The flexibility advantage over structured knowledge bases\ncomes with the drawback of finding the right query for a certain information\nneed. Inspired by human behavior to disambiguate a question, we propose to\nquery LMs by example. To clarify the ambivalent question \"Who does Neuer play\nfor?\", a successful strategy is to demonstrate the relation using another\nsubject, e.g., \"Ronaldo plays for Portugal. Who does Neuer play for?\". We apply\nthis approach of querying by example to the LAMA probe and obtain substantial\nimprovements of up to 37.8% for BERT-large on the T-REx data when providing\nonly 10 demonstrations--even outperforming a baseline that queries the model\nwith up to 40 paraphrases of the question. The examples are provided through\nthe model's context and thus require neither fine-tuning nor an additional\nforward pass.

This paper explores the\npossibility of safe RL algorithms with zero training-time safety violations in\nthe challenging setting where we are only given a safe but trivial-reward\ninitial policy without any prior knowledge of the dynamics model and additional\noffline data. We propose an algorithm, Co-trained Barrier Certificate for Safe\nRL (CRABS), which iteratively learns barrier certificates, dynamics models, and\npolicies. The barrier certificates, learned via adversarial training, ensure\nthe policy's safety assuming calibrated learned dynamics model. We also add a\nregularization term to encourage larger certified regions to enable better\nexploration. Empirical simulations show that zero safety violations are already\nchallenging for a suite of simple environments with only 2-4 dimensional state\nspace, especially if high-reward policies have to visit regions near the safety\nboundary.

          "description": "Exponential families are widely used in machine learning; they include many\ndistributions in continuous and discrete domains (e.g., Gaussian, Dirichlet,\nPoisson, and categorical distributions via the softmax transformation).\nDistributions in each of these families have fixed support. In contrast, for\nfinite domains, there has been recent works on sparse alternatives to softmax\n(e.g. sparsemax, $\\alpha$-entmax, and fusedmax) and corresponding losses, which\nhave varying support.\n\nThis paper expands that line of work in several directions: first, it extends\n$\\Omega$-regularized prediction maps and Fenchel-Young losses to arbitrary\ndomains (possibly countably infinite or continuous). For linearly parametrized\nfamilies, we show that minimization of Fenchel-Young losses is equivalent to\nmoment matching of the statistics, generalizing a fundamental property of\nexponential families. When $\\Omega$ is a Tsallis negentropy with parameter\n$\\alpha$, we obtain \"deformed exponential families,\" which include\n$\\alpha$-entmax and sparsemax ($\\alpha$ = 2) as particular cases. For quadratic\nenergy functions in continuous domains, the resulting densities are\n$\\beta$-Gaussians, an instance of elliptical distributions that contain as\nparticular cases the Gaussian, biweight, triweight and Epanechnikov densities,\nand for which we derive closed-form expressions for the variance, Tsallis\nentropy, and Fenchel-Young loss. When $\\Omega$ is a total variation or Sobolev\nregularizer, we obtain a continuous version of the fusedmax. Finally, we\nintroduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient\nbackpropagation algorithms for $\\alpha \\in \\{1, 4/3, 3/2, 2\\}$. Using them, we\ndemonstrate our sparse continuous distributions for attention-based audio\nclassification and visual question answering, showing that they allow attending\nto time intervals and compact regions.",

          "description": "Most existing neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms are dedicated to\nthe downstream tasks, e.g., image classification in computer vision. However,\nextensive experiments have shown that, prominent neural architectures, such as\nResNet in computer vision and LSTM in natural language processing, are\ngenerally good at extracting patterns from the input data and perform well on\ndifferent downstream tasks. These observations inspire us to ask: Is it\nnecessary to use the performance of specific downstream tasks to evaluate and\nsearch for good neural architectures? Can we perform NAS effectively and\nefficiently while being agnostic to the downstream task? In this work, we\nattempt to affirmatively answer the above two questions and improve the\nstate-of-the-art NAS solution by proposing a novel and generic NAS framework,\ntermed Generic NAS (GenNAS). GenNAS does not use task-specific labels but\ninstead adopts \\textit{regression} on a set of manually designed synthetic\nsignal bases for architecture evaluation. Such a self-supervised regression\ntask can effectively evaluate the intrinsic power of an architecture to capture\nand transform the input signal patterns, and allow more sufficient usage of\ntraining samples. We then propose an automatic task search to optimize the\ncombination of synthetic signals using limited downstream-task-specific labels,\nfurther improving the performance of GenNAS. We also thoroughly evaluate\nGenNAS's generality and end-to-end NAS performance on all search spaces, which\noutperforms almost all existing works with significant speedup.",

In addition, it is also important to consider opponents\nwho are learning simultaneously or capable of reasoning. However, existing work\nusually tackles only one of the aforementioned types of opponent. In this\npaper, we propose model-based opponent modeling (MBOM), which employs the\nenvironment model to adapt to all kinds of opponent. MBOM simulates the\nrecursive reasoning process in the environment model and imagines a set of\nimproving opponent policies. To effectively and accurately represent the\nopponent policy, MBOM further mixes the imagined opponent policies according to\nthe similarity with the real behaviors of opponents.

          "description": "There is a warning light for the loss of plant habitats worldwide that\nentails concerted efforts to conserve plant biodiversity. Thus, plant species\nclassification is of crucial importance to address this environmental\nchallenge. In recent years, there is a considerable increase in the number of\nstudies related to plant taxonomy. While some researchers try to improve their\nrecognition performance using novel approaches, others concentrate on\ncomputational optimization for their framework. In addition, a few studies are\ndiving into feature extraction to gain significantly in terms of accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose an effective method for the leaf recognition problem. In\nour proposed approach, a leaf goes through some pre-processing to extract its\nrefined color image, vein image, xy-projection histogram, handcrafted shape,\ntexture features, and Fourier descriptors. These attributes are then\ntransformed into a better representation by neural network-based encoders\nbefore a support vector machine (SVM) model is utilized to classify different\nleaves. Overall, our approach performs a state-of-the-art result on the Flavia\nleaf dataset, achieving the accuracy of 99.58\\% on test sets under random\n10-fold cross-validation and bypassing the previous methods.

Our empirical evaluation shows that this\nframework improves the state-of-the-art trade-offs between speed and quality of\nscalable community detection. For example, on a 30-core machine with two-way\nhyper-threading, our implementations achieve orders of magnitude speedups over\nother correlation clustering baselines, and up to 28.44x speedups over our own\nsequential baselines while maintaining or improving quality.",

While existing mathematical programming methods offer\ntheoretical guarantees in the context of constrained Markov decision processes,\nthey either lack scalability in solving larger problems or produce conservative\nplans. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning improve scalability by\nlearning policy networks as function approximators. In this paper, we propose\nan extension of soft actor critic model to estimate the execution risk of a\nplan through a risk critic and produce risk-bounded policies efficiently by\nadding an extra risk term in the loss function of the policy network. We define\nthe execution risk in an accurate form, as opposed to approximating it through\na summation of immediate risks at each time step that leads to conservative\nplans. Our proposed model is conditioned on a continuous spectrum of risk\nbounds, allowing the user to adjust the risk-averse level of the agent on the\nfly.

Monophonic and homophonic music can\nbe described as homorhythmic, or having a single musical rhythm.

We first introduce a workflow for creating large-scale\npolyphonic datasets suitable for end-to-end recognition from sheet music\npublicly available on the MuseScore forum. We then propose two novel\nformulations for end-to-end polyphonic OMR -- one treating the problem as a\ntype of multi-task binary classification, and the other treating it as\nmulti-sequence detection.

          "description": "In many real-world multi-agent cooperative tasks, due to high cost and risk,\nagents cannot interact with the environment and collect experiences during\nlearning, but have to learn from offline datasets. However, the transition\nprobabilities calculated from the dataset can be much different from the\ntransition probabilities induced by the learned policies of other agents,\ncreating large errors in value estimates. Moreover, the experience\ndistributions of agents' datasets may vary wildly due to diverse behavior\npolicies, causing large difference in value estimates between agents.\nConsequently, agents will learn uncoordinated suboptimal policies. In this\npaper, we propose MABCQ, which exploits value deviation and transition\nnormalization to modify the transition probabilities. Value deviation\noptimistically increases the transition probabilities of high-value next\nstates, and transition normalization normalizes the biased transition\nprobabilities of next states. They together encourage agents to discover\npotential optimal and coordinated policies. Mathematically, we prove the\nconvergence of Q-learning under the non-stationary transition probabilities\nafter modification. Empirically, we show that MABCQ greatly outperforms\nbaselines and reduces the difference in value estimates between agents.",

          "description": "While machine learning techniques are being applied to various fields for\ntheir exceptional ability to find complex relations in large datasets, the\nstrengthening of regulations on data ownership and privacy is causing\nincreasing difficulty in its application to medical data. In light of this,\nFederated Learning has recently been proposed as a solution to train on private\ndata without breach of confidentiality. This conservation of privacy is\nparticularly appealing in the field of healthcare, where patient data is highly\nconfidential. However, many studies have shown that its assumption of\nIndependent and Identically Distributed data is unrealistic for medical data.\nIn this paper, we propose Personalized Federated Cluster Models, a hierarchical\nclustering-based FL process, to predict Major Depressive Disorder severity from\nHeart Rate Variability. By allowing clients to receive more personalized model,\nwe address problems caused by non-IID data, showing an accuracy increase in\nseverity prediction. This increase in performance may be sufficient to use\nPersonalized Federated Cluster Models in many existing Federated Learning\nscenarios.",

          "description": "Electronic Health Records often suffer from missing data, which poses a major\nproblem in clinical practice and clinical studies. A novel approach for dealing\nwith missing data are Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), which have been\ngenerating huge research interest in image generation and transformation.\nRecently, researchers have attempted to apply GANs to missing data generation\nand imputation for EHR data: a major challenge here is the categorical nature\nof the data. State-of-the-art solutions to the GAN-based generation of\ncategorical data involve either reinforcement learning, or learning a\nbidirectional mapping between the categorical and the real latent feature\nspace, so that the GANs only need to generate real-valued features. However,\nthese methods are designed to generate complete feature vectors instead of\nimputing only the subsets of missing features. In this paper we propose a\nsimple and yet effective approach that is based on previous work on GANs for\ndata imputation. We first motivate our solution by discussing the reason why\nadversarial training often fails in case of categorical features. Then we\nderive a novel way to re-code the categorical features to stabilize the\nadversarial training. Based on experiments on two real-world EHR data with\nmultiple settings, we show that our imputation approach largely improves the\nprediction accuracy, compared to more traditional data imputation approaches.",

          "description": "This paper proposes a new deep learning approach to antipodal grasp\ndetection, named Double-Dot Network (DD-Net). It follows the recent anchor-free\nobject detection framework, which does not depend on empirically pre-set\nanchors and thus allows more generalized and flexible prediction on unseen\nobjects. Specifically, unlike the widely used 5-dimensional rectangle, the\ngripper configuration is defined as a pair of fingertips. An effective CNN\narchitecture is introduced to localize such fingertips, and with the help of\nauxiliary centers for refinement, it accurately and robustly infers grasp\ncandidates. Additionally, we design a specialized loss function to measure the\nquality of grasps, and in contrast to the IoU scores of bounding boxes adopted\nin object detection, it is more consistent to the grasp detection task. Both\nthe simulation and robotic experiments are executed and state of the art\naccuracies are achieved, showing that DD-Net is superior to the counterparts in\nhandling unseen objects.",

By just\nreplacing the spatial convolutions with global self-attention in the final\nthree bottleneck blocks of a ResNet and no other changes, our approach improves\nupon the baselines significantly on instance segmentation and object detection\nwhile also reducing the parameters, with minimal overhead in latency. Through\nthe design of BoTNet, we also point out how ResNet bottleneck blocks with\nself-attention can be viewed as Transformer blocks. Without any bells and\nwhistles, BoTNet achieves 44.4% Mask AP and 49.7% Box AP on the COCO Instance\nSegmentation benchmark using the Mask R-CNN framework; surpassing the previous\nbest published single model and single scale results of ResNeSt evaluated on\nthe COCO validation set. Finally, we present a simple adaptation of the BoTNet\ndesign for image classification, resulting in models that achieve a strong\nperformance of 84.7% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark while being up to\n1.64x faster in compute time than the popular EfficientNet models on TPU-v3\nhardware.

COVID-19 has largely impacted on our\nsocieties through both direct and indirect effects transmitted by the policy\nmeasures to counter the spread of viruses. We quantitatively analysed the\nmultifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including\npeople's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has\nchanged significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and\nquarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at\ninternational (cross-border), national and regional level. At international\nlevel, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has\nplunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of\nflights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United\nStates announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating\ncountries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March\n10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major\ncity: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain).\nWithin all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We\nalso identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of\nposts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in\nthe beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram\ndoubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among\nInstagram users. Besides, we identified the changes in a wide range of people's\nsocial behaviors, as well as economic impacts through the analysis of Instagram\ndata and primary survey data.",

However,\nsimultaneous incorporation of past and future contexts using generative\nlanguage models (LMs) can be challenging, as they are trained either to\ncondition only on the past context or to perform narrowly scoped\ntext-infilling. In this paper, we propose DeLorean, a new unsupervised decoding\nalgorithm that can flexibly incorporate both the past and future contexts using\nonly off-the-shelf, left-to-right language models and no supervision. The key\nintuition of our algorithm is incorporating the future through\nback-propagation, during which, we only update the internal representation of\nthe output while fixing the model parameters. By alternating between forward\nand backward propagation, DeLorean can decode the output representation that\nreflects both the left and right contexts. We demonstrate that our approach is\ngeneral and applicable to two nonmonotonic reasoning tasks: abductive text\ngeneration and counterfactual story revision, where DeLorean outperforms a\nrange of unsupervised and some supervised methods, based on automatic and human\nevaluation.",

          "description": "Spectral graph convolutional networks (SGCNs) have been attracting increasing\nattention in graph representation learning partly due to their interpretability\nthrough the prism of the established graph signal processing framework.\nHowever, existing SGCNs are limited in implementing graph convolutions with\nrigid transforms that could not adapt to signals residing on graphs and tasks\nat hand. In this paper, we propose a novel class of spectral graph\nconvolutional networks that implement graph convolutions with adaptive graph\nwavelets. Specifically, the adaptive graph wavelets are learned with neural\nnetwork-parameterized lifting structures, where structure-aware attention-based\nlifting operations are developed to jointly consider graph structures and node\nfeatures. We propose to lift based on diffusion wavelets to alleviate the\nstructural information loss induced by partitioning non-bipartite graphs. By\ndesign, the locality and sparsity of the resulting wavelet transform as well as\nthe scalability of the lifting structure for large and varying-size graphs are\nguaranteed. We further derive a soft-thresholding filtering operation by\nlearning sparse graph representations in terms of the learned wavelets, which\nimproves the scalability and interpretablity, and yield a localized, efficient\nand scalable spectral graph convolution. To ensure that the learned graph\nrepresentations are invariant to node permutations, a layer is employed at the\ninput of the networks to reorder the nodes according to their local topology\ninformation. We evaluate the proposed networks in both node-level and\ngraph-level representation learning tasks on benchmark citation and\nbioinformatics graph datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed networks over existing SGCNs in terms of accuracy,\nefficiency and scalability.",

This is motivated\nby the observation that deep generative models, in addition to a likelihood\nmodel $p(x|z)$, often also use an inference model $q(z|x)$ for data\nrepresentation, but they rely on a usually uninformative prior distribution\n$p(z)$ to define a joint distribution, which may render problems like posterior\ncollapse and manifold mismatch. To explore the possibility to model a joint\ndistribution using only $p(x|z)$ and $q(z|x)$, we study their compatibility and\ndeterminacy, corresponding to the existence and uniqueness of a joint\ndistribution whose conditional distributions coincide with them. We develop a\ngeneral theory for novel and operable equivalence criteria for compatibility,\nand sufficient conditions for determinacy. Based on the theory, we propose the\nCyGen framework for cyclic-conditional generative modeling, including methods\nto enforce compatibility and use the determined distribution to fit and\ngenerate data.

          "description": "Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown great success in learning from\ngraph-structured data. They are widely used in various applications, such as\nrecommendation, fraud detection, and search. In these domains, the graphs are\ntypically large, containing hundreds of millions of nodes and several billions\nof edges. To tackle this challenge, we develop DistDGL, a system for training\nGNNs in a mini-batch fashion on a cluster of machines. DistDGL is based on the\nDeep Graph Library (DGL), a popular GNN development framework. DistDGL\ndistributes the graph and its associated data (initial features and embeddings)\nacross the machines and uses this distribution to derive a computational\ndecomposition by following an owner-compute rule. DistDGL follows a synchronous\ntraining approach and allows ego-networks forming the mini-batches to include\nnon-local nodes. To minimize the overheads associated with distributed\ncomputations, DistDGL uses a high-quality and light-weight min-cut graph\npartitioning algorithm along with multiple balancing constraints. This allows\nit to reduce communication overheads and statically balance the computations.\nIt further reduces the communication by replicating halo nodes and by using\nsparse embedding updates. The combination of these design choices allows\nDistDGL to train high-quality models while achieving high parallel efficiency\nand memory scalability. We demonstrate our optimizations on both inductive and\ntransductive GNN models. Our results show that DistDGL achieves linear speedup\nwithout compromising model accuracy and requires only 13 seconds to complete a\ntraining epoch for a graph with 100 million nodes and 3 billion edges on a\ncluster with 16 machines. DistDGL is now publicly available as part of\nDGL:https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/python/dgl/distributed.",

          "description": "Deep Generative Models (DGMs) allow users to synthesize data from complex,\nhigh-dimensional manifolds. Industry applications of DGMs include data\naugmentation to boost performance of (semi-)supervised machine learning, or to\nmitigate fairness or privacy concerns. Large-scale DGMs are notoriously hard to\ntrain, requiring expert skills, large amounts of data and extensive\ncomputational resources. Thus, it can be expected that many enterprises will\nresort to sourcing pre-trained DGMs from potentially unverified third parties,\ne.g.~open source model repositories.\n\nAs we show in this paper, such a deployment scenario poses a new attack\nsurface, which allows adversaries to potentially undermine the integrity of\nentire machine learning development pipelines in a victim organization.\nSpecifically, we describe novel training-time attacks resulting in corrupted\nDGMs that synthesize regular data under normal operations and designated target\noutputs for inputs sampled from a trigger distribution. Depending on the\ncontrol that the adversary has over the random number generation, this imposes\nvarious degrees of risk that harmful data may enter the machine learning\ndevelopment pipelines, potentially causing material or reputational damage to\nthe victim organization.\n\nOur attacks are based on adversarial loss functions that combine the dual\nobjectives of attack stealth and fidelity. We show its effectiveness for a\nvariety of DGM architectures (Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs)) and data domains (images, audio). Our\nexperiments show that - even for large-scale industry-grade DGMs - our attack\ncan be mounted with only modest computational efforts. We also investigate the\neffectiveness of different defensive approaches (based on static/dynamic model\nand output inspections) and prescribe a practical defense strategy that paves\nthe way for safe usage of DGMs.",

          "description": "Domain shift is a well known problem where a model trained on a particular\ndomain (source) does not perform well when exposed to samples from a different\ndomain (target). Unsupervised methods that can adapt to domain shift are highly\ndesirable as they allow effective utilization of the source data without\nrequiring additional annotated training data from the target. Practically,\nobtaining sufficient amount of annotated data from the target domain can be\nboth infeasible and extremely expensive. In this work, we address the domain\nshift problem for the object detection task. Our approach relies on gradually\nremoving the domain shift between the source and the target domains. The key\ningredients to our approach are -- (a) mapping the source to the target domain\non pixel-level; (b) training a teacher network on the mapped source and the\nunannotated target domain using adversarial feature alignment; and (c) finally\ntraining a student network using the pseudo-labels obtained from the teacher.\nExperimentally, when tested on challenging scenarios involving domain shift, we\nconsistently obtain significantly large performance gains over various recent\nstate of the art approaches.",

          "description": "Recently, the standard variational autoencoder has been successfully used to\nlearn a probabilistic prior over speech signals, which is then used to perform\nspeech enhancement. Variational autoencoders have then been conditioned on a\nlabel describing a high-level speech attribute (e.g. speech activity) that\nallows for a more explicit control of speech generation. However, the label is\nnot guaranteed to be disentangled from the other latent variables, which\nresults in limited performance improvements compared to the standard\nvariational autoencoder. In this work, we propose to use an adversarial\ntraining scheme for variational autoencoders to disentangle the label from the\nother latent variables. At training, we use a discriminator that competes with\nthe encoder of the variational autoencoder. Simultaneously, we also use an\nadditional encoder that estimates the label for the decoder of the variational\nautoencoder, which proves to be crucial to learn disentanglement. We show the\nbenefit of the proposed disentanglement learning when a voice activity label,\nestimated from visual data, is used for speech enhancement.",

Significant progress has been made in the past few years in\ndealing with the challenge of correcting for differing behavior between the\ndata collection and learned policies. However, little attention has been paid\nto potentially changing dynamics when transferring a policy to the online\nsetting, where performance can be up to 90% reduced for existing methods. In\nthis paper we address this problem with Augmented World Models (AugWM). We\naugment a learned dynamics model with simple transformations that seek to\ncapture potential changes in physical properties of the robot, leading to more\nrobust policies. We not only train our policy in this new setting, but also\nprovide it with the sampled augmentation as a context, allowing it to adapt to\nchanges in the environment. At test time we learn the context in a\nself-supervised fashion by approximating the augmentation which corresponds to\nthe new environment. We rigorously evaluate our approach on over 100 different\nchanged dynamics settings, and show that this simple approach can significantly\nimprove the zero-shot generalization of a recent state-of-the-art baseline,\noften achieving successful policies where the baseline fails.",

The input of our\nproblem is a set of items, where each item has a particular state drawn from a\nknown prior distribution. However, the state of an item is initially unknown,\none must select an item in order to reveal the state of that item. There is a\nutility function which is defined over items and states. Our objective is to\nsequentially select a group of items to maximize the expected utility. Although\nthe cardinality-constrained non-monotone adaptive submodular maximization has\nbeen well studied in the literature, whether there exists a constant\napproximation solution for the knapsack-constrained or $k$-system constrained\nadaptive submodular maximization problem remains an open problem.

          "description": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on numerous\napplications. However, it is difficult to tell beforehand if a DNN receiving an\ninput will deliver the correct output since their decision criteria are usually\nnontransparent. A DNN delivers the correct output if the input is within the\narea enclosed by its generalization envelope. In this case, the information\ncontained in the input sample is processed reasonably by the network. It is of\nlarge practical importance to assess at inference time if a DNN generalizes\ncorrectly. Currently, the approaches to achieve this goal are investigated in\ndifferent problem set-ups rather independently from one another, leading to\nthree main research and literature fields: predictive uncertainty,\nout-of-distribution detection and adversarial example detection. This survey\nconnects the three fields within the larger framework of investigating the\ngeneralization performance of machine learning methods and in particular DNNs.\nWe underline the common ground, point at the most promising approaches and give\na structured overview of the methods that provide at inference time means to\nestablish if the current input is within the generalization envelope of a DNN.",

          "description": "The rapidly growing computational demands of deep neural networks require\nnovel hardware designs. Recently, tunable nanoelectronic devices were developed\nbased on hopping electrons through a network of dopant atoms in silicon. These\n\"Dopant Network Processing Units\" (DNPUs) are highly energy-efficient and have\npotentially very high throughput. By adapting the control voltages applied to\nits terminals, a single DNPU can solve a variety of linearly non-separable\nclassification problems. However, using a single device has limitations due to\nthe implicit single-node architecture. This paper presents a promising novel\napproach to neural information processing by introducing DNPUs as high-capacity\nneurons and moving from a single to a multi-neuron framework. By implementing\nand testing a small multi-DNPU classifier in hardware, we show that\nfeed-forward DNPU networks improve the performance of a single DNPU from 77% to\n94% test accuracy on a binary classification task with concentric classes on a\nplane. Furthermore, motivated by the integration of DNPUs with memristor\narrays, we study the potential of using DNPUs in combination with linear\nlayers. We show by simulation that a single-layer MNIST classifier with only 10\nDNPUs achieves over 96% test accuracy. Our results pave the road towards\nhardware neural-network emulators that offer atomic-scale information\nprocessing with low latency and energy consumption.",

          "description": "An increasing amount of collected data are high-dimensional multi-way arrays\n(tensors), and it is crucial for efficient learning algorithms to exploit this\ntensorial structure as much as possible. The ever-present curse of\ndimensionality for high dimensional data and the loss of structure when\nvectorizing the data motivates the use of tailored low-rank tensor\nclassification methods. In the presence of small amounts of training data,\nkernel methods offer an attractive choice as they provide the possibility for a\nnonlinear decision boundary. We develop the Tensor Train Multi-way Multi-level\nKernel (TT-MMK), which combines the simplicity of the Canonical Polyadic\ndecomposition, the classification power of the Dual Structure-preserving\nSupport Vector Machine, and the reliability of the Tensor Train (TT)\napproximation. We show by experiments that the TT-MMK method is usually more\nreliable computationally, less sensitive to tuning parameters, and gives higher\nprediction accuracy in the SVM classification when benchmarked against other\nstate-of-the-art techniques.",

          "description": "With the popularity and development of the wearable devices such as\nsmartphones, human activity recognition (HAR) based on sensors has become as a\nkey research area in human computer interaction and ubiquitous computing. The\nemergence of deep learning leads to a recent shift in the research of HAR,\nwhich requires massive strictly labeled data. In comparison with video data,\nactivity data recorded from accelerometer or gyroscope is often more difficult\nto interpret and segment. Recently, several attention mechanisms are proposed\nto handle the weakly labeled human activity data, which do not require accurate\ndata annotation. However, these attention-based models can only handle the\nweakly labeled dataset whose sample includes one target activity, as a result\nit limits efficiency and practicality. In the paper, we propose a recurrent\nattention networks (RAN) to handle sequential weakly labeled multi-activity\nrecognition and location tasks. The model can repeatedly perform steps of\nattention on multiple activities of one sample and each step is corresponding\nto the current focused activity. The effectiveness of the RAN model is\nvalidated on a collected sequential weakly labeled multi-activity dataset and\nthe other two public datasets. The experiment results show that our RAN model\ncan simultaneously infer multi-activity types from the coarse-grained\nsequential weak labels and determine specific locations of every target\nactivity with only knowledge of which types of activities contained in the long\nsequence. It will greatly reduce the burden of manual labeling. The code of our\nwork is available at https://github.com/KennCoder7/RAN.",

However, despite its\nsignificance, this problem remains rather unexplored, with a few exceptions\nthat considered unsupervised semantic segmentation on small-scale datasets with\na narrow visual domain. In this paper, we make a first attempt to tackle the\nproblem on datasets that have been traditionally utilized for the supervised\ncase. To achieve this, we introduce a two-step framework that adopts a\npredetermined mid-level prior in a contrastive optimization objective to learn\npixel embeddings. This marks a large deviation from existing works that relied\non proxy tasks or end-to-end clustering. Additionally, we argue about the\nimportance of having a prior that contains information about objects, or their\nparts, and discuss several possibilities to obtain such a prior in an\nunsupervised manner.\n\nExperimental evaluation shows that our method comes with key advantages over\nexisting works. First, the learned pixel embeddings can be directly clustered\nin semantic groups using K-Means on PASCAL. Under the fully unsupervised\nsetting, there is no precedent in solving the semantic segmentation task on\nsuch a challenging benchmark. Second, our representations can improve over\nstrong baselines when transferred to new datasets, e.g. COCO and DAVIS. The\ncode is available.",

          "description": "Sparse coding has been incorporated in models of the visual cortex for its\ncomputational advantages and connection to biology. But how the level of\nsparsity contributes to performance on visual tasks is not well understood. In\nthis work, sparse coding has been integrated into an existing hierarchical V2\nmodel (Hosoya and Hyv\\\"arinen, 2015), but replacing the Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA) with an explicit sparse coding in which the degree of sparsity\ncan be controlled. After training, the sparse coding basis functions with a\nhigher degree of sparsity resembled qualitatively different structures, such as\ncurves and corners. The contributions of the models were assessed with image\nclassification tasks, including object classification, and tasks associated\nwith mid-level vision including figure-ground classification, texture\nclassification, and angle prediction between two line stimuli. In addition, the\nmodels were assessed in comparison to a texture sensitivity measure that has\nbeen reported in V2 (Freeman et al., 2013), and a deleted-region inference\ntask. The results from the experiments show that while sparse coding performed\nworse than ICA at classifying images, only sparse coding was able to better\nmatch the texture sensitivity level of V2 and infer deleted image regions, both\nby increasing the degree of sparsity in sparse coding. Higher degrees of\nsparsity allowed for inference over larger deleted image regions. The mechanism\nthat allows for this inference capability in sparse coding is described here.",

          "description": "Accounting for the fact that users have different sequential patterns, the\nmain drawback of state-of-the-art recommendation strategies is that a fixed\nsequence length of user-item interactions is required as input to train the\nmodels. This might limit the recommendation accuracy, as in practice users\nfollow different trends on the sequential recommendations. Hence, baseline\nstrategies might ignore important sequential interactions or add noise to the\nmodels with redundant interactions, depending on the variety of users'\nsequential behaviours. To overcome this problem, in this study we propose the\nSAR model, which not only learns the sequential patterns but also adjusts the\nsequence length of user-item interactions in a personalized manner. We first\ndesign an actor-critic framework, where the RL agent tries to compute the\noptimal sequence length as an action, given the user's state representation at\na certain time step. In addition, we optimize a joint loss function to align\nthe accuracy of the sequential recommendations with the expected cumulative\nrewards of the critic network, while at the same time we adapt the sequence\nlength with the actor network in a personalized manner. Our experimental\nevaluation on four real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our\nproposed model over several baseline approaches. Finally, we make our\nimplementation publicly available at https://github.com/stefanosantaris/sar.",

          "description": "Recommender systems(RS), especially collaborative filtering(CF) based RS, has\nbeen playing an important role in many e-commerce applications. As the\ninformation being searched over the internet is rapidly increasing, users often\nface the difficulty of finding items of his/her own interest and RS often\nprovides help in such tasks. Recent studies show that, as the item space\nincreases, and the number of items rated by the users become very less, issues\nlike sparsity arise. To mitigate the sparsity problem, transfer learning\ntechniques are being used wherein the data from dense domain(source) is\nconsidered in order to predict the missing entries in the sparse\ndomain(target). In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach for\ncross-domain recommendation when both domains have no overlap of users and\nitems. In our approach the transferring of knowledge from source to target\ndomain is done in a novel way. We make use of co-clustering technique to obtain\nthe codebook (cluster-level rating pattern) of source domain. By making use of\nhinge loss function we transfer the learnt codebook of the source domain to\ntarget. The use of hinge loss as a loss function is novel and has not been\ntried before in transfer learning. We demonstrate that our technique improves\nthe approximation of the target matrix on benchmark datasets.",

          "description": "The field of Continual Learning (CL) seeks to develop algorithms that\naccumulate knowledge and skills over time through interaction with\nnon-stationary environments and data distributions. Measuring progress in CL\ncan be difficult because a plethora of evaluation procedures (ettings) and\nalgorithmic solutions (methods) have emerged, each with their own potentially\ndisjoint set of assumptions about the CL problem. In this work, we view each\nsetting as a set of assumptions. We then create a tree-shaped hierarchy of the\nresearch settings in CL, in which more general settings become the parents of\nthose with more restrictive assumptions. This makes it possible to use\ninheritance to share and reuse research, as developing a method for a given\nsetting also makes it directly applicable onto any of its children. We\ninstantiate this idea as a publicly available software framework called\nSequoia, which features a variety of settings from both the Continual\nSupervised Learning (CSL) and Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) domains.\nSequoia also includes a growing suite of methods which are easy to extend and\ncustomize, in addition to more specialized methods from third-party libraries.\nWe hope that this new paradigm and its first implementation can serve as a\nfoundation for the unification and acceleration of research in CL.

          "description": "In this paper, the design of a rational decision support system (RDSS) for a\nconnected and autonomous vehicle charging infrastructure (CAV-CI) is studied.\nIn the considered CAV-CI, the distribution system operator (DSO) deploys\nelectric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to provide an EV charging facility for\nhuman-driven connected vehicles (CVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). The\ncharging request by the human-driven EV becomes irrational when it demands more\nenergy and charging period than its actual need. Therefore, the scheduling\npolicy of each EVSE must be adaptively accumulated the irrational charging\nrequest to satisfy the charging demand of both CVs and AVs. To tackle this, we\nformulate an RDSS problem for the DSO, where the objective is to maximize the\ncharging capacity utilization by satisfying the laxity risk of the DSO. Thus,\nwe devise a rational reward maximization problem to adapt the irrational\nbehavior by CVs in a data-informed manner. We propose a novel risk adversarial\nmulti-agent learning system (RAMALS) for CAV-CI to solve the formulated RDSS\nproblem. In RAMALS, the DSO acts as a centralized risk adversarial agent (RAA)\nfor informing the laxity risk to each EVSE. Subsequently, each EVSE plays the\nrole of a self-learner agent to adaptively schedule its own EV sessions by\ncoping advice from RAA. Experiment results show that the proposed RAMALS\naffords around 46.6% improvement in charging rate, about 28.6% improvement in\nthe EVSE's active charging time and at least 33.3% more energy utilization, as\ncompared to a currently deployed ACN EVSE system, and other baselines.",

These methods allow for the\nconstruction of robust and accurate predictive models, that are in turn applied\nto different tasks of spacecraft monitoring and operations planning. More\nimportantly, besides the accurate building of models, GalaxAI implements a\nvisualisation layer, providing mission specialists and operators with a full,\ndetailed and interpretable view of the data analysis process.

However, the observed\nelements may be of different levels of importance. Some information may be\nirrelevant or even distracting to the forecasting in certain situations. To\naddress this issue, we propose a generic motion forecasting framework (named\nRAIN) with dynamic key information selection and ranking based on a hybrid\nattention mechanism. The general framework is instantiated to handle\nmulti-agent trajectory prediction and human motion forecasting tasks,\nrespectively. In the former task, the model learns to recognize the relations\nbetween agents with a graph representation and to determine their relative\nsignificance. In the latter task, the model learns to capture the temporal\nproximity and dependency in long-term human motions. We also propose an\neffective double-stage training pipeline with an alternating training strategy\nto optimize the parameters in different modules of the framework. We validate\nthe framework on both synthetic simulations and motion forecasting benchmarks\nin different domains, demonstrating that our method not only achieves\nstate-of-the-art forecasting performance, but also provides interpretable and\nreasonable hybrid attention weights.",

These data contain a lot of information about binary stars, hidden in\ntheir light curves. With the huge amount of astronomical data gathered, it is\nnot reasonable to expect all the data to be manually processed and analyzed.\nTherefore, in this paper, we focus on the automatic classification of eclipsing\nbinary stars using deep learning methods. Our classifier provides a tool for\nthe categorization of light curves of binary stars into two classes: detached\nand over-contact. We used the ELISa software to obtain synthetic data, which we\nthen used for the training of the classifier. For evaluation purposes, we\ncollected 100 light curves of observed binary stars, in order to evaluate a\nnumber of classifiers. We evaluated semi-detached eclipsing binary stars as\ndetached. The best-performing classifier combines bidirectional Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, which\nachieved 98% accuracy on the evaluation set.

          "description": "Channel estimation and beamforming play critical roles in frequency-division\nduplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However,\nthese two modules have been treated as two stand-alone components, which makes\nit difficult to achieve a global system optimality. In this paper, we propose a\ndeep learning-based approach that directly optimizes the beamformers at the\nbase station according to the received uplink pilots, thereby, bypassing the\nexplicit channel estimation. Different from the existing fully data-driven\napproach where all the modules are replaced by deep neural networks (DNNs), a\nneural calibration method is proposed to improve the scalability of the\nend-to-end design. In particular, the backbone of conventional time-efficient\nalgorithms, i.e., the least-squares (LS) channel estimator and the zero-forcing\n(ZF) beamformer, is preserved and DNNs are leveraged to calibrate their inputs\nfor better performance. The permutation equivariance property of the formulated\nresource allocation problem is then identified to design a low-complexity\nneural network architecture. Simulation results will show the superiority of\nthe proposed neural calibration method over benchmark schemes in terms of both\nthe spectral efficiency and scalability in large-scale wireless networks.",

By\nexciting non-linear dynamical systems and linearly classifying their changes in\nstate, we can create highly energy-efficient devices capable of solving machine\nlearning tasks without the need to build a modular system consisting of\nmillions of neurons interconnected by synapses. The chosen dynamical system\nmust have three desirable properties: non-linearity, complexity, and fading\nmemory to act as an effective reservoir. We present task agnostic quantitative\nmeasures for each of these three requirements and exemplify them for two\nreservoirs: an echo state network and a simulated magnetic skyrmion-based\nreservoir. We show that, in general, systems with lower damping reach higher\nvalues in all three performance metrics. Whilst for input signal strength,\nthere is a natural trade-off between memory capacity and non-linearity of the\nreservoir's behaviour.

          "description": "Click-through rate prediction is one of the core tasks in commercial\nrecommender systems. It aims to predict the probability of a user clicking a\nparticular item given user and item features. As feature interactions bring in\nnon-linearity, they are widely adopted to improve the performance of CTR\nprediction models. Therefore, effectively modelling feature interactions has\nattracted much attention in both the research and industry field. The current\napproaches can generally be categorized into three classes: (1) na\\\"ive\nmethods, which do not model feature interactions and only use original\nfeatures; (2) memorized methods, which memorize feature interactions by\nexplicitly viewing them as new features and assigning trainable embeddings; (3)\nfactorized methods, which learn latent vectors for original features and\nimplicitly model feature interactions through factorization functions. Studies\nhave shown that modelling feature interactions by one of these methods alone\nare suboptimal due to the unique characteristics of different feature\ninteractions. To address this issue, we first propose a general framework\ncalled OptInter which finds the most suitable modelling method for each feature\ninteraction. Different state-of-the-art deep CTR models can be viewed as\ninstances of OptInter. To realize the functionality of OptInter, we also\nintroduce a learning algorithm that automatically searches for the optimal\nmodelling method. We conduct extensive experiments on four large datasets. Our\nexperiments show that OptInter improves the best performed state-of-the-art\nbaseline deep CTR models by up to 2.21%.

As such, only very few take\nadvantage of temporal consistency in video sequences, and those that do only\nimpose weak smoothness constraints across consecutive frames. In this paper, we\nadvocate estimating people flows across image locations between consecutive\nimages and inferring the people densities from these flows instead of directly\nregressing them. This enables us to impose much stronger constraints encoding\nthe conservation of the number of people. As a result, it significantly boosts\nperformance without requiring a more complex architecture.

However, the predictions of the dynamics models are\noften not accurate enough, and the resulting bias may incur catastrophic\ndecisions due to insufficient robustness. Therefore, it is highly desired to\ninvestigate how to improve the robustness of model-based RL algorithms while\nmaintaining high sampling efficiency. In this paper, we propose Model-Based\nDouble-dropout Planning (MBDP) to balance robustness and efficiency. MBDP\nconsists of two kinds of dropout mechanisms, where the rollout-dropout aims to\nimprove the robustness with a small cost of sample efficiency, while the\nmodel-dropout is designed to compensate for the lost efficiency at a slight\nexpense of robustness. By combining them in a complementary way, MBDP provides\na flexible control mechanism to meet different demands of robustness and\nefficiency by tuning two corresponding dropout ratios.

          "description": "Controlling the style of natural language by disentangling the latent space\nis an important step towards interpretable machine learning. After the latent\nspace is disentangled, the style of a sentence can be transformed by tuning the\nstyle representation without affecting other features of the sentence. Previous\nworks usually use adversarial training to guarantee that disentangled vectors\ndo not affect each other. However, adversarial methods are difficult to train.\nEspecially when there are multiple features (e.g., sentiment, or tense, which\nwe call style types in this paper), each feature requires a separate\ndiscriminator for extracting a disentangled style vector corresponding to that\nfeature. In this paper, we propose a unified distribution-controlling method,\nwhich provides each specific style value (the value of style types, e.g.,\npositive sentiment, or past tense) with a unique representation. This method\ncontributes a solid theoretical basis to avoid adversarial training in\nmulti-type disentanglement. We also propose multiple loss functions to achieve\na style-content disentanglement as well as a disentanglement among multiple\nstyle types. In addition, we observe that if two different style types always\nhave some specific style values that occur together in the dataset, they will\naffect each other when transferring the style values. We call this phenomenon\ntraining bias, and we propose a loss function to alleviate such training bias\nwhile disentangling multiple types. We conduct experiments on two datasets\n(Yelp service reviews and Amazon product reviews) to evaluate the\nstyle-disentangling effect and the unsupervised style transfer performance on\ntwo style types: sentiment and tense.

This paper presents STAN\n(Synthetic network Traffic generation with Autoregressive Neural models), a\ntool to generate realistic synthetic network traffic datasets for subsequent\ndownstream applications. Our novel neural architecture captures both temporal\ndependencies and dependence between attributes at any given time. It integrates\nconvolutional neural layers with mixture density neural layers and softmax\nlayers, and models both continuous and discrete variables. We evaluate the\nperformance of STAN in terms of the quality of data generated, by training it\non both a simulated dataset and a real network traffic data set. Finally, to\nanswer the question - can real network traffic data be substituted with\nsynthetic data to train models of comparable accuracy? We train two anomaly\ndetection models based on self-supervision. The results show only a small\ndecline in the accuracy of models trained solely on synthetic data. While\ncurrent results are encouraging in terms of quality of data generated and\nabsence of any obvious data leakage from training data, in the future we plan\nto further validate this fact by conducting privacy attacks on the generated\ndata.

          "description": "We propose a numerical scheme based on Random Projection Neural Networks\n(RPNN) for the solution of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) with a focus\non stiff problems. In particular, we use an Extreme Learning Machine, a\nsingle-hidden layer Feedforward Neural Network with Radial Basis Functions\nwhich widths are uniformly distributed random variables, while the values of\nthe weights between the input and the hidden layer are set equal to one. The\nnumerical solution is obtained by constructing a system of nonlinear algebraic\nequations, which is solved with respect to the output weights using the\nGauss-Newton method. For our illustrations, we apply the proposed machine\nlearning approach to solve two benchmark stiff problems, namely the Rober and\nthe van der Pol ones (the latter with large values of the stiffness parameter),\nand we perform a comparison with well-established methods such as the adaptive\nRunge-Kutta method based on the Dormand-Prince pair, and a variable-step\nvariable-order multistep solver based on numerical differentiation formulas, as\nimplemented in the \\texttt{ode45} and \\texttt{ode15s} MATLAB functions,\nrespectively. We show that our proposed scheme yields good numerical\napproximation accuracy without being affected by the stiffness, thus\noutperforming in same cases the \\texttt{ode45} and \\texttt{ode15s} functions.\nImportantly, upon training using a fixed number of collocation points, the\nproposed scheme approximates the solution in the whole domain in contrast to\nthe classical time integration methods.",

          "description": "E-commerce sites strive to provide users the most timely relevant information\nin order to reduce shopping frictions and increase customer satisfaction. Multi\narmed bandit models (MAB) as a type of adaptive optimization algorithms provide\npossible approaches for such purposes. In this paper, we analyze using three\nclassic MAB algorithms, epsilon-greedy, Thompson sampling (TS), and upper\nconfidence bound 1 (UCB1) for dynamic content recommendations, and walk through\nthe process of developing these algorithms internally to solve a real world\ne-commerce use case. First, we analyze the three MAB algorithms using simulated\npurchasing datasets with non-stationary reward distributions to simulate the\npossible time-varying customer preferences, where the traffic allocation\ndynamics and the accumulative rewards of different algorithms are studied.\nSecond, we compare the accumulative rewards of the three MAB algorithms with\nmore than 1,000 trials using actual historical A/B test datasets. We find that\nthe larger difference between the success rates of competing recommendations\nthe more accumulative rewards the MAB algorithms can achieve. In addition, we\nfind that TS shows the highest average accumulative rewards under different\ntesting scenarios. Third, we develop a batch-updated MAB algorithm to overcome\nthe delayed reward issue in e-commerce and enable an online content\noptimization on our App homepage. For a state-of-the-art comparison, a real A/B\ntest among our batch-updated MAB algorithm, a third-party MAB solution, and the\ndefault business logic are conducted. The result shows that our batch-updated\nMAB algorithm outperforms the counterparts and achieves 6.13% relative\nclick-through rate (CTR) increase and 16.1% relative conversion rate (CVR)\nincrease compared to the default experience, and 2.9% relative CTR increase and\n1.4% relative CVR increase compared to the external MAB service.",

          "description": "Noisy labels are commonly found in real-world data, which cause performance\ndegradation of deep neural networks. Cleaning data manually is labour-intensive\nand time-consuming. Previous research mostly focuses on enhancing\nclassification models against noisy labels, while the robustness of deep metric\nlearning (DML) against noisy labels remains less well-explored. In this paper,\nwe bridge this important gap by proposing Probabilistic Ranking-based Instance\nSelection with Memory (PRISM) approach for DML. PRISM calculates the\nprobability of a label being clean, and filters out potentially noisy samples.\nSpecifically, we propose three methods to calculate this probability: 1)\nAverage Similarity Method (AvgSim), which calculates the average similarity\nbetween potentially noisy data and clean data; 2) Proxy Similarity Method\n(ProxySim), which replaces the centers maintained by AvgSim with the proxies\ntrained by proxy-based method; and 3) von Mises-Fisher Distribution Similarity\n(vMF-Sim), which estimates a von Mises-Fisher distribution for each data class.\nWith such a design, the proposed approach can deal with challenging DML\nsituations in which the majority of the samples are noisy. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy dataset show that the\nproposed approach achieves up to 8.37% higher Precision@1 compared with the\nbest performing state-of-the-art baseline approaches, within reasonable\ntraining time.",

          "description": "The compression of deep learning models is of fundamental importance in\ndeploying such models to edge devices. Incorporating hardware model and\napplication constraints during compression maximizes the benefits but makes it\nspecifically designed for one case. Therefore, the compression needs to be\nautomated. Searching for the optimal compression method parameters is\nconsidered an optimization problem. This article introduces a Multi-Objective\nHardware-Aware Quantization (MOHAQ) method, which considers both hardware\nefficiency and inference error as objectives for mixed-precision quantization.\nThe proposed method makes the evaluation of candidate solutions in a large\nsearch space feasible by relying on two steps. First, post-training\nquantization is applied for fast solution evaluation. Second, we propose a\nsearch technique named \"beacon-based search\" to retrain selected solutions only\nin the search space and use them as beacons to know the effect of retraining on\nother solutions. To evaluate the optimization potential, we chose a speech\nrecognition model using the TIMIT dataset. The model is based on Simple\nRecurrent Unit (SRU) due to its considerable speedup over other recurrent\nunits. We applied our method to run on two platforms: SiLago and Bitfusion.\nExperimental evaluations showed that SRU can be compressed up to 8x by\npost-training quantization without any significant increase in the error and up\nto 12x with only a 1.5 percentage point increase in error. On SiLago, the\ninference-only search found solutions that achieve 80\\% and 64\\% of the maximum\npossible speedup and energy saving, respectively, with a 0.5 percentage point\nincrease in the error. On Bitfusion, with a constraint of a small SRAM size,\nbeacon-based search reduced the error gain of inference-only search by 4\npercentage points and increased the possible reached speedup to be 47x compared\nto the Bitfusion baseline.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks continue to awe the world with their remarkable\nperformance. Their predictions, however, are prone to be corrupted by\nadversarial examples that are imperceptible to humans. Current efforts to\nimprove the robustness of neural networks against adversarial examples are\nfocused on developing robust training methods, which update the weights of a\nneural network in a more robust direction. In this work, we take a step beyond\ntraining of the weight parameters and consider the problem of designing an\nadversarially robust neural architecture with high intrinsic robustness. We\npropose AdvRush, a novel adversarial robustness-aware neural architecture\nsearch algorithm, based upon a finding that independent of the training method,\nthe intrinsic robustness of a neural network can be represented with the\nsmoothness of its input loss landscape. Through a regularizer that favors a\ncandidate architecture with a smoother input loss landscape, AdvRush\nsuccessfully discovers an adversarially robust neural architecture. Along with\na comprehensive theoretical motivation for AdvRush, we conduct an extensive\namount of experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of AdvRush on various\nbenchmark datasets. Notably, on CIFAR-10, AdvRush achieves 55.91% robust\naccuracy under FGSM attack after standard training and 50.04% robust accuracy\nunder AutoAttack after 7-step PGD adversarial training.",

          "description": "We study a new challenging problem of efficient deployment for diverse tasks\nwith different resources, where the resource constraint and task of interest\ncorresponding to a group of classes are dynamically specified at testing time.\nPrevious NAS approaches seek to design architectures for all classes\nsimultaneously, which may not be optimal for some individual tasks. A\nstraightforward solution is to search an architecture from scratch for each\ndeployment scenario, which however is computation-intensive and impractical. To\naddress this, we present a novel and general framework, called Elastic\nArchitecture Search (EAS), permitting instant specializations at runtime for\ndiverse tasks with various resource constraints. To this end, we first propose\nto effectively train the over-parameterized network via a task dropout strategy\nto disentangle the tasks during training. In this way, the resulting model is\nrobust to the subsequent task dropping at inference time. Based on the\nwell-trained over-parameterized network, we then propose an efficient\narchitecture generator to obtain optimal architectures within a single forward\npass. Experiments on two image classification datasets show that EAS is able to\nfind more compact networks with better performance while remarkably being\norders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art NAS methods. For example, our\nproposed EAS finds compact architectures within 0.1 second for 50 deployment\nscenarios.",

          "description": "In tracking radar, the sensing environment often varies significantly over a\ntrack duration due to the target's trajectory and dynamic interference.\nAdapting the radar's waveform using partial information about the state of the\nscene has been shown to provide performance benefits in many practical\nscenarios. Moreover, radar measurements generally exhibit strong temporal\ncorrelation, allowing memory-based learning algorithms to effectively learn\nwaveform selection strategies. This work examines a radar system which builds a\ncompressed model of the radar-environment interface in the form of a\ncontext-tree. The radar uses this context tree-based model to select waveforms\nin a signal-dependent target channel, which may respond adversarially to the\nradar's strategy. This approach is guaranteed to asymptotically converge to the\naverage-cost optimal policy for any stationary target channel that can be\nrepresented as a Markov process of order U < $\\infty$, where the constant U is\nunknown to the radar.

          "description": "Neural population activity is theorized to reflect an underlying dynamical\nstructure. This structure can be accurately captured using state space models\nwith explicit dynamics, such as those based on recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs). However, using recurrence to explicitly model dynamics necessitates\nsequential processing of data, slowing real-time applications such as\nbrain-computer interfaces. Here we introduce the Neural Data Transformer (NDT),\na non-recurrent alternative. We test the NDT's ability to capture autonomous\ndynamical systems by applying it to synthetic datasets with known dynamics and\ndata from monkey motor cortex during a reaching task well-modeled by RNNs. The\nNDT models these datasets as well as state-of-the-art recurrent models.\nFurther, its non-recurrence enables 3.9ms inference, well within the loop time\nof real-time applications and more than 6 times faster than recurrent baselines\non the monkey reaching dataset. These results suggest that an explicit dynamics\nmodel is not necessary to model autonomous neural population dynamics. Code:\nhttps://github.com/snel-repo/neural-data-transformers",

The recent emergence of cloud-based quantum computing\ninfrastructure and innovations in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices have\nrevealed a new era of quantum-enhanced algorithms that can be leveraged to\nimprove real-time incident detection accuracy. In this research, a hybrid\nmachine learning model, which includes classical and quantum machine learning\n(ML) models, is developed to identify incidents using the connected vehicle\n(CV) data. The incident detection performance of the hybrid model is evaluated\nagainst baseline classical ML models. The framework is evaluated using data\nfrom a microsimulation tool for different incident scenarios. The results\nindicate that a hybrid neural network containing a 4-qubit quantum layer\noutperforms all other baseline models when there is a lack of training data. We\nhave created three datasets; DS-1 with sufficient training data, and DS-2 and\nDS-3 with insufficient training data. The hybrid model achieves a recall of\n98.9%, 98.3%, and 96.6% for DS-1, DS-2, and DS-3, respectively. For DS-2 and\nDS-3, the average improvement in F2-score (measures model's performance to\ncorrectly identify incidents) achieved by the hybrid model is 1.9% and 7.8%,\nrespectively, compared to the classical models. It shows that with insufficient\ndata, which may be common for CVs, the hybrid ML model will perform better than\nthe classical models.

Despite notable successes, the\nmain disadvantages of NN are also well known: the risk of overfitting, lack of\nexplainability (inability to extract algorithms from trained NN), and high\nconsumption of computing resources. Determining the appropriate specific NN\nstructure for each problem can help overcome these difficulties: Too poor NN\ncannot be successfully trained, but too rich NN gives unexplainable results and\nmay have a high chance of overfitting. Reducing precision of NN parameters\nsimplifies the implementation of these NN, saves computing resources, and makes\nthe NN skills more transparent. This paper lists the basic NN simplification\nproblems and controlled pruning procedures to solve these problems. All the\ndescribed pruning procedures can be implemented in one framework. The developed\nprocedures, in particular, find the optimal structure of NN for each task,\nmeasure the influence of each input signal and NN parameter, and provide a\ndetailed verbal description of the algorithms and skills of NN. The described\nmethods are illustrated by a simple example: the generation of explicit\nalgorithms for predicting the results of the US presidential election.",

          "description": "Soft spelling errors are a class of spelling mistakes that is widespread\namong native Arabic speakers and foreign learners alike. Some of these errors\nare typographical in nature. They occur due to orthographic variations of some\nArabic letters and the complex rules that dictate their correct usage. Many\npeople forgo these rules, and given the identical phonetic sounds, they often\nconfuse such letters. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term\nmemory network that corrects this class of errors. We develop, train, evaluate,\nand compare a set of BiLSTM networks. We approach the spelling correction\nproblem at the character level. We handle Arabic texts from both classical and\nmodern standard Arabic. We treat the problem as a one-to-one sequence\ntranscription problem. Since the soft Arabic errors class encompasses omission\nand addition mistakes, to preserve the one-to-one sequence transcription, we\npropose a simple low-resource yet effective technique that maintains the\none-to-one sequencing and avoids using a costly encoder-decoder architecture.\nWe train the BiLSTM models to correct the spelling mistakes using transformed\ninput and stochastic error injection approaches. We recommend a configuration\nthat has two BiLSTM layers, uses the dropout regularization, and is trained\nusing the latter training approach with error injection rate of 40%. The best\nmodel corrects 96.4% of the injected errors and achieves a low character error\nrate of 1.28% on a real test set of soft spelling mistakes.",

          "description": "Connected vehicles (CVs), because of the external connectivity with other CVs\nand connected infrastructure, are vulnerable to cyberattacks that can instantly\ncompromise the safety of the vehicle itself and other connected vehicles and\nroadway infrastructure.

The occurrence\nand target of such attack events can be very dynamic, making real-time and\nnear-real-time detection challenging. Change point models, can be used for\nreal-time anomaly detection caused by the false information attack. In this\npaper, we have evaluated three change point-based statistical models;\nExpectation Maximization, Cumulative Summation, and Bayesian Online Change\nPoint Algorithms for cyberattack detection in the CV data. Also, data-driven\nartificial intelligence (AI) models, which can be used to detect known and\nunknown underlying patterns in the dataset, have the potential of detecting a\nreal-time anomaly in the CV data.

          "description": "There has been a recent surge of interest in designing Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) for semi-supervised learning tasks. Unfortunately this work has assumed\nthat the nodes labeled for use in training were selected uniformly at random\n(i.e. are an IID sample). However in many real world scenarios gathering labels\nfor graph nodes is both expensive and inherently biased -- so this assumption\ncan not be met. GNNs can suffer poor generalization when this occurs, by\noverfitting to superfluous regularities present in the training data. In this\nwork we present a method, Shift-Robust GNN (SR-GNN), designed to account for\ndistributional differences between biased training data and the graph's true\ninference distribution. SR-GNN adapts GNN models for the presence of\ndistributional shifts between the nodes which have had labels provided for\ntraining and the rest of the dataset. We illustrate the effectiveness of SR-GNN\nin a variety of experiments with biased training datasets on common GNN\nbenchmark datasets for semi-supervised learning, where we see that SR-GNN\noutperforms other GNN baselines by accuracy, eliminating at least (~40%) of the\nnegative effects introduced by biased training data. On the largest dataset we\nconsider, ogb-arxiv, we observe an 2% absolute improvement over the baseline\nand reduce 30% of the negative effects.",

          "description": "Batch normalization (BN) is a popular and ubiquitous method in deep learning\nthat has been shown to decrease training time and improve generalization\nperformance of neural networks. Despite its success, BN is not theoretically\nwell understood. It is not suitable for use with very small mini-batch sizes or\nonline learning. In this paper, we propose a new method called Batch\nNormalization Preconditioning (BNP). Instead of applying normalization\nexplicitly through a batch normalization layer as is done in BN, BNP applies\nnormalization by conditioning the parameter gradients directly during training.\nThis is designed to improve the Hessian matrix of the loss function and hence\nconvergence during training. One benefit is that BNP is not constrained on the\nmini-batch size and works in the online learning setting. Furthermore, its\nconnection to BN provides theoretical insights on how BN improves training and\nhow BN is applied to special architectures such as convolutional neural\nnetworks.",

          "description": "A master face is a face image that passes face-based identity-authentication\nfor a large portion of the population. These faces can be used to impersonate,\nwith a high probability of success, any user, without having access to any user\ninformation. We optimize these faces, by using an evolutionary algorithm in the\nlatent embedding space of the StyleGAN face generator. Multiple evolutionary\nstrategies are compared, and we propose a novel approach that employs a neural\nnetwork in order to direct the search in the direction of promising samples,\nwithout adding fitness evaluations. The results we present demonstrate that it\nis possible to obtain a high coverage of the population (over 40%) with less\nthan 10 master faces, for three leading deep face recognition systems.",
