          "description": "We consider repair tasks: given a critic (e.g., compiler) that assesses the\nquality of an input, the goal is to train a fixer that converts a bad example\n(e.g., code with syntax errors) into a good one (e.g., code with no syntax\nerrors). Existing works create training data consisting of (bad, good) pairs by\ncorrupting good examples using heuristics (e.g., dropping tokens). However,\nfixers trained on this synthetically-generated data do not extrapolate well to\nthe real distribution of bad inputs. To bridge this gap, we propose a new\ntraining approach, Break-It-Fix-It (BIFI), which has two key ideas: (i) we use\nthe critic to check a fixer's output on real bad inputs and add good (fixed)\noutputs to the training data, and (ii) we train a breaker to generate realistic\nbad code from good code. Based on these ideas, we iteratively update the\nbreaker and the fixer while using them in conjunction to generate more paired\ndata. We evaluate BIFI on two code repair datasets: GitHub-Python, a new\ndataset we introduce where the goal is to repair Python code with AST parse\nerrors; and DeepFix, where the goal is to repair C code with compiler errors.\nBIFI outperforms existing methods, obtaining 90.5% repair accuracy on\nGitHub-Python (+28.5%) and 71.7% on DeepFix (+5.6%). Notably, BIFI does not\nrequire any labeled data; we hope it will be a strong starting point for\nunsupervised learning of various repair tasks.",

          "description": "Targeted syntactic evaluations have demonstrated the ability of language\nmodels to perform subject-verb agreement given difficult contexts. To elucidate\nthe mechanisms by which the models accomplish this behavior, this study applies\ncausal mediation analysis to pre-trained neural language models. We investigate\nthe magnitude of models' preferences for grammatical inflections, as well as\nwhether neurons process subject-verb agreement similarly across sentences with\ndifferent syntactic structures. We uncover similarities and differences across\narchitectures and model sizes -- notably, that larger models do not necessarily\nlearn stronger preferences. We also observe two distinct mechanisms for\nproducing subject-verb agreement depending on the syntactic structure of the\ninput sentence. Finally, we find that language models rely on similar sets of\nneurons when given sentences with similar syntactic structure.",

          "description": "Now, the pre-training technique is ubiquitous in natural language processing\nfield. ProphetNet is a pre-training based natural language generation method\nwhich shows powerful performance on English text summarization and question\ngeneration tasks. In this paper, we extend ProphetNet into other domains and\nlanguages, and present the ProphetNet family pre-training models, named\nProphetNet-X, where X can be English, Chinese, Multi-lingual, and so on. We\npre-train a cross-lingual generation model ProphetNet-Multi, a Chinese\ngeneration model ProphetNet-Zh, two open-domain dialog generation models\nProphetNet-Dialog-En and ProphetNet-Dialog-Zh. And also, we provide a PLG\n(Programming Language Generation) model ProphetNet-Code to show the generation\nperformance besides NLG (Natural Language Generation) tasks. In our\nexperiments, ProphetNet-X models achieve new state-of-the-art performance on 10\nbenchmarks. All the models of ProphetNet-X share the same model structure,\nwhich allows users to easily switch between different models. We make the code\nand models publicly available, and we will keep updating more pre-training\nmodels and finetuning scripts.",

          "description": "This paper describes the system submitted to the IWSLT 2021 Multilingual\nSpeech Translation (MultiST) task from Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. We use a unified\ntransformer architecture for our MultiST model, so that the data from different\nmodalities (i.e., speech and text) and different tasks (i.e., Speech\nRecognition, Machine Translation, and Speech Translation) can be exploited to\nenhance the model's ability. Specifically, speech and text inputs are firstly\nfed to different feature extractors to extract acoustic and textual features,\nrespectively. Then, these features are processed by a shared encoder--decoder\narchitecture. We apply several training techniques to improve the performance,\nincluding multi-task learning, task-level curriculum learning, data\naugmentation, etc. Our final system achieves significantly better results than\nbilingual baselines on supervised language pairs and yields reasonable results\non zero-shot language pairs.",

          "description": "Language models trained on billions of tokens have recently led to\nunprecedented results on many NLP tasks. This success raises the question of\nwhether, in principle, a system can ever ``understand'' raw text without access\nto some form of grounding. We formally investigate the abilities of ungrounded\nsystems to acquire meaning. Our analysis focuses on the role of ``assertions'':\ntextual contexts that provide indirect clues about the underlying semantics. We\nstudy whether assertions enable a system to emulate representations preserving\nsemantic relations like equivalence. We find that assertions enable semantic\nemulation of languages that satisfy a strong notion of semantic transparency.\nHowever, for classes of languages where the same expression can take different\nvalues in different contexts, we show that emulation can become uncomputable.\nFinally, we discuss differences between our formal model and natural language,\nexploring how our results generalize to a modal setting and other semantic\nrelations. Together, our results suggest that assertions in code or language do\nnot provide sufficient signal to fully emulate semantic representations. We\nformalize ways in which ungrounded language models appear to be fundamentally\nlimited in their ability to ``understand''.",

          "description": "Most previous studies integrate cognitive language processing signals (e.g.,\neye-tracking or EEG data) into neural models of natural language processing\n(NLP) just by directly concatenating word embeddings with cognitive features,\nignoring the gap between the two modalities (i.e., textual vs. cognitive) and\nnoise in cognitive features. In this paper, we propose a CogAlign approach to\nthese issues, which learns to align textual neural representations to cognitive\nfeatures. In CogAlign, we use a shared encoder equipped with a modality\ndiscriminator to alternatively encode textual and cognitive inputs to capture\ntheir differences and commonalities. Additionally, a text-aware attention\nmechanism is proposed to detect task-related information and to avoid using\nnoise in cognitive features. Experimental results on three NLP tasks, namely\nnamed entity recognition, sentiment analysis and relation extraction, show that\nCogAlign achieves significant improvements with multiple cognitive features\nover state-of-the-art models on public datasets. Moreover, our model is able to\ntransfer cognitive information to other datasets that do not have any cognitive\nprocessing signals.",

          "description": "Current task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems mostly manage structured knowledge\n(e.g. databases and tables) to guide the goal-oriented conversations. However,\nthey fall short of handling dialogs which also involve unstructured knowledge\n(e.g. reviews and documents). In this paper, we formulate a task of modeling\nTOD grounded on a fusion of structured and unstructured knowledge. To address\nthis task, we propose a TOD system with semi-structured knowledge management,\nSeKnow, which extends the belief state to manage knowledge with both structured\nand unstructured contents. Furthermore, we introduce two implementations of\nSeKnow based on a non-pretrained sequence-to-sequence model and a pretrained\nlanguage model, respectively. Both implementations use the end-to-end manner to\njointly optimize dialog modeling grounded on structured and unstructured\nknowledge. We conduct experiments on the modified version of MultiWOZ 2.1\ndataset, where dialogs are processed to involve semi-structured knowledge.\nExperimental results show that SeKnow has strong performances in both\nend-to-end dialog and intermediate knowledge management, compared to existing\nTOD systems and their extensions with pipeline knowledge management schemes.",

          "description": "Distant supervision for relation extraction provides uniform bag labels for\neach sentence inside the bag, while accurate sentence labels are important for\ndownstream applications that need the exact relation type. Directly using bag\nlabels for sentence-level training will introduce much noise, thus severely\ndegrading performance. In this work, we propose the use of negative training\n(NT), in which a model is trained using complementary labels regarding that\n``the instance does not belong to these complementary labels\". Since the\nprobability of selecting a true label as a complementary label is low, NT\nprovides less noisy information. Furthermore, the model trained with NT is able\nto separate the noisy data from the training data. Based on NT, we propose a\nsentence-level framework, SENT, for distant relation extraction. SENT not only\nfilters the noisy data to construct a cleaner dataset, but also performs a\nre-labeling process to transform the noisy data into useful training data, thus\nfurther benefiting the model's performance. Experimental results show the\nsignificant improvement of the proposed method over previous methods on\nsentence-level evaluation and de-noise effect.",

The general idea is that models trained to convert\nthe generated text to/from a reference output or the source text will achieve\nhigher scores when the generated text is better. We operationalize this idea\nusing BART, an encoder-decoder based pre-trained model, and propose a metric\nBARTScore with a number of variants that can be flexibly applied in an\nunsupervised fashion to evaluation of text from different perspectives (e.g.\ninformativeness, fluency, or factuality).

In this paper,\nbeyond this stereotyped layer pattern, we aim to improve pre-trained models by\nexploiting layer variety from two aspects: the layer type set and the layer\norder. Specifically, besides the original self-attention and feed-forward\nlayers, we introduce convolution into the layer type set, which is\nexperimentally found beneficial to pre-trained models. Furthermore, beyond the\noriginal interleaved order, we explore more layer orders to discover more\npowerful architectures. However, the introduced layer variety leads to a large\narchitecture space of more than billions of candidates, while training a single\ncandidate model from scratch already requires huge computation cost, making it\nnot affordable to search such a space by directly training large amounts of\ncandidate models. To solve this problem, we first pre-train a supernet from\nwhich the weights of all candidate models can be inherited, and then adopt an\nevolutionary algorithm guided by pre-training accuracy to find the optimal\narchitecture. Extensive experiments show that LV-BERT model obtained by our\nmethod outperforms BERT and its variants on various downstream tasks.

          "description": "Dysfluencies and variations in speech pronunciation can severely degrade\nspeech recognition performance, and for many individuals with\nmoderate-to-severe speech disorders, voice operated systems do not work.\nCurrent speech recognition systems are trained primarily with data from fluent\nspeakers and as a consequence do not generalize well to speech with\ndysfluencies such as sound or word repetitions, sound prolongations, or audible\nblocks. The focus of this work is on quantitative analysis of a consumer speech\nrecognition system on individuals who stutter and production-oriented\napproaches for improving performance for common voice assistant tasks (i.e.,\n\"what is the weather?\"). At baseline, this system introduces a significant\nnumber of insertion and substitution errors resulting in intended speech Word\nError Rates (isWER) that are 13.64\\% worse (absolute) for individuals with\nfluency disorders. We show that by simply tuning the decoding parameters in an\nexisting hybrid speech recognition system one can improve isWER by 24\\%\n(relative) for individuals with fluency disorders. Tuning these parameters\ntranslates to 3.6\\% better domain recognition and 1.7\\% better intent\nrecognition relative to the default setup for the 18 study participants across\nall stuttering severities.",

          "description": "Most modern neural networks for classification fail to take into account the\nconcept of the unknown. Trained neural networks are usually tested in an\nunrealistic scenario with only examples from a closed set of known classes. In\nan attempt to develop a more realistic model, the concept of working in an open\nset environment has been introduced. This in turn leads to the concept of\nincremental learning where a model with its own architecture and initial\ntrained set of data can identify unknown classes during the testing phase and\nautonomously update itself if evidence of a new class is detected. Some\nproblems that arise in incremental learning are inefficient use of resources to\nretrain the classifier repeatedly and the decrease of classification accuracy\nas multiple classes are added over time. This process of instantiating new\nclasses is repeated as many times as necessary, accruing errors. To address\nthese problems, this paper proposes the Classification Confidence Threshold\napproach to prime neural networks for incremental learning to keep accuracies\nhigh by limiting forgetting. A lean method is also used to reduce resources\nused in the retraining of the neural network. The proposed method is based on\nthe idea that a network is able to incrementally learn a new class even when\nexposed to a limited number samples associated with the new class. This method\ncan be applied to most existing neural networks with minimal changes to network\narchitecture.",

After re-examining their strengths and drawbacks, we\npropose a novel framework to consolidate the zero-shot approach and the\ntranslation-based approach for better adaptation performance. Instead of simply\naugmenting the source data with the machine-translated data, we tailor-make a\nwarm-up mechanism to quickly update the mPTLMs with the gradients estimated on\na few translated data.

We, therefore, carry out a\nsystematic evaluation of transferability of BERT-based neural ranking models\nacross five English datasets. Previous studies focused primarily on zero-shot\nand few-shot transfer from a large dataset to a dataset with a small number of\nqueries. In contrast, each of our collections has a substantial number of\nqueries, which enables a full-shot evaluation mode and improves reliability of\nour results. Furthermore, since source datasets licences often prohibit\ncommercial use, we compare transfer learning to training on pseudo-labels\ngenerated by a BM25 scorer. We find that training on pseudo-labels -- possibly\nwith subsequent fine-tuning using a modest number of annotated queries -- can\nproduce a competitive or better model compared to transfer learning. Yet, it is\nnecessary to improve the stability and/or effectiveness of the few-shot\ntraining, which, sometimes, can degrade performance of a pretrained model.",

          "description": "Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a deep learning pipeline\nto detect signals on dietary supplement-related adverse events (DS AEs) from\nTwitter. Material and Methods: We obtained 247,807 tweets ranging from 2012 to\n2018 that mentioned both DS and AE. We annotated biomedical entities and\nrelations on 2,000 randomly selected tweets. For the concept extraction task,\nwe compared the performance of traditional word embeddings with SVM, CRF and\nLSTM-CRF classifiers to BERT models. For the relation extraction task, we\ncompared GloVe vectors with CNN classifiers to BERT models. We chose the best\nperforming models in each task to assemble an end-to-end deep learning pipeline\nto detect DS AE signals and compared the results to the known DS AEs from a DS\nknowledge base (i.e., iDISK). Results: In both tasks, the BERT-based models\noutperformed traditional word embeddings. The best performing concept\nextraction model is the BioBERT model that can identify supplement, symptom,\nand body organ entities with F1-scores of 0.8646, 0.8497, and 0.7104,\nrespectively. The best performing relation extraction model is the BERT model\nthat can identify purpose and AE relations with F1-scores of 0.8335 and 0.7538,\nrespectively. The end-to-end pipeline was able to extract DS indication and DS\nAEs with an F1-score of 0.7459 and 0,7414, respectively. Comparing to the\niDISK, we could find both known and novel DS-AEs.

In some cases this training is done independently,\nin other cases, it occurs as part of training a larger, task-specific model. In\neither case, it is of interest to consider membership inference attacks based\non the embedding layer as a way of understanding sensitive information leakage.\nBut, somewhat surprisingly, membership inference attacks on word embeddings and\ntheir effect in other natural language processing (NLP) tasks that use these\nembeddings, have remained relatively unexplored.\n\nIn this work, we show that word embeddings are vulnerable to black-box\nmembership inference attacks under realistic assumptions. Furthermore, we show\nthat this leakage persists through two other major NLP applications:\nclassification and text-generation, even when the embedding layer is not\nexposed to the attacker. We show that our MI attack achieves high attack\naccuracy against a classifier model and an LSTM-based language model.

In this paper,\nwe address this problem in an active learning setting where we can spend a\ngiven budget on translating in-domain data, and gradually fine-tune a\npre-trained out-of-domain NMT model on the newly translated data. Existing\nactive learning methods for NMT usually select sentences based on uncertainty\nscores, but these methods require costly translation of full sentences even\nwhen only one or two key phrases within the sentence are informative. To\naddress this limitation, we re-examine previous work from the phrase-based\nmachine translation (PBMT) era that selected not full sentences, but rather\nindividual phrases. However, while incorporating these phrases into PBMT\nsystems was relatively simple, it is less trivial for NMT systems, which need\nto be trained on full sequences to capture larger structural properties of\nsentences unique to the new domain. To overcome these hurdles, we propose to\nselect both full sentences and individual phrases from unlabelled data in the\nnew domain for routing to human translators. In a German-English translation\ntask, our active learning approach achieves consistent improvements over\nuncertainty-based sentence selection methods, improving up to 1.2 BLEU score\nover strong active learning baselines.",

          "description": "Despite pre-trained language models such as BERT have achieved appealing\nperformance in a wide range of natural language processing tasks, they are\ncomputationally expensive to be deployed in real-time applications. A typical\nmethod is to adopt knowledge distillation to compress these large pre-trained\nmodels (teacher models) to small student models.

To tackle\nthis problem, we propose a method to learn to augment for data-scarce domain\nBERT knowledge distillation, by learning a cross-domain manipulation scheme\nthat automatically augments the target with the help of resource-rich source\ndomains. Specifically, the proposed method generates samples acquired from a\nstationary distribution near the target data and adopts a reinforced selector\nto automatically refine the augmentation strategy according to the performance\nof the student. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four different tasks,\nand for the data-scarce domains, the compressed student models even perform\nbetter than the original large teacher model, with much fewer parameters (only\n${\\sim}13.3\\%$) when only a few labeled examples available.",

Despite achieving good\nperformance on some public benchmarks, existing text-to-SQL models typically\nrely on the lexical matching between words in natural language (NL) questions\nand tokens in table schemas, which may render the models vulnerable to attacks\nthat break the schema linking mechanism. In this work, we investigate the\nrobustness of text-to-SQL models to synonym substitution. In particular, we\nintroduce Spider-Syn, a human-curated dataset based on the Spider benchmark for\ntext-to-SQL translation. NL questions in Spider-Syn are modified from Spider,\nby replacing their schema-related words with manually selected synonyms that\nreflect real-world question paraphrases. We observe that the accuracy\ndramatically drops by eliminating such explicit correspondence between NL\nquestions and table schemas, even if the synonyms are not adversarially\nselected to conduct worst-case adversarial attacks. Finally, we present two\ncategories of approaches to improve the model robustness. The first category of\napproaches utilizes additional synonym annotations for table schemas by\nmodifying the model input, while the second category is based on adversarial\ntraining. We demonstrate that both categories of approaches significantly\noutperform their counterparts without the defense, and the first category of\napproaches are more effective.",

And the weighted sum of context hidden states is used\nas the final representation fed to the classifier. However, the information\nrelated to the given aspect may be already discarded and adverse information\nmay be retained in the context modeling processes of existing models.

          "description": "Speaker diarization is a task to label audio or video recordings with classes\nthat correspond to speaker identity, or in short, a task to identify \"who spoke\nwhen\". In the early years, speaker diarization algorithms were developed for\nspeech recognition on multispeaker audio recordings to enable speaker adaptive\nprocessing. These algorithms also gained their own value as a standalone\napplication over time to provide speaker-specific metainformation for\ndownstream tasks such as audio retrieval. More recently, with the emergence of\ndeep learning technology, which has driven revolutionary changes in research\nand practices across speech application domains, rapid advancements have been\nmade for speaker diarization. In this paper, we review not only the historical\ndevelopment of speaker diarization technology but also the recent advancements\nin neural speaker diarization approaches. Furthermore, we discuss how speaker\ndiarization systems have been integrated with speech recognition applications\nand how the recent surge of deep learning is leading the way of jointly\nmodeling these two components to be complementary to each other. By considering\nsuch exciting technical trends, we believe that this paper is a valuable\ncontribution to the community to provide a survey work by consolidating the\nrecent developments with neural methods and thus facilitating further progress\ntoward a more efficient speaker diarization.",

          "description": "With recent advances in distantly supervised (DS) relation extraction (RE),\nconsiderable attention is attracted to leverage multi-instance learning (MIL)\nto distill high-quality supervision from the noisy DS. Here, we go beyond label\nnoise and identify the key bottleneck of DS-MIL to be its low data utilization:\nas high-quality supervision being refined by MIL, MIL abandons a large amount\nof training instances, which leads to a low data utilization and hinders model\ntraining from having abundant supervision. In this paper, we propose\ncollaborative adversarial training to improve the data utilization, which\ncoordinates virtual adversarial training (VAT) and adversarial training (AT) at\ndifferent levels. Specifically, since VAT is label-free, we employ the\ninstance-level VAT to recycle instances abandoned by MIL. Besides, we deploy AT\nat the bag-level to unleash the full potential of the high-quality supervision\ngot by MIL. Our proposed method brings consistent improvements (~ 5 absolute\nAUC score) to the previous state of the art, which verifies the importance of\nthe data utilization issue and the effectiveness of our method.",

This codebook provides\ncoding guidelines for a revised version of the Institutional Grammar, the\nInstitutional Grammar 2.0 (IG 2.0). IG 2.0 is a specification that aims at\nfacilitating the encoding of policy to meet varying analytical objectives. To\nthis end, it revises the grammar with respect to comprehensiveness,\nflexibility, and specificity by offering multiple levels of expressiveness (IG\nCore, IG Extended, IG Logico). In addition to the encoding of regulative\nstatements, it further introduces the encoding of constitutive institutional\nstatements, as well as statements that exhibit both constitutive and regulative\ncharacteristics. Introducing those aspects, the codebook initially covers\nfundamental concepts of IG 2.0, before providing an overview of pre-coding\nsteps relevant for document preparation. Detailed coding guidelines are\nprovided for both regulative and constitutive statements across all levels of\nexpressiveness, along with the encoding guidelines for statements of mixed form\n-- hybrid and polymorphic institutional statements. The document further\nprovides an overview of taxonomies used in the encoding process and referred to\nthroughout the codebook. The codebook concludes with a summary and discussion\nof relevant considerations to facilitate the coding process. An initial\nReader's Guide helps the reader tailor the content to her interest.\n\nNote that this codebook specifically focuses on operational aspects of IG 2.0\nin the context of policy coding.

However, they\ncurrently require large pretraining corpora or access to typologically similar\nlanguages. In this work, we address these obstacles by removing language\nidentity signals from multilingual embeddings. We examine three approaches for\nthis: (i) re-aligning the vector spaces of target languages (all together) to a\npivot source language; (ii) removing language-specific means and variances,\nwhich yields better discriminativeness of embeddings as a by-product; and (iii)\nincreasing input similarity across languages by removing morphological\ncontractions and sentence reordering. We evaluate on XNLI and reference-free MT\nacross 19 typologically diverse languages. Our findings expose the limitations\nof these approaches -- unlike vector normalization, vector space re-alignment\nand text normalization do not achieve consistent gains across encoders and\nlanguages. Due to the approaches' additive effects, their combination decreases\nthe cross-lingual transfer gap by 8.9 points (m-BERT) and 18.2 points (XLM-R)\non average across all tasks and languages, however.

We introduce new methods for incorporating VIsual LAyout (VILA)\nstructures, e.g., the grouping of page texts into text lines or text blocks,\ninto language models to further improve performance.

          "description": "Assessing an AI agent that can converse in human language and understand\nvisual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor\ncorrect syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,\nwhere an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)\nmetric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a\nsingle human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:\nthe ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence\n(e.g., `yeah' and `yes'). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative\ngain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct\nanswers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually\napplicable uncertain answers such as `I don't know. Crafting a model that\nexcels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should\nanswer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To\naddress this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that\ncan merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep\nmost MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG\nstate-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%).

          "description": "Recent advancements in deep learning have created many opportunities to solve\nreal-world problems that remained unsolved for more than a decade. Automatic\ncaption generation is a major research field, and the research community has\ndone a lot of work on it in most common languages like English. Urdu is the\nnational language of Pakistan and also much spoken and understood in the\nsub-continent region of Pakistan-India, and yet no work has been done for Urdu\nlanguage caption generation. Our research aims to fill this gap by developing\nan attention-based deep learning model using techniques of sequence modeling\nspecialized for the Urdu language. We have prepared a dataset in the Urdu\nlanguage by translating a subset of the \"Flickr8k\" dataset containing 700 'man'\nimages. We evaluate our proposed technique on this dataset and show that it can\nachieve a BLEU score of 0.83 in the Urdu language. We improve on the previous\nstate-of-the-art by using better CNN architectures and optimization techniques.\nFurthermore, we provide a discussion on how the generated captions can be made\ncorrect grammar-wise.",

          "description": "In this paper we present an efficient method for training models for speaker\nrecognition using small or under-resourced datasets. This method requires less\ndata than other SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) methods, e.g. the Angular Prototypical\nand GE2E loss functions, while achieving similar results to those methods. This\nis done using the knowledge of the reconstruction of a phoneme in the speaker's\nvoice. For this purpose, a new dataset was built, composed of 40 male speakers,\nwho read sentences in Portuguese, totaling approximately 3h. We compare the\nthree best architectures trained using our method to select the best one, which\nis the one with a shallow architecture. Then, we compared this model with the\nSOTA method for the speaker recognition task: the Fast ResNet-34 trained with\napproximately 2,000 hours, using the loss functions Angular Prototypical and\nGE2E. Three experiments were carried out with datasets in different languages.\nAmong these three experiments, our model achieved the second best result in two\nexperiments and the best result in one of them. This highlights the importance\nof our method, which proved to be a great competitor to SOTA speaker\nrecognition models, with 500x less data and a simpler approach.",

Increasing\ncases of online antisemitism have become one of the major concerns because of\nits socio-political consequences. Unlike other major forms of online abuse like\nracism, sexism, etc., online antisemitism has not been studied much from a\nmachine learning perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we present the\nfirst work in the direction of automated multimodal detection of online\nantisemitism. The task poses multiple challenges that include extracting\nsignals across multiple modalities, contextual references, and handling\nmultiple aspects of antisemitism. Unfortunately, there does not exist any\npublicly available benchmark corpus for this critical task. Hence, we collect\nand label two datasets with 3,102 and 3,509 social media posts from Twitter and\nGab respectively. Further, we present a multimodal deep learning system that\ndetects the presence of antisemitic content and its specific antisemitism\ncategory using text and images from posts.

          "description": "Dialogue relation extraction (DRE) aims to detect the relation between two\nentities mentioned in a multi-party dialogue. It plays an important role in\nconstructing knowledge graphs from conversational data increasingly abundant on\nthe internet and facilitating intelligent dialogue system development. The\nprior methods of DRE do not meaningfully leverage speaker information-they just\nprepend the utterances with the respective speaker names. Thus, they fail to\nmodel the crucial inter-speaker relations that may give additional context to\nrelevant argument entities through pronouns and triggers. We, however, present\na graph attention network-based method for DRE where a graph, that contains\nmeaningfully connected speaker, entity, entity-type, and utterance nodes, is\nconstructed. This graph is fed to a graph attention network for context\npropagation among relevant nodes, which effectively captures the dialogue\ncontext. We empirically show that this graph-based approach quite effectively\ncaptures the relations between different entity pairs in a dialogue as it\noutperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin on the\nbenchmark dataset DialogRE.

          "description": "Nowadays, there are many applications of text mining over corpora from\ndifferent languages. However, most of them are based on texts in prose, lacking\napplications that work with poetry texts. An example of an application of text\nmining in poetry is the usage of features derived from their individual words\nin order to capture the lexical, sublexical and interlexical meaning, and infer\nthe General Affective Meaning (GAM) of the text. However, even though this\nproposal has been proved as useful for poetry in some languages, there is a\nlack of studies for both Spanish poetry and for highly-structured poetic\ncompositions such as sonnets. This article presents a study over an annotated\ncorpus of Spanish sonnets, in order to analyse if it is possible to build\nfeatures from their individual words for predicting their GAM. The purpose of\nthis is to model sonnets at an affective level. The article also analyses the\nrelationship between the GAM of the sonnets and the content itself. For this,\nwe consider the content from a psychological perspective, identifying with tags\nwhen a sonnet is related to a specific term. Then, we study how GAM changes\naccording to each of those psychological terms.\n\nThe corpus used contains 274 Spanish sonnets from authors of different\ncenturies, from 15th to 19th. This corpus was annotated by different domain\nexperts. The experts annotated the poems with affective and lexico-semantic\nfeatures, as well as with domain concepts that belong to psychology. Thanks to\nthis, the corpus of sonnets can be used in different applications, such as\npoetry recommender systems, personality text mining studies of the authors, or\nthe usage of poetry for therapeutic purposes.",

However,\nthe semantic gap between source code and natural language poses a major\nchallenge for the task. Several studies have been proposed to alleviate the\nchallenge but none explicitly involves code contextual information during\ncommit message generation.

In this paper, we propose a novel Contextualized code\nrepresentation learning strategy for commit message Generation (CoreGen).\nCoreGen first learns contextualized code representations which exploit the\ncontextual information behind code commit sequences. The learned\nrepresentations of code commits built upon Transformer are then fine-tuned for\ndownstream commit message generation.

          "description": "In recent years, the size of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has grown by\nleaps and bounds. However, efficiency issues of these large-scale PLMs limit\ntheir utilization in real-world scenarios. We present a suite of cost-effective\ntechniques for the use of PLMs to deal with the efficiency issues of\npre-training, fine-tuning, and inference. (1) We introduce knowledge\ninheritance to accelerate the pre-training process by exploiting existing PLMs\ninstead of training models from scratch. (2) We explore the best practice of\nprompt tuning with large-scale PLMs. Compared with conventional fine-tuning,\nprompt tuning significantly reduces the number of task-specific parameters. (3)\nWe implement a new inference toolkit, namely InfMoE, for using large-scale PLMs\nwith limited computational resources. Based on our cost-effective pipeline, we\npre-train two models: an encoder-decoder bilingual model with 11 billion\nparameters (CPM-2) and its corresponding MoE version with 198 billion\nparameters. In our experiments, we compare CPM-2 with mT5 on downstream tasks.\nExperimental results show that CPM-2 has excellent general language\nintelligence. Moreover, we validate the efficiency of InfMoE when conducting\ninference of large-scale models having tens of billions of parameters on a\nsingle GPU.

          "description": "Although emotions are universal concepts, transferring the different shades\nof emotion from one language to another may not always be straightforward for\nhuman translators, let alone for machine translation systems. Moreover, the\ncognitive states are established by verbal explanations of experience which is\nshaped by both the verbal and cultural contexts. There are a number of verbal\ncontexts where expression of emotions constitutes the pivotal component of the\nmessage. This is particularly true for User-Generated Content (UGC) which can\nbe in the form of a review of a product or a service, a tweet, or a social\nmedia post. Recently, it has become common practice for multilingual websites\nsuch as Twitter to provide an automatic translation of UGC to reach out to\ntheir linguistically diverse users. In such scenarios, the process of\ntranslating the user's emotion is entirely automatic with no human\nintervention, neither for post-editing nor for accuracy checking. In this\nresearch, we assess whether automatic translation tools can be a successful\nreal-life utility in transferring emotion in user-generated multilingual data\nsuch as tweets. We show that there are linguistic phenomena specific of Twitter\ndata that pose a challenge in translation of emotions in different languages.\nWe summarise these challenges in a list of linguistic features and show how\nfrequent these features are in different language pairs. We also assess the\ncapacity of commonly used methods for evaluating the performance of an MT\nsystem with respect to the preservation of emotion in the source text.",

This framework first selects salient sentences and\nthen independently condenses each of the selected sentences into a concise\nversion. However, compressing sentences separately ignores the context\ninformation of the document, and is therefore prone to delete salient\ninformation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel\ncondense-then-select framework for text summarization. Our framework first\nconcurrently condenses each document sentence. Original document sentences and\ntheir compressed versions then become the candidates for extraction. Finally,\nan extractor utilizes the context information of the document to select\ncandidates and assembles them into a summary. If salient information is deleted\nduring condensing, the extractor can select an original sentence to retain the\ninformation. Thus, our framework helps to avoid the loss of salient\ninformation, while preserving the high efficiency of sentence-level\ncompression. Experiment results on the CNN/DailyMail, DUC-2002, and Pubmed\ndatasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms the select-then-compress\nframework and other strong baselines.",

          "description": "Predicting the next utterance in dialogue is contingent on encoding of users'\ninput text to generate appropriate and relevant response in data-driven\napproaches. Although the semantic and syntactic quality of the language\ngenerated is evaluated, more often than not, the encoded representation of\ninput is not evaluated. As the representation of the encoder is essential for\npredicting the appropriate response, evaluation of encoder representation is a\nchallenging yet important problem. In this work, we showcase evaluating the\ntext generated through human or automatic metrics is not sufficient to\nappropriately evaluate soundness of the language understanding of dialogue\nmodels and, to that end, propose a set of probe tasks to evaluate encoder\nrepresentation of different language encoders commonly used in dialogue models.\nFrom experiments, we observe that some of the probe tasks are easier and some\nare harder for even sophisticated model architectures to learn. And, through\nexperiments we observe that RNN based architectures have lower performance on\nautomatic metrics on text generation than transformer model but perform better\nthan the transformer model on the probe tasks indicating that RNNs might\npreserve task information better than the Transformers.",

          "description": "Transformer has been widely adopted in Neural Machine Translation (NMT)\nbecause of its large capacity and parallel training of sequence generation.\nHowever, the deployment of Transformer is challenging because different\nscenarios require models of different complexities and scales. Naively training\nmultiple Transformers is redundant in terms of both computation and memory. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Scalable Transformers, which naturally contains\nsub-Transformers of different scales and have shared parameters. Each\nsub-Transformer can be easily obtained by cropping the parameters of the\nlargest Transformer. A three-stage training scheme is proposed to tackle the\ndifficulty of training the Scalable Transformers, which introduces additional\nsupervisions from word-level and sequence-level self-distillation.

However, these models still\nsuffer from the challenge of data scarcity. How to effectively use unlabeled or\nother parallel corpora from machine translation is promising but still an open\nproblem. In this paper, we propose Cross Speech-Text Network (XSTNet), an\nend-to-end model for speech-to-text translation. XSTNet takes both speech and\ntext as input and outputs both transcription and translation text. The model\nbenefits from its three key design aspects: a self-supervised pre-trained\nsub-network as the audio encoder, a multi-task training objective to exploit\nadditional parallel bilingual text, and a progressive training procedure. We\nevaluate the performance of XSTNet and baselines on the MuST-C En-X and\nLibriSpeech En-Fr datasets. In particular, XSTNet achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on all language directions with an average BLEU of 28.8, outperforming\nthe previous best method by 3.2 BLEU.

The main motivation of WeNet is to close the gap\nbetween the research and the production of E2E speechrecognition models.

The inference latency could be easily\ncontrolled by only changing the chunk size. The CTC hypotheses are then\nrescored by the attention decoder to get the final result.

          "description": "In deep neural network modeling, the most common practice is to stack a\nnumber of recurrent, convolutional, or feed-forward layers in order to obtain\nhigh-quality continuous space representations which in turn improves the\nquality of the network's prediction. Conventionally, each layer in the stack\nhas its own parameters which leads to a significant increase in the number of\nmodel parameters. In this paper, we propose to share parameters across all\nlayers thereby leading to a recurrently stacked neural network model. We report\non an extensive case study on neural machine translation (NMT), where we apply\nour proposed method to an encoder-decoder based neural network model, i.e., the\nTransformer model, and experiment with three Japanese--English translation\ndatasets. We empirically demonstrate that the translation quality of a model\nthat recurrently stacks a single layer 6 times, despite having significantly\nfewer parameters, approaches that of a model that stacks 6 layers where each\nlayer has different parameters. We also explore the limits of recurrent\nstacking where we train extremely deep NMT models. This paper also examines the\nutility of our recurrently stacked model as a student model through transfer\nlearning via leveraging pre-trained parameters and knowledge distillation, and\nshows that it compensates for the performance drops in translation quality that\nthe direct training of recurrently stacked model brings. We also show how\ntransfer learning helps in faster decoding on top of the already reduced number\nof parameters due to recurrent stacking. Finally, we analyze the effects of\nrecurrently stacked layers by visualizing the attentions of models that use\nrecurrently stacked layers and models that do not.",

          "description": "Human creativity generates novel ideas to solve real-world problems. This\nthereby grants us the power to transform the surrounding world and extend our\nhuman attributes beyond what is currently possible. Creative ideas are not just\nnew and unexpected, but are also successful in providing solutions that are\nuseful, efficient and valuable. Thus, creativity optimizes the use of available\nresources and increases wealth. The origin of human creativity, however, is\npoorly understood, and semantic measures that could predict the success of\ngenerated ideas are currently unknown. Here, we analyze a dataset of design\nproblem-solving conversations in real-world settings by using 49 semantic\nmeasures based on WordNet 3.1 and demonstrate that a divergence of semantic\nsimilarity, an increased information content, and a decreased polysemy predict\nthe success of generated ideas. The first feedback from clients also enhances\ninformation content and leads to a divergence of successful ideas in creative\nproblem solving. These results advance cognitive science by identifying\nreal-world processes in human problem solving that are relevant to the success\nof produced solutions and provide tools for real-time monitoring of problem\nsolving, student training and skill acquisition. A selected subset of\ninformation content (IC S\\'anchez-Batet) and semantic similarity\n(Lin/S\\'anchez-Batet) measures, which are both statistically powerful and\ncomputationally fast, could support the development of technologies for\ncomputer-assisted enhancements of human creativity or for the implementation of\ncreativity in machines endowed with general artificial intelligence.",

In this approach, a representation is obtained via\nreduction to supervised learning, where given a notion of semantic similarity,\nthe learner tries to distinguish a similar (positive) example from a collection\nof random (negative) examples. The success of modern contrastive learning\npipelines relies on many parameters such as the choice of data augmentation,\nthe number of negative examples, and the batch size; however, there is limited\nunderstanding as to how these parameters interact and affect downstream\nperformance. We focus on disambiguating the role of one of these parameters:\nthe number of negative examples. Theoretically, we show the existence of a\ncollision-coverage trade-off suggesting that the optimal number of negative\nexamples should scale with the number of underlying concepts in the data.\nEmpirically, we scrutinize the role of the number of negatives in both NLP and\nvision tasks. In the NLP task, we find that the results broadly agree with our\ntheory, while our vision experiments are murkier with performance sometimes\neven being insensitive to the number of negatives.

          "description": "Entity linking (EL), the task of disambiguating mentions in text by linking\nthem to entities in a knowledge graph, is crucial for text understanding,\nquestion answering or conversational systems. Entity linking on short text\n(e.g., single sentence or question) poses particular challenges due to limited\ncontext. While prior approaches use either heuristics or black-box neural\nmethods, here we propose LNN-EL, a neuro-symbolic approach that combines the\nadvantages of using interpretable rules based on first-order logic with the\nperformance of neural learning. Even though constrained to using rules, LNN-EL\nperforms competitively against SotA black-box neural approaches, with the added\nbenefits of extensibility and transferability. In particular, we show that we\ncan easily blend existing rule templates given by a human expert, with multiple\ntypes of features (priors, BERT encodings, box embeddings, etc), and even\nscores resulting from previous EL methods, thus improving on such methods. For\ninstance, on the LC-QuAD-1.0 dataset, we show more than $4$\\% increase in F1\nscore over previous SotA. Finally, we show that the inductive bias offered by\nusing logic results in learned rules that transfer well across datasets, even\nwithout fine tuning, while maintaining high accuracy.",

          "description": "Public concern detection provides potential guidance to the authorities for\ncrisis management before or during a pandemic outbreak. Detecting people's\nconcerns and attention from online social media platforms has been widely\nacknowledged as an effective approach to relieve public panic and prevent a\nsocial crisis. However, detecting concerns in time from massive information in\nsocial media turns out to be a big challenge, especially when sufficient\nmanually labeled data is in the absence of public health emergencies, e.g.,\nCOVID-19. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model to\nidentify people's concerns and the corresponding relations based on Graph\nConvolutional Network and Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory integrated with\nConcern Graph. Except for the sequential features from BERT embeddings, the\nregional features of tweets can be extracted by the Concern Graph module, which\nnot only benefits the concern detection but also enables our model to be high\nnoise-tolerant. Thus, our model can address the issue of insufficient manually\nlabeled data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model\nby using both manually labeled tweets and automatically labeled tweets.

          "description": "Several years of research have shown that machine-learning systems are\nvulnerable to adversarial examples, both in theory and in practice. Until now,\nsuch attacks have primarily targeted visual models, exploiting the gap between\nhuman and machine perception. Although text-based models have also been\nattacked with adversarial examples, such attacks struggled to preserve semantic\nmeaning and indistinguishability. In this paper, we explore a large class of\nadversarial examples that can be used to attack text-based models in a\nblack-box setting without making any human-perceptible visual modification to\ninputs. We use encoding-specific perturbations that are imperceptible to the\nhuman eye to manipulate the outputs of a wide range of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) systems from neural machine-translation pipelines to web\nsearch engines. We find that with a single imperceptible encoding injection --\nrepresenting one invisible character, homoglyph, reordering, or deletion -- an\nattacker can significantly reduce the performance of vulnerable models, and\nwith three injections most models can be functionally broken. Our attacks work\nagainst currently-deployed commercial systems, including those produced by\nMicrosoft and Google, in addition to open source models published by Facebook\nand IBM. This novel series of attacks presents a significant threat to many\nlanguage processing systems: an attacker can affect systems in a targeted\nmanner without any assumptions about the underlying model. We conclude that\ntext-based NLP systems require careful input sanitization, just like\nconventional applications, and that given such systems are now being deployed\nrapidly at scale, the urgent attention of architects and operators is required.",

          "description": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models make fewer errors when more\nsurrounding speech information is presented as context. Unfortunately,\nacquiring a larger future context leads to higher latency. There exists an\ninevitable trade-off between speed and accuracy. Naively, to fit different\nlatency requirements, people have to store multiple models and pick the best\none under the constraints. Instead, a more desirable approach is to have a\nsingle model that can dynamically adjust its latency based on different\nconstraints, which we refer to as Multi-mode ASR. A Multi-mode ASR model can\nfulfill various latency requirements during inference -- when a larger latency\nbecomes acceptable, the model can process longer future context to achieve\nhigher accuracy and when a latency budget is not flexible, the model can be\nless dependent on future context but still achieve reliable accuracy. In\npursuit of Multi-mode ASR, we propose Stochastic Future Context, a simple\ntraining procedure that samples one streaming configuration in each iteration.\nThrough extensive experiments on AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech datasets, we show\nthat a Multi-mode ASR model rivals, if not surpasses, a set of competitive\nstreaming baselines trained with different latency budgets.",

          "description": "Building a benchmark dataset for hate speech detection presents several\nchallenges. Firstly, because hate speech is relatively rare -- e.g., less than\n3\\% of Twitter posts are hateful \\citep{founta2018large} -- random sampling of\ntweets to annotate is inefficient in capturing hate speech. A common practice\nis to only annotate tweets containing known ``hate words'', but this risks\nyielding a biased benchmark that only partially captures the real-world\nphenomenon of interest. A second challenge is that definitions of hate speech\ntend to be highly variable and subjective. Annotators having diverse prior\nnotions of hate speech may not only disagree with one another but also struggle\nto conform to specified labeling guidelines. Our key insight is that the rarity\nand subjectivity of hate speech are akin to that of relevance in information\nretrieval (IR). This connection suggests that well-established methodologies\nfor creating IR test collections might also be usefully applied to create\nbetter benchmark datasets for hate speech detection. Firstly, to intelligently\nand efficiently select which tweets to annotate, we apply established IR\ntechniques of {\\em pooling} and {\\em active learning}. Secondly, to improve\nboth consistency and value of annotations, we apply {\\em task decomposition}\n\\cite{Zhang-sigir14} and {\\em annotator rationale} \\cite{mcdonnell16-hcomp}\ntechniques. Using the above techniques, we create and share a new benchmark\ndataset\\footnote{We will release the dataset upon publication.} for hate speech\ndetection with broader coverage than prior datasets. We also show a dramatic\ndrop in accuracy of existing detection models when tested on these broader\nforms of hate. Collected annotator rationales not only provide documented\nsupport for labeling decisions but also create exciting future work\nopportunities for dual-supervision and/or explanation generation in modeling.",

          "description": "As the vocabulary size of modern word-based language models becomes ever\nlarger, many sampling-based training criteria are proposed and investigated.\nThe essence of these sampling methods is that the softmax-related traversal\nover the entire vocabulary can be simplified, giving speedups compared to the\nbaseline. A problem we notice about the current landscape of such sampling\nmethods is the lack of a systematic comparison and some myths about preferring\none over another. In this work, we consider Monte Carlo sampling, importance\nsampling, a novel method we call compensated partial summation, and noise\ncontrastive estimation. Linking back to the three traditional criteria, namely\nmean squared error, binary cross-entropy, and cross-entropy, we derive the\ntheoretical solutions to the training problems. Contrary to some common belief,\nwe show that all these sampling methods can perform equally well, as long as we\ncorrect for the intended class posterior probabilities. Experimental results in\nlanguage modeling and automatic speech recognition on Switchboard and\nLibriSpeech support our claim, with all sampling-based methods showing similar\nperplexities and word error rates while giving the expected speedups.",

          "description": "In this paper, we identify an interesting kind of error in the output of\nUnsupervised Neural Machine Translation (UNMT) systems like\n\\textit{Undreamt}(footnote). We refer to this error type as \\textit{Scrambled\nTranslation problem}. We observe that UNMT models which use \\textit{word\nshuffle} noise (as in case of Undreamt) can generate correct words, but fail to\nstitch them together to form phrases. As a result, words of the translated\nsentence look \\textit{scrambled}, resulting in decreased BLEU. We hypothesise\nthat the reason behind \\textit{scrambled translation problem} is 'shuffling\nnoise' which is introduced in every input sentence as a denoising strategy. To\ntest our hypothesis, we experiment by retraining UNMT models with a simple\n\\textit{retraining} strategy. We stop the training of the Denoising UNMT model\nafter a pre-decided number of iterations and resume the training for the\nremaining iterations -- which number is also pre-decided -- using original\nsentence as input without adding any noise. Our proposed solution achieves\nsignificant performance improvement UNMT models that train conventionally. We\ndemonstrate these performance gains on four language pairs, \\textit{viz.},\nEnglish-French, English-German, English-Spanish, Hindi-Punjabi. Our qualitative\nand quantitative analysis shows that the retraining strategy helps achieve\nbetter alignment as observed by attention heatmap and better phrasal\ntranslation, leading to statistically significant improvement in BLEU scores.",

In this context, existing\nresearch has shown that patients often develop language impairment even in mild\nAD conditions. We propose a multimodal deep learning method that utilizes\nspeech and the corresponding transcript simultaneously to detect AD. For audio\nsignals, the proposed audio-based network, a convolutional neural network (CNN)\nbased model, predicts the diagnosis for multiple speech segments, which are\ncombined for the final prediction. Similarly, we use contextual embedding\nextracted from BERT concatenated with a CNN-generated embedding for classifying\nthe transcript. The individual predictions of the two models are then combined\nto make the final classification. We also perform experiments to analyze the\nmodel performance when Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) system generated\ntranscripts are used instead of manual transcription in the text-based model.\nThe proposed method achieves 85.3% 10-fold cross-validation accuracy when\ntrained and evaluated on the Dementiabank Pitt corpus.",

However, vocabulary coverage issues, differences\nin construction method and discrepancies in emotion framework and\nrepresentation result in a heterogeneous landscape of emotion detection\nresources, calling for a unified approach to utilising them. To combat this, we\npresent an extended emotion lexicon of 30,273 unique entries, which is a result\nof merging eight existing emotion lexica by means of a multi-view variational\nautoencoder (VAE). We showed that a VAE is a valid approach for combining\nlexica with different label spaces into a joint emotion label space with a\nchosen number of dimensions, and that these dimensions are still interpretable.\nWe tested the utility of the unified VAE lexicon by employing the lexicon\nvalues as features in an emotion detection model.

Social media provides an opportunity to\nestimate emerging risks to vaccine acceptance by including geographical\nlocation and detailing vaccine-related concerns. Methods for classifying social\nmedia posts, such as vaccine-related tweets, use language models (LMs) trained\non general domain text. However, challenges to measuring vaccine sentiment at\nscale arise from the absence of tonal stress and gestural cues and may not\nalways have additional information about the user, e.g., past tweets or social\nconnections. Another challenge in LMs is the lack of commonsense knowledge that\nare apparent in users metadata, i.e., emoticons, positive and negative words\netc. In this study, to classify vaccine sentiment tweets with limited\ninformation, we present a novel end-to-end framework consisting of\ninterconnected components that use domain-specific LM trained on\nvaccine-related tweets and models commonsense knowledge into a bidirectional\ngated recurrent network (CK-BiGRU) with context-aware attention.

Then, we\nsuggest the main advantage of the multi-head attention is the training\nstability, since it has less number of layers than the single-head attention,\nwhen attending the same number of positions. For example, 24-layer 16-head\nTransformer (BERT-large) and 384-layer single-head Transformer has the same\ntotal attention head number and roughly the same model size, while the\nmulti-head one is significantly shallower.

In contrast to previous work\nusing sentence planning, our model is still end-to-end: AGGGEN performs\nsentence planning at the same time as generating text by learning latent\nalignments (via semantic facts) between input representation and target text.\nExperiments on the WebNLG and E2E challenge data show that by using fact-based\nalignments our approach is more interpretable, expressive, robust to noise, and\neasier to control, while retaining the advantages of end-to-end systems in\nterms of fluency.

However, generating entity\ndescriptions, especially for new and long-tail entities, can be challenging\nsince relevant information is often scattered across multiple sources with\nvaried content and style. We introduce DESCGEN: given mentions spread over\nmultiple documents, the goal is to generate an entity summary description.\nDESCGEN consists of 37K entity descriptions from Wikipedia and Fandom, each\npaired with nine evidence documents on average. The documents were collected\nusing a combination of entity linking and hyperlinks to the Wikipedia and\nFandom entity pages, which together provide high-quality distant supervision.\nThe resulting summaries are more abstractive than those found in existing\ndatasets and provide a better proxy for the challenge of describing new and\nemerging entities. We also propose a two-stage extract-then-generate baseline\nand show that there exists a large gap (19.9% in ROUGE-L) between\nstate-of-the-art models and human performance, suggesting that the data will\nsupport significant future work.",

          "description": "The dominant paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale\npre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or\ndomains. As we pre-train larger models, conventional fine-tuning, which\nretrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an\nexample, deploying many independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with\n175B parameters, is extremely expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or\nLoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank\ndecomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly\nreducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. For GPT-3,\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\ncomputation hardware requirement by 3 times compared to full fine-tuning. LoRA\nperforms on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on both GPT-3 and\nGPT-2, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput,\nand no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation\ninto rank-deficiency in language model adaptations, which sheds light on the\nefficacy of LoRA.

          "description": "The ability of semantic reasoning over the sentence pair is essential for\nmany natural language understanding tasks, e.g., natural language inference and\nmachine reading comprehension. A recent significant improvement in these tasks\ncomes from BERT. As reported, the next sentence prediction (NSP) in BERT, which\nlearns the contextual relationship between two sentences, is of great\nsignificance for downstream problems with sentence-pair input. Despite the\neffectiveness of NSP, we suggest that NSP still lacks the essential signal to\ndistinguish between entailment and shallow correlation. To remedy this, we\npropose to augment the NSP task to a 3-class categorization task, which\nincludes a category for previous sentence prediction (PSP). The involvement of\nPSP encourages the model to focus on the informative semantics to determine the\nsentence order, thereby improves the ability of semantic understanding. This\nsimple modification yields remarkable improvement against vanilla BERT. To\nfurther incorporate the document-level information, the scope of NSP and PSP is\nexpanded into a broader range, i.e., NSP and PSP also include close but\nnonsuccessive sentences, the noise of which is mitigated by the label-smoothing\ntechnique. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method consistently improves the\nperformance on the NLI and MRC benchmarks, including the challenging HANS\ndataset \\cite{hans}, suggesting that the document-level task is still promising\nfor the pre-training.",

          "description": "In this paper, we present SANTA, a scalable framework to automatically\nnormalize E-commerce attribute values (e.g. \"Win 10 Pro\") to a fixed set of\npre-defined canonical values (e.g. \"Windows 10\"). Earlier works on attribute\nnormalization focused on fuzzy string matching (also referred as syntactic\nmatching in this paper). In this work, we first perform an extensive study of\nnine syntactic matching algorithms and establish that 'cosine' similarity leads\nto best results, showing 2.7% improvement over commonly used Jaccard index.\nNext, we argue that string similarity alone is not sufficient for attribute\nnormalization as many surface forms require going beyond syntactic matching\n(e.g. \"720p\" and \"HD\" are synonyms). While semantic techniques like\nunsupervised embeddings (e.g. word2vec/fastText) have shown good results in\nword similarity tasks, we observed that they perform poorly to distinguish\nbetween close canonical forms, as these close forms often occur in similar\ncontexts. We propose to learn token embeddings using a twin network with\ntriplet loss. We propose an embedding learning task leveraging raw attribute\nvalues and product titles to learn these embeddings in a self-supervised\nfashion. We show that providing supervision using our proposed task improves\nover both syntactic and unsupervised embeddings based techniques for attribute\nnormalization. Experiments on a real-world attribute normalization dataset of\n50 attributes show that the embeddings trained using our proposed approach\nobtain 2.3% improvement over best string matching and 19.3% improvement over\nbest unsupervised embeddings.",

          "description": "Pre-trained language models induce dense entity representations that offer\nstrong performance on entity-centric NLP tasks, but such representations are\nnot immediately interpretable. This can be a barrier to model uptake in\nimportant domains such as biomedicine. There has been recent work on general\ninterpretable representation learning (Onoe and Durrett, 2020), but these\ndomain-agnostic representations do not readily transfer to the important domain\nof biomedicine. In this paper, we create a new entity type system and training\nset from a large corpus of biomedical texts by mapping entities to concepts in\na medical ontology, and from these to Wikipedia pages whose categories are our\ntypes. From this mapping we derive Biomedical Interpretable Entity\nRepresentations(BIERs), in which dimensions correspond to fine-grained entity\ntypes, and values are predicted probabilities that a given entity is of the\ncorresponding type. We propose a novel method that exploits BIER's final sparse\nand intermediate dense representations to facilitate model and entity type\ndebugging. We show that BIERs achieve strong performance in biomedical tasks\nincluding named entity disambiguation and entity label classification, and we\nprovide error analysis to highlight the utility of their interpretability,\nparticularly in low-supervision settings. Finally, we provide our induced 68K\nbiomedical type system, the corresponding 37 million triples of derived data\nused to train BIER models and our best performing model.",

          "description": "Natural language inference (NLI) is formulated as a unified framework for\nsolving various NLP problems such as relation extraction, question answering,\nsummarization, etc. It has been studied intensively in the past few years\nthanks to the availability of large-scale labeled datasets. However, most\nexisting studies focus on merely sentence-level inference, which limits the\nscope of NLI's application in downstream NLP problems. This work presents\nDocNLI -- a newly-constructed large-scale dataset for document-level NLI.\nDocNLI is transformed from a broad range of NLP problems and covers multiple\ngenres of text. The premises always stay in the document granularity, whereas\nthe hypotheses vary in length from single sentences to passages with hundreds\nof words. Additionally, DocNLI has pretty limited artifacts which unfortunately\nwidely exist in some popular sentence-level NLI datasets. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that, even without fine-tuning, a model pretrained on DocNLI shows\npromising performance on popular sentence-level benchmarks, and generalizes\nwell to out-of-domain NLP tasks that rely on inference at document granularity.\nTask-specific fine-tuning can bring further improvements.

Unfortunately, the\nlearning of DS-NER is severely dictionary-biased, which suffers from spurious\ncorrelations and therefore undermines the effectiveness and the robustness of\nthe learned models. In this paper, we fundamentally explain the dictionary bias\nvia a Structural Causal Model (SCM), categorize the bias into intra-dictionary\nand inter-dictionary biases, and identify their causes. Based on the SCM, we\nlearn de-biased DS-NER via causal interventions. For intra-dictionary bias, we\nconduct backdoor adjustment to remove the spurious correlations introduced by\nthe dictionary confounder. For inter-dictionary bias, we propose a causal\ninvariance regularizer which will make DS-NER models more robust to the\nperturbation of dictionaries.

          "description": "There is a recent trend in machine learning to increase model quality by\ngrowing models to sizes previously thought to be unreasonable. Recent work has\nshown that autoregressive generative models with cross-entropy objective\nfunctions exhibit smooth power-law relationships, or scaling laws, that predict\nmodel quality from model size, training set size, and the available compute\nbudget. These scaling laws allow one to choose nearly optimal hyper-parameters\ngiven constraints on available training data, model parameter count, or\ntraining computation budget. In this paper, we demonstrate that acoustic models\ntrained with an auto-predictive coding loss behave as if they are subject to\nsimilar scaling laws. We extend previous work to jointly predict loss due to\nmodel size, to training set size, and to the inherent \"irreducible loss\" of the\ntask. We find that the scaling laws accurately match model performance over two\norders of magnitude in both model size and training set size, and make\npredictions about the limits of model performance.",

An audio-to-intent (A2I) model\nencodes the intent of the utterance in the form of embeddings or posteriors,\nand these are used as auxiliary inputs for RNN-T training and inference.\nExperimenting with a 50k-hour far-field English speech corpus, this study shows\nthat when running the system in non-streaming mode, where intent representation\nis extracted from the entire utterance and then used to bias streaming RNN-T\nsearch from the start, it provides a 5.56% relative word error rate reduction\n(WERR).

          "description": "Scalability for handling unknown slot values is a important problem in\ndialogue state tracking (DST). As far as we know, previous scalable DST\napproaches generally rely on either the candidate generation from slot tagging\noutput or the span extraction in dialogue context. However, the candidate\ngeneration based DST often suffers from error propagation due to its pipelined\ntwo-stage process; meanwhile span extraction based DST has the risk of\ngenerating invalid spans in the lack of semantic constraints between start and\nend position pointers. To tackle the above drawbacks, in this paper, we propose\na novel scalable dialogue state tracking method based on slot tagging\nnavigation, which implements an end-to-end single-step pointer to locate and\nextract slot value quickly and accurately by the joint learning of slot tagging\nand slot value position prediction in the dialogue context, especially for\nunknown slot values. Extensive experiments over several benchmark datasets show\nthat the proposed model performs better than state-of-the-art baselines\ngreatly.",

          "description": "Predicting chemical properties from the structure of a molecule is of great\nimportance in many applications including drug discovery and material design.\nMachine learning based molecular property prediction holds the promise of\nenabling accurate predictions at much less complexity, when compared to, for\nexample Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Features extracted from\nmolecular graphs, using graph neural nets in a supervised manner, have emerged\nas strong baselines for such tasks. However, the vast chemical space together\nwith the limited availability of labels makes supervised learning challenging,\ncalling for learning a general-purpose molecular representation. Recently,\npre-trained transformer-based language models (PTLMs) on large unlabeled corpus\nhave produced state-of-the-art results in many downstream natural language\nprocessing tasks. Inspired by this development, here we present molecular\nembeddings obtained by training an efficient transformer encoder model,\nreferred to as MoLFormer. This model was employed with a linear attention\nmechanism and highly paralleized training on 1D SMILES sequences of 1.1 billion\nunlabeled molecules from the PubChem and ZINC datasets. Experiments show that\nthe learned molecular representation performs competitively, when compared to\nexisting graph-based and fingerprint-based supervised learning baselines, on\nthe challenging tasks of predicting properties of QM8 and QM9 molecules.\nFurther task-specific fine-tuning of the MoLFormerr representation improves\nperformance on several of those property prediction benchmarks. These results\nprovide encouraging evidence that large-scale molecular language models can\ncapture sufficient structural information to be able to accurately predict\nquantum chemical properties and beyond.",

This\napproach alleviates the evaluation problem one normally has when converting\ntypical speech to pathological speech, as in our approach, the voice conversion\n(VC) model does not need to be optimised for speech degradation but only for\nthe speaker change. This change in the optimisation ensures that any\ndegradation found in naturalness is due to the conversion process and not due\nto the model exaggerating characteristics of a speech pathology. To show a\nproof of concept of this method, we convert dysarthric speech using the\nUASpeech database and an autoencoder-based VC technique. Subjective evaluation\nresults show reasonable naturalness for high intelligibility dysarthric\nspeakers, though lower intelligibility seems to introduce a marginal\ndegradation in naturalness scores for mid and low intelligibility speakers\ncompared to ground truth. Conversion of speaker characteristics for low and\nhigh intelligibility speakers is successful, but not for mid. Whether the\ndifferences in the results for the different intelligibility levels is due to\nthe intelligibility levels or due to the speakers needs to be further\ninvestigated.",

In this paper, we propose\na novel model, QuatDE, with a dynamic mapping strategy to explicitly capture\nthe variety of relational patterns and separate different semantic information\nof the entity, using transition vectors to adjust the point position of the\nentity embedding vectors in the quaternion space via Hamilton product,\nenhancing the feature interaction capability between elements of the triplet.\nExperiment results show QuatDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on three\nwell-established knowledge graph completion benchmarks. In particular, the MR\nevaluation has relatively increased by 26% on WN18 and 15% on WN18RR, which\nproves the generalization of QuatDE.",

In contrast, there is comparatively little\nwork in the area of speaking, particularly with respect to fully automated\napproaches to assessing L2 spontaneous speech. While the importance of a\nwell-performing ASR system is widely recognized, little research has been\nconducted to investigate the impact of its performance on subsequent automatic\ntext analysis. In this paper, we focus on this issue and examine the impact of\nusing a state-of-the-art ASR system for subsequent automatic analysis of\nlinguistic complexity in spontaneously produced L2 speech. A set of 30 selected\nmeasures were considered, falling into four categories: syntactic, lexical,\nn-gram frequency, and information-theoretic measures. The agreement between the\nscores for these measures obtained on the basis of ASR-generated vs. manual\ntranscriptions was determined through correlation analysis.

          "description": "Pre-trained language models have been successful on text classification\ntasks, but are prone to learning spurious correlations from biased datasets,\nand are thus vulnerable when making inferences in a new domain. Prior works\nreveal such spurious patterns via post-hoc explanation algorithms which compute\nthe importance of input features. Further, the model is regularized to align\nthe importance scores with human knowledge, so that the unintended model\nbehaviors are eliminated. However, such a regularization technique lacks\nflexibility and coverage, since only importance scores towards a pre-defined\nlist of features are adjusted, while more complex human knowledge such as\nfeature interaction and pattern generalization can hardly be incorporated. In\nthis work, we propose to refine a learned language model for a target domain by\ncollecting human-provided compositional explanations regarding observed biases.\nBy parsing these explanations into executable logic rules, the human-specified\nrefinement advice from a small set of explanations can be generalized to more\ntraining examples. We additionally introduce a regularization term allowing\nadjustments for both importance and interaction of features to better rectify\nmodel behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on\ntwo text classification tasks by showing improved performance in target domain\nas well as improved model fairness after refinement.",

          "description": "Variational autoencoders have been widely applied for natural language\ngeneration, however, there are two long-standing problems: information\nunder-representation and posterior collapse. The former arises from the fact\nthat only the last hidden state from the encoder is transformed to the latent\nspace, which is insufficient to summarize data. The latter comes as a result of\nthe imbalanced scale between the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence in\nthe objective function. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose the\ndiscrete variational attention model with categorical distribution over the\nattention mechanism owing to the discrete nature in languages. Our approach is\ncombined with an auto-regressive prior to capture the sequential dependency\nfrom observations, which can enhance the latent space for language generation.\nMoreover, thanks to the property of discreteness, the training of our proposed\napproach does not suffer from posterior collapse. Furthermore, we carefully\nanalyze the superiority of discrete latent space over the continuous space with\nthe common Gaussian distribution.

          "description": "Annotation projection is an important area in NLP that can greatly contribute\nto creating language resources for low-resource languages. Word alignment plays\na key role in this setting. However, most of the existing word alignment\nmethods are designed for a high resource setting in machine translation where\nmillions of parallel sentences are available. This amount reduces to a few\nthousands of sentences when dealing with low-resource languages failing the\nexisting established IBM models. In this paper, we propose subword\nsampling-based alignment of text units. This method's hypothesis is that the\naggregation of different granularities of text for certain language pairs can\nhelp word-level alignment. For certain languages for which gold-standard\nalignments exist, we propose an iterative Bayesian optimization framework to\noptimize selecting possible subwords from the space of possible subword\nrepresentations of the source and target sentences. We show that the subword\nsampling method consistently outperforms word-level alignment on six language\npairs: English-German, English-French, English-Romanian, English-Persian,\nEnglish-Hindi, and English-Inuktitut. In addition, we show that the\nhyperparameters learned for certain language pairs can be applied to other\nlanguages at no supervision and consistently improve the alignment results. We\nobserve that using $5K$ parallel sentences together with our proposed subword\nsampling approach, we obtain similar F1 scores to the use of $100K$'s of\nparallel sentences in existing word-level fast-align/eflomal alignment methods.",

          "description": "Humans are able to perceive, understand and reason about physical events.\nDeveloping models with similar physical understanding capabilities is a\nlong-standing goal of artificial intelligence. As a step towards this goal, in\nthis work, we introduce CRAFT, a new visual question answering dataset that\nrequires causal reasoning about physical forces and object interactions. It\ncontains 58K video and question pairs that are generated from 10K videos from\n20 different virtual environments, containing various objects in motion that\ninteract with each other and the scene. Two question categories from CRAFT\ninclude previously studied descriptive and counterfactual questions. Besides,\ninspired by the theories of force dynamics in cognitive linguistics, we\nintroduce new question categories that involve understanding the interactions\nof objects through the notions of cause, enable, and prevent. Our results\ndemonstrate that even though these tasks seem to be simple and intuitive for\nhumans, the evaluated baseline models, including existing state-of-the-art\nmethods, do not yet deal with the challenges posed in our benchmark dataset.",

The Italian National Institute of\nStatistics (Istat) is currently carrying out several Big Data pilot studies.\nOne of these studies, the ICT Big Data pilot, aims at exploiting massive\namounts of textual data automatically scraped from the websites of Italian\nenterprises in order to predict a set of target variables (e.g. e-commerce)\nthat are routinely observed by the traditional ICT Survey. In this paper, we\nshow that Deep Learning techniques can successfully address this problem.\nEssentially, we tackle a text classification task: an algorithm must learn to\ninfer whether an Italian enterprise performs e-commerce from the textual\ncontent of its website. To reach this goal, we developed a sophisticated\nprocessing pipeline and evaluated its performance through extensive\nexperiments. Our pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks and relies on Word\nEmbeddings to encode raw texts into grayscale images (i.e. normalized numeric\nmatrices). Web-scraped texts are huge and have very low signal to noise ratio:\nto overcome these issues, we adopted a framework known as False Positive\nReduction, which has seldom (if ever) been applied before to text\nclassification tasks.

Most existing approaches employ deep learning\nmodels and have achieved remarkable performance, given the relatively small\ndatasets available.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach of\nCompositional Counterfactual Contrastive Learning ($C^3$) to develop\ncontrastive training between factual and counterfactual samples in\nvideo-grounded dialogues. Specifically, we design factual/counterfactual\nsampling based on the temporal steps in videos and tokens in dialogues and\npropose contrastive loss functions that exploit object-level or action-level\nvariance. Different from prior approaches, we focus on contrastive hidden state\nrepresentations among compositional output tokens to optimize the\nrepresentation space in a generation setting.

          "description": "Recently developed large pre-trained language models, e.g., BERT, have\nachieved remarkable performance in many downstream natural language processing\napplications. These pre-trained language models often contain hundreds of\nmillions of parameters and suffer from high computation and latency in\nreal-world applications. It is desirable to reduce the computation overhead of\nthe models for fast training and inference while keeping the model performance\nin downstream applications. Several lines of work utilize knowledge\ndistillation to compress the teacher model to a smaller student model. However,\nthey usually discard the teacher's knowledge when in inference. Differently, in\nthis paper, we propose RefBERT to leverage the knowledge learned from the\nteacher, i.e., facilitating the pre-computed BERT representation on the\nreference sample and compressing BERT into a smaller student model. To\nguarantee our proposal, we provide theoretical justification on the loss\nfunction and the usage of reference samples. Significantly, the theoretical\nresult shows that including the pre-computed teacher's representations on the\nreference samples indeed increases the mutual information in learning the\nstudent model. Finally, we conduct the empirical evaluation and show that our\nRefBERT can beat the vanilla TinyBERT over 8.1\\% and achieves more than 94\\% of\nthe performance of $\\BERTBASE$ on the GLUE benchmark. Meanwhile, RefBERT is\n7.4x smaller and 9.5x faster on inference than BERT$_{\\rm BASE}$.",

In this work we present our approach to developing an E2E model for\ngeneralized SLU in commercial voice assistants (VAs). We propose a fully\ndifferentiable, transformer-based, hierarchical system that can be pretrained\nat both the ASR and NLU levels. This is then fine-tuned on both transcription\nand semantic classification losses to handle a diverse set of intent and\nargument combinations. This leads to an SLU system that achieves significant\nimprovements over baselines on a complex internal generalized VA dataset with a\n43% improvement in accuracy, while still meeting the 99% accuracy benchmark on\nthe popular Fluent Speech Commands dataset.

          "description": "Weak supervision has shown promising results in many natural language\nprocessing tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Existing work mainly\nfocuses on learning deep NER models only with weak supervision, i.e., without\nany human annotation, and shows that by merely using weakly labeled data, one\ncan achieve good performance, though still underperforms fully supervised NER\nwith manually/strongly labeled data. In this paper, we consider a more\npractical scenario, where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data\nand a large amount of weakly labeled data. Unfortunately, we observe that\nweakly labeled data does not necessarily improve, or even deteriorate the model\nperformance (due to the extensive noise in the weak labels) when we train deep\nNER models over a simple or weighted combination of the strongly labeled and\nweakly labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-stage\ncomputational framework -- NEEDLE with three essential ingredients: (1) weak\nlabel completion, (2) noise-aware loss function, and (3) final fine-tuning over\nthe strongly labeled data. Through experiments on E-commerce query NER and\nBiomedical NER, we demonstrate that NEEDLE can effectively suppress the noise\nof the weak labels and outperforms existing methods. In particular, we achieve\nnew SOTA F1-scores on 3 Biomedical NER datasets: BC5CDR-chem 93.74,\nBC5CDR-disease 90.69, NCBI-disease 92.28.",

While\nthere is an extended literature studying how machines can learn grounded\nlanguage, the topic of how to learn spatio-temporal linguistic concepts is\nstill largely uncharted. To make progress in this direction, we here introduce\na novel spatio-temporal language grounding task where the goal is to learn the\nmeaning of spatio-temporal descriptions of behavioral traces of an embodied\nagent. This is achieved by training a truth function that predicts if a\ndescription matches a given history of observations. The descriptions involve\ntime-extended predicates in past and present tense as well as spatio-temporal\nreferences to objects in the scene. To study the role of architectural biases\nin this task, we train several models including multimodal Transformer\narchitectures; the latter implement different attention computations between\nwords and objects across space and time. We test models on two classes of\ngeneralization: 1) generalization to randomly held-out sentences; 2)\ngeneralization to grammar primitives. We observe that maintaining object\nidentity in the attention computation of our Transformers is instrumental to\nachieving good performance on generalization overall, and that summarizing\nobject traces in a single token has little influence on performance. We then\ndiscuss how this opens new perspectives for language-guided autonomous embodied\nagents.

We specifically consider whether incorporating attention into a\nconvolutional model is beneficial for localisation. Although absolute\nlocalisation performance with visually supervised models is still modest\n(compared to using unordered bag-of-word text labels for supervision), we show\nthat attention provides a large gain in performance over previous visually\ngrounded models.

As a case study, we improve expressive speech vocoding with\na revamped Parallel Wavenet (PW). Specifically, we propose to extend the affine\ntransformation of PW to the more expressive invertible non-affine function. The\ngreater expressiveness of the improved PW leads to better-perceived signal\nquality and naturalness in the waveform reconstruction and text-to-speech (TTS)\ntasks. We evaluate the model across different speaking styles on a\nmulti-speaker, multi-lingual dataset. In the waveform reconstruction task, the\nproposed model closes the naturalness and signal quality gap from the original\nPW to recordings by $10\\%$, and from other state-of-the-art neural vocoding\nsystems by more than $60\\%$. We also demonstrate improvements in objective\nmetrics on the evaluation test set with L2 Spectral Distance and Cross-Entropy\nreduced by $3\\%$ and $6\\unicode{x2030}$ comparing to the affine PW.\nFurthermore, we extend the probability density distillation procedure proposed\nby the original PW paper, so that it works with any non-affine invertible and\ndifferentiable function.",

We first jointly train an RE model with a simple and\nmemory-efficient evidence extraction model. Then, we construct pseudo documents\nbased on the extracted evidence sentences and run the RE model again. Finally,\nwe fuse the extraction results of the first two stages using a blending layer\nand make a final prediction. Extensive experiments show that our proposed\nframework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocRED dataset,\noutperforming the second-best method by 0.76/0.82 Ign F1/F1. In particular, our\nmethod significantly improves the performance on inter-sentence relations by\n1.23 Inter F1.",

          "description": "Out-of-scope intent detection is of practical importance in task-oriented\ndialogue systems. Since the distribution of outlier utterances is arbitrary and\nunknown in the training stage, existing methods commonly rely on strong\nassumptions on data distribution such as mixture of Gaussians to make\ninference, resulting in either complex multi-step training procedures or\nhand-crafted rules such as confidence threshold selection for outlier\ndetection. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to train an\nout-of-scope intent classifier in a fully end-to-end manner by simulating the\ntest scenario in training, which requires no assumption on data distribution\nand no additional post-processing or threshold setting. Specifically, we\nconstruct a set of pseudo outliers in the training stage, by generating\nsynthetic outliers using inliner features via self-supervision and sampling\nout-of-scope sentences from easily available open-domain datasets. The pseudo\noutliers are used to train a discriminative classifier that can be directly\napplied to and generalize well on the test task. We evaluate our method\nextensively on four benchmark dialogue datasets and observe significant\nimprovements over state-of-the-art approaches.

In this paper, we\nask: does the distance in the acoustic embedding space correlate with\nphonological dissimilarity? To answer this question, we empirically investigate\nthe performance of supervised approaches for AWEs with different neural\narchitectures and learning objectives. We train AWE models in controlled\nsettings for two languages (German and Czech) and evaluate the embeddings on\ntwo tasks: word discrimination and phonological similarity. Our experiments\nshow that (1) the distance in the embedding space in the best cases only\nmoderately correlates with phonological distance, and (2) improving the\nperformance on the word discrimination task does not necessarily yield models\nthat better reflect word phonological similarity. Our findings highlight the\nnecessity to rethink the current intrinsic evaluations for AWEs.",

          "description": "The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary\nwidely used in biomedical knowledge systems, particularly for semantic indexing\nof scientific literature. As the MeSH hierarchy evolves through annual version\nupdates, some new descriptors are introduced that were not previously\navailable. This paper explores the conceptual provenance of these new\ndescriptors. In particular, we investigate whether such new descriptors have\nbeen previously covered by older descriptors and what is their current relation\nto them. To this end, we propose a framework to categorize new descriptors\nbased on their current relation to older descriptors. Based on the proposed\nclassification scheme, we quantify, analyse and present the different types of\nnew descriptors introduced in MeSH during the last fifteen years. The results\nshow that only about 25% of new MeSH descriptors correspond to new emerging\nconcepts, whereas the rest were previously covered by one or more existing\ndescriptors, either implicitly or explicitly. Most of them were covered by a\nsingle existing descriptor and they usually end up as descendants of it in the\ncurrent hierarchy, gradually leading towards a more fine-grained MeSH\nvocabulary. These insights about the dynamics of the thesaurus are useful for\nthe retrospective study of scientific articles annotated with MeSH, but could\nalso be used to inform the policy of updating the thesaurus in the future.",

First, we show most Turing Award laureates have\nlong-term and high-quality educational backgrounds, and more than 61% of them\nhave a degree in mathematics, which indicates that mathematics has played a\nsignificant role in the development of computer science. Secondly, the data\nshows that not all scholars have high productivity and high h-index; that is,\nthe number of publications and h-index is not the leading indicator for\nevaluating the Turing Award. Third, the average age of awardees has increased\nfrom 40 to around 70 in recent years. This may be because new breakthroughs\ntake longer, and some new technologies need time to prove their influence.\nBesides, we have also found that in the past ten years, international\ncollaboration has experienced explosive growth, showing a new paradigm in the\nform of collaboration. It is also worth noting that in recent years, the\nemergence of female winners has also been eye-catching.

We, therefore, carry out a\nsystematic evaluation of transferability of BERT-based neural ranking models\nacross five English datasets. Previous studies focused primarily on zero-shot\nand few-shot transfer from a large dataset to a dataset with a small number of\nqueries. In contrast, each of our collections has a substantial number of\nqueries, which enables a full-shot evaluation mode and improves reliability of\nour results. Furthermore, since source datasets licences often prohibit\ncommercial use, we compare transfer learning to training on pseudo-labels\ngenerated by a BM25 scorer. We find that training on pseudo-labels -- possibly\nwith subsequent fine-tuning using a modest number of annotated queries -- can\nproduce a competitive or better model compared to transfer learning. Yet, it is\nnecessary to improve the stability and/or effectiveness of the few-shot\ntraining, which, sometimes, can degrade performance of a pretrained model.",

          "description": "Place Recognition is a crucial capability for mobile robot localization and\nnavigation. Image-based or Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a challenging\nproblem as scene appearance and camera viewpoint can change significantly when\nplaces are revisited. Recent VPR methods based on ``sequential\nrepresentations'' have shown promising results as compared to traditional\nsequence score aggregation or single image based techniques. In parallel to\nthese endeavors, 3D point clouds based place recognition is also being explored\nfollowing the advances in deep learning based point cloud processing. However,\na key question remains: is an explicit 3D structure based place representation\nalways superior to an implicit ``spatial'' representation based on sequence of\nRGB images which can inherently learn scene structure. In this extended\nabstract, we attempt to compare these two types of methods by considering a\nsimilar ``metric span'' to represent places. We compare a 3D point cloud based\nmethod (PointNetVLAD) with image sequence based methods (SeqNet and others) and\nshowcase that image sequence based techniques approach, and can even surpass,\nthe performance achieved by point cloud based methods for a given metric span.\nThese performance variations can be attributed to differences in data richness\nof input sensors as well as data accumulation strategies for a mobile robot.\nWhile a perfect apple-to-apple comparison may not be feasible for these two\ndifferent modalities, the presented comparison takes a step in the direction of\nanswering deeper questions regarding spatial representations, relevant to\nseveral applications like Autonomous Driving and Augmented/Virtual Reality.\nSource code available publicly https://github.com/oravus/seqNet.",

          "description": "Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a deep learning pipeline\nto detect signals on dietary supplement-related adverse events (DS AEs) from\nTwitter. Material and Methods: We obtained 247,807 tweets ranging from 2012 to\n2018 that mentioned both DS and AE. We annotated biomedical entities and\nrelations on 2,000 randomly selected tweets. For the concept extraction task,\nwe compared the performance of traditional word embeddings with SVM, CRF and\nLSTM-CRF classifiers to BERT models. For the relation extraction task, we\ncompared GloVe vectors with CNN classifiers to BERT models. We chose the best\nperforming models in each task to assemble an end-to-end deep learning pipeline\nto detect DS AE signals and compared the results to the known DS AEs from a DS\nknowledge base (i.e., iDISK). Results: In both tasks, the BERT-based models\noutperformed traditional word embeddings. The best performing concept\nextraction model is the BioBERT model that can identify supplement, symptom,\nand body organ entities with F1-scores of 0.8646, 0.8497, and 0.7104,\nrespectively. The best performing relation extraction model is the BERT model\nthat can identify purpose and AE relations with F1-scores of 0.8335 and 0.7538,\nrespectively. The end-to-end pipeline was able to extract DS indication and DS\nAEs with an F1-score of 0.7459 and 0,7414, respectively. Comparing to the\niDISK, we could find both known and novel DS-AEs.

          "description": "Topic modeling is an unsupervised method for revealing the hidden semantic\nstructure of a corpus. It has been increasingly widely adopted as a tool in the\nsocial sciences, including political science, digital humanities and\nsociological research in general. One desirable property of topic models is to\nallow users to find topics describing a specific aspect of the corpus. A\npossible solution is to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into topic\nmodeling, but this requires a specification from domain experts. We propose a\nnovel query-driven topic model that allows users to specify a simple query in\nwords or phrases and return query-related topics, thus avoiding tedious work\nfrom domain experts. Our proposed approach is particularly attractive when the\nuser-specified query has a low occurrence in a text corpus, making it difficult\nfor traditional topic models built on word cooccurrence patterns to identify\nrelevant topics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmodel in comparison with both classical topic models and neural topic models.",

The Edge Intelligence (EI) has led to the emergence of edge devices in\nvarious application domains. The EI can provide efficient services to\ndelay-sensitive applications, where the edge devices are deployed as edge nodes\nto host the majority of execution, which can effectively manage services and\nimprove service discovery efficiency. The multilevel index model is a\nwell-known model used for indexing service, such a model is being introduced\nand optimized in the edge environments to efficiently services discovery whilst\nmanaging large volumes of data. However, effectively updating the multilevel\nindex model by adding new services timely and precisely in the dynamic Edge\nComputing environments is still a challenge. Addressing this issue, this paper\nproposes a designated key selection method to improve the efficiency of adding\nservices in the multilevel index models. Our experimental results show that in\nthe partial index and the full index of multilevel index model, our method\nreduces the service addition time by around 84% and 76%, respectively when\ncompared with the original key selection method and by around 78% and 66%,\nrespectively when compared with the random selection method.

A key challenge of this\nsustainability is the intelligent management of the generated data, as well as\nthe knowledge extracted from it, in order to utilize this knowledge for\nimproving future procedures. This challenge is a result of the tailored\ndocumentation methods and domain-specific requirements, which include the need\nfor quick visibility of the documented knowledge. In this paper, we utilize the\nexpert knowledge documented in chip-design failure reports in supporting user\naccess to information that is relevant to a current chip design. Unstructured,\nfree, textual data in previous failure documentations provides a valuable\nsource of lessons-learned, which expert design-engineers have experienced,\nsolved and documented. To achieve a sustainable utilization of knowledge within\nthe company, not only the inherent knowledge has to be mined from unstructured\ntextual data, but also the relations between the lessons-learned, uncovering\npotentially unknown links. In this research, a knowledge graph is constructed,\nin order to represent and use the interconnections between reported design\nfailures. A search engine is developed and applied onto the graph to answer\nqueries. In contrast to mere keyword-based searching, the searchability of the\nknowledge graph offers enhanced search results beyond direct matches and acts\nas a mean for generating explainable results and result recommendations.\nResults are provided to the design engineer through an interactive search\ninterface, in which, the feedback from the user is used to further optimize\nrelations for future iterations of the knowledge graph.",

In this paper,\nwe propose a unified weakly-supervised learning framework called TCPN (Tag,\nCopy or Predict Network), which introduces 1) an efficient encoder to\nsimultaneously model the semantic and layout information in 2D OCR results; 2)\na weakly-supervised training strategy that utilizes only key information\nsequences as supervision; and 3) a flexible and switchable decoder which\ncontains two inference modes: one (Copy or Predict Mode) is to output key\ninformation sequences of different categories by copying a token from the input\nor predicting one in each time step, and the other (Tag Mode) is to directly\ntag the input sequence in a single forward pass. Our method shows new\nstate-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks, which fully proves\nits effectiveness.",

          "description": "Income verification is the problem of validating a person's stated income\ngiven basic identity information such as name, location, job title and\nemployer. It is widely used in the context of mortgage lending, rental\napplications and other financial risk models. However, the current processes\nsurrounding verification involve significant human effort and document\ngathering which can be both time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we\npropose a novel model for verifying an individual's income given very limited\nidentity information typically available in loan applications. Our model is a\ncombination of a deep neural network and hand-engineered features. The hand\nengineered features are based upon matching the input information against\nincome records extracted automatically from various publicly available online\nsources (e.g. payscale.com, H-1B filings, government employee salaries). We\nconduct experiments on two data sets, one simulated from H-1B records and the\nother from a real-world data set of peer-to-peer (P2P) loan applications\nobtained from one of the world's largest P2P lending platform. Our results show\na significant reduction in error of 3-6% relative to several strong baselines.\nWe also perform ablation studies to demonstrate that a combined model is indeed\nnecessary to achieve state-of-the-art performance on this task.",

          "description": "Assessing an AI agent that can converse in human language and understand\nvisual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor\ncorrect syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,\nwhere an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)\nmetric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a\nsingle human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:\nthe ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence\n(e.g., `yeah' and `yes'). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative\ngain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct\nanswers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually\napplicable uncertain answers such as `I don't know. Crafting a model that\nexcels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should\nanswer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To\naddress this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that\ncan merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep\nmost MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG\nstate-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%).

          "description": "Representation learning on user-item graph for recommendation has evolved\nfrom using single ID or interaction history to exploiting higher-order\nneighbors. This leads to the success of graph convolution networks (GCNs) for\nrecommendation such as PinSage and LightGCN. Despite effectiveness, we argue\nthat they suffer from two limitations: (1) high-degree nodes exert larger\nimpact on the representation learning, deteriorating the recommendations of\nlow-degree (long-tail) items; and (2) representations are vulnerable to noisy\ninteractions, as the neighborhood aggregation scheme further enlarges the\nimpact of observed edges.\n\nIn this work, we explore self-supervised learning on user-item graph, so as\nto improve the accuracy and robustness of GCNs for recommendation. The idea is\nto supplement the classical supervised task of recommendation with an auxiliary\nself-supervised task, which reinforces node representation learning via\nself-discrimination. Specifically, we generate multiple views of a node,\nmaximizing the agreement between different views of the same node compared to\nthat of other nodes. We devise three operators to generate the views -- node\ndropout, edge dropout, and random walk -- that change the graph structure in\ndifferent manners. We term this new learning paradigm as\n\\textit{Self-supervised Graph Learning} (SGL), implementing it on the\nstate-of-the-art model LightGCN. Through theoretical analyses, we find that SGL\nhas the ability of automatically mining hard negatives. Empirical studies on\nthree benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SGL, which improves\nthe recommendation accuracy, especially on long-tail items, and the robustness\nagainst interaction noises.

Recently, pre-training\nmethods tailored for information retrieval (IR) have also been explored, and\nthe latest success is the PROP method which has reached new SOTA on a variety\nof ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks. The basic idea of PROP is to construct the\n\\textit{representative words prediction} (ROP) task for pre-training inspired\nby the query likelihood model. Despite its exciting performance, the\neffectiveness of PROP might be bounded by the classical unigram language model\nadopted in the ROP task construction process. To tackle this problem, we\npropose a bootstrapped pre-training method (namely B-PROP) based on BERT for\nad-hoc retrieval. The key idea is to use the powerful contextual language model\nBERT to replace the classical unigram language model for the ROP task\nconstruction, and re-train BERT itself towards the tailored objective for IR.\nSpecifically, we introduce a novel contrastive method, inspired by the\ndivergence-from-randomness idea, to leverage BERT's self-attention mechanism to\nsample representative words from the document. By further fine-tuning on\ndownstream ad-hoc retrieval tasks, our method achieves significant improvements\nover baselines without pre-training or with other pre-training methods, and\nfurther pushes forward the SOTA on a variety of ad-hoc retrieval tasks.",

          "description": "Building a benchmark dataset for hate speech detection presents several\nchallenges. Firstly, because hate speech is relatively rare -- e.g., less than\n3\\% of Twitter posts are hateful \\citep{founta2018large} -- random sampling of\ntweets to annotate is inefficient in capturing hate speech. A common practice\nis to only annotate tweets containing known ``hate words'', but this risks\nyielding a biased benchmark that only partially captures the real-world\nphenomenon of interest. A second challenge is that definitions of hate speech\ntend to be highly variable and subjective. Annotators having diverse prior\nnotions of hate speech may not only disagree with one another but also struggle\nto conform to specified labeling guidelines. Our key insight is that the rarity\nand subjectivity of hate speech are akin to that of relevance in information\nretrieval (IR). This connection suggests that well-established methodologies\nfor creating IR test collections might also be usefully applied to create\nbetter benchmark datasets for hate speech detection. Firstly, to intelligently\nand efficiently select which tweets to annotate, we apply established IR\ntechniques of {\\em pooling} and {\\em active learning}. Secondly, to improve\nboth consistency and value of annotations, we apply {\\em task decomposition}\n\\cite{Zhang-sigir14} and {\\em annotator rationale} \\cite{mcdonnell16-hcomp}\ntechniques. Using the above techniques, we create and share a new benchmark\ndataset\\footnote{We will release the dataset upon publication.} for hate speech\ndetection with broader coverage than prior datasets. We also show a dramatic\ndrop in accuracy of existing detection models when tested on these broader\nforms of hate. Collected annotator rationales not only provide documented\nsupport for labeling decisions but also create exciting future work\nopportunities for dual-supervision and/or explanation generation in modeling.",

          "description": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online\nadvertising and recommender systems. In practice, the training of CTR models\ndepends on click data which is intrinsically biased towards higher positions\nsince higher position has higher CTR by nature. Existing methods such as actual\nposition training with fixed position inference and inverse propensity weighted\ntraining with no position inference alleviate the bias problem to some extend.\nHowever, the different treatment of position information between training and\ninference will inevitably lead to inconsistency and sub-optimal online\nperformance. Meanwhile, the basic assumption of these methods, i.e., the click\nprobability is the product of examination probability and relevance\nprobability, is oversimplified and insufficient to model the rich interaction\nbetween position and other information. In this paper, we propose a Deep\nPosition-wise Interaction Network (DPIN) to efficiently combine all candidate\nitems and positions for estimating CTR at each position, achieving consistency\nbetween offline and online as well as modeling the deep non-linear interaction\namong position, user, context and item under the limit of serving performance.\nFollowing our new treatment to the position bias in CTR prediction, we propose\na new evaluation metrics named PAUC (position-wise AUC) that is suitable for\nmeasuring the ranking quality at a given position. Through extensive\nexperiments on a real world dataset, we show empirically that our method is\nboth effective and efficient in solving position bias problem. We have also\ndeployed our method in production and observed statistically significant\nimprovement over a highly optimized baseline in a rigorous A/B test.",

For example,\nthe recent Reddit uprising inspired by r/wallstreetbets which had remarkable\neconomic impact was started with a series of posts on the thread. The\nprediction of posts that may have a notable impact will allow for the\npreparation of possible following trends. This study aims to develop a machine\nlearning model capable of accurately predicting the popularity of a Reddit\npost. Specifically, the model is predicting the number of upvotes a post will\nreceive based on its textual content. I experimented with three different\nmodels: a baseline linear regression model, a random forest regression model,\nand a neural network. I collected Reddit post data from an online data set and\nanalyzed the model's performance when trained on a single subreddit and a\ncollection of subreddits. The results showed that the neural network model\nperformed the best when the loss of the models were compared. With the use of a\nmachine learning model to predict social trends through the reaction users have\nto post, a better picture of the near future can be envisioned.",

For better recommendations, it is\nvital to capture user preferences as well as their dynamics. Besides, user\npreferences evolve over time dynamically and each preference has its own\nevolving track. However, most previous works neglect the evolving trend of\npreferences and can be easily disturbed by the effect of preference drifting.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Preference Evolution Networks for\nsession-based Recommendation (PEN4Rec) to model preference evolving process by\na two-stage retrieval from historical contexts. Specifically, the first-stage\nprocess integrates relevant behaviors according to recent items. Then, the\nsecond-stage process models the preference evolving trajectory over time\ndynamically and infer rich preferences.

          "description": "Deep learning-based sequential recommender systems have recently attracted\nincreasing attention from both academia and industry. Most of industrial\nEmbedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) system for recommendation share the similar\nideas with sequential recommenders.

However, most existing\nsequential recommendation models take as input clicked or purchased behavior\nsequences from user-item interactions.

An efficient triplet metric learning algorithm is\nproposed to appropriately learn the representation of unclicked items.

Retrieving the most relevant products from a large-scale corpus\nwhile preserving personalized user characteristics remains an open question.\nRecent approaches in this domain have mainly focused on embedding-based\nretrieval (EBR) systems. However, after a long period of practice on Taobao, we\nfind that the performance of the EBR system is dramatically degraded due to\nits: (1) low relevance with a given query and (2) discrepancy between the\ntraining and inference phases. Therefore, we propose a novel and practical\nembedding-based product retrieval model, named Multi-Grained Deep Semantic\nProduct Retrieval (MGDSPR).

Two efficient methods are further proposed to improve\nretrieval relevance, including smoothing noisy training data and generating\nrelevance-improving hard negative samples without requiring extra knowledge and\ntraining procedures. We evaluate MGDSPR on Taobao Product Search with\nsignificant metrics gains observed in offline experiments and online A/B tests.\nMGDSPR has been successfully deployed to the existing multi-channel retrieval\nsystem in Taobao Search.

          "description": "Recently, linear regression models, such as EASE and SLIM, have shown to\noften produce rather competitive results against more sophisticated deep\nlearning models. On the other side, the (weighted) matrix factorization\napproaches have been popular choices for recommendation in the past and widely\nadopted in the industry. In this work, we aim to theoretically understand the\nrelationship between these two approaches, which are the cornerstones of\nmodel-based recommendations. Through the derivation and analysis of the\nclosed-form solutions for two basic regression and matrix factorization\napproaches, we found these two approaches are indeed inherently related but\nalso diverge in how they \"scale-down\" the singular values of the original\nuser-item interaction matrix. This analysis also helps resolve the questions\nrelated to the regularization parameter range and model complexities. We\nfurther introduce a new learning algorithm in searching (hyper)parameters for\nthe closed-form solution and utilize it to discover the nearby models of the\nexisting solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the basic models\nand their closed-form solutions are indeed quite competitive against the\nstate-of-the-art models, thus, confirming the validity of studying the basic\nmodels. The effectiveness of exploring the nearby models are also\nexperimentally validated.",

Next, we introduce the public datasets and evaluation\nmetrics used for personalized news recommendation. We then discuss the key\npoints on improving the responsibility of personalized news recommender\nsystems. Finally, we raise several research directions that are worth\ninvestigating in future. This paper can provide up-to-date and comprehensive\nviews to help readers understand the personalized news recommendation field.

First, we devise a unified tree-based structure, called a\nbi-dimensional coordinate tree, to describe both the spatial and hierarchical\ninformation of generally structured tables. Upon this, we propose tree-based\nattention and position embedding to better capture the spatial and hierarchical\ninformation. Moreover, we devise three progressive pre-training objectives to\nenable representations at the token, cell, and table levels. We pre-train TUTA\non a wide range of unlabeled web and spreadsheet tables and fine-tune it on two\ncritical tasks in the field of table structure understanding: cell type\nclassification and table type classification.

          "description": "Recommender Systems (RS) have employed knowledge distillation which is a\nmodel compression technique training a compact student model with the knowledge\ntransferred from a pre-trained large teacher model. Recent work has shown that\ntransferring knowledge from the teacher's intermediate layer significantly\nimproves the recommendation quality of the student. However, they transfer the\nknowledge of individual representation point-wise and thus have a limitation in\nthat primary information of RS lies in the relations in the representation\nspace. This paper proposes a new topology distillation approach that guides the\nstudent by transferring the topological structure built upon the relations in\nthe teacher space. We first observe that simply making the student learn the\nwhole topological structure is not always effective and even degrades the\nstudent's performance. We demonstrate that because the capacity of the student\nis highly limited compared to that of the teacher, learning the whole\ntopological structure is daunting for the student. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel method named Hierarchical Topology Distillation (HTD) which\ndistills the topology hierarchically to cope with the large capacity gap. Our\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors. We also provide\nin-depth analyses to ascertain the benefit of distilling the topology for RS.",

          "description": "With the emerging needs of creating fairness-aware solutions for search and\nrecommendation systems, a daunting challenge exists of evaluating such\nsolutions. While many of the traditional information retrieval (IR) metrics can\ncapture the relevance, diversity and novelty for the utility with respect to\nusers, they are not suitable for inferring whether the presented results are\nfair from the perspective of responsible information exposure. On the other\nhand, various fairness metrics have been proposed but they do not account for\nthe user utility or do not measure it adequately. To address this problem, we\npropose a new metric called Fairness-Aware IR (FAIR). By unifying standard IR\nmetrics and fairness measures into an integrated metric, this metric offers a\nnew perspective for evaluating fairness-aware ranking results. Based on this\nmetric, we developed an effective ranking algorithm that jointly optimized user\nutility and fairness. The experimental results showed that our FAIR metric\ncould highlight results with good user utility and fair information exposure.\nWe showed how FAIR related to existing metrics and demonstrated the\neffectiveness of our FAIR-based algorithm. We believe our work opens up a new\ndirection of pursuing a computationally feasible metric for evaluating and\nimplementing the fairness-aware IR systems.",

Pipelines are\nconceptually simple, but errors propagate from one component to the next,\nwithout later components being able to revise earlier decisions. We present an\narchitecture for joint document and snippet ranking, the two middle stages,\nwhich leverages the intuition that relevant documents have good snippets and\ngood snippets come from relevant documents. The architecture is general and can\nbe used with any neural text relevance ranker. We experiment with two main\ninstantiations of the architecture, based on POSIT-DRMM (PDRMM) and a\nBERT-based ranker. Experiments on biomedical data from BIOASQ show that our\njoint models vastly outperform the pipelines in snippet retrieval, the main\ngoal for QA, with fewer trainable parameters, also remaining competitive in\ndocument retrieval. Furthermore, our joint PDRMM-based model is competitive\nwith BERT-based models, despite using orders of magnitude fewer parameters.\nThese claims are also supported by human evaluation on two test batches of\nBIOASQ. To test our key findings on another dataset, we modified the Natural\nQuestions dataset so that it can also be used for document and snippet\nretrieval.

Our method incorporates a coarse-to-fine approach\ninto the proposal based object detection framework and integrates prototype\nbased classifiers into both the proposal generation and classification stages.\nTo improve proposal generation for few-shot novel classes, we propose to learn\na lightweight matching network to measure the similarity between each spatial\nposition in the query image feature map and spatially-pooled class features,\ninstead of the traditional object/nonobject classifier, thus generating\ncategory-specific proposals and improving proposal recall for novel classes. To\naddress the spatial misalignment between generated proposals and few-shot class\nexamples, we propose a novel attentive feature alignment method, thus improving\nthe performance of few-shot object detection. Meanwhile we jointly learn a\nFaster R-CNN detection head for base classes. Extensive experiments conducted\non multiple FSOD benchmarks show our proposed approach achieves state of the\nart results under (incremental) few-shot learning settings.",

          "description": "Thanks to the improvements experienced in technology in the last few years,\nmost especially in virtual reality systems, the number and potential of\nnetworked virtual environments or NVEs and their users are increasing. NVEs aim\nto give distributed users a feeling of immersion in a virtual world and the\npossibility of interacting with other users or with virtual objects inside it,\nlike when they interact in the real world. Being able to provide that feeling\nand natural interactions when the users are geographically separated is one of\nthe goals of these systems. Nevertheless, this goal is especially sensitive to\ndifferent issues, such as different connections with heterogeneous throughput\nor different network latencies, which can lead to consistency and\nsynchronization problems and, thus, to a worsening of the users' quality of\nexperience or QoE. With the purpose of solving these issues, researchers have\nproposed and evaluated numerous technical solutions, in fields like network\narchitectures, data distribution and filtering, resource balancing, computing\nmodels, predictive modeling and synchronization in NVEs. This paper gathers and\nclassifies them, summarizing their advantages and disadvantages, using a new\nway of classification. With the current increase of the number of NVEs and the\nmultiple solutions proposed so far, this work aims to become a useful tool and\na starting point not only for future researchers in this field but also for\nthose who are new in NVEs development, in which guaranteeing a good users' QoE\nis essential.",

          "description": "Human personality traits are the key drivers behind our decision-making,\ninfluencing our life path on a daily basis. Inference of personality traits,\nsuch as Myers-Briggs Personality Type, as well as an understanding of\ndependencies between personality traits and users' behavior on various social\nmedia platforms is of crucial importance to modern research and industry\napplications. The emergence of diverse and cross-purpose social media avenues\nmakes it possible to perform user personality profiling automatically and\nefficiently based on data represented across multiple data modalities. However,\nthe research efforts on personality profiling from multi-source multi-modal\nsocial media data are relatively sparse, and the level of impact of different\nsocial network data on machine learning performance has yet to be\ncomprehensively evaluated. Furthermore, there is not such dataset in the\nresearch community to benchmark. This study is one of the first attempts\ntowards bridging such an important research gap. Specifically, in this work, we\ninfer the Myers-Briggs Personality Type indicators, by applying a novel\nmulti-view fusion framework, called \"PERS\" and comparing the performance\nresults not just across data modalities but also with respect to different\nsocial network data sources. Our experimental results demonstrate the PERS's\nability to learn from multi-view data for personality profiling by efficiently\nleveraging on the significantly different data arriving from diverse social\nmultimedia sources. We have also found that the selection of a machine learning\napproach is of crucial importance when choosing social network data sources and\nthat people tend to reveal multiple facets of their personality in different\nsocial media avenues. Our released social multimedia dataset facilitates future\nresearch on this direction.",

In this paper,\nwe propose a unified weakly-supervised learning framework called TCPN (Tag,\nCopy or Predict Network), which introduces 1) an efficient encoder to\nsimultaneously model the semantic and layout information in 2D OCR results; 2)\na weakly-supervised training strategy that utilizes only key information\nsequences as supervision; and 3) a flexible and switchable decoder which\ncontains two inference modes: one (Copy or Predict Mode) is to output key\ninformation sequences of different categories by copying a token from the input\nor predicting one in each time step, and the other (Tag Mode) is to directly\ntag the input sequence in a single forward pass.

Most deep steganalysis classifiers\nusually extract noise residuals using high-pass filters as preprocessing steps\nand feed them to their deep model for classification. It is observed that\nrecent steganographic embedding does not always restrict their embedding in the\nhigh-frequency zone; instead, they distribute it as per embedding policy.\nTherefore, besides noise residual, learning the embedding zone is another\nchallenging task. In this work, unlike the conventional approaches, the\nproposed model first extracts the noise residual using learned denoising\nkernels to boost the signal-to-noise ratio. After preprocessing, the sparse\nnoise residuals are fed to a novel Multi-Contextual Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (M-CNET) that uses heterogeneous context size to learn the sparse and\nlow-amplitude representation of noise residuals. The model performance is\nfurther improved by incorporating the Self-Attention module to focus on the\nareas prone to steganalytic embedding. A set of comprehensive experiments is\nperformed to show the proposed scheme's efficacy over the prior arts.

          "description": "In many contexts, creating mappings for gestural interactions can form part\nof an artistic process. Creators seeking a mapping that is expressive, novel,\nand affords them a sense of authorship may not know how to program it up in a\nsignal processing patch. Tools like Wekinator and MIMIC allow creators to use\nsupervised machine learning to learn mappings from example input/output\npairings. However, a creator may know a good mapping when they encounter it yet\nstart with little sense of what the inputs or outputs should be. We call this\nan open-ended mapping process. Addressing this need, we introduce the latent\nmapping, which leverages the latent space of an unsupervised machine learning\nalgorithm such as a Variational Autoencoder trained on a corpus of unlabelled\ngestural data from the creator. We illustrate it with Sonified Body, a system\nmapping full-body movement to sound which we explore in a residency with three\ndancers.",

          "description": "The versatility of recent machine learning approaches makes them ideal for\nimprovement of next generation video compression solutions. Unfortunately,\nthese approaches typically bring significant increases in computational\ncomplexity and are difficult to interpret into explainable models, affecting\ntheir potential for implementation within practical video coding applications.\nThis paper introduces a novel explainable neural network-based inter-prediction\nscheme, to improve the interpolation of reference samples needed for fractional\nprecision motion compensation. The approach requires a single neural network to\nbe trained from which a full quarter-pixel interpolation filter set is derived,\nas the network is easily interpretable due to its linear structure. A novel\ntraining framework enables each network branch to resemble a specific\nfractional shift. This practical solution makes it very efficient to use\nalongside conventional video coding schemes. When implemented in the context of\nthe state-of-the-art Versatile Video Coding (VVC) test model, 0.77%, 1.27% and\n2.25% BD-rate savings can be achieved on average for lower resolution sequences\nunder the random access, low-delay B and low-delay P configurations,\nrespectively, while the complexity of the learned interpolation schemes is\nsignificantly reduced compared to the interpolation with full CNNs.",

          "description": "Textures contain a wealth of image information and are widely used in various\nfields such as computer graphics and computer vision. With the development of\nmachine learning, the texture synthesis and generation have been greatly\nimproved. As a very common element in everyday life, wallpapers contain a\nwealth of texture information, making it difficult to annotate with a simple\nsingle label. Moreover, wallpaper designers spend significant time to create\ndifferent styles of wallpaper. For this purpose, this paper proposes to\ndescribe wallpaper texture images by using multi-label semantics. Based on\nthese labels and generative adversarial networks, we present a framework for\nperception driven wallpaper texture generation and style transfer. In this\nframework, a perceptual model is trained to recognize whether the wallpapers\nproduced by the generator network are sufficiently realistic and have the\nattribute designated by given perceptual description; these multi-label\nsemantic attributes are treated as condition variables to generate wallpaper\nimages. The generated wallpaper images can be converted to those with\nwell-known artist styles using CycleGAN. Finally, using the aesthetic\nevaluation method, the generated wallpaper images are quantitatively measured.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate\nwallpaper textures conforming to human aesthetics and have artistic\ncharacteristics.",

          "description": "Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (ZS-SBIR) is a novel cross-modal\nretrieval task, where abstract sketches are used as queries to retrieve natural\nimages under zero-shot scenario. Most existing methods regard ZS-SBIR as a\ntraditional classification problem and employ a cross-entropy or triplet-based\nloss to achieve retrieval, which neglect the problems of the domain gap between\nsketches and natural images and the large intra-class diversity in sketches.\nToward this end, we propose a novel Domain-Smoothing Network (DSN) for ZS-SBIR.\nSpecifically, a cross-modal contrastive method is proposed to learn generalized\nrepresentations to smooth the domain gap by mining relations with additional\naugmented samples. Furthermore, a category-specific memory bank with sketch\nfeatures is explored to reduce intra-class diversity in the sketch domain.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approach notably outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods in both Sketchy and TU-Berlin datasets.

Typically data augmentation\nsimulates realistic variations in data in order to increase the apparent\ndiversity of the training-set. However, for opcode-based malware analysis,\nwhere deep learning methods are already achieving state of the art performance,\nit is not immediately clear how to apply data augmentation. In this paper we\nstudy different methods of data augmentation starting with basic methods using\nfixed transformations and moving to methods that adapt to the data. We propose\na novel data augmentation method based on using an opcode embedding layer\nwithin the network and its corresponding opcode embedding matrix to perform\nadaptive data augmentation during training.

          "description": "Skeleton-based Human Activity Recognition has achieved great interest in\nrecent years as skeleton data has demonstrated being robust to illumination\nchanges, body scales, dynamic camera views, and complex background. In\nparticular, Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN) demonstrated\nto be effective in learning both spatial and temporal dependencies on\nnon-Euclidean data such as skeleton graphs. Nevertheless, an effective encoding\nof the latent information underlying the 3D skeleton is still an open problem,\nespecially when it comes to extracting effective information from joint motion\npatterns and their correlations. In this work, we propose a novel\nSpatial-Temporal Transformer network (ST-TR) which models dependencies between\njoints using the Transformer self-attention operator. In our ST-TR model, a\nSpatial Self-Attention module (SSA) is used to understand intra-frame\ninteractions between different body parts, and a Temporal Self-Attention module\n(TSA) to model inter-frame correlations. The two are combined in a two-stream\nnetwork, whose performance is evaluated on three large-scale datasets,\nNTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, and Kinetics Skeleton 400, consistently improving\nbackbone results. Compared with methods that use the same input data, the\nproposed ST-TR achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets when using\njoints' coordinates as input, and results on-par with state-of-the-art when\nadding bones information.",

          "description": "Benefited from considerable pixel-level annotations collected from a specific\nsituation (source), the trained semantic segmentation model performs quite\nwell, but fails in a new situation (target) due to the large domain shift. To\nmitigate the domain gap, previous cross-domain semantic segmentation methods\nalways assume the co-existence of source data and target data during\ndistribution alignment. However, the access to source data in the real scenario\nmay raise privacy concerns and violate intellectual property. To tackle this\nproblem, we focus on an interesting and challenging cross-domain semantic\nsegmentation task where only the trained source model is provided to the target\ndomain, and further propose a unified framework called Domain Adaptive Semantic\nSegmentation without Source data (DAS$^3$ for short). Specifically, DAS$^3$\nconsists of three schemes, i.e., feature alignment, self-training, and\ninformation propagation. First, we mainly develop a focal entropic loss on the\nnetwork outputs to implicitly align the target features with unseen source\nfeatures via the provided source model. Second, besides positive pseudo labels\nin vanilla self-training, we first introduce negative pseudo labels to the\nfield and develop a bi-directional self-training strategy to enhance the\nrepresentation learning in the target domain. Finally, the information\npropagation scheme further reduces the intra-domain discrepancy within the\ntarget domain via pseudo semi-supervised learning. Extensive results on\nsynthesis-to-real and cross-city driving datasets validate DAS$^3$ yields\nstate-of-the-art performance, even on par with methods that need access to\nsource data.",

          "description": "Recent advances in bioimaging have provided scientists a superior high\nspatial-temporal resolution to observe dynamics of living cells as 3D\nvolumetric videos. Unfortunately, the 3D biomedical video analysis is lagging,\nimpeded by resource insensitive human curation using off-the-shelf 3D analytic\ntools. Herein, biologists often need to discard a considerable amount of rich\n3D spatial information by compromising on 2D analysis via maximum intensity\nprojection. Recently, pixel embedding-based cell instance segmentation and\ntracking provided a neat and generalizable computing paradigm for understanding\ncellular dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatial-temporal\nvoxel-embedding (VoxelEmbed) based learning method to perform simultaneous cell\ninstance segmenting and tracking on 3D volumetric video sequences. Our\ncontribution is in four-fold: (1) The proposed voxel embedding generalizes the\npixel embedding with 3D context information; (2) Present a simple multi-stream\nlearning approach that allows effective spatial-temporal embedding; (3)\nAccomplished an end-to-end framework for one-stage 3D cell instance\nsegmentation and tracking without heavy parameter tuning; (4) The proposed 3D\nquantification is memory efficient via a single GPU with 12 GB memory. We\nevaluate our VoxelEmbed method on four 3D datasets (with different cell types)\nfrom the ISBI Cell Tracking Challenge. The proposed VoxelEmbed method achieved\nconsistent superior overall performance (OP) on two densely annotated datasets.\nThe performance is also competitive on two sparsely annotated cohorts with\n20.6% and 2% of data-set having segmentation annotations. The results\ndemonstrate that the VoxelEmbed method is a generalizable and memory-efficient\nsolution.",

          "description": "It is well known that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks, which are implemented by adding crafted perturbations onto\nbenign examples. Min-max robust optimization based adversarial training can\nprovide a notion of security against adversarial attacks. However, adversarial\nrobustness requires a significantly larger capacity of the network than that\nfor the natural training with only benign examples. This paper proposes a\nframework of concurrent adversarial training and weight pruning that enables\nmodel compression while still preserving the adversarial robustness and\nessentially tackles the dilemma of adversarial training. Furthermore, this work\nstudies two hypotheses about weight pruning in the conventional setting and\nfinds that weight pruning is essential for reducing the network model size in\nthe adversarial setting, training a small model from scratch even with\ninherited initialization from the large model cannot achieve both adversarial\nrobustness and high standard accuracy.

          "description": "In this paper, we aim to create generalizable and controllable neural signed\ndistance fields (SDFs) that represent clothed humans from monocular depth\nobservations. Recent advances in deep learning, especially neural implicit\nrepresentations, have enabled human shape reconstruction and controllable\navatar generation from different sensor inputs. However, to generate realistic\ncloth deformations from novel input poses, watertight meshes or dense full-body\nscans are usually needed as inputs. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of\neffectively modeling pose-dependent cloth deformations for diverse body shapes\nand cloth types, existing approaches resort to per-subject/cloth-type\noptimization from scratch, which is computationally expensive. In contrast, we\npropose an approach that can quickly generate realistic clothed human avatars,\nrepresented as controllable neural SDFs, given only monocular depth images. We\nachieve this by using meta-learning to learn an initialization of a\nhypernetwork that predicts the parameters of neural SDFs. The hypernetwork is\nconditioned on human poses and represents a clothed neural avatar that deforms\nnon-rigidly according to the input poses. Meanwhile, it is meta-learned to\neffectively incorporate priors of diverse body shapes and cloth types and thus\ncan be much faster to fine-tune, compared to models trained from scratch. We\nqualitatively and quantitatively show that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches that require complete meshes as inputs while our\napproach requires only depth frames as inputs and runs orders of magnitudes\nfaster. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our meta-learned hypernetwork is very\nrobust, being the first to generate avatars with realistic dynamic cloth\ndeformations given as few as 8 monocular depth frames.",

This led to the\ncreation of the theBEAST project, which aims to create an autonomous security\ndrone, with focus on those regulations and on safety. This technical paper\ndescribes the first steps of a module within this project, which revolves\naround detecting obstacles so they can be avoided in a fail-safe landing. A\ndeep learning powered object detection method is the subject of our research,\nand various experiments are held to maximize its performance, such as comparing\nvarious data augmentation techniques or YOLOv3 and YOLOv5.

          "description": "Contrastive self-supervised learning has largely narrowed the gap to\nsupervised pre-training on ImageNet. However, its success highly relies on the\nobject-centric priors of ImageNet, i.e., different augmented views of the same\nimage correspond to the same object. Such a heavily curated constraint becomes\nimmediately infeasible when pre-trained on more complex scene images with many\nobjects. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Object-level Representation\nLearning (ORL), a new self-supervised learning framework towards scene images.\nOur key insight is to leverage image-level self-supervised pre-training as the\nprior to discover object-level semantic correspondence, thus realizing\nobject-level representation learning from scene images. Extensive experiments\non COCO show that ORL significantly improves the performance of self-supervised\nlearning on scene images, even surpassing supervised ImageNet pre-training on\nseveral downstream tasks. Furthermore, ORL improves the downstream performance\nwhen more unlabeled scene images are available, demonstrating its great\npotential of harnessing unlabeled data in the wild. We hope our approach can\nmotivate future research on more general-purpose unsupervised representation\nlearning from scene data. Project page: https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/project/orl/.",

          "description": "As soon as abstract mathematical computations were adapted to computation on\ndigital computers, the problem of efficient representation, manipulation, and\ncommunication of the numerical values in those computations arose. Strongly\nrelated to the problem of numerical representation is the problem of\nquantization: in what manner should a set of continuous real-valued numbers be\ndistributed over a fixed discrete set of numbers to minimize the number of bits\nrequired and also to maximize the accuracy of the attendant computations? This\nperennial problem of quantization is particularly relevant whenever memory\nand/or computational resources are severely restricted, and it has come to the\nforefront in recent years due to the remarkable performance of Neural Network\nmodels in computer vision, natural language processing, and related areas.\nMoving from floating-point representations to low-precision fixed integer\nvalues represented in four bits or less holds the potential to reduce the\nmemory footprint and latency by a factor of 16x; and, in fact, reductions of 4x\nto 8x are often realized in practice in these applications. Thus, it is not\nsurprising that quantization has emerged recently as an important and very\nactive sub-area of research in the efficient implementation of computations\nassociated with Neural Networks. In this article, we survey approaches to the\nproblem of quantizing the numerical values in deep Neural Network computations,\ncovering the advantages/disadvantages of current methods. With this survey and\nits organization, we hope to have presented a useful snapshot of the current\nresearch in quantization for Neural Networks and to have given an intelligent\norganization to ease the evaluation of future research in this area.",

          "description": "Predefined evenly-distributed class centroids (PEDCC) can be widely used in\nmodels and algorithms of pattern classification, such as CNN classifiers,\nclassification autoencoders, clustering, and semi-supervised learning, etc. Its\nbasic idea is to predefine the class centers, which are evenly-distributed on\nthe unit hypersphere in feature space, to maximize the inter-class distance.\nThe previous method of generating PEDCC uses an iterative algorithm based on a\ncharge model, that is, the initial values of various centers (charge positions)\nare randomly set from the normal distribution, and the charge positions are\nupdated iteratively with the help of the repulsive force between charges of the\nsame polarity. The class centers generated by the algorithm will produce some\nerrors with the theoretically evenly-distributed points, and the generation\ntime will be longer. This paper takes advantage of regular polyhedron in\nhigh-dimensional space and the evenly distribution of points on the n\ndimensional hypersphere to generate PEDCC mathematically. Then, we discussed\nthe basic and extensive characteristics of the frames formed by PEDCC. Finally,\nexperiments show that new algorithm is not only faster than the iterative\nmethod, but also more accurate in position. The mathematical analysis and\nexperimental results of this paper can provide a theoretical tool for using\nPEDCC to solve the key problems in the field of pattern recognition, such as\ninterpretable supervised/unsupervised learning, incremental learning,\nuncertainty analysis and so on.",

          "description": "In class-incremental learning, an agent with limited resources needs to learn\na sequence of classification tasks, forming an ever growing classification\nproblem, with the constraint of not being able to access data from previous\ntasks. The main difference with task-incremental learning, where a task-ID is\navailable at inference time, is that the learner also needs to perform\ncross-task discrimination, i.e. distinguish between classes that have not been\nseen together. Approaches to tackle this problem are numerous and mostly make\nuse of an external memory (buffer) of non-negligible size. In this paper, we\nablate the learning of cross-task features and study its influence on the\nperformance of basic replay strategies used for class-IL. We also define a new\nforgetting measure for class-incremental learning, and see that forgetting is\nnot the principal cause of low performance. Our experimental results show that\nfuture algorithms for class-incremental learning should not only prevent\nforgetting, but also aim to improve the quality of the cross-task features.\nThis is especially important when the number of classes per task is small.",

          "description": "Tracking and reconstructing the 3D pose and geometry of two hands in\ninteraction is a challenging problem that has a high relevance for several\nhuman-computer interaction applications, including AR/VR, robotics, or sign\nlanguage recognition. Existing works are either limited to simpler tracking\nsettings (e.g., considering only a single hand or two spatially separated\nhands), or rely on less ubiquitous sensors, such as depth cameras. In contrast,\nin this work we present the first real-time method for motion capture of\nskeletal pose and 3D surface geometry of hands from a single RGB camera that\nexplicitly considers close interactions. In order to address the inherent depth\nambiguities in RGB data, we propose a novel multi-task CNN that regresses\nmultiple complementary pieces of information, including segmentation, dense\nmatchings to a 3D hand model, and 2D keypoint positions, together with newly\nproposed intra-hand relative depth and inter-hand distance maps. These\npredictions are subsequently used in a generative model fitting framework in\norder to estimate pose and shape parameters of a 3D hand model for both hands.\nWe experimentally verify the individual components of our RGB two-hand tracking\nand 3D reconstruction pipeline through an extensive ablation study. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that our approach offers previously unseen two-hand tracking\nperformance from RGB, and quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms existing\nRGB-based methods that were not explicitly designed for two-hand interactions.\nMoreover, our method even performs on-par with depth-based real-time methods.",

However, significant miss rates for polyps have been reported,\nparticularly when there are multiple small adenomas. This presents an\nopportunity to leverage computer-aided systems to support clinicians and reduce\nthe number of polyps missed.\n\nMethod: In this work we introduce the Focus U-Net, a novel dual\nattention-gated deep neural network, which combines efficient spatial and\nchannel-based attention into a single Focus Gate module to encourage selective\nlearning of polyp features. The Focus U-Net further incorporates short-range\nskip connections and deep supervision. Furthermore, we introduce the Hybrid\nFocal loss, a new compound loss function based on the Focal loss and Focal\nTversky loss, to handle class-imbalanced image segmentation. For our\nexperiments, we selected five public datasets containing images of polyps\nobtained during optical colonoscopy: CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ColonDB,\nETIS-Larib PolypDB and EndoScene test set. To evaluate model performance, we\nuse the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU)\nmetrics.\n\nResults: Our model achieves state-of-the-art results for both CVC-ClinicDB\nand Kvasir-SEG, with a mean DSC of 0.941 and 0.910, respectively.

          "description": "Self-supervised learning (especially contrastive learning) has attracted\ngreat interest due to its tremendous potentials in learning discriminative\nrepresentations in an unsupervised manner. Despite the acknowledged successes,\nexisting contrastive learning methods suffer from very low learning efficiency,\ne.g., taking about ten times more training epochs than supervised learning for\ncomparable recognition accuracy. In this paper, we discover two contradictory\nphenomena in contrastive learning that we call under-clustering and\nover-clustering problems, which are major obstacles to learning efficiency.\nUnder-clustering means that the model cannot efficiently learn to discover the\ndissimilarity between inter-class samples when the negative sample pairs for\ncontrastive learning are insufficient to differentiate all the actual object\ncategories. Over-clustering implies that the model cannot efficiently learn the\nfeature representation from excessive negative sample pairs, which enforces the\nmodel to over-cluster samples of the same actual categories into different\nclusters. To simultaneously overcome these two problems, we propose a novel\nself-supervised learning framework using a median triplet loss. Precisely, we\nemploy a triplet loss tending to maximize the relative distance between the\npositive pair and negative pairs to address the under-clustering problem; and\nwe construct the negative pair by selecting the negative sample of a median\nsimilarity score from all negative samples to avoid the over-clustering\nproblem, guaranteed by the Bernoulli Distribution model. We extensively\nevaluate our proposed framework in several large-scale benchmarks (e.g.,\nImageNet, SYSU-30k, and COCO). The results demonstrate the superior performance\n(e.g., the learning efficiency) of our model over the latest state-of-the-art\nmethods by a clear margin.

In this paper, we propose a novel diffeomorphic temporal\ntransformer network for both pairwise and joint time-series alignment. Our\nResNet-TW (Deep Residual Network for Time Warping) tackles the alignment\nproblem by compositing a flow of incremental diffeomorphic mappings. Governed\nby the flow equation, our Residual Network (ResNet) builds smooth, fluid and\nregular flows of velocity fields and consequently generates smooth and\ninvertible transformations (i.e. diffeomorphic warping functions). Inspired by\nthe elegant Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework,\nthe final transformation is built by the flow of time-dependent vector fields\nwhich are none other than the building blocks of our Residual Network. The\nlatter is naturally viewed as an Eulerian discretization schema of the flow\nequation (an ODE). Once trained, our ResNet-TW aligns unseen data by a single\ninexpensive forward pass. As we show in experiments on both univariate (84\ndatasets from UCR archive) and multivariate time-series (MSR Action-3D,\nFlorence-3D and MSR Daily Activity), ResNet-TW achieves competitive performance\nin joint alignment and classification.",

          "description": "Adversarial training is one of the most effective approaches to improve model\nrobustness against adversarial examples. However, previous works mainly focus\non the overall robustness of the model, and the in-depth analysis on the role\nof each class involved in adversarial training is still missing. In this paper,\nwe propose to analyze the class-wise robustness in adversarial training. First,\nwe provide a detailed diagnosis of adversarial training on six benchmark\ndatasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, STL-10 and ImageNet.\nSurprisingly, we find that there are remarkable robustness discrepancies among\nclasses, leading to unbalance/unfair class-wise robustness in the robust\nmodels. Furthermore, we keep investigating the relations between classes and\nfind that the unbalanced class-wise robustness is pretty consistent among\ndifferent attack and defense methods. Moreover, we observe that the stronger\nattack methods in adversarial learning achieve performance improvement mainly\nfrom a more successful attack on the vulnerable classes (i.e., classes with\nless robustness). Inspired by these interesting findings, we design a simple\nbut effective attack method based on the traditional PGD attack, named\nTemperature-PGD attack, which proposes to enlarge the robustness disparity\namong classes with a temperature factor on the confidence distribution of each\nimage. Experiments demonstrate our method can achieve a higher attack rate than\nthe PGD attack. Furthermore, from the defense perspective, we also make some\nmodifications in the training and inference phases to improve the robustness of\nthe most vulnerable class, so as to mitigate the large difference in class-wise\nrobustness. We believe our work can contribute to a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of adversarial training as well as rethinking the class-wise\nproperties in robust models.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks designed for vision tasks are often prone to failure\nwhen they encounter environmental conditions not covered by the training data.\nSingle-modal strategies are insufficient when the sensor fails to acquire\ninformation due to malfunction or its design limitations. Multi-sensor\nconfigurations are known to provide redundancy, increase reliability, and are\ncrucial in achieving robustness against asymmetric sensor failures. To address\nthe issue of changing lighting conditions and asymmetric sensor degradation in\nobject detection, we develop a multi-modal 2D object detector, and propose\ndeterministic and stochastic sensor-aware feature fusion strategies. The\nproposed fusion mechanisms are driven by the estimated sensor measurement\nreliability values/weights. Reliable object detection in harsh lighting\nconditions is essential for applications such as self-driving vehicles and\nhuman-robot interaction. We also propose a new \"r-blended\" hybrid depth\nmodality for RGB-D sensors.

The main challenge lies in finding the\ncross-view and temporal correspondences correctly even when several human pose\nestimations are noisy. Compare to previous solutions that construct 3D poses\nfrom multiple views, our approach takes advantage of temporal consistency to\nmatch the 2D poses estimated with previously constructed 3D skeletons in every\nview. Therefore cross-view and temporal associations are accomplished\nsimultaneously. Since the performance suffers from mistaken association and\nnoisy predictions, we design two strategies for aiming better correspondences\nand 3D reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a part-aware measurement for\n2D-3D association and a filter that can cope with 2D outliers during\nreconstruction. Our approach is efficient and effective comparing to\nstate-of-the-art methods; it achieves competitive results on two benchmarks:\n96.8% on Campus and 97.4% on Shelf.

          "description": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to\ntheir biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.\nAs these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is\nthus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods\ndirectly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,\nwhich ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the\nperformance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for\nshallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination\nin the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning\nalgorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly\noptimize network structure without retraining. Our key innovation is to\nredefine the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration\nof network structures by taking full advantage of the competition between\npruning and regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the\nproposed method achieves minimal loss of SNNs' performance on MNIST and\nCIFAR-10 dataset so far. Moreover, it reaches a $\\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under\nunprecedented 0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining\ncapability in SNNs.

          "description": "Recent researches show that deep learning model is susceptible to backdoor\nattacks. Many defenses against backdoor attacks have been proposed. However,\nexisting defense works require high computational overhead or backdoor attack\ninformation such as the trigger size, which is difficult to satisfy in\nrealistic scenarios. In this paper, a novel backdoor detection method based on\nadversarial examples is proposed. The proposed method leverages intentional\nadversarial perturbations to detect whether an image contains a trigger, which\ncan be applied in both the training stage and the inference stage (sanitize the\ntraining set in training stage and detect the backdoor instances in inference\nstage). Specifically, given an untrusted image, the adversarial perturbation is\nadded to the image intentionally. If the prediction of the model on the\nperturbed image is consistent with that on the unperturbed image, the input\nimage will be considered as a backdoor instance. Compared with most existing\ndefense works, the proposed adversarial perturbation based method requires low\ncomputational resources and maintains the visual quality of the images.\nExperimental results show that, the backdoor detection rate of the proposed\ndefense method is 99.63%, 99.76% and 99.91% on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and\nGTSRB datasets, respectively. Besides, the proposed method maintains the visual\nquality of the image as the l2 norm of the added perturbation are as low as\n2.8715, 3.0513 and 2.4362 on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets,\nrespectively. In addition, it is also demonstrated that the proposed method can\nachieve high defense performance against backdoor attacks under different\nattack settings (trigger transparency, trigger size and trigger pattern).\nCompared with the existing defense work (STRIP), the proposed method has better\ndetection performance on all the three datasets, and is more efficient than\nSTRIP.",

          "description": "Probabilistic Face Embeddings (PFE) can improve face recognition performance\nin unconstrained scenarios by integrating data uncertainty into the feature\nrepresentation. However, existing PFE methods tend to be over-confident in\nestimating uncertainty and is too slow to apply to large-scale face matching.\nThis paper proposes a regularized probabilistic face embedding method to\nimprove the robustness and speed of PFE. Specifically, the mutual likelihood\nscore (MLS) metric used in PFE is simplified to speedup the matching of face\nfeature pairs. Then, an output-constraint loss is proposed to penalize the\nvariance of the uncertainty output, which can regularize the output of the\nneural network. In addition, an identification preserving loss is proposed to\nimprove the discriminative of the MLS metric, and a multi-layer feature fusion\nmodule is proposed to improve the neural network's uncertainty estimation\nability. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method can achieve\ncomparable or better results in 9 benchmarks than the state-of-the-art methods,\nand can improve the performance of risk-controlled face recognition.

          "description": "We propose a method to detect and reconstruct multiple 3D objects from a\nsingle RGB image. The key idea is to optimize for detection, alignment and\nshape jointly over all objects in the RGB image, while focusing on realistic\nand physically plausible reconstructions. To this end, we propose a keypoint\ndetector that localizes objects as center points and directly predicts all\nobject properties, including 9-DoF bounding boxes and 3D shapes -- all in a\nsingle forward pass. The proposed method formulates 3D shape reconstruction as\na shape selection problem, i.e. it selects among exemplar shapes from a given\ndatabase. This makes it agnostic to shape representations, which enables a\nlightweight reconstruction of realistic and visually-pleasing shapes based on\nCAD-models, while the training objective is formulated around point clouds and\nvoxel representations. A collision-loss promotes non-intersecting objects,\nfurther increasing the reconstruction realism. Given the RGB image, the\npresented approach performs lightweight reconstruction in a single-stage, it is\nreal-time capable, fully differentiable and end-to-end trainable. Our\nexperiments compare multiple approaches for 9-DoF bounding box estimation,\nevaluate the novel shape-selection mechanism and compare to recent methods in\nterms of 3D bounding box estimation and 3D shape reconstruction quality.",

However, model uncertainty\n(i.e., model reliability/confidence on report generation) is still an\nunder-explored problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method to explicitly\nquantify both the visual uncertainty and the textual uncertainty for the task\nof radiology report generation. Such multi-modal uncertainties can sufficiently\ncapture the model confidence scores at both the report-level and the\nsentence-level, and thus they are further leveraged to weight the losses for\nachieving more comprehensive model optimization.

          "description": "This paper investigates how to realize better and more efficient embedding\nlearning to tackle the semi-supervised video object segmentation under\nchallenging multi-object scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods learn to\ndecode features with a single positive object and thus have to match and\nsegment each target separately under multi-object scenarios, consuming multiple\ntimes computing resources. To solve the problem, we propose an Associating\nObjects with Transformers (AOT) approach to match and decode multiple objects\nuniformly. In detail, AOT employs an identification mechanism to associate\nmultiple targets into the same high-dimensional embedding space. Thus, we can\nsimultaneously process the matching and segmentation decoding of multiple\nobjects as efficiently as processing a single object. For sufficiently modeling\nmulti-object association, a Long Short-Term Transformer is designed for\nconstructing hierarchical matching and propagation. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on both multi-object and single-object benchmarks to examine AOT\nvariant networks with different complexities. Particularly, our AOT-L\noutperforms all the state-of-the-art competitors on three popular benchmarks,\ni.e., YouTube-VOS (83.7% J&F), DAVIS 2017 (83.0%), and DAVIS 2016 (91.0%),\nwhile keeping more than 3X faster multi-object run-time.

          "description": "Few-shot learning methods offer pre-training techniques optimized for easier\nlater adaptation of the model to new classes (unseen during training) using one\nor a few examples. This adaptivity to unseen classes is especially important\nfor many practical applications where the pre-trained label space cannot remain\nfixed for effective use and the model needs to be \"specialized\" to support new\ncategories on the fly. One particularly interesting scenario, essentially\noverlooked by the few-shot literature, is Coarse-to-Fine Few-Shot (C2FS), where\nthe training classes (e.g. animals) are of much `coarser granularity' than the\ntarget (test) classes (e.g. breeds). A very practical example of C2FS is when\nthe target classes are sub-classes of the training classes. Intuitively, it is\nespecially challenging as (both regular and few-shot) supervised pre-training\ntends to learn to ignore intra-class variability which is essential for\nseparating sub-classes. In this paper, we introduce a novel 'Angular\nnormalization' module that allows to effectively combine supervised and\nself-supervised contrastive pre-training to approach the proposed C2FS task,\ndemonstrating significant gains in a broad study over multiple baselines and\ndatasets. We hope that this work will help to pave the way for future research\non this new, challenging, and very practical topic of C2FS classification.",

Existing dataset (e.g., KITTI, Waymo)\neither provides only a small amount of data or covers limited domains with full\nannotation, hindering the exploration of large-scale pre-trained models. Here,\nwe release a Large-Scale Object Detection benchmark for Autonomous driving,\nnamed as SODA10M, containing 10 million unlabeled images and 20K images labeled\nwith 6 representative object categories. To improve diversity, the images are\ncollected every ten seconds per frame within 32 different cities under\ndifferent weather conditions, periods and location scenes. We provide extensive\nexperiments and deep analyses of existing supervised state-of-the-art detection\nmodels, popular self-supervised and semi-supervised approaches, and some\ninsights about how to develop future models. The data and more up-to-date\ninformation have been released at https://soda-2d.github.io.",

We present a confidence-aware camouflaged\nobject detection framework using dynamic supervision to produce both accurate\ncamouflage map and meaningful \"confidence\" representing model awareness about\nthe current prediction. A camouflaged object detection network is designed to\nproduce our camouflage prediction. Then, we concatenate it with the input image\nand feed it to the confidence estimation network to produce an one channel\nconfidence map.We generate dynamic supervision for the confidence estimation\nnetwork, representing the agreement of camouflage prediction with the ground\ntruth camouflage map. With the produced confidence map, we introduce\nconfidence-aware learning with the confidence map as guidance to pay more\nattention to the hard/low-confidence pixels in the loss function. We claim\nthat, once trained, our confidence estimation network can evaluate pixel-wise\naccuracy of the prediction without relying on the ground truth camouflage map.\nExtensive results on four camouflaged object detection testing datasets\nillustrate the superior performance of the proposed model in explaining the\ncamouflage prediction.",

          "description": "Geometric Deep Learning has recently made striking progress with the advent\nof continuous Deep Implicit Fields. They allow for detailed modeling of\nwatertight surfaces of arbitrary topology while not relying on a 3D Euclidean\ngrid, resulting in a learnable parameterization that is unlimited in\nresolution. Unfortunately, these methods are often unsuitable for applications\nthat require an explicit mesh-based surface representation because converting\nan implicit field to such a representation relies on the Marching Cubes\nalgorithm, which cannot be differentiated with respect to the underlying\nimplicit field. In this work, we remove this limitation and introduce a\ndifferentiable way to produce explicit surface mesh representations from Deep\nImplicit Fields. Our key insight is that by reasoning on how implicit field\nperturbations impact local surface geometry, one can ultimately differentiate\nthe 3D location of surface samples with respect to the underlying deep implicit\nfield. We exploit this to define DeepMesh -- end-to-end differentiable mesh\nrepresentation that can vary its topology. We use two different applications to\nvalidate our theoretical insight: Single view 3D Reconstruction via\nDifferentiable Rendering and Physically-Driven Shape Optimization. In both\ncases our end-to-end differentiable parameterization gives us an edge over\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.",

          "description": "Analyzing the structure of proteins is a key part of understanding their\nfunctions and thus their role in biology at the molecular level. In addition,\ndesign new proteins in a methodical way is a major engineering challenge. In\nthis work, we introduce a joint geometric-neural networks approach for\ncomparing, deforming and generating 3D protein structures. Viewing protein\nstructures as 3D open curves, we adopt the Square Root Velocity Function (SRVF)\nrepresentation and leverage its suitable geometric properties along with Deep\nResidual Networks (ResNets) for a joint registration and comparison. Our\nResNets handle better large protein deformations while being more\ncomputationally efficient. On top of the mathematical framework, we further\ndesign a Geometric Variational Auto-Encoder (G-VAE), that once trained, maps\noriginal, previously unseen structures, into a low-dimensional (latent)\nhyper-sphere. Motivated by the spherical structure of the pre-shape space, we\nnaturally adopt the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution to model our hidden\nvariables. We test the effectiveness of our models by generating novel protein\nstructures and predicting completions of corrupted protein structures.\nExperimental results show that our method is able to generate plausible\nstructures, different from the structures in the training data.",

The focus of this work is on quantitative analysis of a consumer speech\nrecognition system on individuals who stutter and production-oriented\napproaches for improving performance for common voice assistant tasks (i.e.,\n\"what is the weather?\"). At baseline, this system introduces a significant\nnumber of insertion and substitution errors resulting in intended speech Word\nError Rates (isWER) that are 13.64\\% worse (absolute) for individuals with\nfluency disorders. We show that by simply tuning the decoding parameters in an\nexisting hybrid speech recognition system one can improve isWER by 24\\%\n(relative) for individuals with fluency disorders.

          "description": "Semi-supervised learning has been gaining attention as it allows for\nperforming image analysis tasks such as classification with limited labeled\ndata. Some popular algorithms using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for\nsemi-supervised classification share a single architecture for classification\nand discrimination. However, this may require a model to converge to a separate\ndata distribution for each task, which may reduce overall performance. While\nprogress in semi-supervised learning has been made, less addressed are\nsmall-scale, fully-supervised tasks where even unlabeled data is unavailable\nand unattainable. We therefore, propose a novel GAN model namely External\nClassifier GAN (EC-GAN), that utilizes GANs and semi-supervised algorithms to\nimprove classification in fully-supervised regimes. Our method leverages a GAN\nto generate artificial data used to supplement supervised classification. More\nspecifically, we attach an external classifier, hence the name EC-GAN, to the\nGAN's generator, as opposed to sharing an architecture with the discriminator.\nOur experiments demonstrate that EC-GAN's performance is comparable to the\nshared architecture method, far superior to the standard data augmentation and\nregularization-based approach, and effective on a small, realistic dataset.",

          "description": "Chinese character recognition has attracted much research interest due to its\nwide applications. Although it has been studied for many years, some issues in\nthis field have not been completely resolved yet, e.g. the zero-shot problem.\nPrevious character-based and radical-based methods have not fundamentally\naddressed the zero-shot problem since some characters or radicals in test sets\nmay not appear in training sets under a data-hungry condition. Inspired by the\nfact that humans can generalize to know how to write characters unseen before\nif they have learned stroke orders of some characters, we propose a\nstroke-based method by decomposing each character into a sequence of strokes,\nwhich are the most basic units of Chinese characters. However, we observe that\nthere is a one-to-many relationship between stroke sequences and Chinese\ncharacters. To tackle this challenge, we employ a matching-based strategy to\ntransform the predicted stroke sequence to a specific character. We evaluate\nthe proposed method on handwritten characters, printed artistic characters, and\nscene characters. The experimental results validate that the proposed method\noutperforms existing methods on both character zero-shot and radical zero-shot\ntasks. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily generalized to other\nlanguages whose characters can be decomposed into strokes.",

While the input image\ncan be of a smiling person or taken in extreme lighting conditions, our method\ncan reliably produce a high-quality textured model of a person's face in\nneutral expression and skin textures under diffuse lighting condition.\nCutting-edge 3D face reconstruction methods use non-linear morphable face\nmodels combined with GAN-based decoders to capture the likeness and details of\na person but fail to produce neutral head models with unshaded albedo textures\nwhich is critical for creating relightable and animation-friendly avatars for\nintegration in virtual environments. The key challenges for existing methods to\nwork is the lack of training and ground truth data containing normalized 3D\nfaces. We propose a two-stage approach to address this problem. First, we adopt\na highly robust normalized 3D face generator by embedding a non-linear\nmorphable face model into a StyleGAN2 network. This allows us to generate\ndetailed but normalized facial assets. This inference is then followed by a\nperceptual refinement step that uses the generated assets as regularization to\ncope with the limited available training samples of normalized faces. We\nfurther introduce a Normalized Face Dataset, which consists of a combination\nphotogrammetry scans, carefully selected photographs, and generated fake people\nwith neutral expressions in diffuse lighting conditions. While our prepared\ndataset contains two orders of magnitude less subjects than cutting edge\nGAN-based 3D facial reconstruction methods, we show that it is possible to\nproduce high-quality normalized face models for very challenging unconstrained\ninput images, and demonstrate superior performance to the current\nstate-of-the-art.",

Thus, the\nfollowing paper presents a brief review of visual-based methods for food\nrecognition, including their accuracy, performance, and the use of popular food\ndatabases to evaluate existing models. The work further aims to highlight\nfuture challenges in this area. New high-quality studies for developing\nstandard benchmarks and using continual learning methods for food recognition\nare recommended.",

          "description": "Light field technology has increasingly attracted the attention of the\nresearch community with its many possible applications. The lenslet array in\ncommercial plenoptic cameras helps capture both the spatial and angular\ninformation of light rays in a single exposure. While the resulting high\ndimensionality of light field data enables its superior capabilities, it also\nimpedes its extensive adoption. Hence, there is a compelling need for efficient\ncompression of light field images. Existing solutions are commonly composed of\nseveral separate modules, some of which may not have been designed for the\nspecific structure and quality of light field data. This increases the\ncomplexity of the codec and results in impractical decoding runtimes. We\npropose a new learning-based, disparity-aided model for compression of 4D light\nfield images capable of parallel decoding. The model is end-to-end trainable,\neliminating the need for hand-tuning separate modules and allowing joint\nlearning of rate and distortion. The disparity-aided approach ensures the\nstructural integrity of the reconstructed light fields. Comparisons with the\nstate of the art show encouraging performance in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM\nmetrics. Also, there is a notable gain in the encoding and decoding runtimes.\nSource code is available at https://moha23.github.io/LFDAAE.",

          "description": "Multi-label image classification (MLIC) is a fundamental and practical task,\nwhich aims to assign multiple possible labels to an image. In recent years,\nmany deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches have been\nproposed which model label correlations to discover semantics of labels and\nlearn semantic representations of images. This paper advances this research\ndirection by improving both the modeling of label correlations and the learning\nof semantic representations. On the one hand, besides the local semantics of\neach label, we propose to further explore global semantics shared by multiple\nlabels. On the other hand, existing approaches mainly learn the semantic\nrepresentations at the last convolutional layer of a CNN. But it has been noted\nthat the image representations of different layers of CNN capture different\nlevels or scales of features and have different discriminative abilities. We\nthus propose to learn semantic representations at multiple convolutional\nlayers. To this end, this paper designs a Multi-layered Semantic Representation\nNetwork (MSRN) which discovers both local and global semantics of labels\nthrough modeling label correlations and utilizes the label semantics to guide\nthe semantic representations learning at multiple layers through an attention\nmechanism.

          "description": "Most modern neural networks for classification fail to take into account the\nconcept of the unknown. Trained neural networks are usually tested in an\nunrealistic scenario with only examples from a closed set of known classes. In\nan attempt to develop a more realistic model, the concept of working in an open\nset environment has been introduced. This in turn leads to the concept of\nincremental learning where a model with its own architecture and initial\ntrained set of data can identify unknown classes during the testing phase and\nautonomously update itself if evidence of a new class is detected. Some\nproblems that arise in incremental learning are inefficient use of resources to\nretrain the classifier repeatedly and the decrease of classification accuracy\nas multiple classes are added over time. This process of instantiating new\nclasses is repeated as many times as necessary, accruing errors. To address\nthese problems, this paper proposes the Classification Confidence Threshold\napproach to prime neural networks for incremental learning to keep accuracies\nhigh by limiting forgetting. A lean method is also used to reduce resources\nused in the retraining of the neural network. The proposed method is based on\nthe idea that a network is able to incrementally learn a new class even when\nexposed to a limited number samples associated with the new class. This method\ncan be applied to most existing neural networks with minimal changes to network\narchitecture.",

          "description": "Kernel segmentation aims at partitioning a data sequence into several\nnon-overlapping segments that may have nonlinear and complex structures. In\ngeneral, it is formulated as a discrete optimization problem with combinatorial\nconstraints. A popular algorithm for optimally solving this problem is dynamic\nprogramming (DP), which has quadratic computation and memory requirements.\nGiven that sequences in practice are too long, this algorithm is not a\npractical approach. Although many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to\napproximate the optimal segmentation, they have no guarantee on the quality of\ntheir solutions. In this paper, we take a differentiable approach to alleviate\nthe aforementioned issues. First, we introduce a novel sigmoid-based\nregularization to smoothly approximate the combinatorial constraints. Combining\nit with objective of the balanced kernel clustering, we formulate a\ndifferentiable model termed Kernel clustering with sigmoid-based regularization\n(KCSR), where the gradient-based algorithm can be exploited to obtain the\noptimal segmentation. Second, we develop a stochastic variant of the proposed\nmodel. By using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which has much lower\ntime and space complexities, for optimization, the second model can perform\nsegmentation on overlong data sequences. Finally, for simultaneously segmenting\nmultiple data sequences, we slightly modify the sigmoid-based regularization to\nfurther introduce an extended variant of the proposed model. Through extensive\nexperiments on various types of data sequences performances of our models are\nevaluated and compared with those of the existing methods. The experimental\nresults validate advantages of the proposed models. Our Matlab source code is\navailable on github.",

However, more recent works found that the performance of the\nsearched architecture barely increases with the optimization proceeding in\nDARTS. In addition, several concurrent works show that the NAS could find more\ncompetitive architectures without labels.

However, state-of-the-art techniques to detect the location of slum\nareas employ high-resolution satellite imagery, which is costly to obtain and\nprocess. As a result, researchers have started to look at utilising free and\nopen-access medium resolution satellite imagery. Yet, there is no clear\nconsensus on which data preparation and machine learning approaches are the\nmost appropriate to use with such imagery data. In this paper, we evaluate two\ntechniques (multi-spectral data and grey-level co-occurrence matrix feature\nextraction) on an open-access dataset consisting of labelled Sentinel-2 images\nwith a spatial resolution of 10 meters. Both techniques were paired with a\ncanonical correlation forests classifier. The results show that the grey-level\nco-occurrence matrix performed better than multi-spectral data for all four\ncities. It had an average accuracy for the slum class of 97% and a mean\nintersection over union of 94%, while multi-spectral data had 75% and 64% for\nthe respective metrics.

          "description": "Top-down attention allows neural networks, both artificial and biological, to\nfocus on the information most relevant for a given task. This is known to\nenhance performance in visual perception. But it remains unclear how attention\nbrings about its perceptual boost, especially when it comes to naturalistic\nsettings like recognising an object in an everyday scene. What aspects of a\nvisual task does attention help to deal with? We aim to answer this with a\ncomputational experiment based on a general framework called task-oriented\nablation design. First we define a broad range of visual tasks and identify six\nfactors that underlie task variability. Then on each task we compare the\nperformance of two neural networks, one with top-down attention and one\nwithout. These comparisons reveal the task-dependence of attention's perceptual\nboost, giving a clearer idea of the role attention plays. Whereas many existing\ncognitive accounts link attention to stimulus-level variables, such as visual\nclutter and object scale, we find greater explanatory power in system-level\nvariables that capture the interaction between the model, the distribution of\ntraining data and the task format. This finding suggests a shift in how\nattention is studied could be fruitful. We make publicly available our code and\nresults, along with statistics relevant to ImageNet-based experiments beyond\nthis one. Our contribution serves to support the development of more human-like\nvision models and the design of more informative machine-learning experiments.",

Recent VPR methods based on ``sequential\nrepresentations'' have shown promising results as compared to traditional\nsequence score aggregation or single image based techniques. In parallel to\nthese endeavors, 3D point clouds based place recognition is also being explored\nfollowing the advances in deep learning based point cloud processing. However,\na key question remains: is an explicit 3D structure based place representation\nalways superior to an implicit ``spatial'' representation based on sequence of\nRGB images which can inherently learn scene structure. In this extended\nabstract, we attempt to compare these two types of methods by considering a\nsimilar ``metric span'' to represent places.

          "description": "Bilevel optimization recently has attracted increased interest in machine\nlearning due to its many applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and\npolicy optimization. Although some methods recently have been proposed to solve\nthe bilevel problems, these methods do not consider using adaptive learning\nrates. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a class of fast and effective\nadaptive methods for solving bilevel optimization problems that the outer\nproblem is possibly nonconvex and the inner problem is strongly-convex.\nSpecifically, we propose a fast single-loop BiAdam algorithm based on the basic\nmomentum technique, which achieves a sample complexity of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ for finding an $\\epsilon$-stationary point. At the\nsame time, we propose an accelerated version of BiAdam algorithm (VR-BiAdam) by\nusing variance reduced technique, which reaches the best known sample\ncomplexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$. To further reduce computation in\nestimating derivatives, we propose a fast single-loop stochastic approximated\nBiAdam algorithm (saBiAdam) by avoiding the Hessian inverse, which still\nachieves a sample complexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ without large\nbatches. We further present an accelerated version of saBiAdam algorithm\n(VR-saBiAdam), which also reaches the best known sample complexity of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$. We apply the unified adaptive matrices to our\nmethods as the SUPER-ADAM \\citep{huang2021super}, which including many types of\nadaptive learning rates. Moreover, our framework can flexibly use the momentum\nand variance reduced techniques. In particular, we provide a useful convergence\nanalysis framework for both the constrained and unconstrained bilevel\noptimization. To the best of our knowledge, we first study the adaptive bilevel\noptimization methods with adaptive learning rates.",

However, as there exist numerous application scenarios\nthat have distinctive demands such as certain latency constraints and\nspecialized data distributions, it is prohibitively expensive to take advantage\nof large-scale pre-training for per-task requirements. In this paper, we focus\non the area of object detection and present a transfer learning system named\nGAIA, which could automatically and efficiently give birth to customized\nsolutions according to heterogeneous downstream needs. GAIA is capable of\nproviding powerful pre-trained weights, selecting models that conform to\ndownstream demands such as latency constraints and specified data domains, and\ncollecting relevant data for practitioners who have very few datapoints for\ntheir tasks. With GAIA, we achieve promising results on COCO, Objects365, Open\nImages, Caltech, CityPersons, and UODB which is a collection of datasets\nincluding KITTI, VOC, WiderFace, DOTA, Clipart, Comic, and more. Taking COCO as\nan example, GAIA is able to efficiently produce models covering a wide range of\nlatency from 16ms to 53ms, and yields AP from 38.2 to 46.5 without whistles and\nbells.

          "description": "Assessing an AI agent that can converse in human language and understand\nvisual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor\ncorrect syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,\nwhere an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)\nmetric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a\nsingle human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:\nthe ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence\n(e.g., `yeah' and `yes'). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative\ngain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct\nanswers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually\napplicable uncertain answers such as `I don't know. Crafting a model that\nexcels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should\nanswer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To\naddress this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that\ncan merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep\nmost MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG\nstate-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%).

          "description": "Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a challenging problem when\ngiven image category labels but requires to learn object localization models.\nOptimizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification tends to\nactivate local discriminative regions while ignoring complete object extent,\ncausing the partial activation issue. In this paper, we argue that partial\nactivation is caused by the intrinsic characteristics of CNN, where the\nconvolution operations produce local receptive fields and experience difficulty\nto capture long-range feature dependency among pixels. We introduce the token\nsemantic coupled attention map (TS-CAM) to take full advantage of the\nself-attention mechanism in visual transformer for long-range dependency\nextraction. TS-CAM first splits an image into a sequence of patch tokens for\nspatial embedding, which produce attention maps of long-range visual dependency\nto avoid partial activation. TS-CAM then re-allocates category-related\nsemantics for patch tokens, enabling each of them to be aware of object\ncategories. TS-CAM finally couples the patch tokens with the semantic-agnostic\nattention map to achieve semantic-aware localization. Experiments on the\nILSVRC/CUB-200-2011 datasets show that TS-CAM outperforms its CNN-CAM\ncounterparts by 7.1%/27.1% for WSOL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

          "description": "Facial action unit (AU) detection in the wild is a challenging problem, due\nto the unconstrained variability in facial appearances and the lack of accurate\nannotations. Most existing methods depend on either impractical labor-intensive\nlabeling or inaccurate pseudo labels. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end\nunconstrained facial AU detection framework based on domain adaptation, which\ntransfers accurate AU labels from a constrained source domain to an\nunconstrained target domain by exploiting labels of AU-related facial\nlandmarks. Specifically, we map a source image with label and a target image\nwithout label into a latent feature domain by combining source landmark-related\nfeature with target landmark-free feature. Due to the combination of source\nAU-related information and target AU-free information, the latent feature\ndomain with transferred source label can be learned by maximizing the\ntarget-domain AU detection performance.

          "description": "Metric learning is a widely used method for few shot learning in which the\nquality of prototypes plays a key role in the algorithm. In this paper we\npropose the trainable prototypes for distance measure instead of the artificial\nones within the meta-training and task-training framework. Also to avoid the\ndisadvantages that the episodic meta-training brought, we adopt non-episodic\nmeta-training based on self-supervised learning. Overall we solve the few-shot\ntasks in two phases: meta-training a transferable feature extractor via\nself-supervised learning and training the prototypes for metric classification.\nIn addition, the simple attention mechanism is used in both meta-training and\ntask-training. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in a variety of\nestablished few-shot tasks on the standard few-shot visual classification\ndataset, with about 20% increase compared to the available unsupervised\nfew-shot learning methods.",

Inspired by real-world applications of\nforgetting techniques, we introduce a novel notion of forgetting in\nmixed-privacy setting, where we know that a \"core\" subset of the training\nsamples does not need to be forgotten. While this variation of the problem is\nconceptually simple, we show that working in this setting significantly\nimproves the accuracy and guarantees of forgetting methods applied to vision\nclassification tasks. Moreover, our method allows efficient removal of all\ninformation contained in non-core data by simply setting to zero a subset of\nthe weights with minimal loss in performance. We achieve these results by\nreplacing a standard deep network with a suitable linear approximation. With\nopportune changes to the network architecture and training procedure, we show\nthat such linear approximation achieves comparable performance to the original\nnetwork and that the forgetting problem becomes quadratic and can be solved\nefficiently even for large models. Unlike previous forgetting methods on deep\nnetworks, ours can achieve close to the state-of-the-art accuracy on large\nscale vision tasks.

          "description": "The grade of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a critical prognostic\nfactor, making ccRCC nuclei grading a crucial task in RCC pathology analysis.\nComputer-aided nuclei grading aims to improve pathologists' work efficiency\nwhile reducing their misdiagnosis rate by automatically identifying the grades\nof tumor nuclei within histopathological images. Such a task requires precisely\nsegment and accurately classify the nuclei. However, most of the existing\nnuclei segmentation and classification methods can not handle the inter-class\nsimilarity property of nuclei grading, thus can not be directly applied to the\nccRCC grading task. In this paper, we propose a Composite High-Resolution\nNetwork for ccRCC nuclei grading. Specifically, we propose a segmentation\nnetwork called W-Net that can separate the clustered nuclei. Then, we recast\nthe fine-grained classification of nuclei to two cross-category classification\ntasks, based on two high-resolution feature extractors (HRFEs) which are\nproposed for learning these two tasks. The two HRFEs share the same backbone\nencoder with W-Net by a composite connection so that meaningful features for\nthe segmentation task can be inherited for the classification task. Last, a\nhead-fusion block is applied to generate the predicted label of each nucleus.\nFurthermore, we introduce a dataset for ccRCC nuclei grading, containing 1000\nimage patches with 70945 annotated nuclei. We demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods on\nthis large ccRCC grading dataset.",

          "description": "Deep visual models are susceptible to adversarial perturbations to inputs.\nAlthough these signals are carefully crafted, they still appear noise-like\npatterns to humans. This observation has led to the argument that deep visual\nrepresentation is misaligned with human perception. We counter-argue by\nproviding evidence of human-meaningful patterns in adversarial perturbations.\nWe first propose an attack that fools a network to confuse a whole category of\nobjects (source class) with a target label. Our attack also limits the\nunintended fooling by samples from non-sources classes, thereby circumscribing\nhuman-defined semantic notions for network fooling. We show that the proposed\nattack not only leads to the emergence of regular geometric patterns in the\nperturbations, but also reveals insightful information about the decision\nboundaries of deep models. Exploring this phenomenon further, we alter the\n`adversarial' objective of our attack to use it as a tool to `explain' deep\nvisual representation. We show that by careful channeling and projection of the\nperturbations computed by our method, we can visualize a model's understanding\nof human-defined semantic notions. Finally, we exploit the explanability\nproperties of our perturbations to perform image generation, inpainting and\ninteractive image manipulation by attacking adversarialy robust\n`classifiers'.In all, our major contribution is a novel pragmatic adversarial\nattack that is subsequently transformed into a tool to interpret the visual\nmodels. The article also makes secondary contributions in terms of establishing\nthe utility of our attack beyond the adversarial objective with multiple\ninteresting applications.",

In this work, we test the validity of assumption (A)\nusing a three-pronged approach. First, we develop an evaluation framework,\nDiffROAR, to test assumption (A) on four image classification benchmarks. Our\nresults suggest that (i) input gradients of standard models (i.e., trained on\noriginal data) may grossly violate (A), whereas (ii) input gradients of\nadversarially robust models satisfy (A). Second, we then introduce BlockMNIST,\nan MNIST-based semi-real dataset, that by design encodes a priori knowledge of\ndiscriminative features. Our analysis on BlockMNIST leverages this information\nto validate as well as characterize differences between input gradient\nattributions of standard and robust models. Finally, we theoretically prove\nthat our empirical findings hold on a simplified version of the BlockMNIST\ndataset. Specifically, we prove that input gradients of standard\none-hidden-layer MLPs trained on this dataset do not highlight\ninstance-specific signal coordinates, thus grossly violating assumption (A).\nOur findings motivate the need to formalize and test common assumptions in\ninterpretability in a falsifiable manner [Leavitt and Morcos, 2020].\nAdditionally, we believe that the DiffROAR evaluation framework and\nBlockMNIST-based datasets can serve as sanity checks to audit instance-specific\ninterpretability methods.",

However, in order\nto deduce any statements regarding the performance of an autonomous driving\nfunction based on simulation, the sensor model has to be validated to determine\nthe discrepancy between the synthetic and real sensor data. Since a certain\ndegree of divergence can be assumed to exist, the sufficient level of fidelity\nmust be determined, which poses a major challenge. In particular, a method for\nquantifying the fidelity of a sensor model does not exist and the problem of\ndefining an appropriate metric remains.

          "description": "In this paper, we address Novel Class Discovery (NCD), the task of unveiling\nnew classes in a set of unlabeled samples given a labeled dataset with known\nclasses. We exploit the peculiarities of NCD to build a new framework, named\nNeighborhood Contrastive Learning (NCL), to learn discriminative\nrepresentations that are important to clustering performance. Our contribution\nis twofold. First, we find that a feature extractor trained on the labeled set\ngenerates representations in which a generic query sample and its neighbors are\nlikely to share the same class. We exploit this observation to retrieve and\naggregate pseudo-positive pairs with contrastive learning, thus encouraging the\nmodel to learn more discriminative representations. Second, we notice that most\nof the instances are easily discriminated by the network, contributing less to\nthe contrastive loss. To overcome this issue, we propose to generate hard\nnegatives by mixing labeled and unlabeled samples in the feature space. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that these two ingredients significantly contribute\nto clustering performance and lead our model to outperform state-of-the-art\nmethods by a large margin (e.g., clustering accuracy +13% on CIFAR-100 and +8%\non ImageNet).",

SiamSNN is the first deep SNN tracker that achieves short\nlatency and low precision loss on the visual object tracking benchmarks\nOTB2013/2015, VOT2016/2018, and GOT-10k.

          "description": "In the era of big data, methods for improving memory and computational\nefficiency have become crucial for successful deployment of technologies.\nHashing is one of the most effective approaches to deal with computational\nlimitations that come with big data. One natural way for formulating this\nproblem is spectral hashing that directly incorporates affinity to learn binary\ncodes. However, due to binary constraints, the optimization becomes\nintractable. To mitigate this challenge, different relaxation approaches have\nbeen proposed to reduce the computational load of obtaining binary codes and\nstill attain a good solution. The problem with all existing relaxation methods\nis resorting to one or more additional auxiliary variables to attain high\nquality binary codes while relaxing the problem. The existence of auxiliary\nvariables leads to coordinate descent approach which increases the\ncomputational complexity. We argue that introducing these variables is\nunnecessary. To this end, we propose a novel relaxed formulation for spectral\nhashing that adds no additional variables to the problem. Furthermore, instead\nof solving the problem in original space where number of variables is equal to\nthe data points, we solve the problem in a much smaller space and retrieve the\nbinary codes from this solution. This trick reduces both the memory and\ncomputational complexity at the same time. We apply two optimization\ntechniques, namely projected gradient and optimization on manifold, to obtain\nthe solution. Using comprehensive experiments on four public datasets, we show\nthat the proposed efficient spectral hashing (ESH) algorithm achieves highly\ncompetitive retrieval performance compared with state of the art at low\ncomplexity.",

          "description": "Most consumer-grade digital cameras can only capture a limited range of\nluminance in real-world scenes due to sensor constraints. Besides, noise and\nquantization errors are often introduced in the imaging process. In order to\nobtain high dynamic range (HDR) images with excellent visual quality, the most\ncommon solution is to combine multiple images with different exposures.\nHowever, it is not always feasible to obtain multiple images of the same scene\nand most HDR reconstruction methods ignore the noise and quantization loss. In\nthis work, we propose a novel learning-based approach using a spatially dynamic\nencoder-decoder network, HDRUNet, to learn an end-to-end mapping for single\nimage HDR reconstruction with denoising and dequantization. The network\nconsists of a UNet-style base network to make full use of the hierarchical\nmulti-scale information, a condition network to perform pattern-specific\nmodulation and a weighting network for selectively retaining information.\nMoreover, we propose a Tanh_L1 loss function to balance the impact of\nover-exposed values and well-exposed values on the network learning. Our method\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance in quantitative comparisons and\nvisual quality. The proposed HDRUNet model won the second place in the single\nframe track of NITRE2021 High Dynamic Range Challenge.",

          "description": "Stereotactic body radiation therapy allows for a precise and accurate dose\ndelivery. Organ motion during treatment bears the risk of undetected high dose\nhealthy tissue exposure. An organ very susceptible to high dose is the\noesophagus. Its low contrast on CT and the oblong shape renders motion\nestimation difficult. We tackle this issue by modern algorithms to measure the\noesophageal motion voxel-wise and to estimate motion related dosimetric impact.\nOesophageal motion was measured using deformable image registration and 4DCT of\n11 internal and 5 public datasets. Current clinical practice of contouring the\norgan on 3DCT was compared to timely resolved 4DCT contours. The dosimetric\nimpact of the motion was estimated by analysing the trajectory of each voxel in\nthe 4D dose distribution. Finally an organ motion model was built, allowing for\neasier patient-wise comparisons. Motion analysis showed mean absolute maximal\nmotion amplitudes of 4.55 +/- 1.81 mm left-right, 5.29 +/- 2.67 mm\nanterior-posterior and 10.78 +/- 5.30 mm superior-inferior. Motion between the\ncohorts differed significantly. In around 50 % of the cases the dosimetric\npassing criteria was violated. Contours created on 3DCT did not cover 14 % of\nthe organ for 50 % of the respiratory cycle and the 3D contour is around 38 %\nsmaller than the union of all 4D contours. The motion model revealed that the\nmaximal motion is not limited to the lower part of the organ. Our results\nshowed motion amplitudes higher than most reported values in the literature and\nthat motion is very heterogeneous across patients. Therefore, individual motion\ninformation should be considered in contouring and planning.",

          "description": "Computer vision techniques have attracted a great interest in precision\nagriculture, recently. The common goal of all computer vision-based precision\nagriculture tasks is to detect the objects of interest (e.g., crop, weed) and\ndiscriminating them from the background. The Weeds are unwanted plants growing\namong crops competing for nutrients, water, and sunlight, causing losses to\ncrop yields. Weed detection and mapping is critical for site-specific weed\nmanagement to reduce the cost of labor and impact of herbicides. This paper\ninvestigates the use of color and texture features for discrimination of\nSoybean crops and weeds. Feature extraction methods including two color spaces\n(RGB, HSV), gray level Co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and Local Binary Pattern\n(LBP) are used to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The\nexperiment was carried out on image dataset of soybean crop, obtained from an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which is publicly available. The results from\nthe experiment showed that the highest accuracy (above 96%) was obtained from\nthe combination of color and LBP features.",

          "description": "Neural shape representations have recently shown to be effective in shape\nanalysis and reconstruction tasks. Existing neural network methods require\npoint coordinates and corresponding normal vectors to learn the implicit level\nsets of the shape. Normal vectors are often not provided as raw data,\ntherefore, approximation and reorientation are required as pre-processing\nstages, both of which can introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a\ndivergence guided shape representation learning approach that does not require\nnormal vectors as input. We show that incorporating a soft constraint on the\ndivergence of the distance function favours smooth solutions that reliably\norients gradients to match the unknown normal at each point, in some cases even\nbetter than approaches that use ground truth normal vectors directly.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel geometric initialization method for\nsinusoidal shape representation networks that further improves convergence to\nthe desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the task\nof surface reconstruction and show state-of-the-art performance compared to\nother unoriented methods and on-par performance compared to oriented methods.",

          "description": "When dealing with deep neural network (DNN) applications on edge devices,\ncontinuously updating the model is important. Although updating a model with\nreal incoming data is ideal, using all of them is not always feasible due to\nlimits, such as labeling and communication costs. Thus, it is necessary to\nfilter and select the data to use for training (i.e., active learning) on the\ndevice. In this paper, we formalize a practical active learning problem for\nDNNs on edge devices and propose a general task-agnostic framework to tackle\nthis problem, which reduces it to a stream submodular maximization. This\nframework is light enough to be run with low computational resources, yet\nprovides solutions whose quality is theoretically guaranteed thanks to the\nsubmodular property. Through this framework, we can configure data selection\ncriteria flexibly, including using methods proposed in previous active learning\nstudies. We evaluate our approach on both classification and object detection\ntasks in a practical setting to simulate a real-life scenario. The results of\nour study show that the proposed framework outperforms all other methods in\nboth tasks, while running at a practical speed on real devices.",

          "description": "As a 3D counterpart of object classification in images, object point cloud\nclassification is fundamental to 3D scene understanding, and has drawn great\nresearch attention since the release of benchmarking datasets, such as the\nModelNet and the ShapeNet. These benchmarks assume point clouds covering\ncomplete surfaces of object instances, for which plenty of high-performing\nmethods have been developed. However, their settings deviate from those often\nmet in practice, where, due to (self-)occlusion, a point cloud covering partial\nsurface of an object is captured from an arbitrary view. We show in this paper\nthat performance of existing point cloud classification methods drops\ndrastically under the considered practical single-view, partial setting; the\nphenomenon is consistent with the observation that semantic category of a\npartial object surface is less ambiguous only when its distribution on the\nwhole surface is clearly specified. To this end, we argue for a single-view,\npartial setting where supervised learning of object pose estimation should be\naccompanied with classification. Technically, we propose a baseline method of\nPose-Accompanied Point cloud classification Network (PAPNet); built upon\nSE(3)-equivariant convolutions, the PAPNet learns intermediate pose\ntransformations for equivariant features defined on vector fields, which makes\nthe subsequent classification easier (ideally) in the category-level, canonical\npose. We adapt existing ModelNet40 and ScanNet datasets on point set\nclassification to the introduced single-view, partial setting to verify our\nhypothesis. Thorough experiments confirm the necessity of object pose\nestimation; our PAPNet also outperforms existing methods greatly on the new\nbenchmarks.",

          "description": "A new learning paradigm, self-supervised learning (SSL), can be used to solve\nsuch problems by pre-training a general model with large unlabeled images and\nthen fine-tuning on a downstream task with very few labeled samples.\nContrastive learning is a typical method of SSL, which can learn general\ninvariant features. However, most of the existing contrastive learning is\ndesigned for classification tasks to obtain an image-level representation,\nwhich may be sub-optimal for semantic segmentation tasks requiring pixel-level\ndiscrimination. Therefore, we propose Global style and Local matching\nContrastive Learning Network (GLCNet) for remote sensing semantic segmentation.\nSpecifically, the global style contrastive module is used to learn an\nimage-level representation better, as we consider the style features can better\nrepresent the overall image features; The local features matching contrastive\nmodule is designed to learn representations of local regions which is\nbeneficial for semantic segmentation. We evaluate four remote sensing semantic\nsegmentation datasets, and the experimental results show that our method mostly\noutperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and ImageNet pre-training.\nSpecifically, with 1\\% annotation from the original dataset, our approach\nimproves Kappa by 6\\% on the ISPRS Potsdam dataset and 3\\% on Deep Globe Land\nCover Classification dataset relative to the existing baseline. Moreover, our\nmethod outperforms supervised learning when there are some differences between\nthe datasets of upstream tasks and downstream tasks.

While both object detection and tracking has received a\nlot of attention in the past, most existing methods in this domain do not\ntarget detecting or tracking objects when they are occluded. However, being\nable to detect or track an object of interest through occlusion has been a long\nstanding challenge for different autonomous tasks. Traditional methods that\nemploy visual object trackers with explicit occlusion modeling experience drift\nand make several fundamental assumptions about the data. We propose to address\nthis with a `tracking-by-detection` approach that builds upon the success of\nregion based video object detectors. Our video level object detector uses a\nnovel recurrent computational unit at its core that enables long term\npropagation of object features even under occlusion. Finally, we compare our\napproach with existing state-of-the-art video object detectors and show that\nour approach achieves superior results on a dataset of furniture assembly\nvideos collected from the internet, where small objects like screws, nuts, and\nbolts often get occluded from the camera viewpoint.",

          "description": "This paper reviews the current state of the art in Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) technologies and applications in the context of the creative industries. A\nbrief background of AI, and specifically Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, is\nprovided including Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL). We categorise creative applications into five groups related to\nhow AI technologies are used: i) content creation, ii) information analysis,\niii) content enhancement and post production workflows, iv) information\nextraction and enhancement, and v) data compression. We critically examine the\nsuccesses and limitations of this rapidly advancing technology in each of these\nareas. We further differentiate between the use of AI as a creative tool and\nits potential as a creator in its own right. We foresee that, in the near\nfuture, machine learning-based AI will be adopted widely as a tool or\ncollaborative assistant for creativity. In contrast, we observe that the\nsuccesses of machine learning in domains with fewer constraints, where AI is\nthe `creator', remain modest. The potential of AI (or its developers) to win\nawards for its original creations in competition with human creatives is also\nlimited, based on contemporary technologies. We therefore conclude that, in the\ncontext of creative industries, maximum benefit from AI will be derived where\nits focus is human centric -- where it is designed to augment, rather than\nreplace, human creativity.",

          "description": "Security-sensitive applications that rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are\nvulnerable to small perturbations that are crafted to generate Adversarial\nExamples(AEs). The AEs are imperceptible to humans and cause DNN to misclassify\nthem. Many defense and detection techniques have been proposed. Model's\nconfidences and Dropout, as a popular way to estimate the model's uncertainty,\nhave been used for AE detection but they showed limited success against black-\nand gray-box attacks. Moreover, the state-of-the-art detection techniques have\nbeen designed for specific attacks or broken by others, need knowledge about\nthe attacks, are not consistent, increase model parameters overhead, are\ntime-consuming, or have latency in inference time. To trade off these factors,\nwe revisit the model's uncertainty and confidences and propose a novel\nunsupervised ensemble AE detection mechanism that 1) uses the uncertainty\nmethod called SelectiveNet, 2) processes model layers outputs, i.e.feature\nmaps, to generate new confidence probabilities. The detection method is called\nSelective and Feature based Adversarial Detection (SFAD). Experimental results\nshow that the proposed approach achieves better performance against black- and\ngray-box attacks than the state-of-the-art methods and achieves comparable\nperformance against white-box attacks. Moreover, results show that SFAD is\nfully robust against High Confidence Attacks (HCAs) for MNIST and partially\nrobust for CIFAR10 datasets.",

          "description": "We propose to learn a generative model via entropy interpolation with a\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger Bridge. The generative learning task can be formulated as\ninterpolating between a reference distribution and a target distribution based\non the Kullback-Leibler divergence. At the population level, this entropy\ninterpolation is characterized via an SDE on $[0,1]$ with a time-varying drift\nterm. At the sample level, we derive our Schr\\\"{o}dinger Bridge algorithm by\nplugging the drift term estimated by a deep score estimator and a deep density\nratio estimator into the Euler-Maruyama method. Under some mild smoothness\nassumptions of the target distribution, we prove the consistency of both the\nscore estimator and the density ratio estimator, and then establish the\nconsistency of the proposed Schr\\\"{o}dinger Bridge approach. Our theoretical\nresults guarantee that the distribution learned by our approach converges to\nthe target distribution. Experimental results on multimodal synthetic data and\nbenchmark data support our theoretical findings and indicate that the\ngenerative model via Schr\\\"{o}dinger Bridge is comparable with state-of-the-art\nGANs, suggesting a new formulation of generative learning.

The popular\napproaches for ML either learn a generalizable initial model or a generic\nparametric optimizer through episodic training. The former approaches leverage\nthe knowledge from a batch of tasks to learn an optimal prior. In this work, we\nstudy the importance of a batch for ML. Specifically, we first incorporate a\nbatch episodic training regimen to improve the learning of the generic\nparametric optimizer. We also hypothesize that the common assumption in batch\nepisodic training that each task in a batch has an equal contribution to\nlearning an optimal meta-model need not be true. We propose to weight the tasks\nin a batch according to their \"importance\" in improving the meta-model's\nlearning. To this end, we introduce a training curriculum motivated by\nselective focus in humans, called task attended meta-training, to weight the\ntasks in a batch.

          "description": "Recently, some approaches are proposed to harness deep convolutional networks\nto facilitate superpixel segmentation. The common practice is to first evenly\ndivide the image into a pre-defined number of grids and then learn to associate\neach pixel with its surrounding grids. However, simply applying a series of\nconvolution operations with limited receptive fields can only implicitly\nperceive the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids.\nConsequently, existing methods often fail to provide an effective context when\ninferring the association map. To remedy this issue, we propose a novel\n\\textbf{A}ssociation \\textbf{I}mplantation (AI) module to enable the network to\nexplicitly capture the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids.\nThe proposed AI module directly implants the features of grid cells to the\nsurrounding of its corresponding central pixel, and conducts convolution on the\npadded window to adaptively transfer knowledge between them. With such an\nimplantation operation, the network could explicitly harvest the pixel-grid\nlevel context, which is more in line with the target of superpixel segmentation\ncomparing to the pixel-wise relation. Furthermore, to pursue better boundary\nprecision, we design a boundary-perceiving loss to help the network\ndiscriminate the pixels around boundaries in hidden feature level, which could\nbenefit the subsequent inferring modules to accurately identify more boundary\npixels. Extensive experiments on BSDS500 and NYUv2 datasets show that our\nmethod could not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but maintain\nsatisfactory inference efficiency.",

          "description": "Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are becoming more capable of navigating in complex\nenvironments with dynamic and changing conditions. A key component that enables\nthese intelligent vehicles to overcome such conditions and become more\nautonomous is the sophistication of the perception and localization systems. As\npart of the localization system, place recognition has benefited from recent\ndevelopments in other perception tasks such as place categorization or object\nrecognition, namely with the emergence of deep learning (DL) frameworks. This\npaper surveys recent approaches and methods used in place recognition,\nparticularly those based on deep learning. The contributions of this work are\ntwofold: surveying recent sensors such as 3D LiDARs and RADARs, applied in\nplace recognition; and categorizing the various DL-based place recognition\nworks into supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, parallel, and\nhierarchical categories. First, this survey introduces key place recognition\nconcepts to contextualize the reader. Then, sensor characteristics are\naddressed. This survey proceeds by elaborating on the various DL-based works,\npresenting summaries for each framework. Some lessons learned from this survey\ninclude: the importance of NetVLAD for supervised end-to-end learning; the\nadvantages of unsupervised approaches in place recognition, namely for\ncross-domain applications; or the increasing tendency of recent works to seek,\nnot only for higher performance but also for higher efficiency.",

          "description": "Transferability estimation is an essential problem in transfer learning to\npredict how good the performance is when transfer a source model (source task)\nto a target task. Recent analytical transferability metrics have been widely\nused for source model selection and multi-task learning. Earlier metrics does\nnot work sufficiently well under the challenging cross-domain cross-task\ntransfer settings, but recent OTCE score achieves a noteworthy performance\nusing auxiliary tasks. A simplified version named OT-based NCE score sacrifices\naccuracy to be more efficient, but it can be further improved. Consequently, we\npropose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score to further\nimprove the cross-domain cross-task transferability estimation performance,\nwhich is more efficient than the OTCE score and more accurate than the OT-based\nNCE score. Specifically, we build the joint correspondences between source and\ntarget data via solving an optimal transport problem with considering both the\nsample distance and label distance, and then compute the transferability score\nas the negative conditional entropy. Extensive validations under the\nintra-dataset and inter-dataset transfer settings demonstrate that our JC-NCE\nscore outperforms the OT-based NCE score with about 7% and 12% gains,\nrespectively.",

          "description": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in many computer\nvision tasks recently, but the huge number of parameters and the high\ncomputation overhead hinder their deployments on resource-constrained edge\ndevices. It is worth noting that channel pruning is an effective approach for\ncompressing DNN models. A critical challenge is to determine which channels are\nto be removed, so that the model accuracy will not be negatively affected. In\nthis paper, we first propose Spatial and Channel Attention (SCA), a new\nattention module combining both spatial and channel attention that respectively\nfocuses on \"where\" and \"what\" are the most informative parts. Guided by the\nscale values generated by SCA for measuring channel importance, we further\npropose a new channel pruning approach called Channel Pruning guided by Spatial\nand Channel Attention (CPSCA). Experimental results indicate that SCA achieves\nthe best inference accuracy, while incurring negligibly extra resource\nconsumption, compared to other state-of-the-art attention modules. Our\nevaluation on two benchmark datasets shows that, with the guidance of SCA, our\nCPSCA approach achieves higher inference accuracy than other state-of-the-art\npruning methods under the same pruning ratios.",

Among these networks,\nthe arguably most widespread approach is so-called prototype learning, where\nsimilarities to learned latent prototypes serve as the basis of classifying an\nunseen data point. In this work, we point to an important shortcoming of such\napproaches.

We design\ntwo experiments that exemplify this issue on the so-called ProtoPNet.\nSpecifically, we find that this network's interpretability mechanism can be led\nastray by intentionally crafted or even JPEG compression artefacts, which can\nproduce incomprehensible decisions.

This observation leads us to\ndesign a simplified architecture with minor code changes upon the original\nvision transformer and obtains improved performance compared to existing\nmethods. Our empirical results show that the proposed method NesT converges\nfaster and requires much less training data to achieve good generalization. For\nexample, a NesT with 68M parameters trained on ImageNet for 100/300 epochs\nachieves $82.3\\%/83.8\\%$ accuracy evaluated on $224\\times 224$ image size,\noutperforming previous methods with up to $57\\%$ parameter reduction.

          "description": "Direct reconstruction methods have been developed to estimate parametric\nimages directly from the measured PET sinograms by combining the PET imaging\nmodel and tracer kinetics in an integrated framework. Due to limited counts\nreceived, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and resolution of parametric images\nproduced by direct reconstruction frameworks are still limited. Recently\nsupervised deep learning methods have been successfully applied to medical\nimaging denoising/reconstruction when large number of high-quality training\nlabels are available. For static PET imaging, high-quality training labels can\nbe acquired by extending the scanning time. However, this is not feasible for\ndynamic PET imaging, where the scanning time is already long enough. In this\nwork, we proposed an unsupervised deep learning framework for direct parametric\nreconstruction from dynamic PET, which was tested on the Patlak model and the\nrelative equilibrium Logan model. The patient's anatomical prior image, which\nis readily available from PET/CT or PET/MR scans, was supplied as the network\ninput to provide a manifold constraint, and also utilized to construct a kernel\nlayer to perform non-local feature denoising. The linear kinetic model was\nembedded in the network structure as a 1x1 convolution layer. The training\nobjective function was based on the PET statistical model. Evaluations based on\ndynamic datasets of 18F-FDG and 11C-PiB tracers show that the proposed\nframework can outperform the traditional and the kernel method-based direct\nreconstruction methods.",

          "description": "Cervical cancer is a malignant tumor that seriously threatens women's health,\nand is one of the most common that affects women worldwide. For its early\ndetection, colposcopic images of the cervix are used for searching for possible\ninjuries or abnormalities. An inherent characteristic of these images is the\npresence of specular reflections (brightness) that make it difficult to observe\nsome regions, which might imply misdiagnosis. In this paper, a new strategy\nbased on neural networks is introduced for eliminating specular reflections and\nestimating the unobserved anatomical cervix portion under the bright zones. For\novercoming the fact that the ground truth corresponding to the specular\nreflection regions is always unknown, the new strategy proposes the supervised\ntraining of a neural network to learn how to restore any hidden regions of\ncolposcopic images. Once the specular reflections are identified, they are\nremoved from the image, and the previously trained network is used to fulfill\nthese deleted areas. The quality of the processed images was evaluated\nquantitatively and qualitatively. In 21 of the 22 evaluated images, the\ndetected specular reflections were eliminated, whereas, in the remaining one,\nthese reflections were almost completely eliminated. The distribution of the\ncolors and the content of the restored images are similar to those of the\noriginals. The evaluation carried out by a specialist in Cervix Pathology\nconcluded that, after eliminating the specular reflections, the anatomical and\nphysiological elements of the cervix are observable in the restored images,\nwhich facilitates the medical diagnosis of cervical pathologies. Our method has\nthe potential to improve the early detection of cervical cancer.",

          "description": "In this paper, we propose an efficient saliency map generation method, called\nGroup score-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Group-CAM), which adopts the\n\"split-transform-merge\" strategy to generate saliency maps. Specifically, for\nan input image, the class activations are firstly split into groups. In each\ngroup, the sub-activations are summed and de-noised as an initial mask. After\nthat, the initial masks are transformed with meaningful perturbations and then\napplied to preserve sub-pixels of the input (i.e., masked inputs), which are\nthen fed into the network to calculate the confidence scores. Finally, the\ninitial masks are weighted summed to form the final saliency map, where the\nweights are confidence scores produced by the masked inputs. Group-CAM is\nefficient yet effective, which only requires dozens of queries to the network\nwhile producing target-related saliency maps. As a result, Group-CAM can be\nserved as an effective data augment trick for fine-tuning the networks. We\ncomprehensively evaluate the performance of Group-CAM on common-used\nbenchmarks, including deletion and insertion tests on ImageNet-1k, and pointing\ngame tests on COCO2017. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that\nGroup-CAM achieves better visual performance than the current state-of-the-art\nexplanation approaches.

          "description": "Deep time series metric learning is challenging due to the difficult\ntrade-off between temporal invariance to nonlinear distortion and\ndiscriminative power in identifying non-matching sequences. This paper proposes\na novel neural network-based approach for robust yet discriminative time series\nclassification and verification. This approach adapts a parameterized attention\nmodel to time warping for greater and more adaptive temporal invariance. It is\nrobust against not only local but also large global distortions, so that even\nmatching pairs that do not satisfy the monotonicity, continuity, and boundary\nconditions can still be successfully identified. Learning of this model is\nfurther guided by dynamic time warping to impose temporal constraints for\nstabilized training and higher discriminative power. It can learn to augment\nthe inter-class variation through warping, so that similar but different\nclasses can be effectively distinguished. We experimentally demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed approach over previous non-parametric and deep\nmodels by combining it with a deep online signature verification framework,\nafter confirming its promising behavior in single-letter handwriting\nclassification on the Unipen dataset.",

          "description": "Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven\nby the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be\neasily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However,\nvarious factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model\nconfigurations complicate the easy reuse of important innovations by a wide\naudience. Though there have been on-going efforts to improve reusability and\nsimplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural\nlanguage processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for\nchallenges in the domain of DIA.

          "description": "Recent years have seen the introduction of a range of methods for post-hoc\nexplainability of image classifier predictions. However, these post-hoc\nexplanations may not always align perfectly with classifier predictions, which\nposes a significant challenge when attempting to debug models based on such\nexplanations. To this end, we seek a methodology that can improve alignment\nbetween model predictions and explanation method that is both agnostic to the\nmodel and explanation classes and which does not require ground truth\nexplanations. We achieve this through a novel explanation-driven data\naugmentation (EDDA) method that augments the training data with occlusions of\nexisting data stemming from model-explanations; this is based on the simple\nmotivating principle that occluding salient regions for the model prediction\nshould decrease the model confidence in the prediction, while occluding\nnon-salient regions should not change the prediction -- if the model and\nexplainer are aligned. To verify that this augmentation method improves model\nand explainer alignment, we evaluate the methodology on a variety of datasets,\nimage classification models, and explanation methods. We verify in all cases\nthat our explanation-driven data augmentation method improves alignment of the\nmodel and explanation in comparison to no data augmentation and non-explanation\ndriven data augmentation methods. In conclusion, this approach provides a novel\nmodel- and explainer-agnostic methodology for improving alignment between model\npredictions and explanations, which we see as a critical step forward for\npractical deployment and debugging of image classification models.",

          "description": "A video prediction model that generalizes to diverse scenes would enable\nintelligent agents such as robots to perform a variety of tasks via planning\nwith the model. However, while existing video prediction models have produced\npromising results on small datasets, they suffer from severe underfitting when\ntrained on large and diverse datasets. To address this underfitting challenge,\nwe first observe that the ability to train larger video prediction models is\noften bottlenecked by the memory constraints of GPUs or TPUs. In parallel, deep\nhierarchical latent variable models can produce higher quality predictions by\ncapturing the multi-level stochasticity of future observations, but end-to-end\noptimization of such models is notably difficult. Our key insight is that\ngreedy and modular optimization of hierarchical autoencoders can simultaneously\naddress both the memory constraints and the optimization challenges of\nlarge-scale video prediction.

          "description": "Previous studies dominantly target at self-supervised learning on real-valued\nnetworks and have achieved many promising results. However, on the more\nchallenging binary neural networks (BNNs), this task has not yet been fully\nexplored in the community. In this paper, we focus on this more difficult\nscenario: learning networks where both weights and activations are binary,\nmeanwhile, without any human annotated labels. We observe that the commonly\nused contrastive objective is not satisfying on BNNs for competitive accuracy,\nsince the backbone network contains relatively limited capacity and\nrepresentation ability. Hence instead of directly applying existing\nself-supervised methods, which cause a severe decline in performance, we\npresent a novel guided learning paradigm from real-valued to distill binary\nnetworks on the final prediction distribution, to minimize the loss and obtain\ndesirable accuracy. Our proposed method can boost the simple contrastive\nlearning baseline by an absolute gain of 5.5~15% on BNNs. We further reveal\nthat it is difficult for BNNs to recover the similar predictive distributions\nas real-valued models when training without labels. Thus, how to calibrate them\nis key to address the degradation in performance. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on the large-scale ImageNet and downstream datasets. Our method\nachieves substantial improvement over the simple contrastive learning baseline,\nand is even comparable to many mainstream supervised BNN methods.

          "description": "Contrastive loss and its variants have become very popular recently for\nlearning visual representations without supervision. In this work, we study\nthree intriguing properties of contrastive learning. We first generalize the\nstandard contrastive loss to a broader family of losses, and we find that\nvarious instantiations of the generalized loss perform similarly under the\npresence of a multi-layer non-linear projection head. We then study if\ninstance-based contrastive learning (such as in SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, and so on,\nwhich are based on global image representation) can learn well on images with\nmultiple objects present. We find that meaningful hierarchical local features\ncan be learned despite the fact that these objectives operate on global\ninstance-level features.\n\nFinally, we study an intriguing phenomenon of feature suppression among\ncompeting features shared across augmented views, such as \"color distribution\"\nvs \"object class\". We construct datasets with explicit and controllable\ncompeting features, and show that, for contrastive learning, a few bits of\neasy-to-learn shared features can suppress, and even fully prevent, the\nlearning of other sets of competing features. In scenarios where there are\nmultiple objects in an image, the dominant object would suppress the learning\nof smaller objects. Existing contrastive learning methods critically rely on\ndata augmentation to favor certain sets of features over others, and face\npotential limitation for scenarios where existing augmentations cannot fully\naddress the feature suppression. This poses open challenges to existing\ncontrastive learning techniques.",

For\nevaluation of the stitching algorithms, metrics are used, some of which have\nonly been developed in this work or have been supplemented by test procedures\nalready in use. The applicability of the developed algorithm is not only\nlimited to machine tool spindles. Instead, the developed method allows a\ngeneral approach to the surface inspection of various rotationally symmetric\ncomponents and can therefore be used in a variety of industrial applications.\nDeep-learning-based detection Algorithms can easily be implemented to generate\na complete pipeline for failure detection and condition monitoring on\nrotationally symmetric parts.",

          "description": "Building facial analysis systems that generalize to extreme variations in\nlighting and facial expressions is a challenging problem that can potentially\nbe alleviated using natural-looking synthetic data.

LEGAN disentangles the lighting and expression\nsubspaces and performs transformations in the feature space before upscaling to\nthe desired output image. The fidelity of the synthetic image is further\nrefined by integrating a perceptual quality estimation model, trained with face\nimages rendered using multiple synthesis methods and their crowd-sourced\nnaturalness ratings, into the LEGAN framework as an auxiliary discriminator.\nUsing objective metrics like FID and LPIPS, LEGAN is shown to generate higher\nquality face images when compared with popular GAN models like StarGAN and\nStarGAN-v2 for lighting and expression synthesis. We also conduct a perceptual\nstudy using images synthesized by LEGAN and other GAN models and show the\ncorrelation between our quality estimation and visual fidelity.

A promising approach to solve both of these problems is\na self-attention bottleneck, which provides a simple and effective framework\nfor learning high performing policies, even in the presence of distractions.\nHowever, due to poor scalability of attention architectures, these methods do\nnot scale beyond low resolution visual inputs, using large patches (thus small\nattention matrices).

          "description": "The phenomenon of adversarial examples illustrates one of the most basic\nvulnerabilities of deep neural networks. Among the variety of techniques\nintroduced to surmount this inherent weakness, adversarial training has emerged\nas the most common and efficient strategy to achieve robustness. Typically,\nthis is achieved by balancing robust and natural objectives. In this work, we\naim to achieve better trade-off between robust and natural performances by\nenforcing a domain-invariant feature representation. We present a new\nadversarial training method, Domain Invariant Adversarial Learning (DIAL),\nwhich learns a feature representation which is both robust and domain\ninvariant. DIAL uses a variant of Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) on\nthe natural domain and its corresponding adversarial domain. In a case where\nthe source domain consists of natural examples and the target domain is the\nadversarially perturbed examples, our method learns a feature representation\nconstrained not to discriminate between the natural and adversarial examples,\nand can therefore achieve a more robust representation. Our experiments\nindicate that our method improves both robustness and natural accuracy, when\ncompared to current state-of-the-art adversarial training methods.",

          "description": "Most existing approaches for visual localization either need a detailed 3D\nmodel of the environment or, in the case of learning-based methods, must be\nretrained for each new scene. This can either be very expensive or simply\nimpossible for large, unknown environments, for example in search-and-rescue\nscenarios. Although there are learning-based approaches that operate\nscene-agnostically, the generalization capability of these methods is still\noutperformed by classical approaches. In this paper, we present an approach\nthat can generalize to new scenes by applying specific changes to the model\narchitecture, including an extended regression part, the use of hierarchical\ncorrelation layers, and the exploitation of scale and uncertainty information.\nOur approach outperforms the 5-point algorithm using SIFT features on equally\nbig images and additionally surpasses all previous learning-based approaches\nthat were trained on different data. It is also superior to most of the\napproaches that were specifically trained on the respective scenes. We also\nevaluate our approach in a scenario where only very few reference images are\navailable, showing that under such more realistic conditions our learning-based\napproach considerably exceeds both existing learning-based and classical\nmethods.",

As such, we present a\ncomprehensive review of the latest progress in this field covering all the main\ntopics including sensors, fundamentals, and the recent state-of-the-art\ndetection methods with their pros and cons.

          "description": "Adversarial learning has emerged as one of the successful techniques to\ncircumvent the susceptibility of existing methods against adversarial\nperturbations. However, the majority of existing defense methods are tailored\nto defend against a single category of adversarial perturbation (e.g.\n$\\ell_\\infty$-attack). In safety-critical applications, this makes these\nmethods extraneous as the attacker can adopt diverse adversaries to deceive the\nsystem. Moreover, training on multiple perturbations simultaneously\nsignificantly increases the computational overhead during training. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that explicitly\nlearns to generate noise to improve the model's robustness against multiple\ntypes of attacks. Its key component is Meta Noise Generator (MNG) that outputs\noptimal noise to stochastically perturb a given sample, such that it helps\nlower the error on diverse adversarial perturbations. By utilizing samples\ngenerated by MNG, we train a model by enforcing the label consistency across\nmultiple perturbations. We validate the robustness of models trained by our\nscheme on various datasets and against a wide variety of perturbations,\ndemonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines across multiple\nperturbations with a marginal computational cost.",

          "description": "Scene graph generation (SGG) is to detect entity pairs with their relations\nin an image. Existing SGG approaches often use multi-stage pipelines to\ndecompose this task into object detection, relation graph construction, and\ndense or dense-to-sparse relation prediction. Instead, from a perspective on\nSGG as a direct set prediction, this paper presents a simple, sparse, and\nunified framework for relation detection, termed as Structured Sparse R-CNN.\nThe key to our method is a set of learnable triplet queries and structured\ntriplet detectors which could be jointly optimized from the training set in an\nend-to-end manner. Specifically, the triplet queries encode the general prior\nfor entity pair locations, categories, and their relations, and provide an\ninitial guess of relation detection for subsequent refinement. The triplet\ndetector presents a cascaded dynamic head design to progressively refine the\nresults of relation detection. In addition, to relieve the training difficulty\nof Structured Sparse R-CNN, we propose a relaxed and enhanced training strategy\nbased on knowledge distillation from a Siamese Sparse R-CNN. We also propose\nadaptive focusing parameter and average logit approach for imbalance data\ndistribution. We perform experiments on two benchmarks: Visual Genome and Open\nImages, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, we perform in-depth ablation studies\nto provide insights on our structured modeling in triplet detector design and\ntraining strategies.",

          "description": "We present a novel neural surface reconstruction method, called NeuS, for\nreconstructing objects and scenes with high fidelity from 2D image inputs.\nExisting neural surface reconstruction approaches, such as DVR and IDR, require\nforeground mask as supervision, easily get trapped in local minima, and\ntherefore struggle with the reconstruction of objects with severe\nself-occlusion or thin structures. Meanwhile, recent neural methods for novel\nview synthesis, such as NeRF and its variants, use volume rendering to produce\na neural scene representation with robustness of optimization, even for highly\ncomplex objects. However, extracting high-quality surfaces from this learned\nimplicit representation is difficult because there are not sufficient surface\nconstraints in the representation. In NeuS, we propose to represent a surface\nas the zero-level set of a signed distance function (SDF) and develop a new\nvolume rendering method to train a neural SDF representation. We observe that\nthe conventional volume rendering method causes inherent geometric errors (i.e.\nbias) for surface reconstruction, and therefore propose a new formulation that\nis free of bias in the first order of approximation, thus leading to more\naccurate surface reconstruction even without the mask supervision. Experiments\non the DTU dataset and the BlendedMVS dataset show that NeuS outperforms the\nstate-of-the-arts in high-quality surface reconstruction, especially for\nobjects and scenes with complex structures and self-occlusion.",

          "description": "Visual information extraction (VIE) has attracted increasing attention in\nrecent years. The existing methods usually first organized optical character\nrecognition (OCR) results into plain texts and then utilized token-level entity\nannotations as supervision to train a sequence tagging model. However, it\nexpends great annotation costs and may be exposed to label confusion, and the\nOCR errors will also significantly affect the final performance. In this paper,\nwe propose a unified weakly-supervised learning framework called TCPN (Tag,\nCopy or Predict Network), which introduces 1) an efficient encoder to\nsimultaneously model the semantic and layout information in 2D OCR results; 2)\na weakly-supervised training strategy that utilizes only key information\nsequences as supervision; and 3) a flexible and switchable decoder which\ncontains two inference modes: one (Copy or Predict Mode) is to output key\ninformation sequences of different categories by copying a token from the input\nor predicting one in each time step, and the other (Tag Mode) is to directly\ntag the input sequence in a single forward pass.

          "description": "Many approaches to 3D image segmentation are based on hierarchical clustering\nof supervoxels into image regions. Here we describe a distributed algorithm\ncapable of handling a tremendous number of supervoxels. The algorithm works\nrecursively, the regions are divided into chunks that are processed\nindependently in parallel by multiple workers. At each round of the recursive\nprocedure, the chunk size in all dimensions are doubled until a single chunk\nencompasses the entire image. The final result is provably independent of the\nchunking scheme, and the same as if the entire image were processed without\ndivision into chunks. This is nontrivial because a pair of adjacent regions is\nscored by some statistical property (e.g. mean or median) of the affinities at\nthe interface, and the interface may extend over arbitrarily many chunks. The\ntrick is to delay merge decisions for regions that touch chunk boundaries, and\nonly complete them in a later round after the regions are fully contained\nwithin a chunk. We demonstrate the algorithm by clustering an affinity graph\nwith over 1.5 trillion edges between 135 billion supervoxels derived from a 3D\nelectron microscopic brain image.",

The distribution generator aims at generating\nsamples that follow some distribution condensed around the real data manifold.\nIt is achieved by matching two sets of points using their geometric shape\ndescriptors, such as centroid and $p$-diameter, with learned distance metric;\nthe metric generator utilizes both real data and generated samples to learn a\ndistance metric which is close to some intrinsic geodesic distance on the real\ndata manifold. The produced distance metric is further used for manifold\nmatching. The two networks are learned simultaneously during the training\nprocess. We apply the approach on both unsupervised and supervised learning\ntasks: in unconditional image generation task, the proposed method obtains\ncompetitive results compared with existing generative models; in\nsuper-resolution task, we incorporate the framework in perception-based models\nand improve visual qualities by producing samples with more natural textures.\nBoth theoretical analysis and real data experiments guarantee the feasibility\nand effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

The\nintroduction of optimal transport mitigates the constraint of many-to-one\nfeature matching significantly while building up accurate semantic\ncorrespondences between conditional inputs and exemplars. We design a novel\nunbalanced optimal transport to address the transport between features with\ndeviational distributions which exists widely between conditional inputs and\nexemplars. In addition, we design a semantic-activation normalization scheme\nthat injects style features of exemplars into the image translation process\nsuccessfully.

In this paper, we reformulate the problem of table structure recognition\nas the table graph reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end trainable table\ngraph reconstruction network (TGRNet) for table structure recognition.\nSpecifically, the proposed method has two main branches, a cell detection\nbranch and a cell logical location branch, to jointly predict the spatial\nlocation and the logical location of different cells. Experimental results on\nthree popular table recognition datasets and a new dataset with table graph\nannotations (TableGraph-350K) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nTGRNet for table structure recognition. Code and annotations will be made\npublicly available.",

Our framework can operate in both,\na fully unsupervised mode and a supervised training mode. We analyse the impact\nof prescribed summary lengths and show experimental evidence for the\neffectiveness of 3DST-UNet-RL on two commonly used general video summarization\nbenchmarks.

Existing\napproaches follow a fully supervised setting where both bounding box and\nidentity annotations are available. However, annotating identities is\nlabor-intensive, limiting the practicability and scalability of current\nframeworks. This paper inventively considers weakly supervised person search\nwith only bounding box annotations. We proposed the first framework to address\nthis novel task, namely Context-Guided Person Search (CGPS), by investigating\nthree levels of context clues (i.e., detection, memory and scene) in\nunconstrained natural images. The first two are employed to promote local and\nglobal discriminative capabilities, while the latter enhances clustering\naccuracy. Despite its simple design, our CGPS boosts the baseline model by 8.3%\nin mAP on CUHK-SYSU. Surprisingly, it even achieves comparable performance to\ntwo-step person search models, while displaying higher efficiency. Our code is\navailable at https://github.com/ljpadam/CGPS.",

          "description": "The costly process of obtaining semantic segmentation labels has driven\nresearch towards weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods, using\nonly image-level, point, or box labels. The lack of dense scene representation\nrequires methods to increase complexity to obtain additional semantic\ninformation about the scene, often done through multiple stages of training and\nrefinement. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models leverage image-level labels\nto produce class activation maps (CAMs) which go through multiple stages of\nrefinement before they are thresholded to make pseudo-masks for supervision.\nThe multi-stage approach is computationally expensive, and dependency on\nimage-level labels for CAMs generation lacks generalizability to more complex\nscenes. In contrary, our method offers a single-stage approach generalizable to\narbitrary dataset, that is trainable from scratch, without any dependency on\npre-trained backbones, classification, or separate refinement tasks. We utilize\npoint annotations to generate reliable, on-the-fly pseudo-masks through refined\nand filtered features. While our method requires point annotations that are\nonly slightly more expensive than image-level annotations, we are to\ndemonstrate SOTA performance on benchmark datasets (PascalVOC 2012), as well as\nsignificantly outperform other SOTA WSSS methods on recent real-world datasets\n(CRAID, CityPersons, IAD).",

After preprocessing, the sparse\nnoise residuals are fed to a novel Multi-Contextual Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (M-CNET) that uses heterogeneous context size to learn the sparse and\nlow-amplitude representation of noise residuals. The model performance is\nfurther improved by incorporating the Self-Attention module to focus on the\nareas prone to steganalytic embedding.

Pruning plasticity\ncan help explain several other empirical observations about neural network\npruning in literature. We further find that pruning plasticity can be\nsubstantially improved by injecting a brain-inspired mechanism called\nneuroregeneration, i.e., to regenerate the same number of connections as\npruned. Based on the insights from pruning plasticity, we design a novel\ngradual magnitude pruning (GMP) method, named gradual pruning with zero-cost\nneuroregeneration (GraNet), and its dynamic sparse training (DST) variant\n(GraNet-ST). Both of them advance state of the art. Perhaps most impressively,\nthe latter for the first time boosts the sparse-to-sparse training performance\nover various dense-to-sparse methods by a large margin with ResNet-50 on\nImageNet. We will release all codes.",

          "description": "To assist human drivers and autonomous vehicles in assessing crash risks,\ndriving scene analysis using dash cameras on vehicles and deep learning\nalgorithms is of paramount importance. Although these technologies are\nincreasingly available, driving scene analysis for this purpose still remains a\nchallenge. This is mainly due to the lack of annotated large image datasets for\nanalyzing crash risk indicators and crash likelihood, and the lack of an\neffective method to extract lots of required information from complex driving\nscenes. To fill the gap, this paper develops a scene analysis system. The\nMulti-Net of the system includes two multi-task neural networks that perform\nscene classification to provide four labels for each scene. The DeepLab v3 and\nYOLO v3 are combined by the system to detect and locate risky pedestrians and\nthe nearest vehicles. All identified information can provide the situational\nawareness to autonomous vehicles or human drivers for identifying crash risks\nfrom the surrounding traffic. To address the scarcity of annotated image\ndatasets for studying traffic crashes, two completely new datasets have been\ndeveloped by this paper and made available to the public, which were proved to\nbe effective in training the proposed deep neural networks. The paper further\nevaluates the performance of the Multi-Net and the efficiency of the developed\nsystem. Comprehensive scene analysis is further illustrated with representative\nexamples. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed system and\ndatasets for driving scene analysis, and their supportiveness for crash risk\nassessment and crash prevention.",

          "description": "Retinal artery/vein (A/V) classification is a critical technique for\ndiagnosing diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Although deep learning based\nmethods achieve impressive results in A/V classification, their performances\nusually degrade severely when being directly applied to another database, due\nto the domain shift, e.g., caused by the variations in imaging protocols. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel vessel-mixing based consistency regularization\nframework, for cross-domain learning in retinal A/V classification. Specially,\nto alleviate the severe bias to source domain, based on the label smooth prior,\nthe model is regularized to give consistent predictions for unlabeled\ntarget-domain inputs that are under perturbation. This consistency\nregularization implicitly introduces a mechanism where the model and the\nperturbation is opponent to each other, where the model is pushed to be robust\nenough to cope with the perturbation. Thus, we investigate a more difficult\nopponent to further inspire the robustness of model, in the scenario of retinal\nA/V, called vessel-mixing perturbation. Specially, it effectively disturbs the\nfundus images especially the vessel structures by mixing two images regionally.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on cross-domain A/V classification using four\npublic datasets, which are collected by diverse institutions and imaging\ndevices. The results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art\ncross-domain performance, which is also close to the upper bound obtained by\nfully supervised learning on target domain.",

To facilitate CompositeTasking, we introduce a novel\ntask conditioning model -- a single encoder-decoder network that performs\nmultiple, spatially varying tasks at once. The proposed network takes an image\nand a set of pixel-wise dense task requests as inputs, and performs the\nrequested prediction task for each pixel. Moreover, we also learn the\ncomposition of tasks that needs to be performed according to some\nCompositeTasking rules, which includes the decision of where to apply which\ntask. It not only offers us a compact network for multi-tasking, but also\nallows for task-editing. Another strength of the proposed method is\ndemonstrated by only having to supply sparse supervision per task. The obtained\nresults are on par with our baselines that use dense supervision and a\nmulti-headed multi-tasking design.

          "description": "Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results on\nvarious vision tasks. Yet, their generalization ability under different\ndistribution shifts is rarely understood. In this work, we provide a\ncomprehensive study on the out-of-distribution generalization of ViTs. To\nsupport a systematic investigation, we first present a taxonomy of distribution\nshifts by categorizing them into five conceptual groups: corruption shift,\nbackground shift, texture shift, destruction shift, and style shift. Then we\nperform extensive evaluations of ViT variants under different groups of\ndistribution shifts and compare their generalization ability with CNNs. Several\nimportant observations are obtained: 1) ViTs generalize better than CNNs under\nmultiple distribution shifts. With the same or fewer parameters, ViTs are ahead\nof corresponding CNNs by more than 5% in top-1 accuracy under most distribution\nshifts. 2) Larger ViTs gradually narrow the in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution performance gap. To further improve the generalization of\nViTs, we design the Generalization-Enhanced ViTs by integrating adversarial\nlearning, information theory, and self-supervised learning. By investigating\nthree types of generalization-enhanced ViTs, we observe their\ngradient-sensitivity and design a smoother learning strategy to achieve a\nstable training process. With modified training schemes, we achieve\nimprovements on performance towards out-of-distribution data by 4% from vanilla\nViTs. We comprehensively compare three generalization-enhanced ViTs with their\ncorresponding CNNs, and observe that: 1) For the enhanced model, larger ViTs\nstill benefit more for the out-of-distribution generalization. 2)\ngeneralization-enhanced ViTs are more sensitive to the hyper-parameters than\ncorresponding CNNs. We hope our comprehensive study could shed light on the\ndesign of more generalizable learning architectures.",

Hashing is one of the most widely used methods for its\ncomputational and storage efficiency. With the development of deep learning,\ndeep hashing methods show more advantages than traditional methods. In this\npaper, we present a comprehensive survey of the deep hashing algorithms.\nSpecifically, we categorize deep supervised hashing methods into pairwise\nsimilarity preserving, multiwise similarity preserving, implicit similarity\npreserving, classification-oriented preserving as well as quantization\naccording to the manners of preserving the similarities. In addition, we also\nintroduce some other topics such as deep unsupervised hashing and multi-modal\ndeep hashing methods.

          "description": "Collecting a large number of reliable training images annotated by multiple\nland-cover class labels in the framework of multi-label classification is\ntime-consuming and costly in remote sensing (RS). To address this problem,\npublicly available thematic products are often used for annotating RS images\nwith zero-labeling-cost. However, such an approach may result in constructing a\ntraining set with noisy multi-labels, distorting the learning process. To\naddress this problem, we propose a Consensual Collaborative Multi-Label\nLearning (CCML) method. The proposed CCML identifies, ranks and corrects\ntraining images with noisy multi-labels through four main modules: 1)\ndiscrepancy module; 2) group lasso module; 3) flipping module; and 4) swap\nmodule. The discrepancy module ensures that the two networks learn diverse\nfeatures, while obtaining the same predictions. The group lasso module detects\nthe potentially noisy labels by estimating the label uncertainty based on the\naggregation of two collaborative networks. The flipping module corrects the\nidentified noisy labels, whereas the swap module exchanges the ranking\ninformation between the two networks. The experimental results confirm the\nsuccess of the proposed CCML under high (synthetically added) multi-label noise\nrates.

While games are not merely\nimages, neural network models trained on game pixels often capture differences\nof the visual style of the image rather than the content of the game. As a\nresult, such models cannot generalize well even within similar games of the\nsame genre. In this paper we build on recent advances in contrastive learning\nand showcase its benefits for representation learning in games. Learning to\ncontrast images of games not only classifies games in a more efficient manner;\nit also yields models that separate games in a more meaningful fashion by\nignoring the visual style and focusing, instead, on their content. Our results\nin a large dataset of sports video games containing 100k images across 175\ngames and 10 game genres suggest that contrastive learning is better suited for\nlearning generalized game representations compared to conventional supervised\nlearning.

Recent work has shown that it is possible to learn\na unified dense pose predictor for several categories of related objects.\nHowever, training such models requires to initialize inter-category\ncorrespondences by hand. This is suboptimal and the resulting models fail to\nmaintain correct correspondences as individual categories are learned. In this\npaper, we show that improved correspondences can be learned automatically as a\nnatural byproduct of learning category-specific dense pose predictors. To do\nthis, we express correspondences between different categories and between\nimages and categories using a unified embedding. Then, we use the latter to\nenforce two constraints: symmetric inter-category cycle consistency and a new\nasymmetric image-to-category cycle consistency. Without any manual annotations\nfor the inter-category correspondences, we obtain state-of-the-art alignment\nresults, outperforming dedicated methods for matching 3D shapes. Moreover, the\nnew model is also better at the task of dense pose prediction than prior work.",

In this paper, we study a\nfundamental problem in this context about recovering a surface mesh from an\nimplicit field function whose zero-level set captures the underlying surface.\nTo achieve the goal, existing methods rely on traditional meshing algorithms;\nwhile promising, they suffer from loss of precision learned in the implicit\nsurface networks, due to the use of discrete space sampling in marching cubes.\nGiven that an MLP with activations of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) partitions\nits input space into a number of linear regions, we are motivated to connect\nthis local linearity with a same property owned by the desired result of\npolygon mesh. More specifically, we identify from the linear regions,\npartitioned by an MLP based implicit function, the analytic cells and analytic\nfaces that are associated with the function's zero-level isosurface. We prove\nthat under mild conditions, the identified analytic faces are guaranteed to\nconnect and form a closed, piecewise planar surface.

          "description": "Novelty detection is the process of determining whether a query example\ndiffers from the learned training distribution. Previous methods attempt to\nlearn the representation of the normal samples via generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs). However, they will suffer from instability training, mode\ndropping, and low discriminative ability. Recently, various pretext tasks (e.g.\nrotation prediction and clustering) have been proposed for self-supervised\nlearning in novelty detection. However, the learned latent features are still\nlow discriminative. We overcome such problems by introducing a novel\ndecoder-encoder framework. Firstly, a generative network (a.k.a. decoder)\nlearns the representation by mapping the initialized latent vector to an image.\nIn particular, this vector is initialized by considering the entire\ndistribution of training data to avoid the problem of mode-dropping. Secondly,\na contrastive network (a.k.a. encoder) aims to ``learn to compare'' through\nmutual information estimation, which directly helps the generative network to\nobtain a more discriminative representation by using a negative data\naugmentation strategy. Extensive experiments show that our model has\nsignificant superiority over cutting-edge novelty detectors and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results on some novelty detection benchmarks, e.g. CIFAR10 and\nDCASE.

This\nresults in a smooth trajectory field that captures the global morphological\nchange of the brain while maintaining the local continuity. We apply LNE to\nlongitudinal T1w MRIs of two neuroimaging studies: a dataset composed of 274\nhealthy subjects, and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI,\nN=632). The visualization of the smooth trajectory vector field and superior\nperformance on downstream tasks demonstrate the strength of the proposed method\nover existing self-supervised methods in extracting information associated with\nnormal aging and in revealing the impact of neurodegenerative disorders.

          "description": "Late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE MRI) is commonly\nused to visualize and quantify left atrial (LA) scars. The position and extent\nof scars provide important information of the pathophysiology and progression\nof atrial fibrillation (AF). Hence, LA scar segmentation and quantification\nfrom LGE MRI can be useful in computer-assisted diagnosis and treatment\nstratification of AF patients. Since manual delineation can be time-consuming\nand subject to intra- and inter-expert variability, automating this computing\nis highly desired, which nevertheless is still challenging and\nunder-researched.\n\nThis paper aims to provide a systematic review on computing methods for LA\ncavity, wall, scar and ablation gap segmentation and quantification from LGE\nMRI, and the related literature for AF studies. Specifically, we first\nsummarize AF-related imaging techniques, particularly LGE MRI. Then, we review\nthe methodologies of the four computing tasks in detail, and summarize the\nvalidation strategies applied in each task. Finally, the possible future\ndevelopments are outlined, with a brief survey on the potential clinical\napplications of the aforementioned methods. The review shows that the research\ninto this topic is still in early stages. Although several methods have been\nproposed, especially for LA segmentation, there is still large scope for\nfurther algorithmic developments due to performance issues related to the high\nvariability of enhancement appearance and differences in image acquisition.",

          "description": "This paper proposes two novel knowledge transfer techniques for\nclass-incremental learning (CIL). First, we propose data-free generative replay\n(DF-GR) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in CIL by using synthetic samples\nfrom a generative model. In the conventional generative replay, the generative\nmodel is pre-trained for old data and shared in extra memory for later\nincremental learning. In our proposed DF-GR, we train a generative model from\nscratch without using any training data, based on the pre-trained\nclassification model from the past, so we curtail the cost of sharing\npre-trained generative models. Second, we introduce dual-teacher information\ndistillation (DT-ID) for knowledge distillation from two teachers to one\nstudent. In CIL, we use DT-ID to learn new classes incrementally based on the\npre-trained model for old classes and another model (pre-)trained on the new\ndata for new classes. We implemented the proposed schemes on top of one of the\nstate-of-the-art CIL methods and showed the performance improvement on\nCIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets.",

They are not suitable for exploiting\nthe rich dynamical structure of video however, as operations are done on many\naugmented instances. In this paper we propose \"Video Cross-Stream Prototypical\nContrasting\", a novel method which predicts consistent prototype assignments\nfrom both RGB and optical flow views, operating on sets of samples.\nSpecifically, we alternate the optimization process; while optimizing one of\nthe streams, all views are mapped to one set of stream prototype vectors. Each\nof the assignments is predicted with all views except the one matching the\nprediction, pushing representations closer to their assigned prototypes. As a\nresult, more efficient video embeddings with ingrained motion information are\nlearned, without the explicit need for optical flow computation during\ninference. We obtain state-of-the-art results on nearest neighbour video\nretrieval and action recognition, outperforming previous best by +3.2% on\nUCF101 using the S3D backbone (90.5% Top-1 acc), and by +7.2% on UCF101 and\n+15.1% on HMDB51 using the R(2+1)D backbone.",

          "description": "Despite the significant advances in deep learning over the past decade, a\nmajor challenge that limits the wide-spread adoption of deep learning has been\ntheir fragility to adversarial attacks. This sensitivity to making erroneous\npredictions in the presence of adversarially perturbed data makes deep neural\nnetworks difficult to adopt for certain real-world, mission-critical\napplications. While much of the research focus has revolved around adversarial\nexample creation and adversarial hardening, the area of performance measures\nfor assessing adversarial robustness is not well explored. Motivated by this,\nthis study presents the concept of residual error, a new performance measure\nfor not only assessing the adversarial robustness of a deep neural network at\nthe individual sample level, but also can be used to differentiate between\nadversarial and non-adversarial examples to facilitate for adversarial example\ndetection. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid model for approximating the\nresidual error in a tractable manner. Experimental results using the case of\nimage classification demonstrates the effectiveness and efficacy of the\nproposed residual error metric for assessing several well-known deep neural\nnetwork architectures. These results thus illustrate that the proposed measure\ncould be a useful tool for not only assessing the robustness of deep neural\nnetworks used in mission-critical scenarios, but also in the design of\nadversarially robust models.",

          "description": "Despite the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), their training\nsuffers from several well-known problems, including mode collapse and\ndifficulties learning a disconnected set of manifolds. In this paper, we break\ndown the challenging task of learning complex high dimensional distributions,\nsupporting diverse data samples, to simpler sub-tasks. Our solution relies on\ndesigning a partitioner that breaks the space into smaller regions, each having\na simpler distribution, and training a different generator for each partition.\nThis is done in an unsupervised manner without requiring any labels.\n\nWe formulate two desired criteria for the space partitioner that aid the\ntraining of our mixture of generators: 1) to produce connected partitions and\n2) provide a proxy of distance between partitions and data samples, along with\na direction for reducing that distance. These criteria are developed to avoid\nproducing samples from places with non-existent data density, and also\nfacilitate training by providing additional direction to the generators. We\ndevelop theoretical constraints for a space partitioner to satisfy the above\ncriteria. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we design an effective neural\narchitecture for the space partitioner that empirically assures these\nconditions.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel self-supervised image rectification (SIR) method based on an\nimportant insight that the rectified results of distorted images of a same\nscene from different lens should be the same. Specifically, we devise a new\nnetwork architecture with a shared encoder and several prediction heads, each\nof which predicts the distortion parameter of a specific distortion model. We\nfurther leverage a differentiable warping module to generate the rectified\nimages and re-distorted images from the distortion parameters and exploit the\nintra- and inter-model consistency between them during training, thereby\nleading to a self-supervised learning scheme without the need for ground-truth\ndistortion parameters or normal images. Experiments on synthetic dataset and\nreal-world fisheye images demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or\neven better performance than the supervised baseline method and representative\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Comparing with\nexisting multimodal datasets such as MSCOCO and Flicker30K for image-language\ntasks, YouCook2 and MSR-VTT for video-language tasks, GEM is not only the\nlargest vision-language dataset covering image-language tasks and\nvideo-language tasks at the same time, but also labeled in multiple languages.\nWe also provide two baseline models for this benchmark.

          "description": "Traffic near-crash events serve as critical data sources for various smart\ntransportation applications, such as being surrogate safety measures for\ntraffic safety research and corner case data for automated vehicle testing.\nHowever, there are several key challenges for near-crash detection. First,\nextracting near-crashes from original data sources requires significant\ncomputing, communication, and storage resources. Also, existing methods lack\nefficiency and transferability, which bottlenecks prospective large-scale\napplications. To this end, this paper leverages the power of edge computing to\naddress these challenges by processing the video streams from existing dashcams\nonboard in a real-time manner. We design a multi-thread system architecture\nthat operates on edge devices and model the bounding boxes generated by object\ndetection and tracking in linear complexity. The method is insensitive to\ncamera parameters and backward compatible with different vehicles. The edge\ncomputing system has been evaluated with recorded videos and real-world tests\non two cars and four buses for over ten thousand hours. It filters out\nirrelevant videos in real-time thereby saving labor cost, processing time,\nnetwork bandwidth, and data storage. It collects not only event videos but also\nother valuable data such as road user type, event location, time to collision,\nvehicle trajectory, vehicle speed, brake switch, and throttle. The experiments\ndemonstrate the promising performance of the system regarding efficiency,\naccuracy, reliability, and transferability. It is among the first efforts in\napplying edge computing for real-time traffic video analytics and is expected\nto benefit multiple sub-fields in smart transportation research and\napplications.",

We present generative models that condition on the\ndependency tree of an utterance and generate a corresponding visual 3D feature\nmap as well as reason about its plausibility, and detector models that\ncondition on both the dependency tree of an utterance and a related image and\nlocalize the object referents in the 3D feature map inferred from the image.\nOur model outperforms models of language and vision that associate language\nwith 2D CNN activations or 2D images by a large margin in a variety of tasks,\nsuch as, classifying plausibility of utterances, detecting referential\nexpressions, and supplying rewards for trajectory optimization of object\nplacement policies from language instructions. We perform numerous ablations\nand show the improved performance of our detectors is due to its better\ngeneralization across camera viewpoints and lack of object interferences in the\ninferred 3D feature space, and the improved performance of our generators is\ndue to their ability to spatially reason about objects and their configurations\nin 3D when mapping from language to scenes.",

          "description": "Radars and cameras are mature, cost-effective, and robust sensors and have\nbeen widely used in the perception stack of mass-produced autonomous driving\nsystems. Due to their complementary properties, outputs from radar detection\n(radar pins) and camera perception (2D bounding boxes) are usually fused to\ngenerate the best perception results. The key to successful radar-camera fusion\nis the accurate data association. The challenges in the radar-camera\nassociation can be attributed to the complexity of driving scenes, the noisy\nand sparse nature of radar measurements, and the depth ambiguity from 2D\nbounding boxes. Traditional rule-based association methods are susceptible to\nperformance degradation in challenging scenarios and failure in corner cases.\nIn this study, we propose to address radar-camera association via deep\nrepresentation learning, to explore feature-level interaction and global\nreasoning. Additionally, we design a loss sampling mechanism and an innovative\nordinal loss to overcome the difficulty of imperfect labeling and to enforce\ncritical human-like reasoning. Despite being trained with noisy labels\ngenerated by a rule-based algorithm, our proposed method achieves a performance\nof 92.2% F1 score, which is 11.6% higher than the rule-based teacher. Moreover,\nthis data-driven method also lends itself to continuous improvement via corner\ncase mining.",

Fields over a base space are fundamental entities in both subjects, as\nare equivariant maps between these fields.

Developing the theory of\nequivariant PDOs in the context of deep learning could bring these subjects\neven closer together and lead to a stronger flow of ideas. In this work, we\nderive a $G$-steerability constraint that completely characterizes when a PDO\nbetween feature vector fields is equivariant, for arbitrary symmetry groups\n$G$. We then fully solve this constraint for several important groups. We use\nour solutions as equivariant drop-in replacements for convolutional layers and\nbenchmark them in that role.

To recover the ``clustering-friendly''\nrepresentation and facilitate the subsequent clustering, we propose a graph\nfiltering approach by which a smooth representation is achieved.

          "description": "Pedestrian trajectory prediction in dynamic scenes remains a challenging and\ncritical problem in numerous applications, such as self-driving cars and\nsocially aware robots. Challenges concentrate on capturing pedestrians' motion\npatterns and social interactions, as well as handling the future uncertainties.\nRecent studies focus on modeling pedestrians' motion patterns with recurrent\nneural networks, capturing social interactions with pooling-based or\ngraph-based methods, and handling future uncertainties by using random Gaussian\nnoise as the latent variable. However, they do not integrate specific obstacle\navoidance experience (OAE) that may improve prediction performance. For\nexample, pedestrians' future trajectories are always influenced by others in\nfront. Here we propose GTPPO (Graph-based Trajectory Predictor with Pseudo\nOracle), an encoder-decoder-based method conditioned on pedestrians' future\nbehaviors. Pedestrians' motion patterns are encoded with a long short-term\nmemory unit, which introduces the temporal attention to highlight specific time\nsteps. Their interactions are captured by a graph-based attention mechanism,\nwhich draws OAE into the data-driven learning process of graph attention.\nFuture uncertainties are handled by generating multi-modal outputs with an\ninformative latent variable. Such a variable is generated by a novel pseudo\noracle predictor, which minimizes the knowledge gap between historical and\nground-truth trajectories. Finally, the GTPPO is evaluated on ETH, UCY and\nStanford Drone datasets, and the results demonstrate state-of-the-art\nperformance. Besides, the qualitative evaluations show successful cases of\nhandling sudden motion changes in the future. Such findings indicate that GTPPO\ncan peek into the future.",

          "description": "In adversarial training (AT), the main focus has been the objective and\noptimizer while the model has been less studied, so that the models being used\nare still those classic ones in standard training (ST). Classic network\narchitectures (NAs) are generally worse than searched NAs in ST, which should\nbe the same in AT. In this paper, we argue that NA and AT cannot be handled\nindependently, since given a dataset, the optimal NA in ST would be no longer\noptimal in AT. That being said, AT is time-consuming itself; if we directly\nsearch NAs in AT over large search spaces, the computation will be practically\ninfeasible. Thus, we propose a diverse-structured network (DS-Net), to\nsignificantly reduce the size of the search space: instead of low-level\noperations, we only consider predefined atomic blocks, where an atomic block is\na time-tested building block like the residual block. There are only a few\natomic blocks and thus we can weight all atomic blocks rather than find the\nbest one in a searched block of DS-Net, which is an essential trade-off between\nexploring diverse structures and exploiting the best structures. Empirical\nresults demonstrate the advantages of DS-Net, i.e., weighting the atomic\nblocks.",

          "description": "While medical image segmentation is an important task for computer aided\ndiagnosis, the high expertise requirement for pixelwise manual annotations\nmakes it a challenging and time consuming task. Since conventional data\naugmentations do not fully represent the underlying distribution of the\ntraining set, the trained models have varying performance when tested on images\ncaptured from different sources. Most prior work on image synthesis for data\naugmentation ignore the interleaved geometric relationship between different\nanatomical labels. We propose improvements over previous GAN-based medical\nimage synthesis methods by learning the relationship between different\nanatomical labels. We use a weakly supervised segmentation method to obtain\npixel level semantic label map of images which is used learn the intrinsic\nrelationship of geometry and shape across semantic labels. Latent space\nvariable sampling results in diverse generated images from a base image and\nimproves robustness. We use the synthetic images from our method to train\nnetworks for segmenting COVID-19 infected areas from lung CT images. The\nproposed method outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods on a public\ndataset. Ablation studies also demonstrate benefits of integrating geometry and\ndiversity.",

          "description": "Recently, autonomous vehicles and those equipped with an Advanced Driver\nAssistance System (ADAS) are emerging. They share the road with regular ones\noperated by human drivers entirely. To ensure guaranteed safety for passengers\nand other road users, it becomes essential for autonomous vehicles and ADAS to\nanticipate traffic accidents from natural driving scenes. The dynamic\nspatial-temporal interaction of the traffic agents is complex, and visual cues\nfor predicting a future accident are embedded deeply in dashcam video data.\nTherefore, early anticipation of traffic accidents remains a challenge. To this\nend, the paper presents a dynamic spatial-temporal attention (DSTA) network for\nearly anticipation of traffic accidents from dashcam videos. The proposed\nDSTA-network learns to select discriminative temporal segments of a video\nsequence with a module named Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA). It also learns\nto focus on the informative spatial regions of frames with another module named\nDynamic Spatial Attention (DSA). The spatial-temporal relational features of\naccidents, along with scene appearance features, are learned jointly with a\nGated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network. The experimental evaluation of the\nDSTA-network on two benchmark datasets confirms that it has exceeded the\nstate-of-the-art performance. A thorough ablation study evaluates the\ncontributions of individual components of the DSTA-network, revealing how the\nnetwork achieves such performance. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new\nstrategy that fuses the prediction scores from two complementary models and\nverifies its effectiveness in further boosting the performance of early\naccident anticipation.",

This motivates the application of learned methods, which allow\nreconstruction from non-oversampled magnitude measurements after a learning\nphase.

          "description": "The determination of precise skin lesion boundaries in dermoscopic images\nusing automated methods faces many challenges, most importantly, the presence\nof hair, inconspicuous lesion edges and low contrast in dermoscopic images, and\nvariability in the color, texture and shapes of skin lesions. Existing deep\nlearning-based skin lesion segmentation algorithms are expensive in terms of\ncomputational time and memory. Consequently, running such segmentation\nalgorithms requires a powerful GPU and high bandwidth memory, which are not\navailable in dermoscopy devices. Thus, this article aims to achieve precise\nskin lesion segmentation with minimum resources: a lightweight, efficient\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) model called SLSNet, which combines 1-D\nkernel factorized networks, position and channel attention, and multiscale\naggregation mechanisms with a GAN model. The 1-D kernel factorized network\nreduces the computational cost of 2D filtering. The position and channel\nattention modules enhance the discriminative ability between the lesion and\nnon-lesion feature representations in spatial and channel dimensions,\nrespectively. A multiscale block is also used to aggregate the coarse-to-fine\nfeatures of input skin images and reduce the effect of the artifacts. SLSNet is\nevaluated on two publicly available datasets: ISBI 2017 and the ISIC 2018.\nAlthough SLSNet has only 2.35 million parameters, the experimental results\ndemonstrate that it achieves segmentation results on a par with the\nstate-of-the-art skin lesion segmentation methods with an accuracy of 97.61%,\nand Dice and Jaccard similarity coefficients of 90.63% and 81.98%,\nrespectively. SLSNet can run at more than 110 frames per second (FPS) in a\nsingle GTX1080Ti GPU, which is faster than well-known deep learning-based image\nsegmentation models, such as FCN. Therefore, SLSNet can be used for practical\ndermoscopic applications.",

          "description": "Despite its best performance in image denoising, the supervised deep\ndenoising methods require paired noise-clean data, which are often unavailable.\nTo address this challenge, Noise2Noise was designed based on the fact that\npaired noise-clean images can be replaced by paired noise-noise images that are\neasier to collect. However, in many scenarios the collection of paired\nnoise-noise images is still impractical. To bypass labeled images, Noise2Void\nmethods predict masked pixels from their surroundings with single noisy images\nonly and give improved denoising results that still need improvements. An\nobservation on classic denoising methods is that non-local mean (NLM) outcomes\nare typically superior to locally denoised results. In contrast, Noise2Void and\nits variants do not utilize self-similarities in an image as the NLM-based\nmethods do. Here we propose Noise2Sim, an NLM-inspired self-learning method for\nimage denoising. Specifically, Noise2Sim leverages the self-similarity of image\npixels to train the denoising network, requiring single noisy images only. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that Noise2Sim tends to be equivalent to Noise2Noise\nunder mild conditions.

          "description": "Most capsule network designs rely on traditional matrix multiplication\nbetween capsule layers and computationally expensive routing mechanisms to deal\nwith the capsule dimensional entanglement that the matrix multiplication\nintroduces. By using Homogeneous Vector Capsules (HVCs), which use element-wise\nmultiplication rather than matrix multiplication, the dimensions of the\ncapsules remain unentangled. In this work, we study HVCs as applied to the\nhighly structured MNIST dataset in order to produce a direct comparison to the\ncapsule research direction of Geoffrey Hinton, et al. In our study, we show\nthat a simple convolutional neural network using HVCs performs as well as the\nprior best performing capsule network on MNIST using 5.5x fewer parameters, 4x\nfewer training epochs, no reconstruction sub-network, and requiring no routing\nmechanism. The addition of multiple classification branches to the network\nestablishes a new state of the art for the MNIST dataset with an accuracy of\n99.87% for an ensemble of these models, as well as establishing a new state of\nthe art for a single model (99.83% accurate).",

          "description": "Many applications require the robustness, or ideally the invariance, of a\nneural network to certain transformations of input data. Most commonly, this\nrequirement is addressed by either augmenting the training data, using\nadversarial training, or defining network architectures that include the\ndesired invariance automatically. Unfortunately, the latter often relies on the\nability to enlist all possible transformations, which make such approaches\nlargely infeasible for infinite sets of transformations, such as arbitrary\nrotations or scaling. In this work, we propose a method for provably invariant\nnetwork architectures with respect to group actions by choosing one element\nfrom a (possibly continuous) orbit based on a fixed criterion. In a nutshell,\nwe intend to 'undo' any possible transformation before feeding the data into\nthe actual network. We analyze properties of such approaches, extend them to\nequivariant networks, and demonstrate their advantages in terms of robustness\nas well as computational efficiency in several numerical examples. In\nparticular, we investigate the robustness with respect to rotations of images\n(which can possibly hold up to discretization artifacts only) as well as the\nprovable rotational and scaling invariance of 3D point cloud classification.",

          "description": "When interacting with objects through cameras, or pictures, users often have\na specific intent. For example, they may want to perform a visual search.\nHowever, most object detection models ignore the user intent, relying on image\npixels as their only input. This often leads to incorrect results, such as lack\nof a high-confidence detection on the object of interest, or detection with a\nwrong class label. In this paper we investigate techniques to modulate standard\nobject detectors to explicitly account for the user intent, expressed as an\nembedding of a simple query. Compared to standard object detectors,\nquery-modulated detectors show superior performance at detecting objects for a\ngiven label of interest. Thanks to large-scale training data synthesized from\nstandard object detection annotations, query-modulated detectors can also\noutperform specialized referring expression recognition systems. Furthermore,\nthey can be simultaneously trained to solve for both query-modulated detection\nand standard object detection.",

          "description": "In real-world image enhancement, it is often challenging (if not impossible)\nto acquire ground-truth data, preventing the adoption of distance metrics for\nobjective quality assessment. As a result, one often resorts to subjective\nquality assessment, the most straightforward and reliable means of evaluating\nimage enhancement. Conventional subjective testing requires manually\npre-selecting a small set of visual examples, which may suffer from three\nsources of biases: 1) sampling bias due to the extremely sparse distribution of\nthe selected samples in the image space; 2) algorithmic bias due to potential\noverfitting the selected samples; 3) subjective bias due to further potential\ncherry-picking test results. This eventually makes the field of real-world\nimage enhancement more of an art than a science. Here we take steps towards\ndebiasing conventional subjective assessment by automatically sampling a set of\nadaptive and diverse images for subsequent testing. This is achieved by casting\nsample selection into a joint maximization of the discrepancy between the\nenhancers and the diversity among the selected input images. Careful visual\ninspection on the resulting enhanced images provides a debiased ranking of the\nenhancement algorithms. We demonstrate our subjective assessment method using\nthree popular and practically demanding image enhancement tasks: dehazing,\nsuper-resolution, and low-light enhancement.",

          "description": "In active visual tracking, it is notoriously difficult when distracting\nobjects appear, as distractors often mislead the tracker by occluding the\ntarget or bringing a confusing appearance. To address this issue, we propose a\nmixed cooperative-competitive multi-agent game, where a target and multiple\ndistractors form a collaborative team to play against a tracker and make it\nfail to follow. Through learning in our game, diverse distracting behaviors of\nthe distractors naturally emerge, thereby exposing the tracker's weakness,\nwhich helps enhance the distraction-robustness of the tracker. For effective\nlearning, we then present a bunch of practical methods, including a reward\nfunction for distractors, a cross-modal teacher-student learning strategy, and\na recurrent attention mechanism for the tracker. The experimental results show\nthat our tracker performs desired distraction-robust active visual tracking and\ncan be well generalized to unseen environments. We also show that the\nmulti-agent game can be used to adversarially test the robustness of trackers.",

          "description": "Pseudo-LiDAR based 3D object detectors have gained popularity due to their\nhigh accuracy. However, these methods need dense depth supervision and suffer\nfrom inferior speed. To solve these two issues, a recently introduced RTS3D\nbuilds an efficient 4D Feature-Consistency Embedding (FCE) space for the\nintermediate representation of object without depth supervision. FCE space\nsplits the entire object region into 3D uniform grid latent space for feature\nsampling point generation, which ignores the importance of different object\nregions. However, we argue that, compared with the inner region, the outer\nregion plays a more important role for accurate 3D detection. To encode more\ninformation from the outer region, we propose a shape prior non-uniform\nsampling strategy that performs dense sampling in outer region and sparse\nsampling in inner region. As a result, more points are sampled from the outer\nregion and more useful features are extracted for 3D detection. Further, to\nenhance the feature discrimination of each sampling point, we propose a\nhigh-level semantic enhanced FCE module to exploit more contextual information\nand suppress noise better. Experiments on the KITTI dataset are performed to\nshow the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the baseline\nRTS3D, our proposed method has 2.57% improvement on AP3d almost without extra\nnetwork parameters. Moreover, our proposed method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods without extra supervision at a real-time speed.",

To define the artificial labels, we exploit the\nassumption that neural network generators can be trained more easily to map\nnearby latent vectors to data with semantic similarities, than across separate\ncategories. We use generated data samples and their corresponding artificial\nconditioning labels to train a classifier. The classifier is then used to\nself-label real data. To boost the accuracy of the self-labeling, we also use\nthe exponential moving average of the classifier. However, because the\nclassifier might still make mistakes, especially at the beginning of the\ntraining, we also refine the labels through self-attention, by using the\nlabeling of real data samples only when the classifier outputs a high\nclassification probability score. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, STL-10\nand SVHN, and show that both self-labeling and self-attention consistently\nimprove the quality of generated data.

          "description": "Collecting training data from untrusted sources exposes machine learning\nservices to poisoning adversaries, who maliciously manipulate training data to\ndegrade the model accuracy. When trained on offline datasets, poisoning\nadversaries have to inject the poisoned data in advance before training, and\nthe order of feeding these poisoned batches into the model is stochastic. In\ncontrast, practical systems are more usually trained/fine-tuned on sequentially\ncaptured real-time data, in which case poisoning adversaries could dynamically\npoison each data batch according to the current model state. In this paper, we\nfocus on the real-time settings and propose a new attacking strategy, which\naffiliates an accumulative phase with poisoning attacks to secretly (i.e.,\nwithout affecting accuracy) magnify the destructive effect of a (poisoned)\ntrigger batch. By mimicking online learning and federated learning on CIFAR-10,\nwe show that the model accuracy will significantly drop by a single update step\non the trigger batch after the accumulative phase.

          "description": "Purpose: Image classification is perhaps the most fundamental task in imaging\nAI. However, labeling images is time-consuming and tedious. We have recently\ndemonstrated that reinforcement learning (RL) can classify 2D slices of MRI\nbrain images with high accuracy. Here we make two important steps toward\nspeeding image classification: Firstly, we automatically extract class labels\nfrom the clinical reports. Secondly, we extend our prior 2D classification work\nto fully 3D image volumes from our institution. Hence, we proceed as follows:\nin Part 1, we extract labels from reports automatically using the SBERT natural\nlanguage processing approach. Then, in Part 2, we use these labels with RL to\ntrain a classification Deep-Q Network (DQN) for 3D image volumes.\n\nMethods: For Part 1, we trained SBERT with 90 radiology report impressions.\nWe then used the trained SBERT to predict class labels for use in Part 2. In\nPart 2, we applied multi-step image classification to allow for combined Deep-Q\nlearning using 3D convolutions and TD(0) Q learning. We trained on a set of 90\nimages. We tested on a separate set of 61 images, again using the classes\npredicted from patient reports by the trained SBERT in Part 1. For comparison,\nwe also trained and tested a supervised deep learning classification network on\nthe same set of training and testing images using the same labels.\n\nResults: Part 1: Upon training with the corpus of radiology reports, the\nSBERT model had 100% accuracy for both normal and metastasis-containing scans.\nPart 2: Then, using these labels, whereas the supervised approach quickly\noverfit the training data and as expected performed poorly on the testing set\n(66% accuracy, just over random guessing), the reinforcement learning approach\nachieved an accuracy of 92%. The results were found to be statistically\nsignificant, with a p-value of 3.1 x 10^-5.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are effective in solving many real-world\nproblems. Larger DNN models usually exhibit better quality (e.g., accuracy) but\ntheir excessive computation results in long training and inference time. Model\nsparsification can reduce the computation and memory cost while maintaining\nmodel quality. Most existing sparsification algorithms unidirectionally remove\nweights, while others randomly or greedily explore a small subset of weights in\neach layer. The inefficiency of the algorithms reduces the achievable sparsity\nlevel. In addition, many algorithms still require pre-trained dense models and\nthus suffer from large memory footprint and long training time. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel scheduled grow-and-prune (GaP) methodology without\npre-training the dense models. It addresses the shortcomings of the previous\nworks by repeatedly growing a subset of layers to dense and then pruning back\nto sparse after some training. Experiments have shown that such models can\nmatch or beat the quality of highly optimized dense models at 80% sparsity on a\nvariety of tasks, such as image classification, objective detection, 3D object\npart segmentation, and translation. They also outperform other state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) pruning methods, including pruning from pre-trained dense models. As an\nexample, a 90% sparse ResNet-50 obtained via GaP achieves 77.9% top-1 accuracy\non ImageNet, improving the SOTA results by 1.5%.",

          "description": "To evaluate clustering results is a significant part of cluster analysis.\nSince there are no true class labels for clustering in typical unsupervised\nlearning, many internal cluster validity indices (CVIs), which use predicted\nlabels and data, have been created. Without true labels, to design an effective\nCVI is as difficult as to create a clustering method. And it is crucial to have\nmore CVIs because there are no universal CVIs that can be used to measure all\ndatasets and no specific methods of selecting a proper CVI for clusters without\ntrue labels. Therefore, to apply a variety of CVIs to evaluate clustering\nresults is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel internal CVI -- the\nDistance-based Separability Index (DSI), based on a data separability measure.\nWe compared the DSI with eight internal CVIs including studies from early Dunn\n(1974) to most recent CVDD (2019) and an external CVI as ground truth, by using\nclustering results of five clustering algorithms on 12 real and 97 synthetic\ndatasets. Results show DSI is an effective, unique, and competitive CVI to\nother compared CVIs. We also summarized the general process to evaluate CVIs\nand created the rank-difference metric for comparison of CVIs' results.",

          "description": "Integrated Gradients (IG) is a commonly used feature attribution method for\ndeep neural networks. While IG has many desirable properties, the method often\nproduces spurious/noisy pixel attributions in regions that are not related to\nthe predicted class when applied to visual models. While this has been\npreviously noted, most existing solutions are aimed at addressing the symptoms\nby explicitly reducing the noise in the resulting attributions. In this work,\nwe show that one of the causes of the problem is the accumulation of noise\nalong the IG path. To minimize the effect of this source of noise, we propose\nadapting the attribution path itself -- conditioning the path not just on the\nimage but also on the model being explained. We introduce Adaptive Path Methods\n(APMs) as a generalization of path methods, and Guided IG as a specific\ninstance of an APM. Empirically, Guided IG creates saliency maps better aligned\nwith the model's prediction and the input image that is being explained. We\nshow through qualitative and quantitative experiments that Guided IG\noutperforms other, related methods in nearly every experiment.",

          "description": "In recent years, multi-view subspace clustering has achieved impressive\nperformance due to the exploitation of complementary imformation across\nmultiple views. However, multi-view data can be very complicated and are not\neasy to cluster in real-world applications. Most existing methods operate on\nraw data and may not obtain the optimal solution. In this work, we propose a\nnovel multi-view clustering method named smoothed multi-view subspace\nclustering (SMVSC) by employing a novel technique, i.e., graph filtering, to\nobtain a smooth representation for each view, in which similar data points have\nsimilar feature values. Specifically, it retains the graph geometric features\nthrough applying a low-pass filter. Consequently, it produces a\n``clustering-friendly\" representation and greatly facilitates the downstream\nclustering task. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the\nsuperiority of our approach. Analysis shows that graph filtering increases the\nseparability of classes.",

Human employees\nwith handheld thermometers have been used to fulfill this task, however this\nputs them at risk as they cannot be physically distanced and the sequential\nnature of this method leads to great inconveniences and inefficiency. The\nproposed solution is an autonomously navigating robot capable of conversing and\nscanning people's temperature to detect fevers and help screen for COVID-19. To\nsatisfy this objective, the robot must be able to (1) navigate autonomously,\n(2) detect and track people, and (3) get individuals' temperature reading and\nconverse with them if it exceeds 38{\\deg}C. An autonomously navigating mobile\nrobot is used with a manipulator controlled using a face tracking algorithm,\nand an end effector consisting of a thermal camera, smartphone, and chatbot.\nThe goal is to develop a functioning solution that performs the above tasks.

          "description": "Robust multi-agent trajectory prediction is essential for the safe control of\nrobots and vehicles that interact with humans. Many existing methods treat\nsocial and temporal information separately and therefore fall short of\nmodelling the joint future trajectories of all agents in a socially consistent\nway. To address this, we propose a new class of Latent Variable Sequential Set\nTransformers which autoregressively model multi-agent trajectories. We refer to\nthese architectures as \"AutoBots\". AutoBots model the contents of sets (e.g.\nrepresenting the properties of agents in a scene) over time and employ\nmulti-head self-attention blocks over these sequences of sets to encode the\nsociotemporal relationships between the different actors of a scene. This\nproduces either the trajectory of one ego-agent or a distribution over the\nfuture trajectories for all agents under consideration. Our approach works for\ngeneral sequences of sets and we provide illustrative experiments modelling the\nsequential structure of the multiple strokes that make up symbols in the\nOmniglot data. For the single-agent prediction case, we validate our model on\nthe NuScenes motion prediction task and achieve competitive results on the\nglobal leaderboard. In the multi-agent forecasting setting, we validate our\nmodel on TrajNet. We find that our method outperforms physical extrapolation\nand recurrent network baselines and generates scene-consistent trajectories.",

Two main contexts are identified,\noriginated respectively from the descriptor space and from the keypoint space.\nThe former is generally used to design the actual matching strategy while the\nlatter to filter matches according to the local spatial consistency. On this\nbasis, a new matching strategy and a novel local spatial filter, named\nrespectively blob matching and Delaunay Triangulation Matching (DTM) are\ndevised. Blob matching provides a general matching framework by merging\ntogether several strategies, including pre-filtering as well as many-to-many\nand symmetric matching, enabling to achieve a global improvement upon each\nindividual strategy. DTM alternates between Delaunay triangulation contractions\nand expansions to figure out and adjust keypoint neighborhood consistency.\nExperimental evaluation shows that DTM is comparable or better than the\nstate-of-the-art in terms of matching accuracy and robustness, especially for\nnon-planar scenes. Evaluation is carried out according to a new benchmark\ndevised for analyzing the matching pipeline in terms of correct correspondences\non both planar and non-planar scenes, including state-of-the-art methods as\nwell as the common SIFT matching approach for reference.

          "description": "Multiple views of data, both naturally acquired (e.g., image and audio) and\nartificially produced (e.g., via adding different noise to data samples), have\nproven useful in enhancing representation learning. Natural views are often\nhandled by multiview analysis tools, e.g., (deep) canonical correlation\nanalysis [(D)CCA], while the artificial ones are frequently used in\nself-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, e.g., SimCLR and Barlow Twins. Both\ntypes of approaches often involve learning neural feature extractors such that\nthe embeddings of data exhibit high cross-view correlations. Although\nintuitive, the effectiveness of correlation-based neural embedding is only\nempirically validated. This work puts forth a theory-backed framework for\nunsupervised multiview learning. Our development starts with proposing a\nmultiview model, where each view is a nonlinear mixture of shared and private\ncomponents. Consequently, the learning problem boils down to shared/private\ncomponent identification and disentanglement. Under this model, latent\ncorrelation maximization is shown to guarantee the extraction of the shared\ncomponents across views (up to certain ambiguities). In addition, the private\ninformation in each view can be provably disentangled from the shared using\nproper regularization design. The method is tested on a series of tasks, e.g.,\ndownstream clustering, which all show promising performance. Our development\nalso provides a unifying perspective for understanding various DCCA and SSL\nschemes.",

          "description": "We investigate the reasoning ability of pretrained vision and language (V&L)\nmodels in two tasks that require multimodal integration: (1) discriminating a\ncorrect image-sentence pair from an incorrect one, and (2) counting entities in\nan image. We evaluate three pretrained V&L models on these tasks: ViLBERT,\nViLBERT 12-in-1 and LXMERT, in zero-shot and finetuned settings. Our results\nshow that models solve task (1) very well, as expected, since all models are\npretrained on task (1). However, none of the pretrained V&L models is able to\nadequately solve task (2), our counting probe, and they cannot generalise to\nout-of-distribution quantities. We propose a number of explanations for these\nfindings: LXMERT (and to some extent ViLBERT 12-in-1) show some evidence of\ncatastrophic forgetting on task (1). Concerning our results on the counting\nprobe, we find evidence that all models are impacted by dataset bias, and also\nfail to individuate entities in the visual input. While a selling point of\npretrained V&L models is their ability to solve complex tasks, our findings\nsuggest that understanding their reasoning and grounding capabilities requires\nmore targeted investigations on specific phenomena.",

          "description": "Sensory input from multiple sources is crucial for robust and coherent human\nperception. Different sources contribute complementary explanatory factors.\nSimilarly, research studies often collect multimodal imaging data, each of\nwhich can provide shared and unique information. This observation motivated the\ndesign of powerful multimodal self-supervised representation-learning\nalgorithms. In this paper, we unify recent work on multimodal self-supervised\nlearning under a single framework. Observing that most self-supervised methods\noptimize similarity metrics between a set of model components, we propose a\ntaxonomy of all reasonable ways to organize this process. We first evaluate\nmodels on toy multimodal MNIST datasets and then apply them to a multimodal\nneuroimaging dataset with Alzheimer's disease patients. We find that (1)\nmultimodal contrastive learning has significant benefits over its unimodal\ncounterpart, (2) the specific composition of multiple contrastive objectives is\ncritical to performance on a downstream task, (3) maximization of the\nsimilarity between representations has a regularizing effect on a neural\nnetwork, which can sometimes lead to reduced downstream performance but still\nreveal multimodal relations. Results show that the proposed approach\noutperforms previous self-supervised encoder-decoder methods based on canonical\ncorrelation analysis (CCA) or the mixture-of-experts multimodal variational\nautoEncoder (MMVAE) on various datasets with a linear evaluation protocol.\nImportantly, we find a promising solution to uncover connections between\nmodalities through a jointly shared subspace that can help advance work in our\nsearch for neuroimaging biomarkers.",

Then, based on the user annotations, a segmentation algorithm\nrefines the masks. The previous interactive VOS paradigm selects the frame with\nsome worst evaluation metric, and the ground truth is required for calculating\nthe evaluation metric, which is impractical in the testing phase. In contrast,\nin this paper, we advocate that the frame with the worst evaluation metric may\nnot be exactly the most valuable frame that leads to the most performance\nimprovement across the video. Thus, we formulate the frame selection problem in\nthe interactive VOS as a Markov Decision Process, where an agent is learned to\nrecommend the frame under a deep reinforcement learning framework. The learned\nagent can automatically determine the most valuable frame, making the\ninteractive setting more practical in the wild.

Based\non these insights, we propose a novel ALPR approach, termed VSNet.\nSpecifically, VSNet includes two CNNs, i.e., VertexNet for license plate\ndetection and SCR-Net for license plate recognition, integrated in a\nresampling-based cascaded manner. In VertexNet, we propose an efficient\nintegration block to extract the spatial features of license plates. With\nvertex supervisory information, we propose a vertex-estimation branch in\nVertexNet such that license plates can be rectified as the input images of\nSCR-Net. In SCR-Net, we introduce a horizontal encoding technique for\nleft-to-right feature extraction and propose a weight-sharing classifier for\ncharacter recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed VSNet\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by more than 50% relative improvement on\nerror rate, achieving > 99% recognition accuracy on CCPD and AOLP datasets with\n149 FPS inference speed.

Applications range from\nrepresentation learning, image translation and generative modeling, to the\nestimation of spatial deformations. Such maps relate feature vectors, or map\nbetween feature spaces. Well-behaved maps should be regular, which can be\nimposed explicitly or may emanate from the data itself. We explore what induces\nregularity for spatial transformations, e.g., when computing image\nregistrations. Classical optimization-based models compute maps between pairs\nof samples and rely on an appropriate regularizer for well-posedness. Recent\ndeep learning approaches have attempted to avoid using such regularizers\naltogether by relying on the sample population instead. We explore if it is\npossible to obtain spatial regularity using an inverse consistency loss only\nand elucidate what explains map regularity in such a context. We find that deep\nnetworks combined with an inverse consistency loss and randomized off-grid\ninterpolation yield well behaved, approximately diffeomorphic, spatial\ntransformations.

They also offer an\neffective solution in healthcare for bi-directional protection against\nair-borne diseases. Wearing and positioning the mask correctly is essential for\nits function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution\nfor face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and\npositioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such algorithms\ncan be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and\nother indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These application\nscenarios impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The\ninference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing\nsufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably\nlow latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain\non the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address\nthese challenges, we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for\ncorrect facial-mask wear and positioning. The classification task is\nimplemented on an embedded FPGA, performing high-throughput binary operations.\nClassification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling\nmulti-camera, speed-gate settings or statistics collection in crowd settings.\nWhen deployed on a single entrance or gate, the idle power consumption is\nreduced to 1.6W, improving the battery-life of the device. We achieve an\naccuracy of up to 98% for four wearing positions of the MaskedFace-Net dataset.\nTo maintain equivalent classification accuracy for all face structures,\nskin-tones, hair types, and mask types, the algorithms are tested for their\nability to generalize the relevant features over all subjects using the\nGrad-CAM approach.",

          "description": "Following their success in natural language processing, transformers have\nrecently shown much promise for computer vision. The self-attention operation\nunderlying transformers yields global interactions between all tokens ,i.e.\nwords or image patches, and enables flexible modelling of image data beyond the\nlocal interactions of convolutions. This flexibility, however, comes with a\nquadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering application to long\nsequences and high-resolution images. We propose a \"transposed\" version of\nself-attention that operates across feature channels rather than tokens, where\nthe interactions are based on the cross-covariance matrix between keys and\nqueries. The resulting cross-covariance attention (XCA) has linear complexity\nin the number of tokens, and allows efficient processing of high-resolution\nimages. Our cross-covariance image transformer (XCiT) is built upon XCA. It\ncombines the accuracy of conventional transformers with the scalability of\nconvolutional architectures.

First, a novel noise\nand outlier filtering method is designed to facilitate subsequent high-level\ntasks. For effective understanding purpose, we propose a deep convolutional\nneural network leveraging correlated feature mining and deformable convolution\nbased geometric-aware modelling, in which the local feature relationships and\ngeometric patterns can be fully exploited. For the efficiency issue, we put\nforward an inverse density sampling operation and a feature pyramid based\nresidual learning strategy to save the computational cost and memory\nconsumption respectively. Extensive experiments on real-world challenging\ndatasets demonstrated that our approaches outperform state-of-the-art\napproaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Medical image analysis (MedIA) systems have recently\nbeen argued to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to strong financial\nincentives and the associated technological infrastructure.\n\nIn this paper, we study previously unexplored factors affecting adversarial\nattack vulnerability of deep learning MedIA systems in three medical domains:\nophthalmology, radiology, and pathology. We focus on adversarial black-box\nsettings, in which the attacker does not have full access to the target model\nand usually uses another model, commonly referred to as surrogate model, to\ncraft adversarial examples. We consider this to be the most realistic scenario\nfor MedIA systems.\n\nFirstly, we study the effect of weight initialization (ImageNet vs. random)\non the transferability of adversarial attacks from the surrogate model to the\ntarget model. Secondly, we study the influence of differences in development\ndata between target and surrogate models. We further study the interaction of\nweight initialization and data differences with differences in model\narchitecture. All experiments were done with a perturbation degree tuned to\nensure maximal transferability at minimal visual perceptibility of the attacks.\n\nOur experiments show that pre-training may dramatically increase the\ntransferability of adversarial examples, even when the target and surrogate's\narchitectures are different: the larger the performance gain using\npre-training, the larger the transferability. Differences in the development\ndata between target and surrogate models considerably decrease the performance\nof the attack; this decrease is further amplified by difference in the model\narchitecture. We believe these factors should be considered when developing\nsecurity-critical MedIA systems planned to be deployed in clinical practice.",

          "description": "Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is widely used\nto complement ultrasound examinations and x-ray mammography during the early\ndetection and diagnosis of breast cancer. However, images generated by various\nMRI scanners (e.g. GE Healthcare vs Siemens) differ both in intensity and noise\ndistribution, preventing algorithms trained on MRIs from one scanner to\ngeneralize to data from other scanners successfully. We propose a method for\nimage normalization to solve this problem. MRI normalization is challenging\nbecause it requires both normalizing intensity values and mapping between the\nnoise distributions of different scanners. We utilize a cycle-consistent\ngenerative adversarial network to learn a bidirectional mapping between MRIs\nproduced by GE Healthcare and Siemens scanners. This allows us learning the\nmapping between two different scanner types without matched data, which is not\ncommonly available. To ensure the preservation of breast shape and structures\nwithin the breast, we propose two technical innovations. First, we incorporate\na mutual information loss with the CycleGAN architecture to ensure that the\nstructure of the breast is maintained. Second, we propose a modified\ndiscriminator architecture which utilizes a smaller field-of-view to ensure the\npreservation of finer details in the breast tissue. Quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations show that the second proposed method was able to\nconsistently preserve a high level of detail in the breast structure while also\nperforming the proper intensity normalization and noise mapping. Our results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model can successfully learn a bidirectional\nmapping between MRIs produced by different vendors, potentially enabling\nimproved accuracy of downstream computational algorithms for diagnosis and\ndetection of breast cancer.

How\nto query zero-streaming cameras efficiently? Our response is a camera/cloud\nruntime system called DIVA. It addresses two key challenges: to best use\nlimited camera resource during video capture; to rapidly explore massive videos\nduring query execution. DIVA contributes two unconventional techniques. (1)\nWhen capturing videos, a camera builds sparse yet accurate landmark frames,\nfrom which it learns reliable knowledge for accelerating future queries. (2)\nWhen executing a query, a camera processes frames in multiple passes with\nincreasingly more expensive operators. As such, DIVA presents and keeps\nrefining inexact query results throughout the query's execution. On diverse\nqueries over 15 videos lasting 720 hours in total, DIVA runs at more than 100x\nvideo realtime and outperforms competitive alternative designs.

We find that non-negative concept activation vectors (NCAVs) from\nnon-negative matrix factorization provide superior performance in\ninterpretability and fidelity based on computational and human subject\nexperiments. Our framework provides both local and global concept-level\nexplanations for pre-trained CNN models.",

Our method successively learns an agnostic\nforeground segmentation followed by a distinction between manipulator and\nobject solely by observing the motion between consecutive RGB frames. In\ncontrast to previous approaches, we propose a single, end-to-end trainable\narchitecture which jointly incorporates motion cues and semantic knowledge.\nFurthermore, while the motion of the manipulator and the object are substantial\ncues for our algorithm, we present means to robustly deal with distraction\nobjects moving in the background, as well as with completely static scenes. Our\nmethod neither depends on any visual registration of a kinematic robot or 3D\nobject models, nor on precise hand-eye calibration or any additional sensor\ndata. By extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate the superiority of\nour framework and provide detailed insights on its capability of dealing with\nthe aforementioned extreme cases of motion. We also show that training a\nsemantic segmentation network with the automatically labeled data achieves\nresults on par with manually annotated training data.

          "description": "Understanding the semantics of human movement -- the what, how and why of the\nmovement -- is an important problem that requires datasets of human actions\nwith semantic labels. Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale\nvideo datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D\nhuman motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body\nmotions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we\npresent BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions\nbeing performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about\n43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of\nabstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and\nframe labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame\nlabel is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the\nmocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence\nlabels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action\ncategories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action\nrecognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To\ndemonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of\nmodels on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting\nlearning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve\nas a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition. The dataset,\nbaseline method, and evaluation code is made available, and supported for\nacademic research purposes at https://babel.is.tue.mpg.de/.",

          "description": "Predicting all applicable labels for a given image is known as multi-label\nclassification. Compared to the standard multi-class case (where each image has\nonly one label), it is considerably more challenging to annotate training data\nfor multi-label classification. When the number of potential labels is large,\nhuman annotators find it difficult to mention all applicable labels for each\ntraining image. Furthermore, in some settings detection is intrinsically\ndifficult e.g. finding small object instances in high resolution images. As a\nresult, multi-label training data is often plagued by false negatives. We\nconsider the hardest version of this problem, where annotators provide only one\nrelevant label for each image. As a result, training sets will have only one\npositive label per image and no confirmed negatives. We explore this special\ncase of learning from missing labels across four different multi-label image\nclassification datasets for both linear classifiers and end-to-end fine-tuned\ndeep networks. We extend existing multi-label losses to this setting and\npropose novel variants that constrain the number of expected positive labels\nduring training.

          "description": "Over the past several years, we have witnessed impressive progress in the\nfield of learned image compression. Recent learned image codecs are commonly\nbased on autoencoders, that first encode an image into low-dimensional latent\nrepresentations and then decode them for reconstruction purposes. To capture\nspatial dependencies in the latent space, prior works exploit hyperprior and\nspatial context model to build an entropy model, which estimates the bit-rate\nfor end-to-end rate-distortion optimization. However, such an entropy model is\nsuboptimal from two aspects: (1) It fails to capture spatially global\ncorrelations among the latents. (2) Cross-channel relationships of the latents\nare still underexplored. In this paper, we propose the concept of separate\nentropy coding to leverage a serial decoding process for causal contextual\nentropy prediction in the latent space. A causal context model is proposed that\nseparates the latents across channels and makes use of cross-channel\nrelationships to generate highly informative contexts. Furthermore, we propose\na causal global prediction model, which is able to find global reference points\nfor accurate predictions of unknown points. Both these two models facilitate\nentropy estimation without the transmission of overhead. In addition, we\nfurther adopt a new separate attention module to build more powerful transform\nnetworks. Experimental results demonstrate that our full image compression\nmodel outperforms standard VVC/H.266 codec on Kodak dataset in terms of both\nPSNR and MS-SSIM, yielding the state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance.",

          "description": "Dexterous robotic hands are appealing for their agility and human-like\nmorphology, yet their high degree of freedom makes learning to manipulate\nchallenging. We introduce an approach for learning dexterous grasping. Our key\nidea is to embed an object-centric visual affordance model within a deep\nreinforcement learning loop to learn grasping policies that favor the same\nobject regions favored by people. Unlike traditional approaches that learn from\nhuman demonstration trajectories (e.g., hand joint sequences captured with a\nglove), the proposed prior is object-centric and image-based, allowing the\nagent to anticipate useful affordance regions for objects unseen during policy\nlearning. We demonstrate our idea with a 30-DoF five-fingered robotic hand\nsimulator on 40 objects from two datasets, where it successfully and\nefficiently learns policies for stable functional grasps. Our affordance-guided\npolicies are significantly more effective, generalize better to novel objects,\ntrain 3 X faster than the baselines, and are more robust to noisy sensor\nreadings and actuation. Our work offers a step towards manipulation agents that\nlearn by watching how people use objects, without requiring state and action\ninformation about the human body.

This inspires us to use a sparse\nset of LF captures to render high-quality novel views globally. However, fusion\nof LF captures from multiple angles is challenging due to the scale\ninconsistency caused by various capture settings. To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose a novel scale-consistent volume rescaling algorithm that robustly\naligns the disparity probability volumes (DPV) among different captures for\nscale-consistent global geometry fusion. Based on the fused DPV projected to\nthe target camera frustum, novel learning-based modules have been proposed\n(i.e., the attention-guided multi-scale residual fusion module, and the\ndisparity field guided deep re-regularization module) which comprehensively\nregularize noisy observations from heterogeneous captures for high-quality\nrendering of novel LFIs. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments over the\nStanford Lytro Multi-view LF dataset show that the proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods significantly under different experiment settings for\ndisparity inference and LF synthesis.",

Fast and accurate segmentation\non the organ in these images is crucial to planning and fusion with other\nmodalities such as magnetic resonance images (MRIs) .

          "description": "Instance segmentation has witnessed a remarkable progress on class-balanced\nbenchmarks. However, they fail to perform as accurately in real-world\nscenarios, where the category distribution of objects naturally comes with a\nlong tail. Instances of head classes dominate a long-tailed dataset and they\nserve as negative samples of tail categories. The overwhelming gradients of\nnegative samples on tail classes lead to a biased learning process for\nclassifiers. Consequently, objects of tail categories are more likely to be\nmisclassified as backgrounds or head categories. To tackle this problem, we\npropose Seesaw Loss to dynamically re-balance gradients of positive and\nnegative samples for each category, with two complementary factors, i.e.,\nmitigation factor and compensation factor. The mitigation factor reduces\npunishments to tail categories w.r.t. the ratio of cumulative training\ninstances between different categories. Meanwhile, the compensation factor\nincreases the penalty of misclassified instances to avoid false positives of\ntail categories. We conduct extensive experiments on Seesaw Loss with\nmainstream frameworks and different data sampling strategies. With a simple\nend-to-end training pipeline, Seesaw Loss obtains significant gains over\nCross-Entropy Loss, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on LVIS dataset\nwithout bells and whistles.

          "description": "Classical machine learning frameworks assume access to a possibly large\ndataset in order to train a predictive model. In many practical applications\nhowever, data does not arrive all at once, but in batches over time. This\ncreates a natural trade-off between accuracy of a model and time to obtain such\na model. A greedy predictor could produce non-trivial predictions by\nimmediately training on batches as soon as these become available but, it may\nalso make sub-optimal use of future data. On the other hand, a tardy predictor\ncould wait for a long time to aggregate several batches into a larger dataset,\nbut ultimately deliver a much better performance. In this work, we consider\nsuch a streaming learning setting, which we dub {\\em anytime learning at\nmacroscale} (ALMA). It is an instance of anytime learning applied not at the\nlevel of a single chunk of data, but at the level of the entire sequence of\nlarge batches. We first formalize this learning setting, we then introduce\nmetrics to assess how well learners perform on the given task for a given\nmemory and compute budget, and finally we test several baseline approaches on\nstandard benchmarks repurposed for anytime learning at macroscale. The general\nfinding is that bigger models always generalize better. In particular, it is\nimportant to grow model capacity over time if the initial model is relatively\nsmall. Moreover, updating the model at an intermediate rate strikes the best\ntrade off between accuracy and time to obtain a useful predictor.",

          "description": "Adversarial training is the de facto most promising defense against\nadversarial examples. Yet, its passive nature inevitably prevents it from being\nimmune to unknown attackers. To achieve a proactive defense, we need a more\nfundamental understanding of adversarial examples, beyond the popular bounded\nthreat model. In this paper, we provide a causal viewpoint of adversarial\nvulnerability: the cause is the confounder ubiquitously existing in learning,\nwhere attackers are precisely exploiting the confounding effect. Therefore, a\nfundamental solution for adversarial robustness is causal intervention. As the\nconfounder is unobserved in general, we propose to use the instrumental\nvariable that achieves intervention without the need for confounder\nobservation. We term our robust training method as Causal intervention by\ninstrumental Variable (CiiV). It has a differentiable retinotopic sampling\nlayer and a consistency loss, which is stable and guaranteed not to suffer from\ngradient obfuscation. Extensive experiments on a wide spectrum of attackers and\nsettings applied in MNIST, CIFAR-10, and mini-ImageNet datasets empirically\ndemonstrate that CiiV is robust to adaptive attacks.",

          "description": "3D face reconstruction from a single image is challenging due to its\nill-posed nature. Model-based face autoencoders address this issue effectively\nby fitting a face model to the target image in a weakly supervised manner.\nHowever, in unconstrained environments occlusions distort the face\nreconstruction because the model often erroneously tries to adapt to occluded\nface regions. Supervised occlusion segmentation is a viable solution to avoid\nthe fitting of occluded face regions, but it requires a large amount of\nannotated training data. In this work, we enable model-based face autoencoders\nto segment occluders accurately without requiring any additional supervision\nduring training, and this separates regions where the model will be fitted from\nthose where it will not be fitted. To achieve this, we extend face autoencoders\nwith a segmentation network. The segmentation network decides which regions the\nmodel should adapt to by reaching balances in a trade-off between including\npixels and adapting the model to them, and excluding pixels so that the model\nfitting is not negatively affected and reaches higher overall reconstruction\naccuracy on pixels showing the face. This leads to a synergistic effect, in\nwhich the occlusion segmentation guides the training of the face autoencoder to\nconstrain the fitting in the non-occluded regions, while the improved fitting\nenables the segmentation model to better predict the occluded face regions.\nQualitative and quantitative experiments on the CelebA-HQ database and the AR\ndatabase verify the effectiveness of our model in improving 3D face\nreconstruction under occlusions and in enabling accurate occlusion segmentation\nfrom weak supervision only.

          "description": "Deep networks have been progressively adapted to new sensor modalities,\nnamely to 3D LiDAR, which led to unprecedented achievements in autonomous\nvehicle-related applications such as place recognition. One of the main\nchallenges of deep models in place recognition is to extract efficient and\ndescriptive feature representations that relate places based on their\nsimilarity. To address the problem of place recognition using LiDAR data, this\npaper proposes a novel 3D LiDAR-based deep learning network (named AttDLNet)\nthat comprises an encoder network and exploits an attention mechanism to\nselectively focus on long-range context and interfeature relationships. The\nproposed network is trained and validated on the KITTI dataset, using the\ncosine loss for training and a retrieval-based place recognition pipeline for\nvalidation. Additionally, an ablation study is presented to assess the best\nnetwork configuration. Results show that the encoder network features are\nalready very descriptive, but adding attention to the network further improves\nperformance. From the ablation study, results indicate that the middle encoder\nlayers have the highest mean performance, while deeper layers are more robust\nto orientation change.

Inevitably, an independent stream is introduced to extract features\nfrom depth images, leading to extra computation and parameters. This\nmethodology which sacrifices the model size to improve the detection accuracy\nmay impede the practical application of SOD problems.

          "description": "The joint use of multiple imaging modalities for medical image segmentation\nhas been widely studied in recent years. The fusion of information from\ndifferent modalities has demonstrated to improve the segmentation accuracy,\nwith respect to mono-modal segmentations, in several applications. However,\nacquiring multiple modalities is usually not possible in a clinical setting due\nto a limited number of physicians and scanners, and to limit costs and scan\ntime. Most of the time, only one modality is acquired. In this paper, we\npropose KD-Net, a framework to transfer knowledge from a trained multi-modal\nnetwork (teacher) to a mono-modal one (student). The proposed method is an\nadaptation of the generalized distillation framework where the student network\nis trained on a subset (1 modality) of the teacher's inputs (n modalities). We\nillustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in brain tumor\nsegmentation with the BraTS 2018 dataset. Using different architectures, we\nshow that the student network effectively learns from the teacher and always\noutperforms the baseline mono-modal network in terms of segmentation accuracy.",

          "description": "The task of unsupervised motion retargeting in videos has seen substantial\nadvancements through the use of deep neural networks. While early works\nconcentrated on specific object priors such as a human face or body, recent\nwork considered the unsupervised case. When the source and target videos,\nhowever, are of different shapes, current methods fail. To alleviate this\nproblem, we introduce JOKR - a JOint Keypoint Representation that captures the\nmotion common to both the source and target videos, without requiring any\nobject prior or data collection. By employing a domain confusion term, we\nenforce the unsupervised keypoint representations of both videos to be\nindistinguishable. This encourages disentanglement between the parts of the\nmotion that are common to the two domains, and their distinctive appearance and\nmotion, enabling the generation of videos that capture the motion of the one\nwhile depicting the style of the other. To enable cases where the objects are\nof different proportions or orientations, we apply a learned affine\ntransformation between the JOKRs. This augments the representation to be affine\ninvariant, and in practice broadens the variety of possible retargeting pairs.\nThis geometry-driven representation enables further intuitive control, such as\ntemporal coherence and manual editing. Through comprehensive experimentation,\nwe demonstrate the applicability of our method to different challenging\ncross-domain video pairs. We evaluate our method both qualitatively and\nquantitatively, and demonstrate that our method handles various cross-domain\nscenarios, such as different animals, different flowers, and humans. We also\ndemonstrate superior temporal coherency and visual quality compared to\nstate-of-the-art alternatives, through statistical metrics and a user study.\nSource code and videos can be found at https://rmokady.github.io/JOKR/ .",

          "description": "Age estimation is an essential challenge in computer vision. With the\nadvances of convolutional neural networks, the performance of age estimation\nhas been dramatically improved. Existing approaches usually treat age\nestimation as a classification problem. However, the age labels are ambiguous,\nthus make the classification task difficult. In this paper, we propose a simple\nyet effective approach for age estimation, which improves the performance\ncompared to classification-based methods. The method combines four\nclassification losses and one regression loss representing different class\ngranularities together, and we name it as Age-Granularity-Net. We validate the\nAge-Granularity-Net framework on the CVPR Chalearn 2016 dataset, and extensive\nexperiments show that the proposed approach can reduce the prediction error\ncompared to any individual loss.

          "description": "Modern neural networks are highly uncalibrated. It poses a significant\nchallenge for safety-critical systems to utilise deep neural networks (DNNs),\nreliably. Many recently proposed approaches have demonstrated substantial\nprogress in improving DNN calibration. However, they hardly touch upon\nrefinement, which historically has been an essential aspect of calibration.\nRefinement indicates separability of a network's correct and incorrect\npredictions. This paper presents a theoretically and empirically supported\nexposition for reviewing a model's calibration and refinement. Firstly, we show\nthe breakdown of expected calibration error (ECE), into predicted confidence\nand refinement. Connecting with this result, we highlight that regularisation\nbased calibration only focuses on naively reducing a model's confidence. This\nlogically has a severe downside to a model's refinement. We support our claims\nthrough rigorous empirical evaluations of many state of the art calibration\napproaches on standard datasets. We find that many calibration approaches with\nthe likes of label smoothing, mixup etc. lower the utility of a DNN by\ndegrading its refinement. Even under natural data shift, this\ncalibration-refinement trade-off holds for the majority of calibration methods.\nThese findings call for an urgent retrospective into some popular pathways\ntaken for modern DNN calibration.",

          "description": "For a target task where labeled data is unavailable, domain adaptation can\ntransfer a learner from a different source domain. Previous deep domain\nadaptation methods mainly learn a global domain shift, i.e., align the global\nsource and target distributions without considering the relationships between\ntwo subdomains within the same category of different domains, leading to\nunsatisfying transfer learning performance without capturing the fine-grained\ninformation. Recently, more and more researchers pay attention to Subdomain\nAdaptation which focuses on accurately aligning the distributions of the\nrelevant subdomains. However, most of them are adversarial methods which\ncontain several loss functions and converge slowly. Based on this, we present\nDeep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) which learns a transfer network by\naligning the relevant subdomain distributions of domain-specific layer\nactivations across different domains based on a local maximum mean discrepancy\n(LMMD). Our DSAN is very simple but effective which does not need adversarial\ntraining and converges fast. The adaptation can be achieved easily with most\nfeed-forward network models by extending them with LMMD loss, which can be\ntrained efficiently via back-propagation. Experiments demonstrate that DSAN can\nachieve remarkable results on both object recognition tasks and digit\nclassification tasks.

However, most of these attacks fail to encompass a large spectrum of\nadversarial perturbations that are imperceptible to humans. In this paper, we\npresent localized uncertainty attacks, a novel class of threat models against\ndeterministic and stochastic classifiers. Under this threat model, we create\nadversarial examples by perturbing only regions in the inputs where a\nclassifier is uncertain. To find such regions, we utilize the predictive\nuncertainty of the classifier when the classifier is stochastic or, we learn a\nsurrogate model to amortize the uncertainty when it is deterministic. Unlike\n$\\ell_p$ ball or functional attacks which perturb inputs indiscriminately, our\ntargeted changes can be less perceptible.

          "description": "The success of deep learning heavily depends on the availability of large\nlabeled training sets. However, it is hard to get large labeled datasets in\nmedical image domain because of the strict privacy concern and costly labeling\nefforts. Contrastive learning, an unsupervised learning technique, has been\nproved powerful in learning image-level representations from unlabeled data.\nThe learned encoder can then be transferred or fine-tuned to improve the\nperformance of downstream tasks with limited labels. A critical step in\ncontrastive learning is the generation of contrastive data pairs, which is\nrelatively simple for natural image classification but quite challenging for\nmedical image segmentation due to the existence of the same tissue or organ\nacross the dataset. As a result, when applied to medical image segmentation,\nmost state-of-the-art contrastive learning frameworks inevitably introduce a\nlot of false-negative pairs and result in degraded segmentation quality. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel positional contrastive learning (PCL)\nframework to generate contrastive data pairs by leveraging the position\ninformation in volumetric medical images. Experimental results on CT and MRI\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed PCL method can substantially improve the\nsegmentation performance compared to existing methods in both semi-supervised\nsetting and transfer learning setting.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have enormous representational power which leads them to\noverfit on most datasets. Thus, regularizing them is important in order to\nreduce overfitting and enhance their generalization capabilities. Recently,\nchannel shuffle operation has been introduced for mixing channels in group\nconvolutions in resource efficient networks in order to reduce memory and\ncomputations. This paper studies the operation of channel shuffle as a\nregularization technique in deep convolutional networks. We show that while\nrandom shuffling of channels during training drastically reduce their\nperformance, however, randomly shuffling small patches between channels\nsignificantly improves their performance. The patches to be shuffled are picked\nfrom the same spatial locations in the feature maps such that a patch, when\ntransferred from one channel to another, acts as structured noise for the later\nchannel. We call this method \"ShuffleBlock\". The proposed ShuffleBlock module\nis easy to implement and improves the performance of several baseline networks\non the task of image classification on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. It also\nachieves comparable and in many cases better performance than many other\nregularization methods. We provide several ablation studies on selecting\nvarious hyperparameters of the ShuffleBlock module and propose a new scheduling\nmethod that further enhances its performance.",

In the\nfield of stereoscopic vision, the information is fairly distributed between the\nleft and right views as well as the binocular phenomenon. In this work, we\npropose to integrate these characteristics to estimate the quality of\nstereoscopic images without reference through a convolutional neural network.\nOur method is based on two main tasks: the first task predicts naturalness\nanalysis based features adapted to stereo images, while the second task\npredicts the quality of such images. The former, so-called auxiliary task, aims\nto find more robust and relevant features to improve the quality prediction. To\ndo this, we compute naturalness-based features using a Natural Scene Statistics\n(NSS) model in the complex wavelet domain. It allows to capture the statistical\ndependency between pairs of the stereoscopic images. Experiments are conducted\non the well known LIVE PHASE I and LIVE PHASE II databases.

To\nmitigate these problems, in this project, we present a framework that is\ncapable of controllable, confidence-based noise removal. The framework is based\non the fusion between two different denoised images, both derived from the same\nnoisy input. One of the two is denoised using generic algorithms (e.g.\nGaussian), which make few assumptions on the input images, therefore,\ngeneralize in all scenarios. The other is denoised using deep learning,\nperforming well on seen datasets. We introduce a set of techniques to fuse the\ntwo components smoothly in the frequency domain. Beyond that, we estimate the\nconfidence of a deep learning denoiser to allow users to interpret the output,\nand provide a fusion strategy that safeguards them against out-of-distribution\ninputs.

While modern devices exhibit a high level of parallelism,\nreal-time latency is still highly dependent on networks' depth. Although recent\nworks show that below a certain depth, the width of shallower networks must\ngrow exponentially, we presume that neural networks typically exceed this\nminimal depth to accelerate convergence and incrementally increase accuracy.\nThis motivates us to transform pre-trained deep networks that already exploit\nsuch advantages into shallower forms. We propose a method that learns whether\nnon-linear activations can be removed, allowing to fold consecutive linear\nlayers into one. We apply our method to networks pre-trained on CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100 and find that they can all be transformed into shallower forms that\nshare a similar depth. Finally, we use our method to provide more efficient\nalternatives to MobileNetV2 and EfficientNet-Lite architectures on the ImageNet\nclassification task.",

          "description": "In Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, perception is both security and safety\ncritical. Despite various prior studies on its security issues, all of them\nonly consider attacks on camera- or LiDAR-based AD perception alone. However,\nproduction AD systems today predominantly adopt a Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF)\nbased design, which in principle can be more robust against these attacks under\nthe assumption that not all fusion sources are (or can be) attacked at the same\ntime. In this paper, we present the first study of security issues of MSF-based\nperception in AD systems. We directly challenge the basic MSF design assumption\nabove by exploring the possibility of attacking all fusion sources\nsimultaneously. This allows us for the first time to understand how much\nsecurity guarantee MSF can fundamentally provide as a general defense strategy\nfor AD perception.\n\nWe formulate the attack as an optimization problem to generate a\nphysically-realizable, adversarial 3D-printed object that misleads an AD system\nto fail in detecting it and thus crash into it. We propose a novel attack\npipeline that addresses two main design challenges: (1) non-differentiable\ntarget camera and LiDAR sensing systems, and (2) non-differentiable cell-level\naggregated features popularly used in LiDAR-based AD perception. We evaluate\nour attack on MSF included in representative open-source industry-grade AD\nsystems in real-world driving scenarios. Our results show that the attack\nachieves over 90% success rate across different object types and MSF. Our\nattack is also found stealthy, robust to victim positions, transferable across\nMSF algorithms, and physical-world realizable after being 3D-printed and\ncaptured by LiDAR and camera devices. To concretely assess the end-to-end\nsafety impact, we further perform simulation evaluation and show that it can\ncause a 100% vehicle collision rate for an industry-grade AD system.",

High-quality DVF\ntraining data is created by employing hyper-parameter optimization on the\nsubset of the training data with DICE coefficient and mutual information\nmetric. We validated our model on two radiotherapy datasets: a publicly\navailable head-and-neck dataset (28 patients with manually contoured pre-,\nmid-, and post-treatment CTs), and an internal non-small cell lung cancer\ndataset (63 patients with manually contoured planning CT and 6 weekly CBCTs).\nResults: The use of DVF representation and skip connections overcomes the\nblurring issue of ConvLSTM prediction with the traditional image\nrepresentation.

Whether based on recurrent or feed-forward neural networks,\nexisting learning based methods fail to model the observation that human motion\ntends to repeat itself, even for complex sports actions and cooking activities.\nHere, we introduce an attention based feed-forward network that explicitly\nleverages this observation. In particular, instead of modeling frame-wise\nattention via pose similarity, we propose to extract motion attention to\ncapture the similarity between the current motion context and the historical\nmotion sub-sequences. In this context, we study the use of different types of\nattention, computed at joint, body part, and full pose levels. Aggregating the\nrelevant past motions and processing the result with a graph convolutional\nnetwork allows us to effectively exploit motion patterns from the long-term\nhistory to predict the future poses. Our experiments on Human3.6M, AMASS and\n3DPW validate the benefits of our approach for both periodical and\nnon-periodical actions. Thanks to our attention model, it yields\nstate-of-the-art results on all three datasets. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/wei-mao-2019/HisRepItself.",

          "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that influences\nthe communication and social behavior of a person in a way that those in the\nspectrum have difficulty in perceiving other people's facial expressions, as\nwell as presenting and communicating emotions and affect via their own faces\nand bodies. Some efforts have been made to predict and improve children with\nASD's affect states in play therapy, a common method to improve children's\nsocial skills via play and games. However, many previous works only used\npre-trained models on benchmark emotion datasets and failed to consider the\ndistinction in emotion between typically developing children and children with\nautism. In this paper, we present an open-source two-stage multi-modal approach\nleveraging acoustic and visual cues to predict three main affect states of\nchildren with ASD's affect states (positive, negative, and neutral) in\nreal-world play therapy scenarios, and achieved an overall accuracy of 72:40%.\nThis work presents a novel way to combine human expertise and machine\nintelligence for ASD affect recognition by proposing a two-stage schema.",

          "description": "Unsupervised image-to-image translation methods such as CycleGAN learn to\nconvert images from one domain to another using unpaired training data sets\nfrom different domains. Unfortunately, these approaches still require centrally\ncollected unpaired records, potentially violating privacy and security issues.\nAlthough the recent federated learning (FL) allows a neural network to be\ntrained without data exchange, the basic assumption of the FL is that all\nclients have their own training data from a similar domain, which is different\nfrom our image-to-image translation scenario in which each client has images\nfrom its unique domain and the goal is to learn image translation between\ndifferent domains without accessing the target domain data. To address this,\nhere we propose a novel federated CycleGAN architecture that can learn image\ntranslation in an unsupervised manner while maintaining the data privacy.\nSpecifically, our approach arises from a novel observation that CycleGAN loss\ncan be decomposed into the sum of client specific local objectives that can be\nevaluated using only their data. This local objective decomposition allows\nmultiple clients to participate in federated CycleGAN training without\nsacrificing performance. Furthermore, our method employs novel switchable\ngenerator and discriminator architecture using Adaptive Instance Normalization\n(AdaIN) that significantly reduces the band-width requirement of the federated\nlearning.

The\ncommon pipeline for segmentation comprises regions of interest detection stage\nand segmentation stage, which are independent of each other and typically\nperformed using separate deep learning networks. The performance of the\nsegmentation stage highly relies on the extracted set of spatial features and\nthe receptive fields. In this work, we propose an end-to-end network, called\nTrilateral Attention Network (TaNet), for real-time detection and segmentation\nin medical images. TaNet has a module for region localization, and three\nsegmentation pathways: 1) handcrafted pathway with hand-designed convolutional\nkernels, 2) detail pathway with regular convolutional kernels, and 3) a global\npathway to enlarge the receptive field. The first two pathways encode rich\nhandcrafted and low-level features extracted by hand-designed and regular\nkernels while the global pathway encodes high-level context information. By\njointly training the network for localization and segmentation using different\nsets of features, TaNet achieved superior performance, in terms of accuracy and\nspeed, when evaluated on an echocardiography dataset for cardiac segmentation.\nThe code and models will be made publicly available in TaNet Github page.",

          "description": "Enforcing orthogonality in neural networks is an antidote for gradient\nvanishing/exploding problems, sensitivity by adversarial perturbation, and\nbounding generalization errors. However, many previous approaches are\nheuristic, and the orthogonality of convolutional layers is not systematically\nstudied: some of these designs are not exactly orthogonal, while others only\nconsider standard convolutional layers and propose specific classes of their\nrealizations. To address this problem, we propose a theoretical framework for\northogonal convolutional layers, which establishes the equivalence between\nvarious orthogonal convolutional layers in the spatial domain and the\nparaunitary systems in the spectral domain. Since there exists a complete\nspectral factorization of paraunitary systems, any orthogonal convolution layer\ncan be parameterized as convolutions of spatial filters. Our framework endows\nhigh expressive power to various convolutional layers while maintaining their\nexact orthogonality. Furthermore, our layers are memory and computationally\nefficient for deep networks compared to previous designs. Our versatile\nframework, for the first time, enables the study of architecture designs for\ndeep orthogonal networks, such as choices of skip connection, initialization,\nstride, and dilation. Consequently, we scale up orthogonal networks to deep\narchitectures, including ResNet, WideResNet, and ShuffleNet, substantially\nincreasing the performance over the traditional shallow orthogonal networks.",

          "description": "Video transformers have recently emerged as a competitive alternative to 3D\nCNNs for video understanding. However, due to their large number of parameters\nand reduced inductive biases, these models require supervised pretraining on\nlarge-scale image datasets to achieve top performance. In this paper, we\nempirically demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining of video transformers\non video-only datasets can lead to action recognition results that are on par\nor better than those obtained with supervised pretraining on large-scale image\ndatasets, even massive ones such as ImageNet-21K. Since transformer-based\nmodels are effective at capturing dependencies over extended temporal spans, we\npropose a simple learning procedure that forces the model to match a long-term\nview to a short-term view of the same video. Our approach, named Long-Short\nTemporal Contrastive Learning (LSTCL), enables video transformers to learn an\neffective clip-level representation by predicting temporal context captured\nfrom a longer temporal extent. To demonstrate the generality of our findings,\nwe implement and validate our approach under three different self-supervised\ncontrastive learning frameworks (MoCo v3, BYOL, SimSiam) using two distinct\nvideo-transformer architectures, including an improved variant of the Swin\nTransformer augmented with space-time attention.

          "description": "Fetoscopy laser photocoagulation is a widely used procedure for the treatment\nof Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS), that occur in mono-chorionic\nmultiple pregnancies due to placental vascular anastomoses. This procedure is\nparticularly challenging due to limited field of view, poor manoeuvrability of\nthe fetoscope, poor visibility due to fluid turbidity, variability in light\nsource, and unusual position of the placenta. This may lead to increased\nprocedural time and incomplete ablation, resulting in persistent TTTS.\nComputer-assisted intervention may help overcome these challenges by expanding\nthe fetoscopic field of view through video mosaicking and providing better\nvisualization of the vessel network. However, the research and development in\nthis domain remain limited due to unavailability of high-quality data to encode\nthe intra- and inter-procedure variability. Through the \\textit{Fetoscopic\nPlacental Vessel Segmentation and Registration (FetReg)} challenge, we present\na large-scale multi-centre dataset for the development of generalized and\nrobust semantic segmentation and video mosaicking algorithms for the fetal\nenvironment with a focus on creating drift-free mosaics from long duration\nfetoscopy videos. In this paper, we provide an overview of the FetReg dataset,\nchallenge tasks, evaluation metrics and baseline methods for both segmentation\nand registration. Baseline methods results on the FetReg dataset shows that our\ndataset poses interesting challenges, offering large opportunity for the\ncreation of novel methods and models through a community effort initiative\nguided by the FetReg challenge.",

In this paper, we define a new problem, Network Space Search\n(NSS), as searching for favorable network spaces instead of a single\narchitecture. We propose an NSS method to directly search for efficient-aware\nnetwork spaces automatically, reducing the manual effort and immense cost in\ndiscovering satisfactory ones. The resultant network spaces, named Elite\nSpaces, are discovered from Expanded Search Space with minimal human expertise\nimposed. The Pareto-efficient Elite Spaces are aligned with the Pareto front\nunder various complexity constraints and can be further served as NAS search\nspaces, benefiting differentiable NAS approaches (e.g. In CIFAR-100, an\naveragely 2.3% lower error rate and 3.7% closer to target constraint than the\nbaseline with around 90% fewer samples required to find satisfactory networks).\nMoreover, our NSS approach is capable of searching for superior spaces in\nfuture unexplored spaces, revealing great potential in searching for network\nspaces automatically.

We present an\nunsupervised GAN-based model to recover 3D human pose from 2D joint locations\nextracted from a single image. Our model uses a GAN to learn the mapping of\ndistribution from 2D poses to 3D poses, not the simple 2D-3D correspondence.\nConsidering the reprojection constraint, our model can estimate the camera so\nthat we can reproject the estimated 3D pose to the original 2D pose. Based on\nthis reprojection method, we can rotate and reproject the generated pose to get\nour \"new\" 2D pose and then use a weight sharing generator to estimate the \"new\"\n3D pose and a \"new\" camera. Through the above estimation process, we can define\nthe single-view-multi-angle consistency loss during training to simulate\nmulti-view consistency, which means the 3D poses and cameras estimated from two\nangles of a single view should be able to be mixed to generate rich 2D\nreprojections, and the 2D reprojections reprojected from the same 3D pose\nshould be consistent. The experimental results on Human3.6M show that our\nmethod outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods, and results on\nMPI-INF-3DHP show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art by approximately\n15.0%.",

A persistent challenge has been to\ngenerate diverse versions of output images from the same input image, due to\nthe problem of mode collapse: because only one ground truth output image is\ngiven per input image, only one mode of the conditional distribution is\nmodelled. In this paper, we focus on this problem of multimodal conditional\nimage synthesis and build on the recently proposed technique of Implicit\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE). Prior IMLE-based methods required\ndifferent architectures for different tasks, which limit their applicability,\nand were lacking in fine details in the generated images. We propose CAM-Net, a\nunified architecture that can be applied to a broad range of tasks.\nAdditionally, it is capable of generating convincing high frequency details,\nachieving a reduction of the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by up to 45.3%\ncompared to the baseline.",

Our analyses and results show that the\noccurrence and values of facial AU1 and AU4, and Arousal are heightened when\nparticipants fail to use explanations effectively.

Morphed images have\nexposed face recognition systems' susceptibility to false acceptance, resulting\nin dire consequences, especially for national security applications. To detect\nmorphing attacks, we propose a method which is based on a discriminative 2D\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform (2D-DWT). A discriminative wavelet sub-band can\nhighlight inconsistencies between a real and a morphed image. We observe that\nthere is a salient discrepancy between the entropy of a given sub-band in a\nbona fide image, and the same sub-band's entropy in a morphed sample.\nConsidering this dissimilarity between these two entropy values, we find the\nKullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions, namely the entropy\nof the bona fide and the corresponding morphed images. The most discriminative\nwavelet sub-bands are those with the highest corresponding KL-divergence\nvalues. Accordingly, 22 sub-bands are selected as the most discriminative ones\nin terms of morph detection. We show that a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained\non the 22 discriminative sub-bands can detect morphed samples precisely. Most\nimportantly, the effectiveness of our algorithm is validated through\nexperiments on three datasets: VISAPP17, LMA, and MorGAN. We also performed an\nablation study on the sub-band selection.",

Theoretically, we first demonstrate that\nMTL shares the same optimization formulation with a class of gradient-based\nmeta-learning (GBML) algorithms. We then prove that for over-parameterized\nneural networks with sufficient depth, the learned predictive functions of MTL\nand GBML are close. In particular, this result implies that the predictions\ngiven by these two models are similar over the same unseen task. Empirically,\nwe corroborate our theoretical findings by showing that, with proper\nimplementation, MTL is competitive against state-of-the-art GBML algorithms on\na set of few-shot image classification benchmarks. Since existing GBML\nalgorithms often involve costly second-order bi-level optimization, our\nfirst-order MTL method is an order of magnitude faster on large-scale datasets\nsuch as mini-ImageNet. We believe this work could help bridge the gap between\nthese two learning paradigms, and provide a computationally efficient\nalternative to GBML that also supports fast task adaptation.",

The resulting\nfeature detector is tightly coupled with the feature descriptor, in contrast to\nclassical approaches (SIFT, etc.), where the detection phase precedes and\ndiffers from computing the descriptor. Our approach utilizes two CNN\nsubnetworks, the first being a Siamese CNN and the second, consisting of dual\nnon-weight-sharing CNNs. This allows simultaneous processing and fusion of the\njoint and disjoint cues in the multimodal image patches. The proposed approach\nis experimentally shown to outperform contemporary state-of-the-art schemes\nwhen applied to multiple datasets of multimodal images.

Generally, most methods\ndirectly use neural networks and ignore certain constraints (e.g., reprojection\nconstraints and joint angle and bone length constraints). This paper proposes a\nweakly supervised GAN-based model for 3D human pose estimation that considers\n3D information along with 2D information simultaneously, in which a\nreprojection network is employed to learn the mapping of the distribution from\n3D poses to 2D poses. In particular, we train the reprojection network and the\ngenerative adversarial network synchronously. Furthermore, inspired by the\ntypical kinematic chain space (KCS) matrix, we propose a weighted KCS matrix,\nwhich is added into the discriminator's input to impose joint angle and bone\nlength constraints.

          "description": "Although the adoption rate of deep neural networks (DNNs) has tremendously\nincreased in recent years, a solution for their vulnerability against\nadversarial examples has not yet been found. As a result, substantial research\nefforts are dedicated to fix this weakness, with many studies typically using a\nsubset of source images to generate adversarial examples, treating every image\nin this subset as equal. We demonstrate that, in fact, not every source image\nis equally suited for this kind of assessment. To do so, we devise a\nlarge-scale model-to-model transferability scenario for which we meticulously\nanalyze the properties of adversarial examples, generated from every suitable\nsource image in ImageNet by making use of two of the most frequently deployed\nattacks. In this transferability scenario, which involves seven distinct DNN\nmodels, including the recently proposed vision transformers, we reveal that it\nis possible to have a difference of up to $12.5\\%$ in model-to-model\ntransferability success, $1.01$ in average $L_2$ perturbation, and $0.03$\n($8/225$) in average $L_{\\infty}$ perturbation when $1,000$ source images are\nsampled randomly among all suitable candidates. We then take one of the first\nsteps in evaluating the robustness of images used to create adversarial\nexamples, proposing a number of simple but effective methods to identify\nunsuitable source images, thus making it possible to mitigate extreme cases in\nexperimentation and support high-quality benchmarking.",

However,\nstate-of-the-art models frequently show abrupt changes in the image appearance\nduring interpolation, and usually perform poorly in interpolations across\ndomains. In this paper, we propose a new training protocol based on three\nspecific losses which help a translation network to learn a smooth and\ndisentangled latent style space in which: 1) Both intra- and inter-domain\ninterpolations correspond to gradual changes in the generated images and 2) The\ncontent of the source image is better preserved during the translation.\nMoreover, we propose a novel evaluation metric to properly measure the\nsmoothness of latent style space of I2I translation models.

          "description": "Purpose: In current clinical practice, noisy and artifact-ridden weekly\ncone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images are only used for patient setup\nduring radiotherapy. Treatment planning is done once at the beginning of the\ntreatment using high-quality planning CT (pCT) images and manual contours for\norgans-at-risk (OARs) structures. If the quality of the weekly CBCT images can\nbe improved while simultaneously segmenting OAR structures, this can provide\ncritical information for adapting radiotherapy mid-treatment as well as for\nderiving biomarkers for treatment response. Methods: Using a novel\nphysics-based data augmentation strategy, we synthesize a large dataset of\nperfectly/inherently registered planning CT and synthetic-CBCT pairs for\nlocally advanced lung cancer patient cohort, which are then used in a multitask\n3D deep learning framework to simultaneously segment and translate real weekly\nCBCT images to high-quality planning CT-like images. Results: We compared the\nsynthetic CT and OAR segmentations generated by the model to real planning CT\nand manual OAR segmentations and showed promising results. The real week 1\n(baseline) CBCT images which had an average MAE of 162.77 HU compared to pCT\nimages are translated to synthetic CT images that exhibit a drastically\nimproved average MAE of 29.31 HU and average structural similarity of 92% with\nthe pCT images. The average DICE scores of the 3D organs-at-risk segmentations\nare: lungs 0.96, heart 0.88, spinal cord 0.83 and esophagus 0.66. Conclusions:\nWe demonstrate an approach to translate artifact-ridden CBCT images to high\nquality synthetic CT images while simultaneously generating good quality\nsegmentation masks for different organs-at-risk. This approach could allow\nclinicians to adjust treatment plans using only the routine low-quality CBCT\nimages, potentially improving patient outcomes.",

While the widespread use of surrogate\nexplainers is a welcome addition to inspect and understand black-box models,\nassessing the robustness and reliability of the explanations is key for their\nsuccess. Additionally, whilst existing work in the explainability field\nproposes various strategies to address this problem, the challenges of working\nwith data in the wild is often overlooked. For instance, in image\nclassification, distortions to images can not only affect the predictions\nassigned by the model, but also the explanation. Given a clean and a distorted\nversion of an image, even if the prediction probabilities are similar, the\nexplanation may still be different. In this paper we propose a methodology to\nevaluate the effect of distortions in explanations by embedding perceptual\ndistances that tailor the neighbourhoods used to training surrogate explainers.\nWe also show that by operating in this way, we can make the explanations more\nrobust to distortions. We generate explanations for images in the Imagenet-C\ndataset and demonstrate how using a perceptual distances in the surrogate\nexplainer creates more coherent explanations for the distorted and reference\nimages.",

While practitioners celebrate synthetic data\ngeneration using GANs as an economical way to augment data for training\ndata-hungry machine learning models, it is unclear whether they recognize the\nperils of such techniques when applied to real world datasets biased along\nlatent dimensions. Specifically, we show that (1) traditional GANs further skew\nthe distribution of a dataset consisting of engineering faculty headshots,\ngenerating minority modes less often and of worse quality and (2)\nimage-to-image translation (conditional) GANs also exacerbate biases by\nlightening skin color of non-white faces and transforming female facial\nfeatures to be masculine when generating faces of engineering professors.

However, as in\nmany machine learning settings, social biases can influence image captioning in\nundesirable ways. In this work, we study bias propagation pathways within image\ncaptioning, focusing specifically on the COCO dataset. Prior work has analyzed\ngender bias in captions using automatically-derived gender labels; here we\nexamine racial and intersectional biases using manual annotations. Our first\ncontribution is in annotating the perceived gender and skin color of 28,315 of\nthe depicted people after obtaining IRB approval. Using these annotations, we\ncompare racial biases present in both manual and automatically-generated image\ncaptions. We demonstrate differences in caption performance, sentiment, and\nword choice between images of lighter versus darker-skinned people. Further, we\nfind the magnitude of these differences to be greater in modern captioning\nsystems compared to older ones, thus leading to concerns that without proper\nconsideration and mitigation these differences will only become increasingly\nprevalent.

These affinity fields,\nalong with the binary masks, can then be used to cluster lane pixels\nhorizontally and vertically into corresponding lane instances in a\npost-processing step. This clustering is achieved through a simple row-by-row\ndecoding process with little overhead; such an approach allows LaneAF to detect\na variable number of lanes without assuming a fixed or maximum number of lanes.\nMoreover, this form of clustering is more interpretable in comparison to\nprevious visual clustering approaches, and can be analyzed to identify and\ncorrect sources of error. Qualitative and quantitative results obtained on\npopular lane detection datasets demonstrate the model's ability to detect and\ncluster lanes effectively and robustly.

          "description": "Previous studies have verified that the functionality of black-box models can\nbe stolen with full probability outputs. However, under the more practical\nhard-label setting, we observe that existing methods suffer from catastrophic\nperformance degradation. We argue this is due to the lack of rich information\nin the probability prediction and the overfitting caused by hard labels. To\nthis end, we propose a novel hard-label model stealing method termed\n\\emph{black-box dissector}, which consists of two erasing-based modules. One is\na CAM-driven erasing strategy that is designed to increase the information\ncapacity hidden in hard labels from the victim model. The other is a\nrandom-erasing-based self-knowledge distillation module that utilizes soft\nlabels from the substitute model to mitigate overfitting. Extensive experiments\non four widely-used datasets consistently demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, with an improvement of at most $8.27\\%$.\nWe also validate the effectiveness and practical potential of our method on\nreal-world APIs and defense methods.

          "description": "A driver's gaze is critical for determining their attention, state,\nsituational awareness, and readiness to take over control from partially\nautomated vehicles. Estimating the gaze direction is the most obvious way to\ngauge a driver's state under ideal conditions when limited to using\nnon-intrusive imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the vehicular environment\nintroduces a variety of challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh\nillumination, nighttime conditions, and reflective eyeglasses. Relying on head\npose alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable and erroneous. In\nthis study, we offer solutions to address these problems encountered in the\nreal world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate that using an\ninfrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization suffices. To\nhandle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we adopt image-to-image\ntranslation using generative adversarial networks to pre-process images prior\nto gaze estimation. Our proposed Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN) is\ntrained to preserve the driver's gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from\nface images. GPCycleGAN is based on the well-known CycleGAN approach - with the\naddition of a gaze classifier and a gaze consistency loss for additional\nsupervision.

Traditional\ntechniques address this challenge either by synthesizing frontal faces or by\npose invariant learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method with Lie\nalgebra theory to explore how face rotation in the 3D space affects the deep\nfeature generation process of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We prove\nthat face rotation in the image space is equivalent to an additive residual\ncomponent in the feature space of CNNs, which is determined solely by the\nrotation. Based on this theoretical finding, we further design a Lie Algebraic\nResidual Network (LARNet) for tackling pose robust face recognition. Our LARNet\nconsists of a residual subnet for decoding rotation information from input face\nimages, and a gating subnet to learn rotation magnitude for controlling the\nstrength of the residual component contributing to the feature learning\nprocess. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on both frontal-profile face\ndatasets and general face recognition datasets convincingly demonstrate that\nour method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.",

          "description": "Recent studies reveal that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose a threat to security-sensitive\napplications. Many adversarial defense methods improve robustness at the cost\nof accuracy, raising the contradiction between standard and adversarial\naccuracies. In this paper, we observe an interesting phenomenon that feature\nstatistics change monotonically and smoothly w.r.t the rising of attacking\nstrength. Based on this observation, we propose the adaptive feature alignment\n(AFA) to generate features of arbitrary attacking strengths. Our method is\ntrained to automatically align features of arbitrary attacking strength. This\nis done by predicting a fusing weight in a dual-BN architecture. Unlike\nprevious works that need to either retrain the model or manually tune a\nhyper-parameters for different attacking strengths, our method can deal with\narbitrary attacking strengths with a single model without introducing any\nhyper-parameter.

The World\nHealth Organization (WHO) has provided guidelines on how to reduce the spread\nof the virus and one of the most important measures is social distancing.\nMaintaining a minimum of one meter distance from other people is strongly\nsuggested to reduce the risk of infection. This has created a strong interest\nin monitoring the social distances either as a safety measure or to study how\nthe measures have affected human behavior and country-wise differences in this.\nThe need for automatic social distance estimation algorithms is evident, but\nthere is no suitable test benchmark for such algorithms. Collecting images with\nmeasured ground-truth pair-wise distances between all the people using\ndifferent camera settings is cumbersome. Furthermore, performance evaluation\nfor social distance estimation algorithms is not straightforward and there is\nno widely accepted evaluation protocol. In this paper, we provide a dataset of\nvarying images with measured pair-wise social distances under different camera\npositionings and focal length values. We suggest a performance evaluation\nprotocol and provide a benchmark to easily evaluate social distance estimation\nalgorithms. We also propose a method for automatic social distance estimation.\nOur method takes advantage of object detection and human pose estimation. It\ncan be applied on any single image as long as focal length and sensor size\ninformation are known. The results on our benchmark are encouraging with 92%\nhuman detection rate and only 28.9% average error in distance estimation among\nthe detected people.",

Many deep learning based methods have been developed\nin the past few years. However, since there are no intended HR MS images as\nreferences for learning, almost all of the existing methods down-sample the MS\nand PAN images and regard the original MS images as targets to form a\nsupervised setting for training. These methods may perform well on the\ndown-scaled images, however, they generalize poorly to the full-resolution\nimages. To conquer this problem, we design an unsupervised framework that is\nable to learn directly from the full-resolution images without any\npreprocessing. The model is built based on a novel generative multi-adversarial\nnetwork. We use a two-stream generator to extract the modality-specific\nfeatures from the PAN and MS images, respectively, and develop a\ndual-discriminator to preserve the spectral and spatial information of the\ninputs when performing fusion.

          "description": "Panoptic segmentation (PS) is a complex scene understanding task that\nrequires providing high-quality segmentation for both thing objects and stuff\nregions. Previous methods handle these two classes with semantic and instance\nsegmentation modules separately, following with heuristic fusion or additional\nmodules to resolve the conflicts between the two outputs. This work simplifies\nthis pipeline of PS by consistently modeling the two classes with a novel PS\nframework, which extends a detection model with an extra module to predict\ncategory- and instance-aware pixel embedding (CIAE). CIAE is a novel pixel-wise\nembedding feature that encodes both semantic-classification and\ninstance-distinction information. At the inference process, PS results are\nsimply derived by assigning each pixel to a detected instance or a stuff class\naccording to the learned embedding. Our method not only demonstrates fast\ninference speed but also the first one-stage method to achieve comparable\nperformance to two-stage methods on the challenging COCO benchmark.",

Nevertheless, due to\nvarious special challenges in UAV tracking, \\textit{e.g.}, severe occlusion,\nand fast motion, most existing Siamese-based trackers hardly combine superior\nperformance with high efficiency. To this concern, in this paper, a novel\nattentional Siamese tracker (SiamAPN++) is proposed for real-time UAV tracking.\nBy virtue of the attention mechanism, the attentional aggregation network (AAN)\nis conducted with self-AAN and cross-AAN, raising the expression ability of\nfeatures eventually. The former AAN aggregates and models the self-semantic\ninterdependencies of the single feature map via spatial and channel dimensions.\nThe latter aims to aggregate the cross-interdependencies of different semantic\nfeatures including the location information of anchors. In addition, the dual\nfeatures version of the anchor proposal network is proposed to raise the\nrobustness of proposing anchors, increasing the perception ability to objects\nwith various scales. Experiments on two well-known authoritative benchmarks are\nconducted, where SiamAPN++ outperforms its baseline SiamAPN and other SOTA\ntrackers.

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation is useful in medical image segmentation.\nParticularly, when ground truths of the target images are not available, domain\nadaptation can train a target-specific model by utilizing the existing labeled\nimages from other modalities. Most of the reported works mapped images of both\nthe source and target domains into a common latent feature space, and then\nreduced their discrepancy either implicitly with adversarial training or\nexplicitly by directly minimizing a discrepancy metric. In this work, we\npropose a new framework, where the latent features of both domains are driven\ntowards a common and parameterized variational form, whose conditional\ndistribution given the image is Gaussian. This is achieved by two networks\nbased on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and a regularization for this\nvariational approximation. Both of the VAEs, each for one domain, contain a\nsegmentation module, where the source segmentation is trained in a supervised\nmanner, while the target one is trained unsupervisedly. We validated the\nproposed domain adaptation method using two cardiac segmentation tasks, i.e.,\nthe cross-modality (CT and MR) whole heart segmentation and the cross-sequence\ncardiac MR segmentation. Results show that the proposed method achieved better\naccuracies compared to two state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrated good\npotential for cardiac segmentation. Furthermore, the proposed explicit\nregularization was shown to be effective and efficient in narrowing down the\ndistribution gap between domains, which is useful for unsupervised domain\nadaptation.

          "description": "This paper presents an end-to-end semi-supervised object detection approach,\nin contrast to previous more complex multi-stage methods. The end-to-end\ntraining gradually improves pseudo label qualities during the curriculum, and\nthe more and more accurate pseudo labels in turn benefit object detection\ntraining. We also propose two simple yet effective techniques within this\nframework: a soft teacher mechanism where the classification loss of each\nunlabeled bounding box is weighed by the classification score produced by the\nteacher network; a box jittering approach to select reliable pseudo boxes for\nthe learning of box regression. On COCO benchmark, the proposed approach\noutperforms previous methods by a large margin under various labeling ratios,\ni.e. 1\\%, 5\\% and 10\\%. Moreover, our approach proves to perform also well when\nthe amount of labeled data is relatively large. For example, it can improve a\n40.9 mAP baseline detector trained using the full COCO training set by +3.6\nmAP, reaching 44.5 mAP, by leveraging the 123K unlabeled images of COCO. On the\nstate-of-the-art Swin Transformer-based object detector (58.9 mAP on test-dev),\nit can still significantly improve the detection accuracy by +1.5 mAP, reaching\n60.4 mAP, and improve the instance segmentation accuracy by +1.2 mAP, reaching\n52.4 mAP, pushing the new state-of-the-art.",

However, automatic LA segmentation from LGE MRI is\nstill challenging, due to the poor image quality, high variability in LA\nshapes, and unclear LA boundary. Though deep learning-based methods can provide\npromising LA segmentation results, they often generalize poorly to unseen\ndomains, such as data from different scanners and/or sites. In this work, we\ncollect 210 LGE MRIs from different centers with different levels of image\nquality. To evaluate the domain generalization ability of models on the LA\nsegmentation task, we employ four commonly used semantic segmentation networks\nfor the LA segmentation from multi-center LGE MRIs.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach of\nCompositional Counterfactual Contrastive Learning ($C^3$) to develop\ncontrastive training between factual and counterfactual samples in\nvideo-grounded dialogues.

Different from prior approaches, we focus on contrastive hidden state\nrepresentations among compositional output tokens to optimize the\nrepresentation space in a generation setting.

Incorrect clouds forecasts can lead to\nmajor uncertainty in the overall accuracy of weather forecasts due to their\nintrinsic role in the Earth's climate system. Few studies have tackled this\nchallenging problem from a machine learning point-of-view due to a shortage of\nhigh-resolution datasets with many historical observations globally. In this\npaper, we present a novel satellite-based dataset called ``CloudCast''. It\nconsists of 70,080 images with 10 different cloud types for multiple layers of\nthe atmosphere annotated on a pixel level. The spatial resolution of the\ndataset is 928 x 1530 pixels (3x3 km per pixel) with 15-min intervals between\nframes for the period 2017-01-01 to 2018-12-31. All frames are centered and\nprojected over Europe. To supplement the dataset, we conduct an evaluation\nstudy with current state-of-the-art video prediction methods such as\nconvolutional long short-term memory networks, generative adversarial networks,\nand optical flow-based extrapolation methods. As the evaluation of video\nprediction is difficult in practice, we aim for a thorough evaluation in the\nspatial and temporal domain.

While a plethora of generative models\nfor predicting the future frame pixel values given the past few frames exist,\nthe quantitative evaluation of the predicted frames has been found to be\nextremely challenging. In this context, we introduce the problem of naturalness\nevaluation, which refers to how natural or realistic a predicted video looks.\nWe create the Indian Institute of Science VIdeo Naturalness Evaluation (IISc\nVINE) Database consisting of 300 videos, obtained by applying different\nprediction models on different datasets, and accompanying human opinion scores.\nWe collected subjective ratings of naturalness from 50 human participants for\nthese videos. Our subjective study reveals that human observers were highly\nconsistent in their judgments of naturalness. We benchmark several popularly\nused measures for evaluating video prediction and show that they do not\nadequately correlate with these subjective scores. We introduce two new\nfeatures to effectively capture naturalness, motion-compensated cosine\nsimilarities of deep features of predicted frames with past frames, and deep\nfeatures extracted from rescaled frame differences. We show that our feature\ndesign leads to state of the art naturalness prediction in accordance with\nhuman judgments on our IISc VINE Database.

          "description": "Modern feedforward convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can now solve some\ncomputer vision tasks at super-human levels. However, these networks only\nroughly mimic human visual perception. One difference from human vision is that\nthey do not appear to perceive illusory contours (e.g. Kanizsa squares) in the\nsame way humans do. Physiological evidence from visual cortex suggests that the\nperception of illusory contours could involve feedback connections. Would\nrecurrent feedback neural networks perceive illusory contours like humans? In\nthis work we equip a deep feedforward convolutional network with brain-inspired\nrecurrent dynamics. The network was first pretrained with an unsupervised\nreconstruction objective on a natural image dataset, to expose it to natural\nobject contour statistics. Then, a classification decision layer was added and\nthe model was finetuned on a form discrimination task: squares vs. randomly\noriented inducer shapes (no illusory contour). Finally, the model was tested\nwith the unfamiliar ''illusory contour'' configuration: inducer shapes oriented\nto form an illusory square. Compared with feedforward baselines, the iterative\n''predictive coding'' feedback resulted in more illusory contours being\nclassified as physical squares. The perception of the illusory contour was\nmeasurable in the luminance profile of the image reconstructions produced by\nthe model, demonstrating that the model really ''sees'' the illusion. Ablation\nstudies revealed that natural image pretraining and feedback error correction\nare both critical to the perception of the illusion. Finally we validated our\nconclusions in a deeper network (VGG): adding the same predictive coding\nfeedback dynamics again leads to the perception of illusory contours.",

          "description": "Adversarial training, especially projected gradient descent (PGD), has been a\nsuccessful approach for improving robustness against adversarial attacks. After\nadversarial training, gradients of models with respect to their inputs have a\npreferential direction. However, the direction of alignment is not\nmathematically well established, making it difficult to evaluate\nquantitatively. We propose a novel definition of this direction as the\ndirection of the vector pointing toward the closest point of the support of the\nclosest inaccurate class in decision space. To evaluate the alignment with this\ndirection after adversarial training, we apply a metric that uses generative\nadversarial networks to produce the smallest residual needed to change the\nclass present in the image. We show that PGD-trained models have a higher\nalignment than the baseline according to our definition, that our metric\npresents higher alignment values than a competing metric formulation, and that\nenforcing this alignment increases the robustness of models.",

          "description": "Traditional supervised learning with deep neural networks requires a\ntremendous amount of labelled data to converge to a good solution. For 3D\nmedical images, it is often impractical to build a large homogeneous annotated\ndataset for a specific pathology. Self-supervised methods offer a new way to\nlearn a representation of the images in an unsupervised manner with a neural\nnetwork. In particular, contrastive learning has shown great promises by\n(almost) matching the performance of fully-supervised CNN on vision tasks.\nNonetheless, this method does not take advantage of available meta-data, such\nas participant's age, viewed as prior knowledge. Here, we propose to leverage\ncontinuous proxy metadata, in the contrastive learning framework, by\nintroducing a new loss called y-Aware InfoNCE loss. Specifically, we improve\nthe positive sampling during pre-training by adding more positive examples with\nsimilar proxy meta-data with the anchor, assuming they share similar\ndiscriminative semantic features.With our method, a 3D CNN model pre-trained on\n$10^4$ multi-site healthy brain MRI scans can extract relevant features for\nthree classification tasks: schizophrenia, bipolar diagnosis and Alzheimer's\ndetection. When fine-tuned, it also outperforms 3D CNN trained from scratch on\nthese tasks, as well as state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Our code is\nmade publicly available here.",

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a wide class of connectionist models for\ngraph processing. They perform an iterative message passing operation on each\nnode and its neighbors, to solve classification/ clustering tasks --- on some\nnodes or on the whole graph --- collecting all such messages, regardless of\ntheir order. Despite the differences among the various models belonging to this\nclass, most of them adopt the same computation scheme, based on a local\naggregation mechanism and, intuitively, the local computation framework is\nmainly responsible for the expressive power of GNNs. In this paper, we prove\nthat the Weisfeiler--Lehman test induces an equivalence relationship on the\ngraph nodes that exactly corresponds to the unfolding equivalence, defined on\nthe original GNN model. Therefore, the results on the expressive power of the\noriginal GNNs can be extended to general GNNs which, under mild conditions, can\nbe proved capable of approximating, in probability and up to any precision, any\nfunction on graphs that respects the unfolding equivalence.",

          "description": "User data confidentiality protection is becoming a rising challenge in the\npresent deep learning research. Without access to data, conventional\ndata-driven model compression faces a higher risk of performance degradation.\nRecently, some works propose to generate images from a specific pretrained\nmodel to serve as training data. However, the inversion process only utilizes\nbiased feature statistics stored in one model and is from low-dimension to\nhigh-dimension. As a consequence, it inevitably encounters the difficulties of\ngeneralizability and inexact inversion, which leads to unsatisfactory\nperformance. To address these problems, we propose MixMix based on two simple\nyet effective techniques: (1) Feature Mixing: utilizes various models to\nconstruct a universal feature space for generalized inversion; (2) Data Mixing:\nmixes the synthesized images and labels to generate exact label information. We\nprove the effectiveness of MixMix from both theoretical and empirical\nperspectives. Extensive experiments show that MixMix outperforms existing\nmethods on the mainstream compression tasks, including quantization, knowledge\ndistillation, and pruning.

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks for visual recognition require large amounts of\ntraining samples and usually benefit from data augmentation. This paper\nproposes PatchMix, a data augmentation method that creates new samples by\ncomposing patches from pairs of images in a grid-like pattern. These new\nsamples' ground truth labels are set as proportional to the number of patches\nfrom each image. We then add a set of additional losses at the patch-level to\nregularize and to encourage good representations at both the patch and image\nlevels. A ResNet-50 model trained on ImageNet using PatchMix exhibits superior\ntransfer learning capabilities across a wide array of benchmarks. Although\nPatchMix can rely on random pairings and random grid-like patterns for mixing,\nwe explore evolutionary search as a guiding strategy to discover optimal\ngrid-like patterns and image pairing jointly. For this purpose, we conceive a\nfitness function that bypasses the need to re-train a model to evaluate each\nchoice. In this way, PatchMix outperforms a base model on CIFAR-10 (+1.91),\nCIFAR-100 (+5.31), Tiny Imagenet (+3.52), and ImageNet (+1.16) by significant\nmargins, also outperforming previous state-of-the-art pairwise augmentation\nstrategies.",

Here, we prove rigorously that, indeed,\nthe Bayes-optimal prediction and inference of randomly but continuously\ntransforming environments, a common natural setting, relies on short-term\nspike-timing-dependent plasticity, a hallmark of biological synapses. Further,\nthis dynamic Bayesian inference through plasticity enables circuits of the\ncerebral cortex in simulations to recognize previously unseen, highly distorted\ndynamic stimuli. Strikingly, this also introduces a biologically-modelled AI,\nthe first to overcome multiple limitations of deep learning and outperform\nartificial neural networks in a visual task. The cortical-like network is\nspiking and event-based, trained only with unsupervised and local plasticity,\non a small, narrow, and static training dataset, but achieves recognition of\nunseen, transformed, and dynamic data better than deep neural networks with\ncontinuous activations, trained with supervised backpropagation on the\ntransforming data. These results link short-term plasticity to high-level\ncortical function, suggest optimality of natural intelligence for natural\nenvironments, and repurpose neuromorphic AI from mere efficiency to\ncomputational supremacy altogether.",

          "description": "Adversarial training has been the topic of dozens of studies and a leading\nmethod for defending against adversarial attacks. Yet, it remains largely\nunknown (a) how adversarially-robust ImageNet classifiers (R classifiers)\ngeneralize to out-of-distribution examples; and (b) how their generalization\ncapability relates to their hidden representations. In this paper, we perform a\nthorough, systematic study to answer these two questions across AlexNet,\nGoogLeNet, and ResNet-50 architectures. We found that while standard ImageNet\nclassifiers have a strong texture bias, their R counterparts rely heavily on\nshapes. Remarkably, adversarial training induces three simplicity biases into\nhidden neurons in the process of 'robustifying' the network. That is, each\nconvolutional neuron in R networks often changes to detecting (1) pixel-wise\nsmoother patterns i.e. a mechanism that blocks high-frequency noise from\npassing through the network; (2) more lower-level features i.e. textures and\ncolors (instead of objects); and (3) fewer types of inputs. Our findings reveal\nthe interesting mechanisms that made networks more adversarially robust and\nalso explain some recent findings. Our findings reveal the interesting\nmechanisms that made networks more adversarially robust and also explain some\nrecent findings e.g. why R networks benefit from much larger capacity (Xie and\nYuille, 2020) and can act as a strong image prior in image synthesis (Santurkar\net al., 2019).",

          "description": "Training sparse networks to converge to the same performance as dense neural\narchitectures has proven to be elusive. Recent work suggests that\ninitialization is the key. However, while this direction of research has had\nsome success, focusing on initialization alone appears to be inadequate. In\nthis paper, we take a broader view of training sparse networks and consider the\nrole of regularization, optimization, and architecture choices on sparse\nmodels. We propose a simple experimental framework, Same Capacity Sparse vs\nDense Comparison (SC-SDC), that allows for a fair comparison of sparse and\ndense networks. Furthermore, we propose a new measure of gradient flow,\nEffective Gradient Flow (EGF), that better correlates to performance in sparse\nnetworks. Using top-line metrics, SC-SDC and EGF, we show that default choices\nof optimizers, activation functions and regularizers used for dense networks\ncan disadvantage sparse networks. Based upon these findings, we show that\ngradient flow in sparse networks can be improved by reconsidering aspects of\nthe architecture design and the training regime. Our work suggests that\ninitialization is only one piece of the puzzle and taking a wider view of\ntailoring optimization to sparse networks yields promising results.",

          "description": "Using generative models to synthesize visual features from semantic\ndistribution is one of the most popular solutions to ZSL image classification\nin recent years. The triplet loss (TL) is popularly used to generate realistic\nvisual distributions from semantics by automatically searching discriminative\nrepresentations. However, the traditional TL cannot search reliable unseen\ndisentangled representations due to the unavailability of unseen classes in\nZSL. To alleviate this drawback, we propose in this work a multi-modal triplet\nloss (MMTL) which utilizes multimodal information to search a disentangled\nrepresentation space. As such, all classes can interplay which can benefit\nlearning disentangled class representations in the searched space. Furthermore,\nwe develop a novel model called Disentangling Class Representation Generative\nAdversarial Network (DCR-GAN) focusing on exploiting the disentangled\nrepresentations in training, feature synthesis, and final recognition stages.\nBenefiting from the disentangled representations, DCR-GAN could fit a more\nrealistic distribution over both seen and unseen features.

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged with increasing popularity to collaborate\ndistributed medical institutions for training deep networks. However, despite\nexisting FL algorithms only allow the supervised training setting, most\nhospitals in realistic usually cannot afford the intricate data labeling due to\nabsence of budget or expertise. This paper studies a practical yet challenging\nFL problem, named \\textit{Federated Semi-supervised Learning} (FSSL), which\naims to learn a federated model by jointly utilizing the data from both labeled\nand unlabeled clients (i.e., hospitals). We present a novel approach for this\nproblem, which improves over traditional consistency regularization mechanism\nwith a new inter-client relation matching scheme. The proposed learning scheme\nexplicitly connects the learning across labeled and unlabeled clients by\naligning their extracted disease relationships, thereby mitigating the\ndeficiency of task knowledge at unlabeled clients and promoting discriminative\ninformation from unlabeled samples. We validate our method on two large-scale\nmedical image classification datasets. The effectiveness of our method has been\ndemonstrated with the clear improvements over state-of-the-arts as well as the\nthorough ablation analysis on both tasks\\footnote{Code will be made available\nat \\url{https://github.com/liuquande/FedIRM}}.",

          "description": "Anomaly detection has attracted considerable search attention. However,\nexisting anomaly detection databases encounter two major problems. Firstly,\nthey are limited in scale. Secondly, training sets contain only video-level\nlabels indicating the existence of an abnormal event during the full video\nwhile lacking annotations of precise time durations. To tackle these problems,\nwe contribute a new Large-scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) database as the\nbenchmark for anomaly detection in video sequences, which is featured in two\naspects. 1) It contains 2000 video sequences including normal and abnormal\nvideo clips with 14 anomaly categories including crash, fire, violence, etc.\nwith large scene varieties, making it the largest anomaly analysis database to\ndate. 2) It provides the annotation data, including video-level labels\n(abnormal/normal video, anomaly type) and frame-level labels (abnormal/normal\nvideo frame) to facilitate anomaly detection. Leveraging the above benefits\nfrom the LAD database, we further formulate anomaly detection as a\nfully-supervised learning problem and propose a multi-task deep neural network\nto solve it. We first obtain the local spatiotemporal contextual feature by\nusing an Inflated 3D convolutional (I3D) network. Then we construct a recurrent\nconvolutional neural network fed the local spatiotemporal contextual feature to\nextract the spatiotemporal contextual feature. With the global spatiotemporal\ncontextual feature, the anomaly type and score can be computed simultaneously\nby a multi-task neural network. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods on our\ndatabase and other public databases of anomaly detection.

One\nnotable application of GANs is developing fake human faces, also known as \"deep\nfakes,\" due to the deep learning algorithms at the core of the GAN framework.\nMeasuring the quality of the generated images is inherently subjective but\nattempts to objectify quality using standardized metrics have been made. One\nexample of objective metrics is the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), which\nmeasures the difference between distributions of feature vectors for two\nseparate datasets of images. There are situations that images with low\nperceptual qualities are not assigned appropriate FID scores. We propose to\nimprove the robustness of the evaluation process by integrating lower-level\nfeatures to cover a wider array of visual defects.

          "description": "We demonstrate that frequently appearing objects can be discovered by\ntraining randomly sampled patches from a small number of images (100 to 200) by\nself-supervision. Key to this approach is the pattern space, a latent space of\npatterns that represents all possible sub-images of the given image data. The\ndistance structure in the pattern space captures the co-occurrence of patterns\ndue to the frequent objects. The pattern space embedding is learned by\nminimizing the contrastive loss between randomly generated adjacent patches. To\nprevent the embedding from learning the background, we modulate the contrastive\nloss by color-based object saliency and background dissimilarity. The learned\ndistance structure serves as object memory, and the frequent objects are simply\ndiscovered by clustering the pattern vectors from the random patches sampled\nfor inference. Our image representation based on image patches naturally\nhandles the position and scale invariance property that is crucial to\nmulti-object discovery.

          "description": "Deep learning-based multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MUDA) has\nbeen actively studied in recent years. Compared with single-source unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (SUDA), domain shift in MUDA exists not only between the\nsource and target domains but also among multiple source domains. Most existing\nMUDA algorithms focus on extracting domain-invariant representations among all\ndomains whereas the task-specific decision boundaries among classes are largely\nneglected. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable network that\nexploits domain Consistency Regularization for unsupervised Multi-source domain\nAdaptive classification (CRMA). CRMA aligns not only the distributions of each\npair of source and target domains but also that of all domains. For each pair\nof source and target domains, we employ an intra-domain consistency to\nregularize a pair of domain-specific classifiers to achieve intra-domain\nalignment. In addition, we design an inter-domain consistency that targets\njoint inter-domain alignment among all domains. To address different\nsimilarities between multiple source domains and the target domain, we design\nan authorization strategy that assigns different authorities to domain-specific\nclassifiers adaptively for optimal pseudo label prediction and self-training.\nExtensive experiments show that CRMA tackles unsupervised domain adaptation\neffectively under a multi-source setup and achieves superior adaptation\nconsistently across multiple MUDA datasets.",

          "description": "Visual analytics have played an increasingly critical role in the Internet of\nThings, where massive visual signals have to be compressed and fed into\nmachines. But facing such big data and constrained bandwidth capacity, existing\nimage/video compression methods lead to very low-quality representations, while\nexisting feature compression techniques fail to support diversified visual\nanalytics applications/tasks with low-bit-rate representations. In this paper,\nwe raise and study the novel problem of supporting multiple machine vision\nanalytics tasks with the compressed visual representation, namely, the\ninformation compression problem in analytics taxonomy. By utilizing the\nintrinsic transferability among different tasks, our framework successfully\nconstructs compact and expressive representations at low bit-rates to support a\ndiversified set of machine vision tasks, including both high-level\nsemantic-related tasks and mid-level geometry analytic tasks. In order to\nimpose compactness in the representations, we propose a codebook-based\nhyperprior, which helps map the representation into a low-dimensional manifold.\nAs it well fits the signal structure of the deep visual feature, it facilitates\nmore accurate entropy estimation, and results in higher compression efficiency.\nWith the proposed framework and the codebook-based hyperprior, we further\ninvestigate the relationship of different task features owning different levels\nof abstraction granularity. Experimental results demonstrate that with the\nproposed scheme, a set of diversified tasks can be supported at a significantly\nlower bit-rate, compared with existing compression schemes.",

          "description": "The integrated positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging\n(PET/MRI) scanner facilitates the simultaneous acquisition of metabolic\ninformation via PET and morphological information with high soft-tissue\ncontrast using MRI. Although PET/MRI facilitates the capture of high-accuracy\nfusion images, its major drawback can be attributed to the difficulty\nencountered when performing attenuation correction, which is necessary for\nquantitative PET evaluation. The combined PET/MRI scanning requires the\ngeneration of attenuation-correction maps from MRI owing to no direct\nrelationship between the gamma-ray attenuation information and MRIs. While\nMRI-based bone-tissue segmentation can be readily performed for the head and\npelvis regions, the realization of accurate bone segmentation via chest CT\ngeneration remains a challenging task. This can be attributed to the\nrespiratory and cardiac motions occurring in the chest as well as its\nanatomically complicated structure and relatively thin bone cortex. This paper\npresents a means to minimise the anatomical structural changes without human\nannotation by adding structural constraints using a modality-independent\nneighbourhood descriptor (MIND) to a generative adversarial network (GAN) that\ncan transform unpaired images. The results obtained in this study revealed the\nproposed U-GAT-IT + MIND approach to outperform all other competing approaches.\nThe findings of this study hint towards possibility of synthesising clinically\nacceptable CT images from chest MRI without human annotation, thereby\nminimising the changes in the anatomical structure.",

Furthermore, the\nquality of learned representations is known to be heavily influenced by the\nsize and taxonomy of the curated datasets used for self-supervised training.\nThis begs the question of whether we are celebrating too early on catching up\nwith supervised learning when our self-supervised efforts still rely almost\nexclusively on curated data. In this paper, we study the efficacy of learning\nfrom Movies and TV Shows as forms of uncurated data for audio-visual\nself-supervised learning. We demonstrate that a simple model based on\ncontrastive learning, trained on a collection of movies and TV shows, not only\ndramatically outperforms more complex methods which are trained on orders of\nmagnitude larger uncurated datasets, but also performs very competitively with\nthe state-of-the-art that learns from large-scale curated data. We identify\nthat audiovisual patterns like the appearance of the main character or\nprominent scenes and mise-en-sc\\`ene which frequently occur through the whole\nduration of a movie, lead to an overabundance of easy negative instances in the\ncontrastive learning formulation.

          "description": "Learning-based stereo matching and depth estimation networks currently excel\non public benchmarks with impressive results. However, state-of-the-art\nnetworks often fail to generalize from synthetic imagery to more challenging\nreal data domains. This paper is an attempt to uncover hidden secrets of\nachieving domain robustness and in particular, discovering the important\ningredients of generalization success of stereo matching networks by analyzing\nthe effect of synthetic image learning on real data performance. We provide\nevidence that demonstrates that learning of features in the synthetic domain by\na stereo matching network is heavily influenced by two \"shortcuts\" presented in\nthe synthetic data: (1) identical local statistics (RGB colour features)\nbetween matching pixels in the synthetic stereo images and (2) lack of realism\nin synthetic textures on 3D objects simulated in game engines. We will show\nthat by removing such shortcuts, we can achieve domain robustness in the\nstate-of-the-art stereo matching frameworks and produce a remarkable\nperformance on multiple realistic datasets, despite the fact that the networks\nwere trained on synthetic data, only. Our experimental results point to the\nfact that eliminating shortcuts from the synthetic data is key to achieve\ndomain-invariant generalization between synthetic and real data domains.",

          "description": "In this work, we seek new insights into the underlying challenges of the\nScene Graph Generation (SGG) task. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the\nVisual Genome dataset implies -- 1) Ambiguity: even if inter-object\nrelationship contains the same object (or predicate), they may not be visually\nor semantically similar, 2) Asymmetry: despite the nature of the relationship\nthat embodied the direction, it was not well addressed in previous studies, and\n3) Higher-order contexts: leveraging the identities of certain graph elements\ncan help to generate accurate scene graphs. Motivated by the analysis, we\ndesign a novel SGG framework, Local-to-Global Interaction Networks (LOGIN).\nLocally, interactions extract the essence between three instances - subject,\nobject, and background - while baking direction awareness into the network by\nconstraining the input order. Globally, interactions encode the contexts\nbetween every graph components -- nodes and edges. Also we introduce Attract &\nRepel loss which finely adjusts predicate embeddings. Our framework enables\npredicting the scene graph in a local-to-global manner by design, leveraging\nthe possible complementariness. To quantify how much LOGIN is aware of\nrelational direction, we propose a new diagnostic task called Bidirectional\nRelationship Classification (BRC).

Then, we squeeze\nthe instance-level graph to generate the class-level graph, which can help\nobtain the class-level visual knowledge and facilitate modeling the relations\nof different classes. Next, the calibration module is adopted to characterize\nthe relations of the classes explicitly to obtain the more discriminative\nclass-level knowledge representations. Finally, we combine the class-level\nknowledge with the instance-level sample representations to guide the inference\nof the query samples.

          "description": "Predicting the future motion of multiple agents is necessary for planning in\ndynamic environments. This task is challenging for autonomous driving since\nagents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) and their associated behaviors may be\ndiverse and influence each other. Most prior work has focused on first\npredicting independent futures for each agent based on all past motion, and\nthen planning against these independent predictions. However, planning against\nfixed predictions can suffer from the inability to represent the future\ninteraction possibilities between different agents, leading to sub-optimal\nplanning. In this work, we formulate a model for predicting the behavior of all\nagents jointly in real-world driving environments in a unified manner. Inspired\nby recent language modeling approaches, we use a masking strategy as the query\nto our model, enabling one to invoke a single model to predict agent behavior\nin many ways, such as potentially conditioned on the goal or full future\ntrajectory of the autonomous vehicle or the behavior of other agents in the\nenvironment. Our model architecture fuses heterogeneous world state in a\nunified Transformer architecture by employing attention across road elements,\nagent interactions and time steps. We evaluate our approach on autonomous\ndriving datasets for behavior prediction, and achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance. Our work demonstrates that formulating the problem of behavior\nprediction in a unified architecture with a masking strategy may allow us to\nhave a single model that can perform multiple motion prediction and planning\nrelated tasks effectively.",

For this reason,\nit is necessary to quantify the discrepancy between simulation and reality in\norder to determine whether a certain fidelity is sufficient for a desired\nintended use.

          "description": "Attention mechanism of late has been quite popular in the computer vision\ncommunity. A lot of work has been done to improve the performance of the\nnetwork, although almost always it results in increased computational\ncomplexity. In this paper, we propose a new attention module that not only\nachieves the best performance but also has lesser parameters compared to most\nexisting models. Our attention module can easily be integrated with other\nconvolutional neural networks because of its lightweight nature. The proposed\nnetwork named Dual Multi Scale Attention Network (DMSANet) is comprised of two\nparts: the first part is used to extract features at various scales and\naggregate them, the second part uses spatial and channel attention modules in\nparallel to adaptively integrate local features with their global dependencies.\nWe benchmark our network performance for Image Classification on ImageNet\ndataset, Object Detection and Instance Segmentation both on MS COCO dataset.",

This problem is motivated by applications in clustering and\ncommunity detection where latent variables can be partitioned into a fixed\nnumber of known groups (e.g., users and items) and the blocks of the matrix\ncorrespond to different types of pairwise interactions (e.g., user-user,\nuser-item, or item-item interactions). In the setting where the number of\nblocks is fixed while the number of variables tends to infinity, we prove\nasymptotically exact formulas for the minimum mean-squared error in estimating\nboth the matrix and the latent variables. These formulas describe the weak\nrecovery thresholds for the problem and reveal invariance properties with\nrespect to certain scalings of the noise variance. We also derive an\napproximate message passing algorithm and a gradient descent algorithm and show\nempirically that these algorithms achieve the information-theoretic limits in\ncertain regimes.",

          "description": "We introduce a new framework for unifying and systematizing the performance\nanalysis of first-order black-box optimization algorithms for unconstrained\nconvex minimization. The low-cost iteration complexity enjoyed by first-order\nalgorithms renders them particularly relevant for applications in machine\nlearning and large-scale data analysis. Relying on sum-of-squares (SOS)\noptimization, we introduce a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that give\nincreasingly better convergence bounds for higher levels of the hierarchy.\nAlluding to the power of the SOS hierarchy, we show that the (dual of the)\nfirst level corresponds to the Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) introduced\nby Drori and Teboulle [Math. Program., 145(1):451--482, 2014], a powerful\nframework for determining convergence rates of first-order optimization\nalgorithms. Consequently, many results obtained within the PEP framework can be\nreinterpreted as degree-1 SOS proofs, and thus, the SOS framework provides a\npromising new approach for certifying improved rates of convergence by means of\nhigher-order SOS certificates. To determine analytical rate bounds, in this\nwork we use the first level of the SOS hierarchy and derive new result{s} for\nnoisy gradient descent with inexact line search methods (Armijo, Wolfe, and\nGoldstein).",

Rather than producing individual predictions for each of the\nfuture representations, the model emits a sequence of predictions shorter than\nthat of the upcoming representations to which they will be aligned. In this\nway, the prediction network solves a simpler task of predicting the next\nsymbols, but not their exact timing, while the encoding network is trained to\nproduce piece-wise constant latent codes.

          "description": "We perform an in-depth comparison of quantum annealing with several classical\noptimisation techniques, namely thermal annealing, Nelder-Mead, and gradient\ndescent. We begin with a direct study of the 2D Ising model on a quantum\nannealer, and compare its properties directly with those of the thermal 2D\nIsing model. These properties include an Ising-like phase transition that can\nbe induced by either a change in 'quantum-ness' of the theory, or by a scaling\nthe Ising couplings up or down. This behaviour is in accord with what is\nexpected from the physical understanding of the quantum system. We then go on\nto demonstrate the efficacy of the quantum annealer at minimising several\nincreasingly hard two dimensional potentials. For all the potentials we find\nthe general behaviour that Nelder-Mead and gradient descent methods are very\nsusceptible to becoming trapped in false minima, while the thermal anneal\nmethod is somewhat better at discovering the true minimum. However, and despite\ncurrent limitations on its size, the quantum annealer performs a minimisation\nvery markedly better than any of these classical techniques. A quantum anneal\ncan be designed so that the system almost never gets trapped in a false\nminimum, and rapidly and successfully minimises the potentials.",

          "description": "At present, people usually use some methods based on convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) for Electroencephalograph (EEG) decoding. However, CNNs have\nlimitations in perceiving global dependencies, which is not adequate for common\nEEG paradigms with a strong overall relationship. Regarding this issue, we\npropose a novel EEG decoding method that mainly relies on the attention\nmechanism. The EEG data is firstly preprocessed and spatially filtered. And\nthen, we apply attention transforming on the feature-channel dimension so that\nthe model can enhance more relevant spatial features. The most crucial step is\nto slice the data in the time dimension for attention transforming, and finally\nobtain a highly distinguishable representation. At this time, global averaging\npooling and a simple fully-connected layer are used to classify different\ncategories of EEG data. Experiments on two public datasets indicate that the\nstrategy of attention transforming effectively utilizes spatial and temporal\nfeatures. And we have reached the level of the state-of-the-art in\nmulti-classification of EEG, with fewer parameters. As far as we know, it is\nthe first time that a detailed and complete method based on the transformer\nidea has been proposed in this field.

          "description": "Neuromorphic neural network processors, in the form of compute-in-memory\ncrossbar arrays of memristors, or in the form of subthreshold analog and\nmixed-signal ASICs, promise enormous advantages in compute density and energy\nefficiency for NN-based ML tasks. However, these technologies are prone to\ncomputational non-idealities, due to process variation and intrinsic device\nphysics. This degrades the task performance of networks deployed to the\nprocessor, by introducing parameter noise into the deployed model. While it is\npossible to calibrate each device, or train networks individually for each\nprocessor, these approaches are expensive and impractical for commercial\ndeployment. Alternative methods are therefore needed to train networks that are\ninherently robust against parameter variation, as a consequence of network\narchitecture and parameters. We present a new adversarial network optimisation\nalgorithm that attacks network parameters during training, and promotes robust\nperformance during inference in the face of parameter variation. Our approach\nintroduces a regularization term penalising the susceptibility of a network to\nweight perturbation. We compare against previous approaches for producing\nparameter insensitivity such as dropout, weight smoothing and introducing\nparameter noise during training. We show that our approach produces models that\nare more robust to targeted parameter variation, and equally robust to random\nparameter variation. Our approach finds minima in flatter locations in the\nweight-loss landscape compared with other approaches, highlighting that the\nnetworks found by our technique are less sensitive to parameter perturbation.\nOur work provides an approach to deploy neural network architectures to\ninference devices that suffer from computational non-idealities, with minimal\nloss of performance. ...",

However, significant miss rates for polyps have been reported,\nparticularly when there are multiple small adenomas. This presents an\nopportunity to leverage computer-aided systems to support clinicians and reduce\nthe number of polyps missed.\n\nMethod: In this work we introduce the Focus U-Net, a novel dual\nattention-gated deep neural network, which combines efficient spatial and\nchannel-based attention into a single Focus Gate module to encourage selective\nlearning of polyp features. The Focus U-Net further incorporates short-range\nskip connections and deep supervision. Furthermore, we introduce the Hybrid\nFocal loss, a new compound loss function based on the Focal loss and Focal\nTversky loss, to handle class-imbalanced image segmentation. For our\nexperiments, we selected five public datasets containing images of polyps\nobtained during optical colonoscopy: CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ColonDB,\nETIS-Larib PolypDB and EndoScene test set. To evaluate model performance, we\nuse the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU)\nmetrics.\n\nResults: Our model achieves state-of-the-art results for both CVC-ClinicDB\nand Kvasir-SEG, with a mean DSC of 0.941 and 0.910, respectively.

In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination\nin the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning\nalgorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly\noptimize network structure without retraining. Our key innovation is to\nredefine the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration\nof network structures by taking full advantage of the competition between\npruning and regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the\nproposed method achieves minimal loss of SNNs' performance on MNIST and\nCIFAR-10 dataset so far. Moreover, it reaches a $\\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under\nunprecedented 0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining\ncapability in SNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high\nredundancy in deep SNNs. Our codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/Yanqi-Chen/Gradient-Rewiring.",

          "description": "The difficulty in specifying rewards for many real-world problems has led to\nan increased focus on learning rewards from human feedback, such as\ndemonstrations. However, there are often many different reward functions that\nexplain the human feedback, leaving agents with uncertainty over what the true\nreward function is. While most policy optimization approaches handle this\nuncertainty by optimizing for expected performance, many applications demand\nrisk-averse behavior. We derive a novel policy gradient-style robust\noptimization approach, PG-BROIL, that optimizes a soft-robust objective that\nbalances expected performance and risk. To the best of our knowledge, PG-BROIL\nis the first policy optimization algorithm robust to a distribution of reward\nhypotheses which can scale to continuous MDPs. Results suggest that PG-BROIL\ncan produce a family of behaviors ranging from risk-neutral to risk-averse and\noutperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms when learning from\nambiguous demonstrations by hedging against uncertainty, rather than seeking to\nuniquely identify the demonstrator's reward function.",

As personal life is being\ncontinuously documented in pictures, the risk of losing it to eavesdroppers is\na matter of grave concern. Secondary storage is the most preferred medium for\nthe storage of personal and other images. Our work is concerned with the\nsecurity of such images. While encryption is the best way to ensure image\nsecurity, full encryption and decryption is a computationally-intensive\nprocess. Moreover, as cameras are getting better every day, image quality, and\nthus, the pixel density has increased considerably. The increased pixel density\nmakes encryption and decryption more expensive. We, therefore, delve into\nselective encryption and selective blurring based on the region of interest.\nInstead of encrypting or blurring the entire photograph, we only encode\nselected regions of the image. We present a comparative analysis of the partial\nand full encryption of the photos. This kind of encoding will help us lower the\nencryption overhead without compromising security. The applications utilizing\nthis technique will become more usable due to the reduction in the decryption\ntime. Additionally, blurred images being more readable than encrypted ones,\nallowed us to define the level of security.

          "description": "Self-supervised learning (especially contrastive learning) has attracted\ngreat interest due to its tremendous potentials in learning discriminative\nrepresentations in an unsupervised manner. Despite the acknowledged successes,\nexisting contrastive learning methods suffer from very low learning efficiency,\ne.g., taking about ten times more training epochs than supervised learning for\ncomparable recognition accuracy. In this paper, we discover two contradictory\nphenomena in contrastive learning that we call under-clustering and\nover-clustering problems, which are major obstacles to learning efficiency.\nUnder-clustering means that the model cannot efficiently learn to discover the\ndissimilarity between inter-class samples when the negative sample pairs for\ncontrastive learning are insufficient to differentiate all the actual object\ncategories. Over-clustering implies that the model cannot efficiently learn the\nfeature representation from excessive negative sample pairs, which enforces the\nmodel to over-cluster samples of the same actual categories into different\nclusters. To simultaneously overcome these two problems, we propose a novel\nself-supervised learning framework using a median triplet loss. Precisely, we\nemploy a triplet loss tending to maximize the relative distance between the\npositive pair and negative pairs to address the under-clustering problem; and\nwe construct the negative pair by selecting the negative sample of a median\nsimilarity score from all negative samples to avoid the over-clustering\nproblem, guaranteed by the Bernoulli Distribution model. We extensively\nevaluate our proposed framework in several large-scale benchmarks (e.g.,\nImageNet, SYSU-30k, and COCO). The results demonstrate the superior performance\n(e.g., the learning efficiency) of our model over the latest state-of-the-art\nmethods by a clear margin.

Machine learning frameworks that learn to\napproximate solutions to such hard optimization problems are a potentially\npromising avenue to address these difficulties, particularly when many closely\nrelated problem instances must be solved repeatedly. Supervised learning\nframeworks can train a model using the outputs of pre-solved instances.\nHowever, when the outputs are themselves approximations, when the optimization\nproblem has symmetric solutions, and/or when the solver uses randomization,\nsolutions to closely related instances may exhibit large differences and the\nlearning task can become inherently more difficult. This paper demonstrates\nthis critical challenge, connects the volatility of the training data to the\nability of a model to approximate it, and proposes a method for producing\n(exact or approximate) solutions to optimization problems that are more\namenable to supervised learning tasks.

These contain 12,471 pairs\nof results. Of these, 21.95% changed direction when the MCC metric is used\ninstead of the biased F1 metric. Unfortunately, we also found evidence\nsuggesting that F1 remains widely used in software defect prediction research.\n\nConclusions: We reiterate the concerns of statisticians that the F1 is a\nproblematic metric outside of an information retrieval context, since we are\nconcerned about both classes (defect-prone and not defect-prone units). This\ninappropriate usage has led to a substantial number (more than one fifth) of\nerroneous (in terms of direction) results.

The\nidentified clusters could represent different routine behavioral trends related\nto daily living of patients as well as atypical behavioral trends associated\nwith impending relapse.\n\nWe used the mobile sensing data obtained in the CrossCheck project for our\nanalysis. Continuous data from six different mobile sensing-based modalities\n(e.g. ambient light, sound/conversation, acceleration etc.) obtained from a\ntotal of 63 schizophrenia patients, each monitored for up to a year, were used\nfor the clustering models and relapse prediction evaluation. Two clustering\nmodels, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Partition Around Medoids (PAM), were\nused to obtain behavioral representations from the mobile sensing data. The\nfeatures obtained from the clustering models were used to train and evaluate a\npersonalized relapse prediction model using Balanced Random Forest. The\npersonalization was done by identifying optimal features for a given patient\nbased on a personalization subset consisting of other patients who are of\nsimilar age.\n\nThe clusters identified using the GMM and PAM models were found to represent\ndifferent behavioral patterns (such as clusters representing sedentary days,\nactive but with low communications days, etc.). Significant changes near the\nrelapse periods were seen in the obtained behavioral representation features\nfrom the clustering models. The clustering model based features, together with\nother features characterizing the mobile sensing data, resulted in an F2 score\nof 0.24 for the relapse prediction task in a leave-one-patient-out evaluation\nsetting.

          "description": "Most modern neural networks for classification fail to take into account the\nconcept of the unknown. Trained neural networks are usually tested in an\nunrealistic scenario with only examples from a closed set of known classes. In\nan attempt to develop a more realistic model, the concept of working in an open\nset environment has been introduced. This in turn leads to the concept of\nincremental learning where a model with its own architecture and initial\ntrained set of data can identify unknown classes during the testing phase and\nautonomously update itself if evidence of a new class is detected. Some\nproblems that arise in incremental learning are inefficient use of resources to\nretrain the classifier repeatedly and the decrease of classification accuracy\nas multiple classes are added over time. This process of instantiating new\nclasses is repeated as many times as necessary, accruing errors. To address\nthese problems, this paper proposes the Classification Confidence Threshold\napproach to prime neural networks for incremental learning to keep accuracies\nhigh by limiting forgetting. A lean method is also used to reduce resources\nused in the retraining of the neural network. The proposed method is based on\nthe idea that a network is able to incrementally learn a new class even when\nexposed to a limited number samples associated with the new class. This method\ncan be applied to most existing neural networks with minimal changes to network\narchitecture.",

However, all these\nworks share a strong realizability assumption about the optimal value function\nof the true MDP. Such realizability assumptions are often too strong to hold in\npractice. In this work, we consider the more realistic setting of agnostic RL\nwith rich observation spaces and a fixed class of policies $\\Pi$ that may not\ncontain any near-optimal policy. We provide an algorithm for this setting whose\nerror is bounded in terms of the rank $d$ of the underlying MDP.

Based on this, our new EPIG-BALD acquisition\nfunction for Bayesian Neural Networks selects samples to improve the\nperformance on the test data distribution instead of selecting samples that\nreduce model uncertainty everywhere, including for out-of-distribution regions\nwith low density in the test data distribution. Our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art Bayesian active learning methods on high-dimensional datasets\nand avoids out-of-distribution junk data in cases where current\nstate-of-the-art methods fail.",

          "description": "Routing methods in capsule networks often learn a hierarchical relationship\nfor capsules in successive layers, but the intra-relation between capsules in\nthe same layer is less studied, while this intra-relation is a key factor for\nthe semantic understanding in text data. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce\na new capsule network with graph routing to learn both relationships, where\ncapsules in each layer are treated as the nodes of a graph. We investigate\nstrategies to yield adjacency and degree matrix with three different distances\nfrom a layer of capsules, and propose the graph routing mechanism between those\ncapsules. We validate our approach on five text classification datasets, and\nour findings suggest that the approach combining bottom-up routing and top-down\nattention performs the best. Such an approach demonstrates generalization\ncapability across datasets. Compared to the state-of-the-art routing methods,\nthe improvements in accuracy in the five datasets we used were 0.82, 0.39,\n0.07, 1.01, and 0.02, respectively.",

          "description": "Electronic health records represent a holistic overview of patients'\ntrajectories. Their increasing availability has fueled new hopes to leverage\nthem and develop accurate risk prediction models for a wide range of diseases.\nGiven the complex interrelationships of medical records and patient outcomes,\ndeep learning models have shown clear merits in achieving this goal. However, a\nkey limitation of these models remains their capacity in processing long\nsequences. Capturing the whole history of medical encounters is expected to\nlead to more accurate predictions, but the inclusion of records collected for\ndecades and from multiple resources can inevitably exceed the receptive field\nof the existing deep learning architectures. This can result in missing\ncrucial, long-term dependencies. To address this gap, we present Hi-BEHRT, a\nhierarchical Transformer-based model that can significantly expand the\nreceptive field of Transformers and extract associations from much longer\nsequences. Using a multimodal large-scale linked longitudinal electronic health\nrecords, the Hi-BEHRT exceeds the state-of-the-art BEHRT 1% to 5% for area\nunder the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and 3% to 6% for area\nunder the precision recall (AUPRC) curve on average, and 3% to 6% (AUROC) and\n3% to 11% (AUPRC) for patients with long medical history for 5-year heart\nfailure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and stroke risk prediction.\nAdditionally, because pretraining for hierarchical Transformer is not\nwell-established, we provide an effective end-to-end contrastive pre-training\nstrategy for Hi-BEHRT using EHR, improving its transferability on predicting\nclinical events with relatively small training dataset.",

          "description": "Recently demonstrated physical-world adversarial attacks have exposed\nvulnerabilities in perception systems that pose severe risks for\nsafety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. These attacks place\nadversarial artifacts in the physical world that indirectly cause the addition\nof a universal patch to inputs of a model that can fool it in a variety of\ncontexts. Adversarial training is the most effective defense against\nimage-dependent adversarial attacks. However, tailoring adversarial training to\nuniversal patches is computationally expensive since the optimal universal\npatch depends on the model weights which change during training. We propose\nmeta adversarial training (MAT), a novel combination of adversarial training\nwith meta-learning, which overcomes this challenge by meta-learning universal\npatches along with model training. MAT requires little extra computation while\ncontinuously adapting a large set of patches to the current model.

In statistics and machine learning, they arise, for\nexample, in various dimensionality reduction techniques such as canonical\ncorrelation analysis. In deep learning, regularization and improved stability\ncan be obtained by constraining some layers to have parameter matrices that\nbelong to the Stiefel manifold. Solving problems on the generalized Stiefel\nmanifold can be approached via the tools of Riemannian optimization. However,\nusing the standard geometric components for the generalized Stiefel manifold\nhas two possible shortcoming: computing some of the geometric components can be\ntoo expensive and converge can be rather slow in certain cases.

However,\nsince existing works often use different benchmarks and tuning protocols, it is\nunclear if the proposed models universally outperform GBDT. Moreover, the\nmodels are often not compared to each other, therefore, it is challenging to\nidentify the best deep model for practitioners.\n\nIn this work, we start from a thorough review of the main families of DL\nmodels recently developed for tabular data.

First, we show\nthat the choice between GBDT and DL models highly depends on data and there is\nstill no universally superior solution. Second, we demonstrate that a simple\nResNet-like architecture is a surprisingly effective baseline, which\noutperforms most of the sophisticated models from the DL literature.

          "description": "Deep learning and data-driven approaches have shown great potential in\nscientific domains. The promise of data-driven techniques relies on the\navailability of a large volume of high-quality training datasets. Due to the\nhigh cost of obtaining data through expensive physical experiments,\ninstruments, and simulations, data augmentation techniques for scientific\napplications have emerged as a new direction for obtaining scientific data\nrecently. However, existing data augmentation techniques originating from\ncomputer vision, yield physically unacceptable data samples that are not\nhelpful for the domain problems that we are interested in. In this paper, we\ndevelop new physics-informed data augmentation techniques based on\nconvolutional neural networks. Specifically, our generative models leverage\ndifferent physics knowledge (such as governing equations, observable\nperception, and physics phenomena) to improve the quality of the synthetic\ndata. To validate the effectiveness of our data augmentation techniques, we\napply them to solve a subsurface seismic full-waveform inversion using\nsimulated CO$_2$ leakage data. Our interest is to invert for subsurface\nvelocity models associated with very small CO$_2$ leakage. We validate the\nperformance of our methods using comprehensive numerical tests. Via comparison\nand analysis, we show that data-driven seismic imaging can be significantly\nenhanced by using our physics-informed data augmentation techniques.\nParticularly, the imaging quality has been improved by 15% in test scenarios of\ngeneral-sized leakage and 17% in small-sized leakage when using an augmented\ntraining set obtained with our techniques.",

          "description": "Agents that learn to select optimal actions represent a prominent focus of\nthe sequential decision-making literature. In the face of a complex environment\nor constraints on time and resources, however, aiming to synthesize such an\noptimal policy can become infeasible. These scenarios give rise to an important\ntrade-off between the information an agent must acquire to learn and the\nsub-optimality of the resulting policy. While an agent designer has a\npreference for how this trade-off is resolved, existing approaches further\nrequire that the designer translate these preferences into a fixed learning\ntarget for the agent. In this work, leveraging rate-distortion theory, we\nautomate this process such that the designer need only express their\npreferences via a single hyperparameter and the agent is endowed with the\nability to compute its own learning targets that best achieve the desired\ntrade-off. We establish a general bound on expected discounted regret for an\nagent that decides what to learn in this manner along with computational\nexperiments that illustrate the expressiveness of designer preferences and even\nshow improvements over Thompson sampling in identifying an optimal policy.",

This information is present\nboth in the domain and the class labels. In this work we investigate the\ncomplementary roles of these two sources of information by combining\ninstance-discriminative contrastive learning and supervised learning in a\nsingle framework called Supervised Momentum Contrastive learning (SUPMOCO). Our\napproach avoids a problem observed in supervised learning where information in\nimages not relevant to the task is discarded, which hampers their\ngeneralization to novel tasks. We show that (self-supervised) contrastive\nlearning and supervised learning are mutually beneficial, leading to a new\nstate-of-the-art on the META-DATASET - a recently introduced benchmark for\nfew-shot learning. Our method is based on a simple modification of MOCO and\nscales better than prior work on combining supervised and self-supervised\nlearning.

          "description": "It is well known that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks, which are implemented by adding crafted perturbations onto\nbenign examples. Min-max robust optimization based adversarial training can\nprovide a notion of security against adversarial attacks. However, adversarial\nrobustness requires a significantly larger capacity of the network than that\nfor the natural training with only benign examples. This paper proposes a\nframework of concurrent adversarial training and weight pruning that enables\nmodel compression while still preserving the adversarial robustness and\nessentially tackles the dilemma of adversarial training. Furthermore, this work\nstudies two hypotheses about weight pruning in the conventional setting and\nfinds that weight pruning is essential for reducing the network model size in\nthe adversarial setting, training a small model from scratch even with\ninherited initialization from the large model cannot achieve both adversarial\nrobustness and high standard accuracy.

          "description": "Temperature monitoring during the life time of heat-source components in\nengineering systems becomes essential to ensure the normal work and even the\nlong working life of the heat sources. However, prior methods, which mainly use\nthe interpolate estimation, require large amounts of temperature tensors for an\naccurate estimation. To solve this problem, this work develops a novel\nphysics-informed deep surrogate models for temperature field reconstruction.\nFirst, we defines the temperature field reconstruction task of heat-source\nsystems. Then, this work develops the deep surrogate model mapping for the\nproposed task. Finally, considering the physical properties of heat transfer,\nthis work proposes four different losses and joint learns the deep surrogate\nmodel with these losses. Experimental studies have conducted over typical\ntwo-dimensional heat-source systems to demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the proposed physics-informed deep surrogate models for\ntemperature field reconstruction.",

The goal of this\npaper is to take a broad look into coarsening techniques that have been\nsuccessfully deployed in scientific computing and see how similar principles\nare finding their way in more recent applications related to machine learning.\nIn scientific computing, coarsening plays a central role in algebraic multigrid\nmethods as well as the related class of multilevel incomplete LU\nfactorizations. In machine learning, graph coarsening goes under various names,\ne.g., graph downsampling or graph reduction. Its goal in most cases is to\nreplace some original graph by one which has fewer nodes, but whose structure\nand characteristics are similar to those of the original graph.

          "description": "Reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find an optimal policy by interaction\nwith an environment. Consequently, learning complex behavior requires a vast\nnumber of samples, which can be prohibitive in practice. Nevertheless, instead\nof systematically reasoning and actively choosing informative samples, policy\ngradients for local search are often obtained from random perturbations. These\nrandom samples yield high variance estimates and hence are sub-optimal in terms\nof sample complexity. Actively selecting informative samples is at the core of\nBayesian optimization, which constructs a probabilistic surrogate of the\nobjective from past samples to reason about informative subsequent ones. In\nthis paper, we propose to join both worlds. We develop an algorithm utilizing a\nprobabilistic model of the objective function and its gradient. Based on the\nmodel, the algorithm decides where to query a noisy zeroth-order oracle to\nimprove the gradient estimates. The resulting algorithm is a novel type of\npolicy search method, which we compare to existing black-box algorithms. The\ncomparison reveals improved sample complexity and reduced variance in extensive\nempirical evaluations on synthetic objectives. Further, we highlight the\nbenefits of active sampling on popular RL benchmarks.",

If the lower bound is above a certain threshold,\ni.e., on the other side of the decision boundary, recourse is guaranteed in\nexpectation.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have reached very high accuracy on object detection but\ntheir success hinges on large amounts of labeled data. To reduce the dependency\non labels, various active-learning strategies have been proposed, typically\nbased on the confidence of the detector. However, these methods are biased\ntowards best-performing classes and can lead to acquired datasets that are not\ngood representatives of the data in the testing set. In this work, we propose a\nunified framework for active learning, that considers both the uncertainty and\nthe robustness of the detector, ensuring that the network performs accurately\nin all classes. Furthermore, our method is able to pseudo-label the very\nconfident predictions, suppressing a potential distribution drift while further\nboosting the performance of the model. Experiments show that our method\ncomprehensively outperforms a wide range of active-learning methods on PASCAL\nVOC07+12 and MS-COCO, having up to a 7.7% relative improvement, or up to 82%\nreduction in labeling cost.",

          "description": "In this work, we consider the problem of learning a feed-forward neural\nnetwork (NN) controller to safely steer an arbitrarily shaped planar robot in a\ncompact and obstacle-occluded workspace. Unlike existing methods that depend\nstrongly on the density of data points close to the boundary of the safe state\nspace to train NN controllers with closed-loop safety guarantees, we propose an\napproach that lifts such assumptions on the data that are hard to satisfy in\npractice and instead allows for graceful safety violations, i.e., of a bounded\nmagnitude that can be spatially controlled. To do so, we employ reachability\nanalysis methods to encapsulate safety constraints in the training process.\nSpecifically, to obtain a computationally efficient over-approximation of the\nforward reachable set of the closed-loop system, we partition the robot's state\nspace into cells and adaptively subdivide the cells that contain states which\nmay escape the safe set under the trained control law. To do so, we first\ndesign appropriate under- and over-approximations of the robot's footprint to\nadaptively subdivide the configuration space into cells. Then, using the\noverlap between each cell's forward reachable set and the set of infeasible\nrobot configurations as a measure for safety violations, we introduce penalty\nterms into the loss function that penalize this overlap in the training\nprocess. As a result, our method can learn a safe vector field for the\nclosed-loop system and, at the same time, provide numerical worst-case bounds\non safety violation over the whole configuration space, defined by the overlap\nbetween the over-approximation of the forward reachable set of the closed-loop\nsystem and the set of unsafe states. Moreover, it can control the tradeoff\nbetween computational complexity and tightness of these bounds. Finally, we\nprovide a simulation study that verifies the efficacy of the proposed scheme.",

Governments worldwide have invested lots of economic and human\nresources to radically eliminate this threat. Despite these efforts, providing\naccurate predictions of the risk that a victim of gender violence has of being\nattacked again is still a very hard open problem. The development of new\nmethods for issuing accurate, fair and quick predictions would allow police\nforces to select the most appropriate measures to prevent recidivism. In this\nwork, we propose to apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to create models\nthat accurately predict the recidivism risk of a gender-violence offender. The\nrelevance of the contribution of this work is threefold: (i) the proposed ML\nmethod outperforms the preexisting risk assessment algorithm based on classical\nstatistical techniques, (ii) the study has been conducted through an official\nspecific-purpose database with more than 40,000 reports of gender violence, and\n(iii) two new quality measures are proposed for assessing the effective police\nprotection that a model supplies and the overload in the invested resources\nthat it generates. Additionally, we propose a hybrid model that combines the\nstatistical prediction methods with the ML method, permitting authorities to\nimplement a smooth transition from the preexisting model to the ML-based model.\nThis hybrid nature enables a decision-making process to optimally balance\nbetween the efficiency of the police system and aggressiveness of the\nprotection measures taken.",

SGA-PDE focuses on the representation and optimization of PDE.\nFirstly, SGA-PDE uses symbolic mathematics to realize the flexible\nrepresentation of any given PDE, transforms a PDE into a forest, and converts\neach function term into a binary tree. Secondly, SGA-PDE adopts a specially\ndesigned genetic algorithm to efficiently optimize the binary trees by\niteratively updating the tree topology and node attributes. The SGA-PDE is\ngradient-free, which is a desirable characteristic in PDE discovery since it is\ndifficult to obtain the gradient between the PDE loss and the PDE structure. In\nthe experiment, SGA-PDE not only successfully discovered nonlinear Burgers'\nequation, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, and Chafee-Infante equation, but\nalso handled PDEs with fractional structure and compound functions that cannot\nbe solved by conventional PDE discovery methods.",

          "description": "Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning approach where\nclients train a global model cooperatively while keeping their local data\nprivate. Different from cross-device FL, clients in cross-silo FL are usually\norganizations or companies which may execute multiple cross-silo FL processes\nrepeatedly due to their time-varying local data sets, and aim to optimize their\nlong-term benefits by selfishly choosing their participation levels. While\nthere has been some work on incentivizing clients to join FL, the analysis of\nthe long-term selfish participation behaviors of clients in cross-silo FL\nremains largely unexplored. In this paper, we analyze the selfish participation\nbehaviors of heterogeneous clients in cross-silo FL. Specifically, we model the\nlong-term selfish participation behaviors of clients as an infinitely repeated\ngame, with the stage game being a selfish participation game in one cross-silo\nFL process (SPFL). For the stage game SPFL, we derive the unique Nash\nequilibrium (NE), and propose a distributed algorithm for each client to\ncalculate its equilibrium participation strategy. For the long-term\ninteractions among clients, we derive a cooperative strategy for clients which\nminimizes the number of free riders while increasing the amount of local data\nfor model training. We show that enforced by a punishment strategy, such a\ncooperative strategy is a SPNE of the infinitely repeated game, under which\nsome clients who are free riders at the NE of the stage game choose to be\n(partial) contributors. We further propose an algorithm to calculate the\noptimal SPNE which minimizes the number of free riders while maximizing the\namount of local data for model training. Simulation results show that our\nproposed cooperative strategy at the optimal SPNE can effectively reduce the\nnumber of free riders and increase the amount of local data for model training.",

The key\nidea is to let the learner itself iteratively generate \"pseudo-supervision\" for\nunlabeled instances based on its current hypothesis. In combination with\nconsistency regularization, pseudo-labeling has shown promising performance in\nvarious domains, for example in computer vision. To account for the\nhypothetical nature of the pseudo-labels, these are commonly provided in the\nform of probability distributions. Still, one may argue that even a probability\ndistribution represents an excessive level of informedness, as it suggests that\nthe learner precisely knows the ground-truth conditional probabilities. In our\napproach, we therefore allow the learner to label instances in the form of\ncredal sets, that is, sets of (candidate) probability distributions. Thanks to\nthis increased expressiveness, the learner is able to represent uncertainty and\na lack of knowledge in a more flexible and more faithful manner. To learn from\nweakly labeled data of that kind, we leverage methods that have recently been\nproposed in the realm of so-called superset learning.

          "description": "In class-incremental learning, an agent with limited resources needs to learn\na sequence of classification tasks, forming an ever growing classification\nproblem, with the constraint of not being able to access data from previous\ntasks. The main difference with task-incremental learning, where a task-ID is\navailable at inference time, is that the learner also needs to perform\ncross-task discrimination, i.e. distinguish between classes that have not been\nseen together. Approaches to tackle this problem are numerous and mostly make\nuse of an external memory (buffer) of non-negligible size. In this paper, we\nablate the learning of cross-task features and study its influence on the\nperformance of basic replay strategies used for class-IL. We also define a new\nforgetting measure for class-incremental learning, and see that forgetting is\nnot the principal cause of low performance. Our experimental results show that\nfuture algorithms for class-incremental learning should not only prevent\nforgetting, but also aim to improve the quality of the cross-task features.\nThis is especially important when the number of classes per task is small.",

By first revisiting the irrepresentability condition\n(IRC) of the Lasso, we gain some insights of when this might occur.

It extends REBEL,\nthe relational Bellman update operator, which is a lifted value iteration\napproach for model-based relational reinforcement learning, toward relational\nmodel-checking. PCTL-REBEL is lifted, which means that rather than grounding,\nthe model exploits symmetries and reasons at an abstract relational level.\nTheoretically, we show that the pCTL model checking approach is decidable for\nrelational MDPs even for possibly infinite domains provided that the states\nhave a bounded size.

A lack of\ntransparency of \"black-box\" deep networks remains one of the largest stumbling\nblocks to the wider acceptance of deep learning for clinical applications.\nEnsuing work therefore aimed to visualise DCNN decisions attributed by\nrelevance heatmaps using Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Through the\nLRP framework, the patterns captured from smartphone-based inertial sensor data\nthat were reflective of those who are healthy versus persons with MS (PwMS)\ncould begin to be established and understood. Interpretations suggested that\ncadence-based measures, gait speed, and ambulation-related signal perturbations\nwere distinct characteristics that distinguished MS disability from healthy\nparticipants. Robust and interpretable outcomes, generated from high-frequency\nout-of-clinic assessments, could greatly augment the current in-clinic\nassessment picture for PwMS, to inform better disease management techniques,\nand enable the development of better therapeutic interventions.",

          "description": "Networks have been widely used to represent the relations between objects\nsuch as academic networks and social networks, and learning embedding for\nnetworks has thus garnered plenty of research attention. Self-supervised\nnetwork representation learning aims at extracting node embedding without\nexternal supervision. Recently, maximizing the mutual information between the\nlocal node embedding and the global summary (e.g. Deep Graph Infomax, or DGI\nfor short) has shown promising results on many downstream tasks such as node\nclassification. However, there are two major limitations of DGI. Firstly, DGI\nmerely considers the extrinsic supervision signal (i.e., the mutual information\nbetween node embedding and global summary) while ignores the intrinsic signal\n(i.e., the mutual dependence between node embedding and node attributes).\nSecondly, nodes in a real-world network are usually connected by multiple edges\nwith different relations, while DGI does not fully explore the various\nrelations among nodes. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a\nnovel framework, called High-order Deep Multiplex Infomax (HDMI), for learning\nnode embedding on multiplex networks in a self-supervised way. To be more\nspecific, we first design a joint supervision signal containing both extrinsic\nand intrinsic mutual information by high-order mutual information, and we\npropose a High-order Deep Infomax (HDI) to optimize the proposed supervision\nsignal. Then we propose an attention based fusion module to combine node\nembedding from different layers of the multiplex network. Finally, we evaluate\nthe proposed HDMI on various downstream tasks such as unsupervised clustering\nand supervised classification. The experimental results show that HDMI achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on these tasks.",

          "description": "Data assimilation (DA) is widely used to combine physical knowledge and\nobservations. It is nowadays commonly used in geosciences to perform parametric\ncalibration. In a context of climate change, old calibrations can not\nnecessarily be used for new scenarios. This raises the question of DA\ncomputational cost, as costly physics-based numerical models need to be\nreanalyzed. Reduction and metamodelling represent therefore interesting\nperspectives, for example proposed in recent contributions as hybridization\nbetween ensemble and variational methods, to combine their advantages\n(efficiency, non-linear framework). They are however often based on Monte Carlo\n(MC) type sampling, which often requires considerable increase of the ensemble\nsize for better efficiency, therefore representing a computational burden in\nensemble-based methods as well. To address these issues, two methods to replace\nthe complex model by a surrogate are proposed and confronted : (i) PODEn3DVAR\ndirectly inspired from PODEn4DVAR, relies on an ensemble-based joint\nparameter-state Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), which provides a linear\nmetamodel ; (ii) POD-PCE-3DVAR, where the model states are POD reduced then\nlearned using Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), resulting in a non-linear\nmetamodel. Both metamodels allow to write an approximate cost function whose\nminimum can be analytically computed, or deduced by a gradient descent at\nnegligible cost. Furthermore, adapted metamodelling error covariance matrix is\ngiven for POD-PCE-3DVAR, allowing to substantially improve the metamodel-based\nDA analysis. Proposed methods are confronted on a twin experiment, and compared\nto classical 3DVAR on a measurement-based problem. Results are promising, in\nparticular superior with POD-PCE-3DVAR, showing good convergence to classical\n3DVAR and robustness to noise.",

          "description": "We consider repair tasks: given a critic (e.g., compiler) that assesses the\nquality of an input, the goal is to train a fixer that converts a bad example\n(e.g., code with syntax errors) into a good one (e.g., code with no syntax\nerrors). Existing works create training data consisting of (bad, good) pairs by\ncorrupting good examples using heuristics (e.g., dropping tokens). However,\nfixers trained on this synthetically-generated data do not extrapolate well to\nthe real distribution of bad inputs. To bridge this gap, we propose a new\ntraining approach, Break-It-Fix-It (BIFI), which has two key ideas: (i) we use\nthe critic to check a fixer's output on real bad inputs and add good (fixed)\noutputs to the training data, and (ii) we train a breaker to generate realistic\nbad code from good code. Based on these ideas, we iteratively update the\nbreaker and the fixer while using them in conjunction to generate more paired\ndata. We evaluate BIFI on two code repair datasets: GitHub-Python, a new\ndataset we introduce where the goal is to repair Python code with AST parse\nerrors; and DeepFix, where the goal is to repair C code with compiler errors.\nBIFI outperforms existing methods, obtaining 90.5% repair accuracy on\nGitHub-Python (+28.5%) and 71.7% on DeepFix (+5.6%). Notably, BIFI does not\nrequire any labeled data; we hope it will be a strong starting point for\nunsupervised learning of various repair tasks.",

It has been increasingly widely adopted as a tool in the\nsocial sciences, including political science, digital humanities and\nsociological research in general. One desirable property of topic models is to\nallow users to find topics describing a specific aspect of the corpus. A\npossible solution is to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into topic\nmodeling, but this requires a specification from domain experts. We propose a\nnovel query-driven topic model that allows users to specify a simple query in\nwords or phrases and return query-related topics, thus avoiding tedious work\nfrom domain experts. Our proposed approach is particularly attractive when the\nuser-specified query has a low occurrence in a text corpus, making it difficult\nfor traditional topic models built on word cooccurrence patterns to identify\nrelevant topics.

          "description": "The recent rise of privacy concerns has led researchers to devise methods for\nprivate neural inference -- where inferences are made directly on encrypted\ndata, never seeing inputs. The primary challenge facing private inference is\nthat computing on encrypted data levies an impractically-high latency penalty,\nstemming mostly from non-linear operators like ReLU. Enabling practical and\nprivate inference requires new optimization methods that minimize network ReLU\ncounts while preserving accuracy. This paper proposes DeepReDuce: a set of\noptimizations for the judicious removal of ReLUs to reduce private inference\nlatency. The key insight is that not all ReLUs contribute equally to accuracy.\nWe leverage this insight to drop, or remove, ReLUs from classic networks to\nsignificantly reduce inference latency and maintain high accuracy. Given a\ntarget network, DeepReDuce outputs a Pareto frontier of networks that tradeoff\nthe number of ReLUs and accuracy. Compared to the state-of-the-art for private\ninference DeepReDuce improves accuracy and reduces ReLU count by up to 3.5%\n(iso-ReLU count) and 3.5$\\times$ (iso-accuracy), respectively.",

          "description": "The classical Langevin Monte Carlo method looks for i.i.d. samples from a\ntarget distribution by descending along the gradient of the target\ndistribution. It is popular partially due to its fast convergence rate.\nHowever, the numerical cost is sometimes high because the gradient can be hard\nto obtain. One approach to eliminate the gradient computation is to employ the\nconcept of \"ensemble\", where a large number of particles are evolved together\nso that the neighboring particles provide gradient information to each other.\nIn this article, we discuss two algorithms that integrate the ensemble feature\ninto LMC, and the associated properties. There are two sides of our discovery:\n\n1. By directly surrogating the gradient using the ensemble approximation, we\ndevelop Ensemble Langevin Monte Carlo. We show that this method is unstable due\nto a potentially small denominator that induces high variance. We provide a\ncounterexample to explicitly show this instability.\n\n2. We then change the strategy and enact the ensemble approximation to the\ngradient only in a constrained manner, to eliminate the unstable points. The\nalgorithm is termed Constrained Ensemble Langevin Monte Carlo. We show that,\nwith a proper tuning, the surrogation takes place often enough to bring the\nreasonable numerical saving, while the induced error is still low enough for us\nto maintain the fast convergence rate, up to a controllable discretization and\nensemble error.\n\nSuch combination of ensemble method and LMC shed light on inventing\ngradient-free algorithms that produce i.i.d. samples almost exponentially fast.",

          "description": "\\textit{Stochastic gradient descent} (SGD) is of fundamental importance in\ndeep learning. Despite its simplicity, elucidating its efficacy remains\nchallenging. Conventionally, the success of SGD is attributed to the\n\\textit{stochastic gradient noise} (SGN) incurred in the training process.\nBased on this general consensus, SGD is frequently treated and analyzed as the\nEuler-Maruyama discretization of a \\textit{stochastic differential equation}\n(SDE) driven by either Brownian or L\\'evy stable motion. In this study, we\nargue that SGN is neither Gaussian nor stable. Instead, inspired by the\nlong-time correlation emerging in SGN series, we propose that SGD can be viewed\nas a discretization of an SDE driven by \\textit{fractional Brownian motion}\n(FBM). Accordingly, the different convergence behavior of SGD dynamics is well\ngrounded. Moreover, the first passage time of an SDE driven by FBM is\napproximately derived. This indicates a lower escaping rate for a larger Hurst\nparameter, and thus SGD stays longer in flat minima. This happens to coincide\nwith the well-known phenomenon that SGD favors flat minima that generalize\nwell. Four groups of experiments are conducted to validate our conjecture, and\nit is demonstrated that long-range memory effects persist across various model\narchitectures, datasets, and training strategies. Our study opens up a new\nperspective and may contribute to a better understanding of SGD.",

The amount of\npatterns stored in the buffer is a critical parameter which largely influences\nthe final performance and the memory footprint of the approach. This work\nintroduces Distilled Replay, a novel replay strategy for Continual Learning\nwhich is able to mitigate forgetting by keeping a very small buffer (1 pattern\nper class) of highly informative samples. Distilled Replay builds the buffer\nthrough a distillation process which compresses a large dataset into a tiny set\nof informative examples.

          "description": "Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithms are extensively\nutilized in modern data science, and seek to partition the dataset into\nclusters while generating a hierarchical relationship between the data samples.\nHAC algorithms are employed in many applications, such as biology, natural\nlanguage processing, and recommender systems. Thus, it is imperative to ensure\nthat these algorithms are fair -- even if the dataset contains biases against\ncertain protected groups, the cluster outputs generated should not discriminate\nagainst samples from any of these groups. However, recent work in clustering\nfairness has mostly focused on center-based clustering algorithms, such as\nk-median and k-means clustering. In this paper, we propose fair algorithms for\nperforming HAC that enforce fairness constraints 1) irrespective of the\ndistance linkage criteria used, 2) generalize to any natural measures of\nclustering fairness for HAC, 3) work for multiple protected groups, and 4) have\ncompetitive running times to vanilla HAC.

A temporary clustering model is built at\nthe first phase; then, it is gradually updated by analyzing consecutive memory\nloads of points. Subsequently, at the end of scalable clustering, the\napproximate structure of the original clusters is obtained. Finally, by another\nscan of the entire dataset and using a suitable criterion, an outlying score is\nassigned to each object called SDCOR (Scalable Density-based Clustering\nOutlierness Ratio). Evaluations on real-life and synthetic datasets demonstrate\nthat the proposed method has a low linear time complexity and is more effective\nand efficient compared to best-known conventional density-based methods, which\nneed to load all data into the memory; and also, to some fast distance-based\nmethods, which can perform on data resident in the disk.",

          "description": "Deep ensembles have recently gained popularity in the deep learning community\nfor their conceptual simplicity and efficiency. However, maintaining functional\ndiversity between ensemble members that are independently trained with gradient\ndescent is challenging. This can lead to pathologies when adding more ensemble\nmembers, such as a saturation of the ensemble performance, which converges to\nthe performance of a single model. Moreover, this does not only affect the\nquality of its predictions, but even more so the uncertainty estimates of the\nensemble, and thus its performance on out-of-distribution data. We hypothesize\nthat this limitation can be overcome by discouraging different ensemble members\nfrom collapsing to the same function. To this end, we introduce a kernelized\nrepulsive term in the update rule of the deep ensembles. We show that this\nsimple modification not only enforces and maintains diversity among the members\nbut, even more importantly, transforms the maximum a posteriori inference into\nproper Bayesian inference. Namely, we show that the training dynamics of our\nproposed repulsive ensembles follow a Wasserstein gradient flow of the KL\ndivergence with the true posterior. We study repulsive terms in weight and\nfunction space and empirically compare their performance to standard ensembles\nand Bayesian baselines on synthetic and real-world prediction tasks.",

          "description": "Federated learning is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables\nmultiple devices to train models locally and formulate a global model, without\nsharing the clients' local data. A federated learning system can be viewed as a\nlarge-scale distributed system, involving different components and stakeholders\nwith diverse requirements and constraints. Hence, developing a federated\nlearning system requires both software system design thinking and machine\nlearning knowledge. Although much effort has been put into federated learning\nfrom the machine learning perspectives, our previous systematic literature\nreview on the area shows that there is a distinct lack of considerations for\nsoftware architecture design for federated learning. In this paper, we propose\nFLRA, a reference architecture for federated learning systems, which provides a\ntemplate design for federated learning-based solutions. The proposed FLRA\nreference architecture is based on an extensive review of existing patterns of\nfederated learning systems found in the literature and existing industrial\nimplementation. The FLRA reference architecture consists of a pool of\narchitectural patterns that could address the frequently recurring design\nproblems in federated learning architectures. The FLRA reference architecture\ncan serve as a design guideline to assist architects and developers with\npractical solutions for their problems, which can be further customised.",

          "description": "Graph representation learning is a fundamental problem for modeling\nrelational data and benefits a number of downstream applications. Traditional\nBayesian-based graph models and recent deep learning based GNN either suffer\nfrom impracticability or lack interpretability, thus combined models for\nundirected graphs have been proposed to overcome the weaknesses. As a large\nportion of real-world graphs are directed graphs (of which undirected graphs\nare special cases), in this paper, we propose a Deep Latent Space Model (DLSM)\nfor directed graphs to incorporate the traditional latent variable based\ngenerative model into deep learning frameworks. Our proposed model consists of\na graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder and a stochastic decoder, which are\nlayer-wise connected by a hierarchical variational auto-encoder architecture.\nBy specifically modeling the degree heterogeneity using node random factors,\nour model possesses better interpretability in both community structure and\ndegree heterogeneity. For fast inference, the stochastic gradient variational\nBayes (SGVB) is adopted using a non-iterative recognition model, which is much\nmore scalable than traditional MCMC-based methods. The experiments on\nreal-world datasets show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformances on both link prediction and community detection tasks while\nlearning interpretable node embeddings.

          "description": "Treatment effect estimation from observational data is a fundamental problem\nin causal inference. There are two very different schools of thought that have\ntackled this problem. On the one hand, the Pearlian framework commonly assumes\nstructural knowledge (provided by an expert) in the form of Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) and provides graphical criteria such as the back-door criterion\nto identify the valid adjustment sets. On the other hand, the potential\noutcomes (PO) framework commonly assumes that all the observed features satisfy\nignorability (i.e., no hidden confounding), which in general is untestable. In\nthis work, we take steps to bridge these two frameworks. We show that even if\nwe know only one parent of the treatment variable (provided by an expert), then\nquite remarkably it suffices to test a broad class of (but not all) back-door\ncriteria. Importantly, we also cover the non-trivial case where the entire set\nof observed features is not ignorable (generalizing the PO framework) without\nrequiring all the parents of the treatment variable to be observed. Our key\ntechnical idea involves a more general result -- Given a synthetic sub-sampling\n(or environment) variable that is a function of the parent variable, we show\nthat an invariance test involving this sub-sampling variable is equivalent to\ntesting a broad class of back-door criteria. We demonstrate our approach on\nsynthetic data as well as real causal effect estimation benchmarks.",

          "description": "In multi-label classification, where a single example may be associated with\nseveral class labels at the same time, the ability to model dependencies\nbetween labels is considered crucial to effectively optimize non-decomposable\nevaluation measures, such as the Subset 0/1 loss. The gradient boosting\nframework provides a well-studied foundation for learning models that are\nspecifically tailored to such a loss function and recent research attests the\nability to achieve high predictive accuracy in the multi-label setting. The\nutilization of second-order derivatives, as used by many recent boosting\napproaches, helps to guide the minimization of non-decomposable losses, due to\nthe information about pairs of labels it incorporates into the optimization\nprocess. On the downside, this comes with high computational costs, even if the\nnumber of labels is small. In this work, we address the computational\nbottleneck of such approach -- the need to solve a system of linear equations\n-- by integrating a novel approximation technique into the boosting procedure.\nBased on the derivatives computed during training, we dynamically group the\nlabels into a predefined number of bins to impose an upper bound on the\ndimensionality of the linear system. Our experiments, using an existing\nrule-based algorithm, suggest that this may boost the speed of training,\nwithout any significant loss in predictive performance.",

          "description": "In high energy physics (HEP), jets are collections of correlated particles\nproduced ubiquitously in particle collisions such as those at the CERN Large\nHadron Collider (LHC). Machine-learning-based generative models, such as\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs), have the potential to significantly\naccelerate LHC jet simulations. However, despite jets having a natural\nrepresentation as a set of particles in momentum-space, a.k.a. a particle\ncloud, to our knowledge there exist no generative models applied to such a\ndataset. We introduce a new particle cloud dataset (JetNet), and, due to\nsimilarities between particle and point clouds, apply to it existing point\ncloud GANs. Results are evaluated using (1) the 1-Wasserstein distance between\nhigh- and low-level feature distributions, (2) a newly developed Fr\\'{e}chet\nParticleNet Distance, and (3) the coverage and (4) minimum matching distance\nmetrics. Existing GANs are found to be inadequate for physics applications,\nhence we develop a new message passing GAN (MPGAN), which outperforms existing\npoint cloud GANs on virtually every metric and shows promise for use in HEP. We\npropose JetNet as a novel point-cloud-style dataset for the machine learning\ncommunity to experiment with, and set MPGAN as a benchmark to improve upon for\nfuture generative models.",

          "description": "Several recent studies have shown that Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based\nclassifiers are vulnerable against model extraction attacks. In model\nextraction attacks, an adversary exploits the target classifier to create a\nsurrogate classifier imitating the target classifier with respect to some\ncriteria. In this paper, we investigate the hardness degree of samples and\ndemonstrate that the hardness degree histogram of model extraction attacks\nsamples is distinguishable from the hardness degree histogram of normal\nsamples. Normal samples come from the target classifier's training data\ndistribution. As the training process of DNN-based classifiers is done in\nseveral epochs, we can consider this process as a sequence of subclassifiers so\nthat each subclassifier is created at the end of an epoch. We use the sequence\nof subclassifiers to calculate the hardness degree of samples. We investigate\nthe relation between hardness degree of samples and the trust in the classifier\noutputs. We propose Hardness-Oriented Detection Approach (HODA) to detect the\nsample sequences of model extraction attacks. The results demonstrate that HODA\ncan detect the sample sequences of model extraction attacks with a high success\nrate by only watching 100 attack samples. We also investigate the hardness\ndegree of adversarial examples and indicate that the hardness degree histogram\nof adversarial examples is distinct from the hardness degree histogram of\nnormal samples.",

To\nbetter address these challenges, we propose a new method, dubbed as SSUL-M\n(Semantic Segmentation with Unknown Label with Memory), by carefully combining\nseveral techniques tailored for semantic segmentation. More specifically, we\nmake three main contributions; (1) modeling unknown class within the background\nclass to help learning future classes (help plasticity), (2) freezing backbone\nnetwork and past classifiers with binary cross-entropy loss and pseudo-labeling\nto overcome catastrophic forgetting (help stability), and (3) utilizing tiny\nexemplar memory for the first time in CISS to improve both plasticity and\nstability. As a result, we show our method achieves significantly better\nperformance than the recent state-of-the-art baselines on the standard\nbenchmark datasets. Furthermore, we justify our contributions with thorough and\nextensive ablation analyses and discuss different natures of the CISS problem\ncompared to the standard class-incremental learning for classification.",

          "description": "Bilevel optimization recently has attracted increased interest in machine\nlearning due to its many applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and\npolicy optimization. Although some methods recently have been proposed to solve\nthe bilevel problems, these methods do not consider using adaptive learning\nrates. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a class of fast and effective\nadaptive methods for solving bilevel optimization problems that the outer\nproblem is possibly nonconvex and the inner problem is strongly-convex.\nSpecifically, we propose a fast single-loop BiAdam algorithm based on the basic\nmomentum technique, which achieves a sample complexity of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ for finding an $\\epsilon$-stationary point. At the\nsame time, we propose an accelerated version of BiAdam algorithm (VR-BiAdam) by\nusing variance reduced technique, which reaches the best known sample\ncomplexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$. To further reduce computation in\nestimating derivatives, we propose a fast single-loop stochastic approximated\nBiAdam algorithm (saBiAdam) by avoiding the Hessian inverse, which still\nachieves a sample complexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ without large\nbatches. We further present an accelerated version of saBiAdam algorithm\n(VR-saBiAdam), which also reaches the best known sample complexity of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$. We apply the unified adaptive matrices to our\nmethods as the SUPER-ADAM \\citep{huang2021super}, which including many types of\nadaptive learning rates. Moreover, our framework can flexibly use the momentum\nand variance reduced techniques. In particular, we provide a useful convergence\nanalysis framework for both the constrained and unconstrained bilevel\noptimization.

However,\na key question remains: is an explicit 3D structure based place representation\nalways superior to an implicit ``spatial'' representation based on sequence of\nRGB images which can inherently learn scene structure. In this extended\nabstract, we attempt to compare these two types of methods by considering a\nsimilar ``metric span'' to represent places. We compare a 3D point cloud based\nmethod (PointNetVLAD) with image sequence based methods (SeqNet and others) and\nshowcase that image sequence based techniques approach, and can even surpass,\nthe performance achieved by point cloud based methods for a given metric span.\nThese performance variations can be attributed to differences in data richness\nof input sensors as well as data accumulation strategies for a mobile robot.\nWhile a perfect apple-to-apple comparison may not be feasible for these two\ndifferent modalities, the presented comparison takes a step in the direction of\nanswering deeper questions regarding spatial representations, relevant to\nseveral applications like Autonomous Driving and Augmented/Virtual Reality.\nSource code available publicly https://github.com/oravus/seqNet.",

          "description": "Kernel segmentation aims at partitioning a data sequence into several\nnon-overlapping segments that may have nonlinear and complex structures. In\ngeneral, it is formulated as a discrete optimization problem with combinatorial\nconstraints. A popular algorithm for optimally solving this problem is dynamic\nprogramming (DP), which has quadratic computation and memory requirements.\nGiven that sequences in practice are too long, this algorithm is not a\npractical approach. Although many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to\napproximate the optimal segmentation, they have no guarantee on the quality of\ntheir solutions. In this paper, we take a differentiable approach to alleviate\nthe aforementioned issues. First, we introduce a novel sigmoid-based\nregularization to smoothly approximate the combinatorial constraints. Combining\nit with objective of the balanced kernel clustering, we formulate a\ndifferentiable model termed Kernel clustering with sigmoid-based regularization\n(KCSR), where the gradient-based algorithm can be exploited to obtain the\noptimal segmentation. Second, we develop a stochastic variant of the proposed\nmodel. By using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which has much lower\ntime and space complexities, for optimization, the second model can perform\nsegmentation on overlong data sequences. Finally, for simultaneously segmenting\nmultiple data sequences, we slightly modify the sigmoid-based regularization to\nfurther introduce an extended variant of the proposed model. Through extensive\nexperiments on various types of data sequences performances of our models are\nevaluated and compared with those of the existing methods. The experimental\nresults validate advantages of the proposed models. Our Matlab source code is\navailable on github.",

          "description": "Coronary X-ray angiography is a crucial clinical procedure for the diagnosis\nand treatment of coronary artery disease, which accounts for roughly 16% of\nglobal deaths every year. However, the images acquired in these procedures have\nlow resolution and poor contrast, making lesion detection and assessment\nchallenging. Accurate coronary artery segmentation not only helps mitigate\nthese problems, but also allows the extraction of relevant anatomical features\nfor further analysis by quantitative methods. Although automated segmentation\nof coronary arteries has been proposed before, previous approaches have used\nnon-optimal segmentation criteria, leading to less useful results. Most methods\neither segment only the major vessel, discarding important information from the\nremaining ones, or segment the whole coronary tree based mostly on contrast\ninformation, producing a noisy output that includes vessels that are not\nrelevant for diagnosis. We adopt a better-suited clinical criterion and segment\nvessels according to their clinical relevance. Additionally, we simultaneously\nperform catheter segmentation, which may be useful for diagnosis due to the\nscale factor provided by the catheter's known diameter, and is a task that has\nnot yet been performed with good results. To derive the optimal approach, we\nconducted an extensive comparative study of encoder-decoder architectures\ntrained on a combination of focal loss and a variant of generalized dice loss.\nBased on the EfficientNet and the UNet++ architectures, we propose a line of\nefficient and high-performance segmentation models using a new decoder\narchitecture, the EfficientUNet++, whose best-performing version achieved\naverage dice scores of 0.8904 and 0.7526 for the artery and catheter classes,\nrespectively, and an average generalized dice score of 0.9234.",

What aspects of a\nvisual task does attention help to deal with? We aim to answer this with a\ncomputational experiment based on a general framework called task-oriented\nablation design. First we define a broad range of visual tasks and identify six\nfactors that underlie task variability.

          "description": "This paper develops an efficient procedure for designing low-complexity\ncodebooks for precoding in a full-dimension (FD) multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) system with a uniform planar array (UPA) antenna at the transmitter (Tx)\nusing tensor learning. In particular, instead of using statistical channel\nmodels, we utilize a model-free data-driven approach with foundations in\nmachine learning to generate codebooks that adapt to the surrounding\npropagation conditions. We use a tensor representation of the FD-MIMO channel\nand exploit its properties to design quantized version of the channel\nprecoders. We find the best representation of the optimal precoder as a\nfunction of Kronecker Product (KP) of two low-dimensional precoders,\nrespectively corresponding to the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the\nUPA, obtained from the tensor decomposition of the channel. We then quantize\nthis precoder to design product codebooks such that an average loss in mutual\ninformation due to quantization of channel state information (CSI) is\nminimized. The key technical contribution lies in exploiting the constraints on\nthe precoders to reduce the product codebook design problem to an unsupervised\nclustering problem on a Cartesian Product Grassmann manifold (CPM), where the\ncluster centroids form a finite-sized precoder codebook. This codebook can be\nfound efficiently by running a $K$-means clustering on the CPM.

          "description": "Moving Object Detection (MOD) is a crucial task for the Autonomous Driving\npipeline. MOD is usually handled via 2-stream convolutional architectures that\nincorporates both appearance and motion cues, without considering the\ninter-relations between the spatial or motion features. In this paper, we\ntackle this problem through multi-head attention mechanisms, both across the\nspatial and motion streams. We propose MODETR; a Moving Object DEtection\nTRansformer network, comprised of multi-stream transformer encoders for both\nspatial and motion modalities, and an object transformer decoder that produces\nthe moving objects bounding boxes using set predictions. The whole architecture\nis trained end-to-end using bi-partite loss. Several methods of incorporating\nmotion cues with the Transformer model are explored, including two-stream RGB\nand Optical Flow (OF) methods, and multi-stream architectures that take\nadvantage of sequence information. To incorporate the temporal information, we\npropose a new Temporal Positional Encoding (TPE) approach to extend the Spatial\nPositional Encoding(SPE) in DETR. We explore two architectural choices for\nthat, balancing between speed and time. To evaluate the our network, we perform\nthe MOD task on the KITTI MOD [6] data set. Results show significant 5% mAP of\nthe Transformer network for MOD over the state-of-the art methods. Moreover,\nthe proposed TPE encoding provides 10% mAP improvement over the SPE baseline.",

          "description": "In the text processing context, most ML models are built on word embeddings.\nThese embeddings are themselves trained on some datasets, potentially\ncontaining sensitive data. In some cases this training is done independently,\nin other cases, it occurs as part of training a larger, task-specific model. In\neither case, it is of interest to consider membership inference attacks based\non the embedding layer as a way of understanding sensitive information leakage.\nBut, somewhat surprisingly, membership inference attacks on word embeddings and\ntheir effect in other natural language processing (NLP) tasks that use these\nembeddings, have remained relatively unexplored.\n\nIn this work, we show that word embeddings are vulnerable to black-box\nmembership inference attacks under realistic assumptions. Furthermore, we show\nthat this leakage persists through two other major NLP applications:\nclassification and text-generation, even when the embedding layer is not\nexposed to the attacker. We show that our MI attack achieves high attack\naccuracy against a classifier model and an LSTM-based language model. Indeed,\nour attack is a cheaper membership inference attack on text-generative models,\nwhich does not require the knowledge of the target model or any expensive\ntraining of text-generative models as shadow models.",

We show that for any signal strength $\\lambda > 1$ (the weak-recovery\nthreshold), there exists a unique local minimizer of the TAP free energy\nfunctional near the mean of the Bayes posterior law. Furthermore, the TAP free\nenergy in a local neighborhood of this minimizer is strongly convex.\nConsequently, a natural-gradient/mirror-descent algorithm achieves linear\nconvergence to this minimizer from a local initialization, which may be\nobtained by a finite number of iterates of Approximate Message Passing (AMP).\nThis provides a rigorous foundation for variational inference in high\ndimensions via minimization of the TAP free energy.\n\nWe also analyze the finite-sample convergence of AMP, showing that AMP is\nasymptotically stable at the TAP minimizer for any $\\lambda > 1$, and is\nlinearly convergent to this minimizer from a spectral initialization for\nsufficiently large $\\lambda$. Such a guarantee is stronger than results\nobtainable by state evolution analyses, which only describe a fixed number of\nAMP iterations in the infinite-sample limit.\n\nOur proofs combine the Kac-Rice formula and Sudakov-Fernique Gaussian\ncomparison inequality to analyze the complexity of critical points that satisfy\nstrong convexity and stability conditions within their local neighborhoods.",

          "description": "The study of provable adversarial robustness for deep neural network (DNN)\nmodels has mainly focused on static supervised learning tasks such as image\nclassification. However, DNNs have been used extensively in real-world adaptive\ntasks such as reinforcement learning (RL), making RL systems vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks. The key challenge in adversarial RL is that the attacker\ncan adapt itself to the defense strategy used by the agent in previous\ntime-steps to strengthen its attack in future steps. In this work, we study the\nprovable robustness of RL against norm-bounded adversarial perturbations of the\ninputs. We focus on smoothing-based provable defenses and propose policy\nsmoothing where the agent adds a Gaussian noise to its observation at each\ntime-step before applying the policy network to make itself less sensitive to\nadversarial perturbations of its inputs. Our main theoretical contribution is\nto prove an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma where the adversarial\nperturbation at a particular time can be a stochastic function of current and\nprevious observations and states as well as previously observed actions. Using\nthis lemma, we adapt the robustness certificates produced by randomized\nsmoothing in the static setting of image classification to the dynamic setting\nof RL. We generate certificates that guarantee that the total reward obtained\nby the smoothed policy will not fall below a certain threshold under a\nnorm-bounded adversarial perturbation of the input. We show that our\ncertificates are tight by constructing a worst-case setting that achieves the\nbounds derived in our analysis. In our experiments, we show that this method\ncan yield meaningful certificates in complex environments demonstrating its\neffectiveness against adversarial attacks.",

We consider the notion of universal representations in which one may\nfix an encoder and vary the decoder to achieve any point within a collection of\ndistortion and perception constraints. We prove that the corresponding\ninformation-theoretic universal rate-distortion-perception function is\noperationally achievable in an approximate sense. Under MSE distortion, we show\nthat the entire distortion-perception tradeoff of a Gaussian source can be\nachieved by a single encoder of the same rate asymptotically. We then\ncharacterize the achievable distortion-perception region for a fixed\nrepresentation in the case of arbitrary distributions, identify conditions\nunder which the aforementioned results continue to hold approximately, and\nstudy the case when the rate is not fixed in advance. This motivates the study\nof practical constructions that are approximately universal across the RDP\ntradeoff, thereby alleviating the need to design a new encoder for each\nobjective. We provide experimental results on MNIST and SVHN suggesting that on\nimage compression tasks, the operational tradeoffs achieved by machine learning\nmodels with a fixed encoder suffer only a small penalty when compared to their\nvariable encoder counterparts.",

          "description": "Multi-relational graph is a ubiquitous and important data structure, allowing\nflexible representation of multiple types of interactions and relations between\nentities. Similar to other graph-structured data, link prediction is one of the\nmost important tasks on multi-relational graphs and is often used for knowledge\ncompletion. When related graphs coexist, it is of great benefit to build a\nlarger graph via integrating the smaller ones. The integration requires\npredicting hidden relational connections between entities belonged to different\ngraphs (inter-domain link prediction). However, this poses a real challenge to\nexisting methods that are exclusively designed for link prediction between\nentities of the same graph only (intra-domain link prediction). In this study,\nwe propose a new approach to tackle the inter-domain link prediction problem by\nsoftly aligning the entity distributions between different domains with optimal\ntransport and maximum mean discrepancy regularizers. Experiments on real-world\ndatasets show that optimal transport regularizer is beneficial and considerably\nimproves the performance of baseline methods.",

          "description": "Existing tensor completion formulation mostly relies on partial observations\nfrom a single tensor. However, tensors extracted from real-world data are often\nmore complex due to: (i) Partial observation: Only a small subset (e.g., 5%) of\ntensor elements are available. (ii) Coarse observation: Some tensor modes only\npresent coarse and aggregated patterns (e.g., monthly summary instead of daily\nreports). In this paper, we are given a subset of the tensor and some\naggregated/coarse observations (along one or more modes) and seek to recover\nthe original fine-granular tensor with low-rank factorization. We formulate a\ncoupled tensor completion problem and propose an efficient Multi-resolution\nTensor Completion model (MTC) to solve the problem. Our MTC model explores\ntensor mode properties and leverages the hierarchy of resolutions to\nrecursively initialize an optimization setup, and optimizes on the coupled\nsystem using alternating least squares. MTC ensures low computational and space\ncomplexity. We evaluate our model on two COVID-19 related spatio-temporal\ntensors. The experiments show that MTC could provide 65.20% and 75.79%\npercentage of fitness (PoF) in tensor completion with only 5% fine granular\nobservations, which is 27.96% relative improvement over the best baseline. To\nevaluate the learned low-rank factors, we also design a tensor prediction task\nfor daily and cumulative disease case predictions, where MTC achieves 50% in\nPoF and 30% relative improvements over the best baseline.",

HMMs are no exception to this, with recent results highlighting\nquantum implementations of deterministic HMMs exhibiting superior memory and\nthermal efficiency relative to their classical counterparts.

Model's\nconfidences and Dropout, as a popular way to estimate the model's uncertainty,\nhave been used for AE detection but they showed limited success against black-\nand gray-box attacks. Moreover, the state-of-the-art detection techniques have\nbeen designed for specific attacks or broken by others, need knowledge about\nthe attacks, are not consistent, increase model parameters overhead, are\ntime-consuming, or have latency in inference time. To trade off these factors,\nwe revisit the model's uncertainty and confidences and propose a novel\nunsupervised ensemble AE detection mechanism that 1) uses the uncertainty\nmethod called SelectiveNet, 2) processes model layers outputs, i.e.feature\nmaps, to generate new confidence probabilities. The detection method is called\nSelective and Feature based Adversarial Detection (SFAD). Experimental results\nshow that the proposed approach achieves better performance against black- and\ngray-box attacks than the state-of-the-art methods and achieves comparable\nperformance against white-box attacks.

Adaptive control laws can endow even nonlinear\nsystems with good trajectory tracking performance, provided that any uncertain\ndynamics terms are linearly parameterizable with known nonlinear features.\nHowever, it is often difficult to specify such features a priori, such as for\naerodynamic disturbances on rotorcraft or interaction forces between a\nmanipulator arm and various objects. In this paper, we turn to data-driven\nmodeling with neural networks to learn, offline from past data, an adaptive\ncontroller with an internal parametric model of these nonlinear features. Our\nkey insight is that we can better prepare the controller for deployment with\ncontrol-oriented meta-learning of features in closed-loop simulation, rather\nthan regression-oriented meta-learning of features to fit input-output data.\nSpecifically, we meta-learn the adaptive controller with closed-loop tracking\nsimulation as the base-learner and the average tracking error as the\nmeta-objective. With a nonlinear planar rotorcraft subject to wind, we\ndemonstrate that our adaptive controller outperforms other controllers trained\nwith regression-oriented meta-learning when deployed in closed-loop for\ntrajectory tracking control.",

          "description": "Action-value estimation is a critical component of many reinforcement\nlearning (RL) methods whereby sample complexity relies heavily on how fast a\ngood estimator for action value can be learned. By viewing this problem through\nthe lens of representation learning, good representations of both state and\naction can facilitate action-value estimation. While advances in deep learning\nhave seamlessly driven progress in learning state representations, given the\nspecificity of the notion of agency to RL, little attention has been paid to\nlearning action representations. We conjecture that leveraging the\ncombinatorial structure of multi-dimensional action spaces is a key ingredient\nfor learning good representations of action. To test this, we set forth the\naction hypergraph networks framework -- a class of functions for learning\naction representations in multi-dimensional discrete action spaces with a\nstructural inductive bias.

          "description": "Contrastive loss and its variants have become very popular recently for\nlearning visual representations without supervision. In this work, we study\nthree intriguing properties of contrastive learning. We first generalize the\nstandard contrastive loss to a broader family of losses, and we find that\nvarious instantiations of the generalized loss perform similarly under the\npresence of a multi-layer non-linear projection head. We then study if\ninstance-based contrastive learning (such as in SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, and so on,\nwhich are based on global image representation) can learn well on images with\nmultiple objects present. We find that meaningful hierarchical local features\ncan be learned despite the fact that these objectives operate on global\ninstance-level features.\n\nFinally, we study an intriguing phenomenon of feature suppression among\ncompeting features shared across augmented views, such as \"color distribution\"\nvs \"object class\". We construct datasets with explicit and controllable\ncompeting features, and show that, for contrastive learning, a few bits of\neasy-to-learn shared features can suppress, and even fully prevent, the\nlearning of other sets of competing features. In scenarios where there are\nmultiple objects in an image, the dominant object would suppress the learning\nof smaller objects. Existing contrastive learning methods critically rely on\ndata augmentation to favor certain sets of features over others, and face\npotential limitation for scenarios where existing augmentations cannot fully\naddress the feature suppression. This poses open challenges to existing\ncontrastive learning techniques.",

The prior is directly proportional to the Bayesian\nposterior for functions that give zero error on a test set. For the case of\nimage classification, we show that $\\log P(f)$ is a significantly more robust\npredictor of generalization than flatness measures are.\n\nWhilst local flatness measures fail under parameter re-scaling, the\nprior/posterior, which is global quantity, remains invariant under re-scaling.\nMoreover, the correlation with generalization as a function of data complexity\nremains good for different variants of SGD.",

          "description": "Obtaining an explanation for an SQL query result can enrich the analysis\nexperience, reveal data errors, and provide deeper insight into the data.\nInference query explanation seeks to explain unexpected aggregate query results\non inference data; such queries are challenging to explain because an\nexplanation may need to be derived from the source, training, or inference data\nin an ML pipeline. In this paper, we model an objective function as a black-box\nfunction and propose BOExplain, a novel framework for explaining inference\nqueries using Bayesian optimization (BO). An explanation is a predicate\ndefining the input tuples that should be removed so that the query result of\ninterest is significantly affected. BO - a technique for finding the global\noptimum of a black-box function - is used to find the best predicate. We\ndevelop two new techniques (individual contribution encoding and warm start) to\nhandle categorical variables. We perform experiments showing that the\npredicates found by BOExplain have a higher degree of explanation compared to\nthose found by the state-of-the-art query explanation engines. We also show\nthat BOExplain is effective at deriving explanations for inference queries from\nsource and training data on a variety of real-world datasets.

          "description": "The rise of algorithmic decision-making has spawned much research on fair\nmachine learning (ML). Financial institutions use ML for building risk\nscorecards that support a range of credit-related decisions. Yet, the\nliterature on fair ML in credit scoring is scarce. The paper makes three\ncontributions. First, we revisit statistical fairness criteria and examine\ntheir adequacy for credit scoring. Second, we catalog algorithmic options for\nincorporating fairness goals in the ML model development pipeline. Last, we\nempirically compare different fairness processors in a profit-oriented credit\nscoring context using real-world data. The empirical results substantiate the\nevaluation of fairness measures, identify suitable options to implement fair\ncredit scoring, and clarify the profit-fairness trade-off in lending decisions.\nWe find that multiple fairness criteria can be approximately satisfied at once\nand recommend separation as a proper criterion for measuring the fairness of a\nscorecard. We also find fair in-processors to deliver a good balance between\nprofit and fairness and show that algorithmic discrimination can be reduced to\na reasonable level at a relatively low cost.

          "description": "Recently, sound-based COVID-19 detection studies have shown great promise to\nachieve scalable and prompt digital pre-screening. However, there are still two\nunsolved issues hindering the practice. First, collected datasets for model\ntraining are often imbalanced, with a considerably smaller proportion of users\ntested positive, making it harder to learn representative and robust features.\nSecond, deep learning models are generally overconfident in their predictions.\nClinically, false predictions aggravate healthcare costs. Estimation of the\nuncertainty of screening would aid this. To handle these issues, we propose an\nensemble framework where multiple deep learning models for sound-based COVID-19\ndetection are developed from different but balanced subsets from original data.\nAs such, data are utilized more effectively compared to traditional up-sampling\nand down-sampling approaches: an AUC of 0.74 with a sensitivity of 0.68 and a\nspecificity of 0.69 is achieved. Simultaneously, we estimate uncertainty from\nthe disagreement across multiple models. It is shown that false predictions\noften yield higher uncertainty, enabling us to suggest the users with certainty\nhigher than a threshold to repeat the audio test on their phones or to take\nclinical tests if digital diagnosis still fails. This study paves the way for a\nmore robust sound-based COVID-19 automated screening system.",

          "description": "Post-hoc gradient-based interpretability methods [Simonyan et al., 2013,\nSmilkov et al., 2017] that provide instance-specific explanations of model\npredictions are often based on assumption (A): magnitude of input gradients --\ngradients of logits with respect to input -- noisily highlight discriminative\ntask-relevant features. In this work, we test the validity of assumption (A)\nusing a three-pronged approach. First, we develop an evaluation framework,\nDiffROAR, to test assumption (A) on four image classification benchmarks. Our\nresults suggest that (i) input gradients of standard models (i.e., trained on\noriginal data) may grossly violate (A), whereas (ii) input gradients of\nadversarially robust models satisfy (A). Second, we then introduce BlockMNIST,\nan MNIST-based semi-real dataset, that by design encodes a priori knowledge of\ndiscriminative features. Our analysis on BlockMNIST leverages this information\nto validate as well as characterize differences between input gradient\nattributions of standard and robust models. Finally, we theoretically prove\nthat our empirical findings hold on a simplified version of the BlockMNIST\ndataset. Specifically, we prove that input gradients of standard\none-hidden-layer MLPs trained on this dataset do not highlight\ninstance-specific signal coordinates, thus grossly violating assumption (A).\nOur findings motivate the need to formalize and test common assumptions in\ninterpretability in a falsifiable manner [Leavitt and Morcos, 2020].\nAdditionally, we believe that the DiffROAR evaluation framework and\nBlockMNIST-based datasets can serve as sanity checks to audit instance-specific\ninterpretability methods.",

A promising approach to solve both of these problems is\na self-attention bottleneck, which provides a simple and effective framework\nfor learning high performing policies, even in the presence of distractions.\nHowever, due to poor scalability of attention architectures, these methods do\nnot scale beyond low resolution visual inputs, using large patches (thus small\nattention matrices). In this paper we make use of new efficient attention\nalgorithms, recently shown to be highly effective for Transformers, and\ndemonstrate that these new techniques can be applied in the RL setting. This\nallows our attention-based controllers to scale to larger visual inputs, and\nfacilitate the use of smaller patches, even individual pixels, improving\ngeneralization. In addition, we propose a new efficient algorithm approximating\nsoftmax attention with what we call hybrid random features, leveraging the\ntheory of angular kernels.

However, while existing video prediction models have produced\npromising results on small datasets, they suffer from severe underfitting when\ntrained on large and diverse datasets. To address this underfitting challenge,\nwe first observe that the ability to train larger video prediction models is\noften bottlenecked by the memory constraints of GPUs or TPUs. In parallel, deep\nhierarchical latent variable models can produce higher quality predictions by\ncapturing the multi-level stochasticity of future observations, but end-to-end\noptimization of such models is notably difficult. Our key insight is that\ngreedy and modular optimization of hierarchical autoencoders can simultaneously\naddress both the memory constraints and the optimization challenges of\nlarge-scale video prediction. We introduce Greedy Hierarchical Variational\nAutoencoders (GHVAEs), a method that learns high-fidelity video predictions by\ngreedily training each level of a hierarchical autoencoder. In comparison to\nstate-of-the-art models, GHVAEs provide 17-55% gains in prediction performance\non four video datasets, a 35-40% higher success rate on real robot tasks, and\ncan improve performance monotonically by simply adding more modules.",

          "description": "Despite the accomplishments of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in\nmodeling data distributions, training them remains a challenging task. A\ncontributing factor to this difficulty is the non-intuitive nature of the GAN\nloss curves, which necessitates a subjective evaluation of the generated output\nto infer training progress. Recently, motivated by game theory, duality gap has\nbeen proposed as a domain agnostic measure to monitor GAN training. However, it\nis restricted to the setting when the GAN converges to a Nash equilibrium. But\nGANs need not always converge to a Nash equilibrium to model the data\ndistribution. In this work, we extend the notion of duality gap to proximal\nduality gap that is applicable to the general context of training GANs where\nNash equilibria may not exist. We show theoretically that the proximal duality\ngap is capable of monitoring the convergence of GANs to a wider spectrum of\nequilibria that subsumes Nash equilibria. We also theoretically establish the\nrelationship between the proximal duality gap and the divergence between the\nreal and generated data distributions for different GAN formulations. Our\nresults provide new insights into the nature of GAN convergence. Finally, we\nvalidate experimentally the usefulness of proximal duality gap for monitoring\nand influencing GAN training.",

Since this behavior is inconsistent with\nseveral widespread presumptions in the field of optimization, our findings\nraise questions as to whether these presumptions are relevant to neural network\ntraining.

          "description": "Most explanation methods in deep learning map importance estimates for a\nmodel's prediction back to the original input space. These \"visual\"\nexplanations are often insufficient, as the model's actual concept remains\nelusive. Moreover, without insights into the model's semantic concept, it is\ndifficult -- if not impossible -- to intervene on the model's behavior via its\nexplanations, called Explanatory Interactive Learning. Consequently, we propose\nto intervene on a Neuro-Symbolic scene representation, which allows one to\nrevise the model on the semantic level, e.g. \"never focus on the color to make\nyour decision\". We compiled a novel confounded visual scene data set, the\nCLEVR-Hans data set, capturing complex compositions of different objects. The\nresults of our experiments on CLEVR-Hans demonstrate that our semantic\nexplanations, i.e. compositional explanations at a per-object level, can\nidentify confounders that are not identifiable using \"visual\" explanations\nonly. More importantly, feedback on this semantic level makes it possible to\nrevise the model from focusing on these factors.",

As a threat model, we consider attacks that minimally alter rewards\nto make the attacker's target policy uniquely optimal under the poisoned\nrewards, with the optimality gap specified by an attack parameter. Our goal is\nto design agents that are robust against such attacks in terms of the\nworst-case utility w.r.t. the true, unpoisoned, rewards while computing their\npolicies under the poisoned rewards. We propose an optimization framework for\nderiving optimal defense policies, both when the attack parameter is known and\nunknown. Moreover, we show that defense policies that are solutions to the\nproposed optimization problems have provable performance guarantees. In\nparticular, we provide the following bounds with respect to the true,\nunpoisoned, rewards: a) lower bounds on the expected return of the defense\npolicies, and b) upper bounds on how suboptimal these defense policies are\ncompared to the attacker's target policy.

          "description": "Assessing an AI agent that can converse in human language and understand\nvisual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor\ncorrect syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,\nwhere an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)\nmetric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a\nsingle human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:\nthe ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence\n(e.g., `yeah' and `yes'). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative\ngain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct\nanswers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually\napplicable uncertain answers such as `I don't know. Crafting a model that\nexcels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should\nanswer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To\naddress this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that\ncan merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep\nmost MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG\nstate-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%).

          "description": "Previous studies dominantly target at self-supervised learning on real-valued\nnetworks and have achieved many promising results. However, on the more\nchallenging binary neural networks (BNNs), this task has not yet been fully\nexplored in the community. In this paper, we focus on this more difficult\nscenario: learning networks where both weights and activations are binary,\nmeanwhile, without any human annotated labels. We observe that the commonly\nused contrastive objective is not satisfying on BNNs for competitive accuracy,\nsince the backbone network contains relatively limited capacity and\nrepresentation ability. Hence instead of directly applying existing\nself-supervised methods, which cause a severe decline in performance, we\npresent a novel guided learning paradigm from real-valued to distill binary\nnetworks on the final prediction distribution, to minimize the loss and obtain\ndesirable accuracy. Our proposed method can boost the simple contrastive\nlearning baseline by an absolute gain of 5.5~15% on BNNs. We further reveal\nthat it is difficult for BNNs to recover the similar predictive distributions\nas real-valued models when training without labels. Thus, how to calibrate them\nis key to address the degradation in performance. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on the large-scale ImageNet and downstream datasets. Our method\nachieves substantial improvement over the simple contrastive learning baseline,\nand is even comparable to many mainstream supervised BNN methods.

          "description": "Recent years have seen the introduction of a range of methods for post-hoc\nexplainability of image classifier predictions. However, these post-hoc\nexplanations may not always align perfectly with classifier predictions, which\nposes a significant challenge when attempting to debug models based on such\nexplanations. To this end, we seek a methodology that can improve alignment\nbetween model predictions and explanation method that is both agnostic to the\nmodel and explanation classes and which does not require ground truth\nexplanations. We achieve this through a novel explanation-driven data\naugmentation (EDDA) method that augments the training data with occlusions of\nexisting data stemming from model-explanations; this is based on the simple\nmotivating principle that occluding salient regions for the model prediction\nshould decrease the model confidence in the prediction, while occluding\nnon-salient regions should not change the prediction -- if the model and\nexplainer are aligned. To verify that this augmentation method improves model\nand explainer alignment, we evaluate the methodology on a variety of datasets,\nimage classification models, and explanation methods. We verify in all cases\nthat our explanation-driven data augmentation method improves alignment of the\nmodel and explanation in comparison to no data augmentation and non-explanation\ndriven data augmentation methods. In conclusion, this approach provides a novel\nmodel- and explainer-agnostic methodology for improving alignment between model\npredictions and explanations, which we see as a critical step forward for\npractical deployment and debugging of image classification models.",

          "description": "One of the main challenges in model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is to\ndecide which aspects of the environment should be modeled. The\nvalue-equivalence (VE) principle proposes a simple answer to this question: a\nmodel should capture the aspects of the environment that are relevant for\nvalue-based planning. Technically, VE distinguishes models based on a set of\npolicies and a set of functions: a model is said to be VE to the environment if\nthe Bellman operators it induces for the policies yield the correct result when\napplied to the functions. As the number of policies and functions increase, the\nset of VE models shrinks, eventually collapsing to a single point corresponding\nto a perfect model. A fundamental question underlying the VE principle is thus\nhow to select the smallest sets of policies and functions that are sufficient\nfor planning. In this paper we take an important step towards answering this\nquestion. We start by generalizing the concept of VE to order-$k$ counterparts\ndefined with respect to $k$ applications of the Bellman operator. This leads to\na family of VE classes that increase in size as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$. In the\nlimit, all functions become value functions, and we have a special\ninstantiation of VE which we call proper VE or simply PVE. Unlike VE, the PVE\nclass may contain multiple models even in the limit when all value functions\nare used. Crucially, all these models are sufficient for planning, meaning that\nthey will yield an optimal policy despite the fact that they may ignore many\naspects of the environment. We construct a loss function for learning PVE\nmodels and argue that popular algorithms such as MuZero and Muesli can be\nunderstood as minimizing an upper bound for this loss. We leverage this\nconnection to propose a modification to MuZero and show that it can lead to\nimproved performance in practice.",

          "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted lives and economies across the globe,\nleading to many deaths. While vaccination is an important intervention, its\nroll-out is slow and unequal across the globe. Therefore, extensive testing\nstill remains one of the key methods to monitor and contain the virus. Testing\non a large scale is expensive and arduous. Hence, we need alternate methods to\nestimate the number of cases. Online surveys have been shown to be an effective\nmethod for data collection amidst the pandemic. In this work, we develop\nmachine learning models to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 using\nself-reported symptoms. Our best model predicts the daily cases with a mean\nabsolute error (MAE) of 226.30 (normalized MAE of 27.09%) per state, which\ndemonstrates the possibility of predicting the actual number of confirmed cases\nby utilizing self-reported symptoms. The models are developed at two levels of\ndata granularity - local models, which are trained at the state level, and a\nsingle global model which is trained on the combined data aggregated across all\nstates. Our results indicate a lower error on the local models as opposed to\nthe global model. In addition, we also show that the most important symptoms\n(features) vary considerably from state to state. This work demonstrates that\nthe models developed on crowd-sourced data, curated via online platforms, can\ncomplement the existing epidemiological surveillance infrastructure in a\ncost-effective manner.

Firstly, we develop a transition-aware AIL algorithm named TAIL\nwith an expert sample complexity of $\\tilde{O}(H^{3/2} |S|/\\varepsilon)$ under\nthe known transition setting, where $H$ is the planning horizon, $|S|$ is the\nstate space size and $\\varepsilon$ is desired policy value gap. This improves\nupon the previous best bound of $\\tilde{O}(H^2 |S| / \\varepsilon^2)$ for AIL\nmethods and matches the lower bound of $\\tilde{\\Omega} (H^{3/2}\n|S|/\\varepsilon)$ in [Rajaraman et al., 2021] up to a logarithmic factor. The\nkey ingredient of TAIL is a fine-grained estimator for expert state-action\ndistribution, which explicitly utilizes the transition function information.\nSecondly, considering practical settings where the transition functions are\nusually unknown but environment interaction is allowed, we accordingly develop\na model-based transition-aware AIL algorithm named MB-TAIL. In particular,\nMB-TAIL builds an empirical transition model by interacting with the\nenvironment and performs imitation under the recovered empirical model. The\ninteraction complexity of MB-TAIL is $\\tilde{O} (H^3 |S|^2 |A| /\n\\varepsilon^2)$, which improves the best known result of $\\tilde{O} (H^4 |S|^2\n|A| / \\varepsilon^2)$ in [Shani et al., 2021].

This allows us to assess\ncommunity disease prevalence, even in areas with low COVID-19 testing ability.\nUsing individually reported symptom data from various populations, our method\npredicts the likely percentage of the population that tested positive for\nCOVID-19.

          "description": "In this paper, we present a novel approach to the audio-visual video parsing\n(AVVP) task that demarcates events from a video separately for audio and visual\nmodalities. The proposed parsing approach simultaneously detects the temporal\nboundaries in terms of start and end times of such events. We show how AVVP can\nbenefit from the following techniques geared towards effective cross-modal\nlearning: (i) adversarial training and skip connections (ii) global context\naware attention and, (iii) self-supervised pretraining using an audio-video\ngrounding objective to obtain cross-modal audio-video representations. We\npresent extensive experimental evaluations on the Look, Listen, and Parse (LLP)\ndataset and show that we outperform the state-of-the-art Hybrid Attention\nNetwork (HAN) on all five metrics proposed for AVVP. We also present several\nablations to validate the effect of pretraining, global attention and\nadversarial training.",

          "description": "Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged recently as a robust tool to\nextract and compare the structure of datasets. TDA identifies features in data\nsuch as connected components and holes and assigns a quantitative measure to\nthese features. Several studies reported that topological features extracted by\nTDA tools provide unique information about the data, discover new insights, and\ndetermine which feature is more related to the outcome. On the other hand, the\noverwhelming success of deep neural networks in learning patterns and\nrelationships has been proven on a vast array of data applications, images in\nparticular. To capture the characteristics of both powerful tools, we propose\n\\textit{TDA-Net}, a novel ensemble network that fuses topological and deep\nfeatures for the purpose of enhancing model generalizability and accuracy.

          "description": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely applied in different\nscenarios thanks to the development of deep neural networks. The original GAN\nwas proposed based on the non-parametric assumption of the infinite capacity of\nnetworks. However, it is still unknown whether GANs can generate realistic\nsamples without any prior information. Due to the overconfident assumption,\nmany issues remain unaddressed in GANs' training, such as non-convergence, mode\ncollapses, gradient vanishing. Regularization and normalization are common\nmethods of introducing prior information to stabilize training and improve\ndiscrimination. Although a handful number of regularization and normalization\nmethods have been proposed for GANs, to the best of our knowledge, there exists\nno comprehensive survey which primarily focuses on objectives and development\nof these methods, apart from some in-comprehensive and limited scope studies.\nIn this work, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the regularization and\nnormalization techniques from different perspectives of GANs training. First,\nwe systematically describe different perspectives of GANs training and thus\nobtain the different objectives of regularization and normalization. Based on\nthese objectives, we propose a new taxonomy. Furthermore, we compare the\nperformance of the mainstream methods on different datasets and investigate the\nregularization and normalization techniques that have been frequently employed\nin SOTA GANs. Finally, we highlight potential future directions of research in\nthis domain.",

It then becomes possible to perform approximate\nBayesian inference on the latent force as well as the ODE solution in a single,\nlinear complexity pass of an extended Kalman filter / smoother - that is, at\nthe cost of computing a single ODE solution.

The framelet decomposition naturally induces\na graph pooling strategy by aggregating the graph feature into low-pass and\nhigh-pass spectra, which considers both the feature values and geometry of the\ngraph data and conserves the total information. The graph neural networks with\nthe proposed framelet convolution and pooling achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance in many node and graph prediction tasks. Moreover, we propose\nshrinkage as a new activation for the framelet convolution, which thresholds\nhigh-frequency information at different scales. Compared to ReLU, shrinkage\nactivation improves model performance on denoising and signal compression:\nnoises in both node and structure can be significantly reduced by accurately\ncutting off the high-pass coefficients from framelet decomposition, and the\nsignal can be compressed to less than half its original size with\nwell-preserved prediction performance.",

For example, we may want to capture the characteristics of a\nface that make it look young, rather than just the age of the person. To this\nend, we develop the CCVAE, a novel VAE model and concomitant variational\nobjective which captures label characteristics explicitly in the latent space,\neschewing direct correspondences between label values and latents. Through\njudicious structuring of mappings between such characteristic latents and\nlabels, we show that the CCVAE can effectively learn meaningful representations\nof the characteristics of interest across a variety of supervision schemes. In\nparticular, we show that the CCVAE allows for more effective and more general\ninterventions to be performed, such as smooth traversals within the\ncharacteristics for a given label, diverse conditional generation, and\ntransferring characteristics across datapoints.",

          "description": "The design of methods for inference from time sequences has traditionally\nrelied on statistical models that describe the relation between a latent\ndesired sequence and the observed one. A broad family of model-based algorithms\nhave been derived to carry out inference at controllable complexity using\nrecursive computations over the factor graph representing the underlying\ndistribution. An alternative model-agnostic approach utilizes machine learning\n(ML) methods. Here we propose a framework that combines model-based algorithms\nand data-driven ML tools for stationary time sequences. In the proposed\napproach, neural networks are developed to separately learn specific components\nof a factor graph describing the distribution of the time sequence, rather than\nthe complete inference task. By exploiting stationary properties of this\ndistribution, the resulting approach can be applied to sequences of varying\ntemporal duration. Learned factor graph can be realized using compact neural\nnetworks that are trainable using small training sets, or alternatively, be\nused to improve upon existing deep inference systems. We present an inference\nalgorithm based on learned stationary factor graphs, which learns to implement\nthe sum-product scheme from labeled data, and can be applied to sequences of\ndifferent lengths. Our experimental results demonstrate the ability of the\nproposed learned factor graphs to learn to carry out accurate inference from\nsmall training sets for sleep stage detection using the Sleep-EDF dataset, as\nwell as for symbol detection in digital communications with unknown channels.",

          "description": "Various iterative reconstruction algorithms for inverse problems can be\nunfolded as neural networks. Empirically, this approach has often led to\nimproved results, but theoretical guarantees are still scarce. While some\nprogress on generalization properties of neural networks have been made, great\nchallenges remain. In this chapter, we discuss and combine these topics to\npresent a generalization error analysis for a class of neural networks suitable\nfor sparse reconstruction from few linear measurements. The hypothesis class\nconsidered is inspired by the classical iterative soft-thresholding algorithm\n(ISTA). The neural networks in this class are obtained by unfolding iterations\nof ISTA and learning some of the weights. Based on training samples, we aim at\nlearning the optimal network parameters via empirical risk minimization and\nthereby the optimal network that reconstructs signals from their compressive\nlinear measurements. In particular, we may learn a sparsity basis that is\nshared by all of the iterations/layers and thereby obtain a new approach for\ndictionary learning. For this class of networks, we present a generalization\nbound, which is based on bounding the Rademacher complexity of hypothesis\nclasses consisting of such deep networks via Dudley's integral. Remarkably,\nunder realistic conditions, the generalization error scales only\nlogarithmically in the number of layers, and at most linear in number of\nmeasurements.",

As an application,\nwe present a novel approach to accurate privacy accounting of the subsampled\nGaussian mechanism.

          "description": "Adversarial learning has emerged as one of the successful techniques to\ncircumvent the susceptibility of existing methods against adversarial\nperturbations. However, the majority of existing defense methods are tailored\nto defend against a single category of adversarial perturbation (e.g.\n$\\ell_\\infty$-attack). In safety-critical applications, this makes these\nmethods extraneous as the attacker can adopt diverse adversaries to deceive the\nsystem. Moreover, training on multiple perturbations simultaneously\nsignificantly increases the computational overhead during training. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that explicitly\nlearns to generate noise to improve the model's robustness against multiple\ntypes of attacks. Its key component is Meta Noise Generator (MNG) that outputs\noptimal noise to stochastically perturb a given sample, such that it helps\nlower the error on diverse adversarial perturbations. By utilizing samples\ngenerated by MNG, we train a model by enforcing the label consistency across\nmultiple perturbations. We validate the robustness of models trained by our\nscheme on various datasets and against a wide variety of perturbations,\ndemonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines across multiple\nperturbations with a marginal computational cost.",

          "description": "We offer straightforward theoretical results that justify incorporating\nmachine learning in the standard linear instrumental variable setting. The key\nidea is to use machine learning, combined with sample-splitting, to predict the\ntreatment variable from the instrument and any exogenous covariates, and then\nuse this predicted treatment and the covariates as technical instruments to\nrecover the coefficients in the second-stage. This allows the researcher to\nextract non-linear co-variation between the treatment and instrument that may\ndramatically improve estimation precision and robustness by boosting instrument\nstrength. Importantly, we constrain the machine-learned predictions to be\nlinear in the exogenous covariates, thus avoiding spurious identification\narising from non-linear relationships between the treatment and the covariates.\nWe show that this approach delivers consistent and asymptotically normal\nestimates under weak conditions and that it may be adapted to be\nsemiparametrically efficient (Chamberlain, 1992). Our method preserves standard\nintuitions and interpretations of linear instrumental variable methods,\nincluding under weak identification, and provides a simple, user-friendly\nupgrade to the applied economics toolbox.

The performance of our\nproposed method is evaluated on (1) the imputation of traffic speed data\ncollected in the city of Guangzhou in China, and the training of short-term\ntraffic prediction models using imputed data, and (2) the imputation of\nmulti-variable traffic data of highways in Portland-Vancouver metropolitan\nregion which includes volume, occupancy, and speed with different missing rates\nfor each of them.

Although updating a model with\nreal incoming data is ideal, using all of them is not always feasible due to\nlimits, such as labeling and communication costs.

In this paper, we formalize a practical active learning problem for\nDNNs on edge devices and propose a general task-agnostic framework to tackle\nthis problem, which reduces it to a stream submodular maximization. This\nframework is light enough to be run with low computational resources, yet\nprovides solutions whose quality is theoretically guaranteed thanks to the\nsubmodular property. Through this framework, we can configure data selection\ncriteria flexibly, including using methods proposed in previous active learning\nstudies.

          "description": "Neural controlled differential equations (CDEs) are the continuous-time\nanalogue of recurrent neural networks, as Neural ODEs are to residual networks,\nand offer a memory-efficient continuous-time way to model functions of\npotentially irregular time series. Existing methods for computing the forward\npass of a Neural CDE involve embedding the incoming time series into path\nspace, often via interpolation, and using evaluations of this path to drive the\nhidden state. Here, we use rough path theory to extend this formulation.\nInstead of directly embedding into path space, we instead represent the input\nsignal over small time intervals through its \\textit{log-signature}, which are\nstatistics describing how the signal drives a CDE. This is the approach for\nsolving \\textit{rough differential equations} (RDEs), and correspondingly we\ndescribe our main contribution as the introduction of Neural RDEs. This\nextension has a purpose: by generalising the Neural CDE approach to a broader\nclass of driving signals, we demonstrate particular advantages for tackling\nlong time series. In this regime, we demonstrate efficacy on problems of length\nup to 17k observations and observe significant training speed-ups, improvements\nin model performance, and reduced memory requirements compared to existing\napproaches.",

          "description": "In the era of big data, methods for improving memory and computational\nefficiency have become crucial for successful deployment of technologies.\nHashing is one of the most effective approaches to deal with computational\nlimitations that come with big data. One natural way for formulating this\nproblem is spectral hashing that directly incorporates affinity to learn binary\ncodes. However, due to binary constraints, the optimization becomes\nintractable. To mitigate this challenge, different relaxation approaches have\nbeen proposed to reduce the computational load of obtaining binary codes and\nstill attain a good solution. The problem with all existing relaxation methods\nis resorting to one or more additional auxiliary variables to attain high\nquality binary codes while relaxing the problem. The existence of auxiliary\nvariables leads to coordinate descent approach which increases the\ncomputational complexity. We argue that introducing these variables is\nunnecessary. To this end, we propose a novel relaxed formulation for spectral\nhashing that adds no additional variables to the problem. Furthermore, instead\nof solving the problem in original space where number of variables is equal to\nthe data points, we solve the problem in a much smaller space and retrieve the\nbinary codes from this solution. This trick reduces both the memory and\ncomputational complexity at the same time. We apply two optimization\ntechniques, namely projected gradient and optimization on manifold, to obtain\nthe solution. Using comprehensive experiments on four public datasets, we show\nthat the proposed efficient spectral hashing (ESH) algorithm achieves highly\ncompetitive retrieval performance compared with state of the art at low\ncomplexity.",

Deep learning-based approaches aim to achieve\nthis goal either by improving their prediction of specific values (i.e., point\nprediction), or by producing prediction intervals (PIs) that quantify\nuncertainty. We present PIVEN, a deep neural network for producing both a PI\nand a value prediction. Our loss function expresses the value prediction as a\nfunction of the upper and lower bounds, thus ensuring that it falls within the\ninterval without increasing model complexity. Moreover, our approach makes no\nassumptions regarding data distribution within the PI, making its value\nprediction more effective for various real-world problems. Experiments and\nablation tests on known benchmarks show that our approach produces tighter\nuncertainty bounds than the current state-of-the-art approaches for producing\nPIs, while maintaining comparable performance to the state-of-the-art approach\nfor value-prediction.

Inspired by real-world applications of\nforgetting techniques, we introduce a novel notion of forgetting in\nmixed-privacy setting, where we know that a \"core\" subset of the training\nsamples does not need to be forgotten. While this variation of the problem is\nconceptually simple, we show that working in this setting significantly\nimproves the accuracy and guarantees of forgetting methods applied to vision\nclassification tasks. Moreover, our method allows efficient removal of all\ninformation contained in non-core data by simply setting to zero a subset of\nthe weights with minimal loss in performance. We achieve these results by\nreplacing a standard deep network with a suitable linear approximation. With\nopportune changes to the network architecture and training procedure, we show\nthat such linear approximation achieves comparable performance to the original\nnetwork and that the forgetting problem becomes quadratic and can be solved\nefficiently even for large models. Unlike previous forgetting methods on deep\nnetworks, ours can achieve close to the state-of-the-art accuracy on large\nscale vision tasks.

          "description": "Entity matching (EM) refers to the problem of identifying tuple pairs in one\nor more relations that refer to the same real world entities. Supervised\nmachine learning (ML) approaches, and deep learning based approaches in\nparticular, typically achieve state-of-the-art matching results. However, these\napproaches require many labeled examples, in the form of matching and\nnon-matching pairs, which are expensive and time-consuming to label. In this\npaper, we introduce Panda, a weakly supervised system specifically designed for\nEM. Panda uses the same labeling function abstraction as Snorkel, where\nlabeling functions (LF) are user-provided programs that can generate large\namounts of (somewhat noisy) labels quickly and cheaply, which can then be\ncombined via a labeling model to generate accurate final predictions. To\nsupport users developing LFs for EM, Panda provides an integrated development\nenvironment (IDE) that lives in a modern browser architecture. Panda's IDE\nfacilitates the development, debugging, and life-cycle management of LFs in the\ncontext of EM tasks, similar to how IDEs such as Visual Studio or Eclipse excel\nin general-purpose programming. Panda's IDE includes many novel features\npurpose-built for EM, such as smart data sampling, a builtin library of EM\nutility functions, automatically generated LFs, visual debugging of LFs, and\nfinally, an EM-specific labeling model. We show in this demo that Panda IDE can\ngreatly accelerate the development of high-quality EM solutions using weak\nsupervision.",

          "description": "To use neural networks in safety-critical settings it is paramount to provide\nassurances on their runtime operation. Recent work on ReLU networks has sought\nto verify whether inputs belonging to a bounded box can ever yield some\nundesirable output. Input-splitting procedures, a particular type of\nverification mechanism, do so by recursively partitioning the input set into\nsmaller sets. The efficiency of these methods is largely determined by the\nnumber of splits the box must undergo before the property can be verified. In\nthis work, we propose a new technique based on shadow prices that fully\nexploits the information of the problem yielding a more efficient generation of\nsplits than the state-of-the-art. Results on the Airborne Collision Avoidance\nSystem (ACAS) benchmark verification tasks show a considerable reduction in the\npartitions generated which substantially reduces computation times.

          "description": "Neural shape representations have recently shown to be effective in shape\nanalysis and reconstruction tasks. Existing neural network methods require\npoint coordinates and corresponding normal vectors to learn the implicit level\nsets of the shape. Normal vectors are often not provided as raw data,\ntherefore, approximation and reorientation are required as pre-processing\nstages, both of which can introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a\ndivergence guided shape representation learning approach that does not require\nnormal vectors as input. We show that incorporating a soft constraint on the\ndivergence of the distance function favours smooth solutions that reliably\norients gradients to match the unknown normal at each point, in some cases even\nbetter than approaches that use ground truth normal vectors directly.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel geometric initialization method for\nsinusoidal shape representation networks that further improves convergence to\nthe desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the task\nof surface reconstruction and show state-of-the-art performance compared to\nother unoriented methods and on-par performance compared to oriented methods.",

A\nbrief background of AI, and specifically Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, is\nprovided including Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL). We categorise creative applications into five groups related to\nhow AI technologies are used: i) content creation, ii) information analysis,\niii) content enhancement and post production workflows, iv) information\nextraction and enhancement, and v) data compression. We critically examine the\nsuccesses and limitations of this rapidly advancing technology in each of these\nareas. We further differentiate between the use of AI as a creative tool and\nits potential as a creator in its own right. We foresee that, in the near\nfuture, machine learning-based AI will be adopted widely as a tool or\ncollaborative assistant for creativity. In contrast, we observe that the\nsuccesses of machine learning in domains with fewer constraints, where AI is\nthe `creator', remain modest. The potential of AI (or its developers) to win\nawards for its original creations in competition with human creatives is also\nlimited, based on contemporary technologies. We therefore conclude that, in the\ncontext of creative industries, maximum benefit from AI will be derived where\nits focus is human centric -- where it is designed to augment, rather than\nreplace, human creativity.",

This paper proposes a DR\nestimator for dependent samples obtained from adaptive experiments. To obtain\nan asymptotically normal semiparametric estimator from dependent samples with\nnon-Donsker nuisance estimators, we propose adaptive-fitting as a variant of\nsample-splitting. We also report an empirical paradox that our proposed DR\nestimator tends to show better performances compared to other estimators\nutilizing the true logging policy.

          "description": "Developing efficient and principled neural architecture optimization methods\nis a critical challenge of modern deep learning. Recently, Liu et al.[19]\nproposed a splitting steepest descent (S2D) method that jointly optimizes the\nneural parameters and architectures based on progressively growing network\nstructures by splitting neurons into multiple copies in a steepest descent\nfashion. However, S2D suffers from a local optimality issue when all the\nneurons become \"splitting stable\", a concept akin to local stability in\nparametric optimization. In this work, we develop a significant and surprising\nextension of the splitting descent framework that addresses the local\noptimality issue. The idea is to observe that the original S2D is unnecessarily\nrestricted to splitting neurons into positive weighted copies. By simply\nallowing both positive and negative weights during splitting, we can eliminate\nthe appearance of splitting stability in S2D and hence escape the local optima\nto obtain better performance. By incorporating signed splittings, we\nsignificantly extend the optimization power of splitting steepest descent both\ntheoretically and empirically. We verify our method on various challenging\nbenchmarks such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet and ModelNet40, on which we outperform\nS2D and other advanced methods on learning accurate and energy-efficient neural\nnetworks.",

To be specific, we\ncarefully study the effect of both real and synthetic backdoor attacks on the\ninternal response of vanilla and backdoored DNNs through the lens of Gard-CAM.\nMoreover, we show that the backdoor attack induces a significant bias in neuron\nactivation in terms of the $\\ell_\\infty$ norm of an activation map compared to\nits $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norm. Spurred by our results, we propose the\n\\textit{$\\ell_\\infty$-based neuron pruning} to remove the backdoor from the\nbackdoored DNN.

          "description": "Dynamic transportation networks have been analyzed for years by means of\nstatic graph-based indicators in order to study the temporal evolution of\nrelevant network components, and to reveal complex dependencies that would not\nbe easily detected by a direct inspection of the data. This paper presents a\nstate-of-the-art latent network model to forecast multilayer dynamic graphs\nthat are increasingly common in transportation and proposes a community-based\nextension to reduce the computational burden. Flexible time series analysis is\nobtained by modeling the probability of edges between vertices through latent\nGaussian processes. The models and Bayesian inference are illustrated on a\nsample of 10-year data from four major airlines within the US air\ntransportation system. Results show how the estimated latent parameters from\nthe models are related to the airline's connectivity dynamics, and their\nability to project the multilayer graph into the future for out-of-sample full\nnetwork forecasts, while stochastic blockmodeling allows for the identification\nof relevant communities. Reliable network predictions would allow policy-makers\nto better understand the dynamics of the transport system, and help in their\nplanning on e.g. route development, or the deployment of new regulations.",

          "description": "Repeated use of a data sample via adaptively chosen queries can rapidly lead\nto overfitting, wherein the issued queries yield answers on the sample that\ndiffer wildly from the values of those queries on the underlying data\ndistribution. Differential privacy provides a tool to ensure generalization\ndespite adaptively-chosen queries, but its worst-case nature means that it\ncannot, for example, yield improved results for low-variance queries. In this\npaper, we give a simple new characterization that illuminates the core problem\nof adaptive data analysis. We show explicitly that the harms of adaptivity come\nfrom the covariance between the behavior of future queries and a Bayes\nfactor-based measure of how much information about the data sample was encoded\nin the responses given to past queries. We leverage this intuition to introduce\na new stability notion; we then use it to prove new generalization results for\nthe most basic noise-addition mechanisms (Laplace and Gaussian noise addition),\nwith guarantees that scale with the variance of the queries rather than the\nsquare of their range. Our characterization opens the door to new insights and\nnew algorithms for the fundamental problem of achieving generalization in\nadaptive data analysis.",

          "description": "We show a simple reduction which demonstrates the cryptographic hardness of\nlearning a single periodic neuron over isotropic Gaussian distributions in the\npresence of noise. More precisely, our reduction shows that any polynomial-time\nalgorithm (not necessarily gradient-based) for learning such functions under\nsmall noise implies a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving worst-case\nlattice problems, whose hardness form the foundation of lattice-based\ncryptography. Our core hard family of functions, which are well-approximated by\none-layer neural networks, take the general form of a univariate periodic\nfunction applied to an affine projection of the data. These functions have\nappeared in previous seminal works which demonstrate their hardness against\ngradient-based (Shamir'18), and Statistical Query (SQ) algorithms (Song et\nal.'17). We show that if (polynomially) small noise is added to the labels, the\nintractability of learning these functions applies to all polynomial-time\nalgorithms under the aforementioned cryptographic assumptions.\n\nMoreover, we demonstrate the necessity of noise in the hardness result by\ndesigning a polynomial-time algorithm for learning certain families of such\nfunctions under exponentially small adversarial noise. Our proposed algorithm\nis not a gradient-based or an SQ algorithm, but is rather based on the\ncelebrated Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov\\'asz (LLL) lattice basis reduction algorithm.\nFurthermore, in the absence of noise, this algorithm can be directly applied to\nsolve CLWE detection (Bruna et al.'21) and phase retrieval with an optimal\nsample complexity of $d+1$ samples. In the former case, this improves upon the\nquadratic-in-$d$ sample complexity required in (Bruna et al.'21). In the latter\ncase, this improves upon the state-of-the-art AMP-based algorithm, which\nrequires approximately $1.128d$ samples (Barbier et al.'19).",

However, extracting\neffective representations that capture the underlying characteristics of the\nacoustic events is still challenging. Previous methods mainly focused on\ndesigning the audio features in a `hand-crafted' manner. Interestingly,\ndata-learnt features have been recently reported to show better performance. Up\nto now, these were only considered on the frame level. In this article, we\npropose an unsupervised learning framework to learn a vector representation of\nan audio sequence for AEC. This framework consists of a Recurrent Neural\nNetwork (RNN) encoder and an RNN decoder, which respectively transforms the\nvariable-length audio sequence into a fixed-length vector and reconstructs the\ninput sequence on the generated vector. After training the encoder-decoder, we\nfeed the audio sequences to the encoder and then take the learnt vectors as the\naudio sequence representations. Compared with previous methods, the proposed\nmethod can not only deal with the problem of arbitrary-lengths of audio\nstreams, but also learn the salient information of the sequence. Extensive\nevaluation on a large-size acoustic event database is performed, and the\nempirical results demonstrate that the learnt audio sequence representation\nyields a significant performance improvement by a large margin compared with\nother state-of-the-art hand-crafted sequence features for AEC.",

          "description": "EEG technology finds applications in several domains. Currently, most EEG\nsystems require subjects to wear several electrodes on the scalp to be\neffective. However, several channels might include noisy information, redundant\nsignals, induce longer preparation times and increase computational times of\nany automated system for EEG decoding. One way to reduce the signal-to-noise\nratio and improve classification accuracy is to combine channel selection with\nfeature extraction, but EEG signals are known to present high inter-subject\nvariability. In this work we introduce a novel algorithm for\nsubject-independent channel selection of EEG recordings. Considering\nmulti-channel trial recordings as statistical units and the EEG decoding task\nas the class of reference, the algorithm (i) exploits channel-specific\n1D-Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNNs) as feature extractors in a\nsupervised fashion to maximize class separability; (ii) it reduces a high\ndimensional multi-channel trial representation into a unique trial vector by\nconcatenating the channels' embeddings and (iii) recovers the complex\ninter-channel relationships during channel selection, by exploiting an ensemble\nof AutoEncoders (AE) to identify from these vectors the most relevant channels\nto perform classification. After training, the algorithm can be exploited by\ntransferring only the parametrized subgroup of selected channel-specific\n1D-CNNs to new signals from new subjects and obtain low-dimensional and highly\ninformative trial vectors to be fed to any classifier.",

          "description": "Modeling and simulating a power distribution network (PDN) for printed\ncircuit boards (PCBs) with irregular board shapes and multi-layer stackup is\ncomputationally inefficient using full-wave simulations. This paper presents a\nnew concept of using deep learning for PDN impedance prediction. A boundary\nelement method (BEM) is applied to efficiently calculate the impedance for\narbitrary board shape and stackup. Then over one million boards with different\nshapes, stackup, IC location, and decap placement are randomly generated to\ntrain a deep neural network (DNN). The trained DNN can predict the impedance\naccurately for new board configurations that have not been used for training.\nThe consumed time using the trained DNN is only 0.1 seconds, which is over 100\ntimes faster than the BEM method and 5000 times faster than full-wave\nsimulations.",

In recent years, many elegant approaches to discovering causal\nrelationships between two variables from observational data have been proposed.\nHowever, most of these deal only with purely directed causal relationships and\ncannot detect latent common causes. Here, we devise a general heuristic which\ntakes a causal discovery algorithm that can only distinguish purely directed\ncausal relations and modifies it to also detect latent common causes. We apply\nour method to two directed causal discovery algorithms, the Information\nGeometric Causal Inference of (Daniusis et al., 2010) and the Kernel\nConditional Deviance for Causal Inference of (Mitrovic, Sejdinovic, & Teh,\n2018), and extensively test on synthetic data -- detecting latent common causes\nin additive, multiplicative and complex noise regimes -- and on real data,\nwhere we are able to detect known common causes. In addition to detecting\nlatent common causes, our experiments demonstrate that both the modified\nalgorithms preserve the performance of the original in distinguishing directed\ncausal relations.",

          "description": "Strategies for machine-learning(ML)-accelerated discovery that are general\nacross materials composition spaces are essential, but demonstrations of ML\nhave been primarily limited to narrow composition variations. By addressing the\nscarcity of data in promising regions of chemical space for challenging targets\nlike open-shell transition-metal complexes, general representations and\ntransferable ML models that leverage known relationships in existing data will\naccelerate discovery. Over a large set (ca. 1000) of isovalent transition-metal\ncomplexes, we quantify evident relationships for different properties (i.e.,\nspin-splitting and ligand dissociation) between rows of the periodic table\n(i.e., 3d/4d metals and 2p/3p ligands). We demonstrate an extension to\ngraph-based revised autocorrelation (RAC) representation (i.e., eRAC) that\nincorporates the effective nuclear charge alongside the nuclear charge\nheuristic that otherwise overestimates dissimilarity of isovalent complexes. To\naddress the common challenge of discovery in a new space where data is limited,\nwe introduce a transfer learning approach in which we seed models trained on a\nlarge amount of data from one row of the periodic table with a small number of\ndata points from the additional row. We demonstrate the synergistic value of\nthe eRACs alongside this transfer learning strategy to consistently improve\nmodel performance. Analysis of these models highlights how the approach\nsucceeds by reordering the distances between complexes to be more consistent\nwith the periodic table, a property we expect to be broadly useful for other\nmaterials domains.",

          "description": "Scaling adaptive traffic-signal control involves dealing with combinatorial\nstate and action spaces. Multi-agent reinforcement learning attempts to address\nthis challenge by distributing control to specialized agents. However,\nspecialization hinders generalization and transferability, and the\ncomputational graphs underlying neural-networks architectures -- dominating in\nthe multi-agent setting -- do not offer the flexibility to handle an arbitrary\nnumber of entities which changes both between road networks, and over time as\nvehicles traverse the network. We introduce Inductive Graph Reinforcement\nLearning (IG-RL) based on graph-convolutional networks which adapts to the\nstructure of any road network, to learn detailed representations of\ntraffic-controllers and their surroundings. Our decentralized approach enables\nlearning of a transferable-adaptive-traffic-signal-control policy. After being\ntrained on an arbitrary set of road networks, our model can generalize to new\nroad networks, traffic distributions, and traffic regimes, with no additional\ntraining and a constant number of parameters, enabling greater scalability\ncompared to prior methods. Furthermore, our approach can exploit the\ngranularity of available data by capturing the (dynamic) demand at both the\nlane and the vehicle levels. The proposed method is tested on both road\nnetworks and traffic settings never experienced during training. We compare\nIG-RL to multi-agent reinforcement learning and domain-specific baselines. In\nboth synthetic road networks and in a larger experiment involving the control\nof the 3,971 traffic signals of Manhattan, we show that different\ninstantiations of IG-RL outperform baselines.",

A key challenge to the scalability and quality of the\nlearned architectures is the need for differentiating through the inner-loop\noptimisation. While much has been discussed about several potentially fatal\nfactors in DARTS, the architecture gradient, a.k.a. hypergradient, has received\nless attention. In this paper, we tackle the hypergradient computation in DARTS\nbased on the implicit function theorem, making it only depends on the obtained\nsolution to the inner-loop optimization and agnostic to the optimization path.\nTo further reduce the computational requirements, we formulate a stochastic\nhypergradient approximation for differentiable NAS, and theoretically show that\nthe architecture optimization with the proposed method, named iDARTS, is\nexpected to converge to a stationary point. Comprehensive experiments on two\nNAS benchmark search spaces and the common NAS search space verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed method.

          "description": "Numerous invariant (or equivariant) neural networks have succeeded in\nhandling invariant data such as point clouds and graphs. However, a\ngeneralization theory for the neural networks has not been well developed,\nbecause several essential factors for the theory, such as network size and\nmargin distribution, are not deeply connected to the invariance and\nequivariance. In this study, we develop a novel generalization error bound for\ninvariant and equivariant deep neural networks. To describe the effect of\ninvariance and equivariance on generalization, we develop a notion of a\n\\textit{quotient feature space}, which measures the effect of group actions for\nthe properties. Our main result proves that the volume of quotient feature\nspaces can describe the generalization error. Furthermore, the bound shows that\nthe invariance and equivariance significantly improve the leading term of the\nbound. We apply our result to specific invariant and equivariant networks, such\nas DeepSets (Zaheer et al. (2017)), and show that their generalization bound is\nconsiderably improved by $\\sqrt{n!}$, where $n!$ is the number of permutations.\nWe also discuss the expressive power of invariant DNNs and show that they can\nachieve an optimal approximation rate. Our experimental result supports our\ntheoretical claims.",

Our starting point is\nan open problem posed by Hongseok Yang: what class of statistical probabilistic\nprograms have densities that are differentiable almost everywhere? To formalise\nthe problem, we consider Statistical PCF (SPCF), an extension of call-by-value\nPCF with real numbers, and constructs for sampling and conditioning. We give\nSPCF a sampling-style operational semantics a la Borgstrom et al., and study\nthe associated weight (commonly referred to as the density) function and value\nfunction on the set of possible execution traces. Our main result is that\nalmost-surely terminating SPCF programs, generated from a set of primitive\nfunctions (e.g. the set of analytic functions) satisfying mild closure\nproperties, have weight and value functions that are almost-everywhere\ndifferentiable. We use a stochastic form of symbolic execution to reason about\nalmost-everywhere differentiability. A by-product of this work is that\nalmost-surely terminating deterministic (S)PCF programs with real parameters\ndenote functions that are almost-everywhere differentiable. Our result is of\npractical interest, as almost-everywhere differentiability of the density\nfunction is required to hold for the correctness of major gradient-based\ninference algorithms.",

In contrast, l_p norms are known to be robust, but cannot\nbe optimized via, e.g., stochastic gradient descent, as they are\nnon-differentiable. We propose an algorithm inspired by so-called model-based\noptimization (MBO) [35, 36], which replaces a non-convex objective with a\nconvex model function and alternates between optimizing the model function and\nupdating the solution. We apply this to robust regression, proposing SADM, a\nstochastic variant of the Online Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(OADM) [50] to solve the inner optimization in MBO. We show that SADM converges\nwith the rate O(log T/T).

          "description": "As the analytic tools become more powerful, and more data are generated on a\ndaily basis, the issue of data privacy arises. This leads to the study of the\ndesign of privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms. Given two objectives,\nnamely, utility maximization and privacy-loss minimization, this work is based\non two previously non-intersecting regimes -- Compressive Privacy and\nmulti-kernel method. Compressive Privacy is a privacy framework that employs\nutility-preserving lossy-encoding scheme to protect the privacy of the data,\nwhile multi-kernel method is a kernel based machine learning regime that\nexplores the idea of using multiple kernels for building better predictors. The\ncompressive multi-kernel method proposed consists of two stages -- the\ncompression stage and the multi-kernel stage. The compression stage follows the\nCompressive Privacy paradigm to provide the desired privacy protection. Each\nkernel matrix is compressed with a lossy projection matrix derived from the\nDiscriminant Component Analysis (DCA). The multi-kernel stage uses the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) score of each kernel to non-uniformly combine\nmultiple compressive kernels. The proposed method is evaluated on two\nmobile-sensing datasets -- MHEALTH and HAR -- where activity recognition is\ndefined as utility and person identification is defined as privacy. The results\nshow that the compression regime is successful in privacy preservation as the\nprivacy classification accuracies are almost at the random-guess level in all\nexperiments. On the other hand, the novel SNR-based multi-kernel shows utility\nclassification accuracy improvement upon the state-of-the-art in both datasets.\nThese results indicate a promising direction for research in privacy-preserving\nmachine learning.",

Outlier detection extends to several fields such as detection of\ncredit card fraud, network intrusions, machine failure prediction, potential\nterrorist attacks, and so on. Outliers are those data points with\ncharacteristics considerably different. They deviate from the data set causing\ninconsistencies, noise and anomalies during analysis and result in modification\nof the original points However, a common misconception is that outliers have to\nbe immediately eliminated or replaced from the data set. Such points could be\nconsidered useful if analyzed separately as they could be obtained from a\nseparate mechanism entirely making it important to the research question.

          "description": "In this paper, we address Novel Class Discovery (NCD), the task of unveiling\nnew classes in a set of unlabeled samples given a labeled dataset with known\nclasses. We exploit the peculiarities of NCD to build a new framework, named\nNeighborhood Contrastive Learning (NCL), to learn discriminative\nrepresentations that are important to clustering performance. Our contribution\nis twofold. First, we find that a feature extractor trained on the labeled set\ngenerates representations in which a generic query sample and its neighbors are\nlikely to share the same class. We exploit this observation to retrieve and\naggregate pseudo-positive pairs with contrastive learning, thus encouraging the\nmodel to learn more discriminative representations. Second, we notice that most\nof the instances are easily discriminated by the network, contributing less to\nthe contrastive loss. To overcome this issue, we propose to generate hard\nnegatives by mixing labeled and unlabeled samples in the feature space. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that these two ingredients significantly contribute\nto clustering performance and lead our model to outperform state-of-the-art\nmethods by a large margin (e.g., clustering accuracy +13% on CIFAR-100 and +8%\non ImageNet).",

We map the established classification into description,\nprediction, and causal inference to common research goals, such as estimating\nprevalence of adverse health or social outcomes, predicting the risk of an\nevent, and identifying risk factors or causes of adverse outcomes. This\nmeta-mapping aims at overcoming disciplinary barriers and starting a fluid\ndialogue between researchers from the social and health sciences and\nmethodologically trained researchers. Such mapping may also help to fully\nexploit the benefits of ML while considering domain-specific aspects relevant\nto the social and health sciences, and hopefully contribute to the acceleration\nof the uptake of ML applications to advance both basic and applied social and\nhealth sciences research.",

          "description": "Existing computer vision research in categorization struggles with\nfine-grained attributes recognition due to the inherently high intra-class\nvariances and low inter-class variances. SOTA methods tackle this challenge by\nlocating the most informative image regions and rely on them to classify the\ncomplete image. The most recent work, Vision Transformer (ViT), shows its\nstrong performance in both traditional and fine-grained classification tasks.\nIn this work, we propose a multi-stage ViT framework for fine-grained image\nclassification tasks, which localizes the informative image regions without\nrequiring architectural changes using the inherent multi-head self-attention\nmechanism. We also introduce attention-guided augmentations for improving the\nmodel's capabilities. We demonstrate the value of our approach by experimenting\nwith four popular fine-grained benchmarks: CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars,\nStanford Dogs, and FGVC7 Plant Pathology. We also prove our model's\ninterpretability via qualitative results.",

However, various types of graphical\nglitches may arise from such GUI complexity and have become one of the main\ncomponent of software compatibility issues. Our study on bug reports from game\ndevelopment teams in NetEase Inc. indicates that graphical glitches frequently\noccur during the GUI rendering and severely degrade the quality of\ngraphically-rich applications such as video games.

In this paper, we present the first step in\nautomating the test oracle for detecting non-crashing bugs in graphically-rich\napplications.

In offline RL, the distributional shift becomes the primary\nsource of difficulty, which arises from the deviation of the target policy\nbeing optimized from the behavior policy used for data collection. This\ntypically causes overestimation of action values, which poses severe problems\nfor model-free algorithms that use bootstrapping. To mitigate the problem,\nprior offline RL algorithms often used sophisticated techniques that encourage\nunderestimation of action values, which introduces an additional set of\nhyperparameters that need to be tuned properly. In this paper, we present an\noffline RL algorithm that prevents overestimation in a more principled way. Our\nalgorithm, OptiDICE, directly estimates the stationary distribution corrections\nof the optimal policy and does not rely on policy-gradients, unlike previous\noffline RL algorithms.

Inference of personality traits,\nsuch as Myers-Briggs Personality Type, as well as an understanding of\ndependencies between personality traits and users' behavior on various social\nmedia platforms is of crucial importance to modern research and industry\napplications. The emergence of diverse and cross-purpose social media avenues\nmakes it possible to perform user personality profiling automatically and\nefficiently based on data represented across multiple data modalities. However,\nthe research efforts on personality profiling from multi-source multi-modal\nsocial media data are relatively sparse, and the level of impact of different\nsocial network data on machine learning performance has yet to be\ncomprehensively evaluated. Furthermore, there is not such dataset in the\nresearch community to benchmark. This study is one of the first attempts\ntowards bridging such an important research gap.

It accomplishes such performance by\neffectively leveraging various forms of side information on the dynamics to\nreduce the sample complexity. Such side information typically comes from\nelementary laws of physics and qualitative properties of the system. More\nprecisely, the algorithm approximately solves an optimal control problem\nencoding the system's desired behavior.

In this work, we analyze optimization and sampling methods\nused in VMC and introduce alterations to improve their performance. First,\nbased on theoretical convergence analysis in a noiseless setting, we motivate a\nnew optimizer that we call the Rayleigh-Gauss-Newton method, which can improve\nupon gradient descent and natural gradient descent to achieve superlinear\nconvergence. Second, in order to realize this favorable comparison in the\npresence of stochastic noise, we analyze the effect of sampling error on VMC\nparameter updates and experimentally demonstrate that it can be reduced by the\nparallel tempering method. In particular, we demonstrate that RGN can be made\nrobust to energy spikes that occur when new regions of configuration space\nbecome available to the sampler over the course of optimization. Finally,\nputting theory into practice, we apply our enhanced optimization and sampling\nmethods to the transverse-field Ising and XXZ models on large lattices,\nyielding ground-state energy estimates with remarkably high accuracy after just\n200-500 parameter updates.",

We design an\nexpressive search space in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to\nrepresent candidate meta graphs for a HIN, and we propose task-dependent type\nconstraint to filter out those edge types along which message passing has no\neffect on the representations of nodes that are related to the downstream task.\nThe size of the search space we define is huge, so we further propose a novel\nand efficient search algorithm to make the total search cost on a par with\ntraining a single GNN once.

We conduct extensive\nexperiments on different HINs and downstream tasks to evaluate our method, and\nexperimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art\nheterogeneous GNNs and also improves efficiency compared with those methods\nwhich can implicitly learn meta paths.",

          "description": "We propose to learn a generative model via entropy interpolation with a\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger Bridge. The generative learning task can be formulated as\ninterpolating between a reference distribution and a target distribution based\non the Kullback-Leibler divergence. At the population level, this entropy\ninterpolation is characterized via an SDE on $[0,1]$ with a time-varying drift\nterm. At the sample level, we derive our Schr\\\"{o}dinger Bridge algorithm by\nplugging the drift term estimated by a deep score estimator and a deep density\nratio estimator into the Euler-Maruyama method. Under some mild smoothness\nassumptions of the target distribution, we prove the consistency of both the\nscore estimator and the density ratio estimator, and then establish the\nconsistency of the proposed Schr\\\"{o}dinger Bridge approach. Our theoretical\nresults guarantee that the distribution learned by our approach converges to\nthe target distribution. Experimental results on multimodal synthetic data and\nbenchmark data support our theoretical findings and indicate that the\ngenerative model via Schr\\\"{o}dinger Bridge is comparable with state-of-the-art\nGANs, suggesting a new formulation of generative learning.

          "description": "Popular approaches for minimizing loss in data-driven learning often involve\nan abstraction or an explicit retention of the history of gradients for\nefficient parameter updates. The aggregated history of gradients nudges the\nparameter updates in the right direction even when the gradients at any given\nstep are not informative. Although the history of gradients summarized in\nmeta-parameters or explicitly stored in memory has been shown effective in\ntheory and practice, the question of whether $all$ or only a subset of the\ngradients in the history are sufficient in deciding the parameter updates\nremains unanswered. In this paper, we propose a framework of memory-augmented\ngradient descent optimizers that retain a limited view of their gradient\nhistory in their internal memory. Such optimizers scale well to large real-life\ndatasets, and our experiments show that the memory augmented extensions of\nstandard optimizers enjoy accelerated convergence and improved performance on a\nmajority of computer vision and language tasks that we considered.\nAdditionally, we prove that the proposed class of optimizers with fixed-size\nmemory converge under assumptions of strong convexity, regardless of which\ngradients are selected or how they are linearly combined to form the update\nstep.",

Our attack also limits the\nunintended fooling by samples from non-sources classes, thereby circumscribing\nhuman-defined semantic notions for network fooling. We show that the proposed\nattack not only leads to the emergence of regular geometric patterns in the\nperturbations, but also reveals insightful information about the decision\nboundaries of deep models. Exploring this phenomenon further, we alter the\n`adversarial' objective of our attack to use it as a tool to `explain' deep\nvisual representation. We show that by careful channeling and projection of the\nperturbations computed by our method, we can visualize a model's understanding\nof human-defined semantic notions. Finally, we exploit the explanability\nproperties of our perturbations to perform image generation, inpainting and\ninteractive image manipulation by attacking adversarialy robust\n`classifiers'.In all, our major contribution is a novel pragmatic adversarial\nattack that is subsequently transformed into a tool to interpret the visual\nmodels.

In this paper, we consider the grant-free uplink transmission of an\nIoT network with a multiple-antenna base station (BS) and a large number of\nsingle-antenna IoT devices.

This problem can\nbe solved by applying the existing compressed sensing techniques, which however\neither suffer from high computational complexities or lack of algorithm\nrobustness. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm unrolling framework based\non the deep neural network to simultaneously achieve low computational\ncomplexity and high robustness for solving the JADCE problem. Specifically, we\nmap the original iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) into an\nunrolled recurrent neural network (RNN), thereby improving the convergence rate\nand computational efficiency through end-to-end training. Moreover, the\nproposed algorithm unrolling approach inherits the structure and domain\nknowledge of the ISTA, thereby maintaining the algorithm robustness, which can\nhandle non-Gaussian preamble sequence matrix in massive access. With rigorous\ntheoretical analysis, we further simplify the unrolled network structure by\nreducing the redundant training parameters.

          "description": "With the rapid growth of renewable energy, lots of small photovoltaic (PV)\nprosumers emerge. Due to the uncertainty of solar power generation, there is a\nneed for aggregated prosumers to predict solar power generation and whether\nsolar power generation will be larger than load. This paper presents two\ninterpretable neural networks to solve the problem: one binary classification\nneural network and one regression neural network. The neural networks are built\nusing TensorFlow. The global feature importance and local feature contributions\nare examined by three gradient-based methods: Integrated Gradients, Expected\nGradients, and DeepLIFT. Moreover, we detect abnormal cases when predictions\nmight fail by estimating the prediction uncertainty using Bayesian neural\nnetworks. Neural networks, which are interpreted by gradient-based methods and\ncomplemented with uncertainty estimation, provide robust and explainable\nforecasting for decision-makers.",

While most\nresearch focuses on the state-action function part through reducing the\nbootstrapping error in value function approximation induced by the distribution\nshift of training data, the effects of error propagation in generative modeling\nhave been neglected.

To remedy this problem, several differentiable variants of\nresampling have been proposed, all of which modify the behavior of the particle\nfilter in significant and potentially undesirable ways. In this paper, we show\nhow to obtain unbiased estimators of the gradient of the marginal likelihood by\nonly modifying messages used in backpropagation, leaving the standard forward\npass of a particle filter unchanged. Our method is simple to implement, has a\nlow computational overhead, does not introduce additional hyperparameters, and\nextends to derivatives of higher orders.

A\nparticular attention has been paid to collaborative filtering, which is the\nmost widely used in applications that involve information recommendations.\nCollaborative filtering (CF) uses the known preference of a group of users to\nmake predictions and recommendations about the unknown preferences of other\nusers (recommendations are made based on the past behavior of users). First\nintroduced in the 1990s, a wide variety of increasingly successful models have\nbeen proposed. Due to the success of machine learning techniques in many areas,\nthere has been a growing emphasis on the application of such algorithms in\nrecommendation systems. In this article, we present an overview of the CF\napproaches for recommender systems, their two main categories, and their\nevaluation metrics. We focus on the application of classical Machine Learning\nalgorithms to CF recommender systems by presenting their evolution from their\nfirst use-cases to advanced Machine Learning models.

This paper proposes a joint dimensionality reduction and\nnon-parametric density estimation framework, using a novel estimator that can\nexplicitly capture the underlying distribution of appropriate reduced-dimension\nrepresentations of the input data. The idea is to jointly design a nonlinear\ndimensionality reducing auto-encoder to model the training data in terms of a\nparsimonious set of latent random variables, and learn a canonical low-rank\ntensor model of the joint distribution of the latent variables in the Fourier\ndomain. The proposed latent density model is non-parametric and universal, as\nopposed to the predefined prior that is assumed in variational auto-encoders.\nJoint optimization of the auto-encoder and the latent density estimator is\npursued via a formulation which learns both by minimizing a combination of the\nnegative log-likelihood in the latent domain and the auto-encoder\nreconstruction loss. We demonstrate that the proposed model achieves very\npromising results on toy, tabular, and image datasets on regression tasks,\nsampling, and anomaly detection.",

          "description": "Blindly decoding a signal requires estimating its unknown transmit\nparameters, compensating for the wireless channel impairments, and identifying\nthe modulation type. While deep learning can solve complex problems, digital\nsignal processing (DSP) is interpretable and can be more computationally\nefficient. To combine both, we propose the dual path network (DPN). It consists\nof a signal path of DSP operations that recover the signal, and a feature path\nof neural networks that estimate the unknown transmit parameters. By\ninterconnecting the paths over several recovery stages, later stages benefit\nfrom the recovered signals and reuse all the previously extracted features. The\nproposed design is demonstrated to provide 5% improvement in modulation\nclassification compared to alternative designs lacking either feature sharing\nor access to recovered signals. The estimation results of DPN along with its\nblind decoding performance are shown to outperform a blind signal processing\nalgorithm for BPSK and QPSK on a simulated dataset. An over-the-air\nsoftware-defined-radio capture was used to verify DPN results at high SNRs.

          "description": "Predicting multiple heterogeneous biological and medical targets is a\nchallenge for traditional deep learning models. In contrast to single-task\nlearning, in which a separate model is trained for each target, multi-task\nlearning (MTL) optimizes a single model to predict multiple related targets\nsimultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose the Multi-gate\nMixture-of-Experts with Exclusivity (MMoEEx). Our work aims to tackle the\nheterogeneous MTL setting, in which the same model optimizes multiple tasks\nwith different characteristics. Such a scenario can overwhelm current MTL\napproaches due to the challenges in balancing shared and task-specific\nrepresentations and the need to optimize tasks with competing optimization\npaths. Our method makes two key contributions: first, we introduce an approach\nto induce more diversity among experts, thus creating representations more\nsuitable for highly imbalanced and heterogenous MTL learning; second, we adopt\na two-step optimization [6, 11] approach to balancing the tasks at the gradient\nlevel. We validate our method on three MTL benchmark datasets, including\nMedical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) and PubChem BioAssay\n(PCBA).",

          "description": "Federated Learning (FL) refers to the paradigm where multiple worker nodes\n(WNs) build a joint model by using local data. Despite extensive research, for\na generic non-convex FL problem, it is not clear, how to choose the WNs' and\nthe server's update directions, the minibatch sizes, and the local update\nfrequency, so that the WNs use the minimum number of samples and communication\nrounds to achieve the desired solution. This work addresses the above question\nand considers a class of stochastic algorithms where the WNs perform a few\nlocal updates before communication. We show that when both the WN's and the\nserver's directions are chosen based on a stochastic momentum estimator, the\nalgorithm requires $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-3/2})$ samples and\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ communication rounds to compute an\n$\\epsilon$-stationary solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nFL algorithm that achieves such {\\it near-optimal} sample and communication\ncomplexities simultaneously. Further, we show that there is a trade-off curve\nbetween local update frequencies and local minibatch sizes, on which the above\nsample and communication complexities can be maintained. Finally, we show that\nfor the classical FedAvg (a.k.a. Local SGD, which is a momentum-less special\ncase of the STEM), a similar trade-off curve exists, albeit with worse sample\nand communication complexities. Our insights on this trade-off provides\nguidelines for choosing the four important design elements for FL algorithms,\nthe update frequency, directions, and minibatch sizes to achieve the best\nperformance.",

          "description": "Transferability estimation is an essential problem in transfer learning to\npredict how good the performance is when transfer a source model (source task)\nto a target task. Recent analytical transferability metrics have been widely\nused for source model selection and multi-task learning. Earlier metrics does\nnot work sufficiently well under the challenging cross-domain cross-task\ntransfer settings, but recent OTCE score achieves a noteworthy performance\nusing auxiliary tasks. A simplified version named OT-based NCE score sacrifices\naccuracy to be more efficient, but it can be further improved. Consequently, we\npropose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score to further\nimprove the cross-domain cross-task transferability estimation performance,\nwhich is more efficient than the OTCE score and more accurate than the OT-based\nNCE score. Specifically, we build the joint correspondences between source and\ntarget data via solving an optimal transport problem with considering both the\nsample distance and label distance, and then compute the transferability score\nas the negative conditional entropy. Extensive validations under the\nintra-dataset and inter-dataset transfer settings demonstrate that our JC-NCE\nscore outperforms the OT-based NCE score with about 7% and 12% gains,\nrespectively.",

          "description": "Existing observational approaches for learning human preferences, such as\ninverse reinforcement learning, usually make strong assumptions about the\nobservability of the human's environment. However, in reality, people make many\nimportant decisions under uncertainty. To better understand preference learning\nin these cases, we study the setting of inverse decision theory (IDT), a\npreviously proposed framework where a human is observed making non-sequential\nbinary decisions under uncertainty. In IDT, the human's preferences are\nconveyed through their loss function, which expresses a tradeoff between\ndifferent types of mistakes. We give the first statistical analysis of IDT,\nproviding conditions necessary to identify these preferences and characterizing\nthe sample complexity -- the number of decisions that must be observed to learn\nthe tradeoff the human is making to a desired precision. Interestingly, we show\nthat it is actually easier to identify preferences when the decision problem is\nmore uncertain. Furthermore, uncertain decision problems allow us to relax the\nunrealistic assumption that the human is an optimal decision maker but still\nidentify their exact preferences; we give sample complexities in this\nsuboptimal case as well. Our analysis contradicts the intuition that partial\nobservability should make preference learning more difficult. It also provides\na first step towards understanding and improving preference learning methods\nfor uncertain and suboptimal humans.",

          "description": "Meta-learning (ML) has emerged as a promising direction in learning models\nunder constrained resource settings like few-shot learning. The popular\napproaches for ML either learn a generalizable initial model or a generic\nparametric optimizer through episodic training. The former approaches leverage\nthe knowledge from a batch of tasks to learn an optimal prior. In this work, we\nstudy the importance of a batch for ML. Specifically, we first incorporate a\nbatch episodic training regimen to improve the learning of the generic\nparametric optimizer. We also hypothesize that the common assumption in batch\nepisodic training that each task in a batch has an equal contribution to\nlearning an optimal meta-model need not be true. We propose to weight the tasks\nin a batch according to their \"importance\" in improving the meta-model's\nlearning. To this end, we introduce a training curriculum motivated by\nselective focus in humans, called task attended meta-training, to weight the\ntasks in a batch. Task attention is a standalone module that can be integrated\nwith any batch episodic training regimen. The comparisons of the models with\ntheir non-task-attended counterparts on complex datasets like miniImageNet and\ntieredImageNet validate its effectiveness.",

          "description": "Formulating real-world optimization problems often begins with making\npredictions from historical data (e.g., an optimizer that aims to recommend\nfast routes relies upon travel-time predictions). Typically, learning the\nprediction model used to generate the optimization problem and solving that\nproblem are performed in two separate stages. Recent work has showed how such\nprediction models can be learned end-to-end by differentiating through the\noptimization task. Such methods often yield empirical improvements, which are\ntypically attributed to end-to-end making better error tradeoffs than the\nstandard loss function used in a two-stage solution. We refine this explanation\nand more precisely characterize when end-to-end can improve performance. When\nprediction targets are stochastic, a two-stage solution must make an a priori\nchoice about which statistics of the target distribution to model -- we\nconsider expectations over prediction targets -- while an end-to-end solution\ncan make this choice adaptively. We show that the performance gap between a\ntwo-stage and end-to-end approach is closely related to the \\emph{price of\ncorrelation} concept in stochastic optimization and show the implications of\nsome existing POC results for our predict-then-optimize problem. We then\nconsider a novel and particularly practical setting, where coefficients in the\nobjective function depend on multiple prediction targets. We give explicit\nconstructions where (1) two-stage performs unboundedly worse than end-to-end;\nand (2) two-stage is optimal. We identify a large set of real-world\napplications whose objective functions rely on multiple prediction targets but\nwhich nevertheless deploy two-stage solutions. We also use simulations to\nexperimentally quantify performance gaps.",

To our knowledge, this paper is the first\nMachine Learning approach to the prediction of FG direction. Conducted data\nanalysis reveals the inherent complexity of the problem and explains the\nreasons of difficulty in FG direction prediction based on 2D X-ray images. To\nperform growth forecasting, we employ a wide range of algorithms, from logistic\nregression, through tree ensembles to neural networks and consider three,\nslightly different, problem formulations. The resulting classification accuracy\nvaries between 71% and 75%.",

A linear regression trained\non top of the learned representations outperforms previous SOTAs for supervised\ntime series forecasting. Also, the instance-level representations can be simply\nobtained by applying a max pooling layer on top of learned representations of\nall timestamps. We conduct extensive experiments on time series classification\ntasks to evaluate the quality of instance-level representations.

          "description": "The utilization of computer technology to solve problems in medical scenarios\nhas attracted considerable attention in recent years, which still has great\npotential and space for exploration. Among them, machine learning has been\nwidely used in the prediction, diagnosis and even treatment of Sepsis. However,\nstate-of-the-art methods require large amounts of labeled medical data for\nsupervised learning. In real-world applications, the lack of labeled data will\ncause enormous obstacles if one hospital wants to deploy a new Sepsis detection\nsystem. Different from the supervised learning setting, we need to use known\ninformation (e.g., from another hospital with rich labeled data) to help build\na model with acceptable performance, i.e., transfer learning. In this paper, we\npropose a semi-supervised optimal transport with self-paced ensemble framework\nfor Sepsis early detection, called SPSSOT, to transfer knowledge from the other\nthat has rich labeled data. In SPSSOT, we first extract the same clinical\nindicators from the source domain (e.g., hospital with rich labeled data) and\nthe target domain (e.g., hospital with little labeled data), then we combine\nthe semi-supervised domain adaptation based on optimal transport theory with\nself-paced under-sampling to avoid a negative transfer possibly caused by\ncovariate shift and class imbalance. On the whole, SPSSOT is an end-to-end\ntransfer learning method for Sepsis early detection which can automatically\nselect suitable samples from two domains respectively according to the number\nof iterations and align feature space of two domains. Extensive experiments on\ntwo open clinical datasets demonstrate that comparing with other methods, our\nproposed SPSSOT, can significantly improve the AUC values with only 1% labeled\ndata in the target domain in two transfer learning scenarios, MIMIC\n$rightarrow$ Challenge and Challenge $rightarrow$ MIMIC.",

In this paper we present a multi-task deep reinforcement learning\nmodel to select the time of a live video streaming event, aiming to optimize\nthe viewer's engagement and adoption at the same time.

          "description": "In the status quo, dementia is yet to be cured. Precise diagnosis prior to\nthe onset of the symptoms can prevent the rapid progression of the emerging\ncognitive impairment. Recent progress has shown that Electroencephalography\n(EEG) is the promising and cost-effective test to facilitate the detection of\nneurocognitive disorders. However, most of the existing works have been using\nonly resting-state EEG. The efficiencies of EEG signals from various cognitive\ntasks, for dementia classification, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. In\nthis study, we designed four cognitive tasks that engage different cognitive\nperformances: attention, working memory, and executive function. We\ninvestigated these tasks by using statistical analysis on both time and\nfrequency domains of EEG signals from three classes of human subjects: Dementia\n(DEM), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Normal Control (NC). We also\nfurther evaluated the classification performances of two features extraction\nmethods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Filter Bank Common Spatial\nPattern (FBCSP). We found that the working memory related tasks yielded good\nperformances for dementia recognition in both cases using PCA and FBCSP.\nMoreover, FBCSP with features combination from four tasks revealed the best\nsensitivity of 0.87 and the specificity of 0.80. To our best knowledge, this is\nthe first work that concurrently investigated several cognitive tasks for\ndementia recognition using both statistical analysis and classification scores.\nOur results give essential information to design and aid in conducting further\nexperimental tasks to early diagnose dementia patients.",

          "description": "Continual learning (CL) -- the ability to continuously learn, building on\npreviously acquired knowledge -- is a natural requirement for long-lived\nautonomous reinforcement learning (RL) agents. While building such agents, one\nneeds to balance opposing desiderata, such as constraints on capacity and\ncompute, the ability to not catastrophically forget, and to exhibit positive\ntransfer on new tasks. Understanding the right trade-off is conceptually and\ncomputationally challenging, which we argue has led the community to overly\nfocus on catastrophic forgetting. In response to these issues, we advocate for\nthe need to prioritize forward transfer and propose Continual World, a\nbenchmark consisting of realistic and meaningfully diverse robotic tasks built\non top of Meta-World as a testbed. Following an in-depth empirical evaluation\nof existing CL methods, we pinpoint their limitations and highlight unique\nalgorithmic challenges in the RL setting.

In this survey,\nwe extend the concept of SSL, which first emerged in the fields of computer\nvision and natural language processing, to present a timely and comprehensive\nreview of the existing SSL techniques for graph data. Specifically, we divide\nexisting graph SSL methods into three categories: contrastive, generative, and\npredictive.

However, most common neural\ncell models, including biologically plausible, such as Hodgkin-Huxley or\nIzhikevich, do not possess predictive dynamics on a single-cell level.\nMoreover, the modern rules of synaptic plasticity or interconnections weights\nadaptation also do not provide grounding for the ability of neurons to adapt to\nthe ever-changing input signal intensity. While natural neuron synaptic growth\nis precisely controlled and restricted by protein supply and recycling, weight\ncorrection rules such as widely used STDP are efficiently unlimited in change\nrate and scale. The present article introduces new mechanics of interconnection\nbetween neuron firing rate homeostasis and weight change through STDP growth\nbounded by abstract protein reserve, controlled by the intracellular\noptimization algorithm. We show how these cellular dynamics help neurons filter\nout the intense noise signals to help neurons keep a stable firing rate. We\nalso examine that such filtering does not affect the ability of neurons to\nrecognize the correlated inputs in unsupervised mode.

In this work, we seek to\nclose this optimality gap and introduce Group-Structured Adversarial Training\n(GSAT) which learns a model robust to perturbations structured across samples.\nWe formulate GSAT as a non-convex concave minimax optimization problem which\nminimizes a group-structured optimal transport cost.

          "description": "The interpretation of feature importance in machine learning models is\nchallenging when features are dependent. Permutation feature importance (PFI)\nignores such dependencies, which can cause misleading interpretations due to\nextrapolation. A possible remedy is more advanced conditional PFI approaches\nthat enable the assessment of feature importance conditional on all other\nfeatures. Due to this shift in perspective and in order to enable correct\ninterpretations, it is therefore important that the conditioning is transparent\nand humanly comprehensible. In this paper, we propose a new sampling mechanism\nfor the conditional distribution based on permutations in conditional\nsubgroups. As these subgroups are constructed using decision trees\n(transformation trees), the conditioning becomes inherently interpretable. This\nnot only provides a simple and effective estimator of conditional PFI, but also\nlocal PFI estimates within the subgroups. In addition, we apply the conditional\nsubgroups approach to partial dependence plots (PDP), a popular method for\ndescribing feature effects that can also suffer from extrapolation when\nfeatures are dependent and interactions are present in the model. We show that\nPFI and PDP based on conditional subgroups often outperform methods such as\nconditional PFI based on knockoffs, or accumulated local effect plots.\nFurthermore, our approach allows for a more fine-grained interpretation of\nfeature effects and importance within the conditional subgroups.",

          "description": "Works on lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) and single-shot network pruning\n(SNIP) have raised a lot of attention currently on post-training pruning\n(iterative magnitude pruning), and before-training pruning (pruning at\ninitialization). The former method suffers from an extremely large computation\ncost and the latter category of methods usually struggles with insufficient\nperformance. In comparison, during-training pruning, a class of pruning methods\nthat simultaneously enjoys the training/inference efficiency and the comparable\nperformance, temporarily, has been less explored. To better understand\nduring-training pruning, we quantitatively study the effect of pruning\nthroughout training from the perspective of pruning plasticity (the ability of\nthe pruned networks to recover the original performance). Pruning plasticity\ncan help explain several other empirical observations about neural network\npruning in literature. We further find that pruning plasticity can be\nsubstantially improved by injecting a brain-inspired mechanism called\nneuroregeneration, i.e., to regenerate the same number of connections as\npruned. Based on the insights from pruning plasticity, we design a novel\ngradual magnitude pruning (GMP) method, named gradual pruning with zero-cost\nneuroregeneration (GraNet), and its dynamic sparse training (DST) variant\n(GraNet-ST). Both of them advance state of the art. Perhaps most impressively,\nthe latter for the first time boosts the sparse-to-sparse training performance\nover various dense-to-sparse methods by a large margin with ResNet-50 on\nImageNet.

Second, it\npresents a comprehensive comparative study of different learning approaches -\nRandom Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, Multiway Decision\nTree, Support Vector Machine, k-NN, Gradient Boosted Trees, Decision Stump,\nAuto MLP, Linear Regression, Vector Linear Regression, Random Tree, Na\\\"ive\nBayes, Na\\\"ive Bayes (Kernel), Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic\nDiscriminant Analysis, and Deep Learning applied to this framework. The\nperformance of each of these learning approaches was boosted by using the\nAdaBoost algorithm, and the Cross Validation approach was used for training and\ntesting. The results show that in boosted form, the k- NN classifier\noutperforms all the other boosted learning approaches and is, therefore, the\noptimal learning method for this purpose. The results presented and discussed\nuphold the importance of this work to contribute towards augmenting the\nabilities of exoskeleton-based assisted and independent living of the elderly\nin the future of Internet of Things-based living environments, such as Smart\nHomes.

Subsequently,\nspatio-temporal structure of disorder-specific dynamics is crucial for early\ndiagnosis and understanding the disorder mechanism. A common way of learning\ndiscriminatory features relies on training a classifier and evaluating feature\nimportance. Classical classifiers, based on handcrafted features are quite\npowerful, but suffer the curse of dimensionality when applied to large input\ndimensions of spatio-temporal data. Deep learning algorithms could handle the\nproblem and a model introspection could highlight discriminatory\nspatio-temporal regions but need way more samples to train. In this paper we\npresent a novel self supervised training schema which reinforces whole sequence\nmutual information local to context (whole MILC). We pre-train the whole MILC\nmodel on unlabeled and unrelated healthy control data. We test our model on\nthree different disorders (i) Schizophrenia (ii) Autism and (iii) Alzheimers\nand four different studies. Our algorithm outperforms existing self-supervised\npre-training methods and provides competitive classification results to\nclassical machine learning algorithms.

This oracle can answer the query that\n``do items $u$ and $v$ belong to the same cluster?''.

This paper presents LiquidSense, a liquid-level\nsensing system that is low-cost, high accuracy, widely applicable to different\ndaily liquids and containers, and can be easily integrated with existing smart\nhome networks. LiquidSense uses an existing home WiFi network and a low-cost\ntransducer that attached to the container to sense the resonance of the\ncontainer for liquid level detection. In particular, our system mounts a\nlow-cost transducer on the surface of the container and emits a well-designed\nchirp signal to make the container resonant, which introduces subtle changes to\nthe home WiFi signals. By analyzing the subtle phase changes of the WiFi\nsignals, LiquidSense extracts the resonance frequency as a feature for liquid\nlevel detection. Our system constructs prediction models for both continuous\nand discrete predictions using curve fitting and SVM respectively. We evaluate\nLiquidSense in home environments with containers of three different materials\nand six types of liquids. Results show that LiquidSense achieves an overall\naccuracy of 97% for continuous prediction and an overall F-score of 0.968 for\ndiscrete prediction.

Unlike massive image and voice datasets, there have relatively few\nacoustic signal datasets, especially for engineering fault detection. In order\nto enhance the development of fault diagnosis, we collect acoustic leakage\nsignals on the basis of an intact gas pipe system with external artificial\nleakages, and then preprocess the collected data with structured tailoring\nwhich are turned into GPLA-12. GPLA-12 dedicates to serve as a feature learning\ndataset for time-series tasks and classifications. To further understand the\ndataset, we train both shadow and deep learning algorithms to observe the\nperformance.

          "description": "Despite their widespread success, the application of deep neural networks to\nfunctional data remains scarce today. The infinite dimensionality of functional\ndata means standard learning algorithms can be applied only after appropriate\ndimension reduction, typically achieved via basis expansions. Currently, these\nbases are chosen a priori without the information for the task at hand and thus\nmay not be effective for the designated task. We instead propose to adaptively\nlearn these bases in an end-to-end fashion. We introduce neural networks that\nemploy a new Basis Layer whose hidden units are each basis functions themselves\nimplemented as a micro neural network. Our architecture learns to apply\nparsimonious dimension reduction to functional inputs that focuses only on\ninformation relevant to the target rather than irrelevant variation in the\ninput function. Across numerous classification/regression tasks with functional\ndata, our method empirically outperforms other types of neural networks, and we\nprove that our approach is statistically consistent with low generalization\nerror.

          "description": "Abstraction is an important aspect of intelligence which enables agents to\nconstruct robust representations for effective decision making. In the last\ndecade, deep networks are proven to be effective due to their ability to form\nincreasingly complex abstractions. However, these abstractions are distributed\nover many neurons, making the re-use of a learned skill costly. Previous work\neither enforced formation of abstractions creating a designer bias, or used a\nlarge number of neural units without investigating how to obtain high-level\nfeatures that may more effectively capture the source task. For avoiding\ndesigner bias and unsparing resource use, we propose to exploit neural response\ndynamics to form compact representations to use in skill transfer. For this, we\nconsider two competing methods based on (1) maximum information compression\nprinciple and (2) the notion that abstract events tend to generate slowly\nchanging signals, and apply them to the neural signals generated during task\nexecution. To be concrete, in our simulation experiments, we either apply\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) or slow feature analysis (SFA) on the\nsignals collected from the last hidden layer of a deep network while it\nperforms a source task, and use these features for skill transfer in a new\ntarget task. We compare the generalization performance of these alternatives\nwith the baselines of skill transfer with full layer output and no-transfer\nsettings. Our results show that SFA units are the most successful for skill\ntransfer. SFA as well as PCA, incur less resources compared to usual skill\ntransfer, whereby many units formed show a localized response reflecting\nend-effector-obstacle-goal relations. Finally, SFA units with lowest\neigenvalues resembles symbolic representations that highly correlate with\nhigh-level features such as joint angles which might be thought of precursors\nfor fully symbolic systems.",

          "description": "We consider a best arm identification (BAI) problem for stochastic bandits\nwith adversarial corruptions in the fixed-budget setting of T steps. We design\na novel randomized algorithm, Probabilistic Sequential Shrinking($u$)\n(PSS($u$)), which is agnostic to the amount of corruptions. When the amount of\ncorruptions per step (CPS) is below a threshold, PSS($u$) identifies the best\narm or item with probability tending to $1$ as $T\\rightarrow \\infty$.\nOtherwise, the optimality gap of the identified item degrades gracefully with\nthe CPS.We argue that such a bifurcation is necessary. In PSS($u$), the\nparameter $u$ serves to balance between the optimality gap and success\nprobability. The injection of randomization is shown to be essential to\nmitigate the impact of corruptions. To demonstrate this, we design two attack\nstrategies that are applicable to any algorithm. We apply one of them to a\ndeterministic analogue of PSS($u$) known as Successive Halving (SH) by Karnin\net al. (2013). The attack strategy results in a high failure probability for\nSH, but PSS($u$) remains robust. In the absence of corruptions, PSS($2$)'s\nperformance guarantee matches SH's.

          "description": "The adoption of machine learning in materials science has rapidly transformed\nmaterials property prediction. Hurdles limiting full capitalization of recent\nadvancements in machine learning include the limited development of methods to\nlearn the underlying interactions of multiple elements, as well as the\nrelationships among multiple properties, to facilitate property prediction in\nnew composition spaces. To address these issues, we introduce the Hierarchical\nCorrelation Learning for Multi-property Prediction (H-CLMP) framework that\nseamlessly integrates (i) prediction using only a material's composition, (ii)\nlearning and exploitation of correlations among target properties in\nmulti-target regression, and (iii) leveraging training data from tangential\ndomains via generative transfer learning. The model is demonstrated for\nprediction of spectral optical absorption of complex metal oxides spanning 69\n3-cation metal oxide composition spaces. H-CLMP accurately predicts non-linear\ncomposition-property relationships in composition spaces for which no training\ndata is available, which broadens the purview of machine learning to the\ndiscovery of materials with exceptional properties. This achievement results\nfrom the principled integration of latent embedding learning, property\ncorrelation learning, generative transfer learning, and attention models. The\nbest performance is obtained using H-CLMP with Transfer learning (H-CLMP(T))\nwherein a generative adversarial network is trained on computational density of\nstates data and deployed in the target domain to augment prediction of optical\nabsorption from composition.

We then propose an\n\\textup{end-to-end bias mitigation} framework, which employs a fusion of pre-,\nin-, and post-processing methods to leverage the strengths of each individual\ntechnique. We test this method, along with the standard techniques we review,\non a deep neural network to analyze bias mitigation in a deep learning setting.\nWe find that our end-to-end bias mitigation framework outperforms the baselines\nwith respect to several fairness metrics, suggesting its promise as a method\nfor improving fairness. As society increasingly relies on artificial\nintelligence to help in decision-making, addressing gender biases present in\ndeep learning models is imperative. To provide readers with the tools to assess\nthe fairness of machine learning models and mitigate the biases present in\nthem, we discuss multiple open source packages for fairness in AI.",

          "description": "Graph-based Anomaly Detection (GAD) is becoming prevalent due to the powerful\nrepresentation abilities of graphs as well as recent advances in graph mining\ntechniques. These GAD tools, however, expose a new attacking surface,\nironically due to their unique advantage of being able to exploit the relations\namong data. That is, attackers now can manipulate those relations (i.e., the\nstructure of the graph) to allow some target nodes to evade detection. In this\npaper, we exploit this vulnerability by designing a new type of targeted\nstructural poisoning attacks to a representative regression-based GAD system\ntermed OddBall. Specially, we formulate the attack against OddBall as a\nbi-level optimization problem, where the key technical challenge is to\nefficiently solve the problem in a discrete domain. We propose a novel attack\nmethod termed BinarizedAttack based on gradient descent. Comparing to prior\narts, BinarizedAttack can better use the gradient information, making it\nparticularly suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems.\nFurthermore, we investigate the attack transferability of BinarizedAttack by\nemploying it to attack other representation-learning-based GAD systems. Our\ncomprehensive experiments demonstrate that BinarizedAttack is very effective in\nenabling target nodes to evade graph-based anomaly detection tools with limited\nattackers' budget, and in the black-box transfer attack setting,\nBinarizedAttack is also tested effective and in particular, can significantly\nchange the node embeddings learned by the GAD systems. Our research thus opens\nthe door to studying a new type of attack against security analytic tools that\nrely on graph data.",

However, most of the research on fairness has considered a\nsingle classifier based prediction task. What are the fairness impacts of the\npreprocessing stages in machine learning pipeline? Furthermore, studies showed\nthat often the root cause of unfairness is ingrained in the data itself, rather\nthan the model.

In\nthis paper, we introduced the causal method of fairness to reason about the\nfairness impact of data preprocessing stages in ML pipeline. We leveraged\nexisting metrics to define the fairness measures of the stages.

In particular, immediately\nafter momentum turning points, where a trend reverses from an uptrend\n(downtrend) to a downtrend (uptrend), time-series momentum (TSMOM) strategies\nare prone to making bad bets. To improve the response to regime change, we\nintroduce a novel approach, where we insert an online change-point detection\n(CPD) module into a Deep Momentum Network (DMN) [1904.04912] pipeline, which\nuses an LSTM deep-learning architecture to simultaneously learn both trend\nestimation and position sizing.

Our CPD module outputs a\nchangepoint location and severity score, allowing our model to learn to respond\nto varying degrees of disequilibrium, or smaller and more localised\nchangepoints, in a data driven manner. Using a portfolio of 50, liquid,\ncontinuous futures contracts over the period 1990-2020, the addition of the CPD\nmodule leads to an improvement in Sharpe ratio of one-third.

          "description": "In adversarial training (AT), the main focus has been the objective and\noptimizer while the model has been less studied, so that the models being used\nare still those classic ones in standard training (ST). Classic network\narchitectures (NAs) are generally worse than searched NAs in ST, which should\nbe the same in AT. In this paper, we argue that NA and AT cannot be handled\nindependently, since given a dataset, the optimal NA in ST would be no longer\noptimal in AT. That being said, AT is time-consuming itself; if we directly\nsearch NAs in AT over large search spaces, the computation will be practically\ninfeasible. Thus, we propose a diverse-structured network (DS-Net), to\nsignificantly reduce the size of the search space: instead of low-level\noperations, we only consider predefined atomic blocks, where an atomic block is\na time-tested building block like the residual block. There are only a few\natomic blocks and thus we can weight all atomic blocks rather than find the\nbest one in a searched block of DS-Net, which is an essential trade-off between\nexploring diverse structures and exploiting the best structures. Empirical\nresults demonstrate the advantages of DS-Net, i.e., weighting the atomic\nblocks.",

We tackle this challenge by introducing a novel\nvariational structured approximation inspired by the Bayesian interpretation of\nDropout regularization. Concretely, we focus on the inflexibility of the\nfactorized structure in Dropout posterior and then propose an improved method\ncalled Variational Structured Dropout (VSD). VSD employs an orthogonal\ntransformation to learn a structured representation on the variational noise\nand consequently induces statistical dependencies in the approximate posterior.\nTheoretically, VSD successfully addresses the pathologies of previous\nVariational Dropout methods and thus offers a standard Bayesian justification.\nWe further show that VSD induces an adaptive regularization term with several\ndesirable properties which contribute to better generalization. Finally, we\nconduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of VSD over state-of-the-art variational methods on predictive\naccuracy, uncertainty estimation, and out-of-distribution detection.",

However, in many scenarios the collection of paired\nnoise-noise images is still impractical. To bypass labeled images, Noise2Void\nmethods predict masked pixels from their surroundings with single noisy images\nonly and give improved denoising results that still need improvements.

          "description": "Representation learning on user-item graph for recommendation has evolved\nfrom using single ID or interaction history to exploiting higher-order\nneighbors. This leads to the success of graph convolution networks (GCNs) for\nrecommendation such as PinSage and LightGCN. Despite effectiveness, we argue\nthat they suffer from two limitations: (1) high-degree nodes exert larger\nimpact on the representation learning, deteriorating the recommendations of\nlow-degree (long-tail) items; and (2) representations are vulnerable to noisy\ninteractions, as the neighborhood aggregation scheme further enlarges the\nimpact of observed edges.\n\nIn this work, we explore self-supervised learning on user-item graph, so as\nto improve the accuracy and robustness of GCNs for recommendation. The idea is\nto supplement the classical supervised task of recommendation with an auxiliary\nself-supervised task, which reinforces node representation learning via\nself-discrimination. Specifically, we generate multiple views of a node,\nmaximizing the agreement between different views of the same node compared to\nthat of other nodes. We devise three operators to generate the views -- node\ndropout, edge dropout, and random walk -- that change the graph structure in\ndifferent manners. We term this new learning paradigm as\n\\textit{Self-supervised Graph Learning} (SGL), implementing it on the\nstate-of-the-art model LightGCN. Through theoretical analyses, we find that SGL\nhas the ability of automatically mining hard negatives. Empirical studies on\nthree benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SGL, which improves\nthe recommendation accuracy, especially on long-tail items, and the robustness\nagainst interaction noises. Our implementations are available at\n\\url{https://github.com/wujcan/SGL}.",

          "description": "Sleep disorder diagnosis relies on the analysis of polysomnography (PSG)\nrecords. As a preliminary step of this examination, sleep stages are\nsystematically determined. In practice, sleep stage classification relies on\nthe visual inspection of 30-second epochs of polysomnography signals. Numerous\nautomatic approaches have been developed to replace this tedious and expensive\ntask. Although these methods demonstrated better performance than human sleep\nexperts on specific datasets, they remain largely unused in sleep clinics. The\nmain reason is that each sleep clinic uses a specific PSG montage that most\nautomatic approaches cannot handle out-of-the-box. Moreover, even when the PSG\nmontage is compatible, publications have shown that automatic approaches\nperform poorly on unseen data with different demographics. To address these\nissues, we introduce RobustSleepNet, a deep learning model for automatic sleep\nstage classification able to handle arbitrary PSG montages. We trained and\nevaluated this model in a leave-one-out-dataset fashion on a large corpus of 8\nheterogeneous sleep staging datasets to make it robust to demographic changes.\nWhen evaluated on an unseen dataset, RobustSleepNet reaches 97% of the F1 of a\nmodel explicitly trained on this dataset. Hence, RobustSleepNet unlocks the\npossibility to perform high-quality out-of-the-box automatic sleep staging with\nany clinical setup. We further show that finetuning RobustSleepNet, using a\npart of the unseen dataset, increases the F1 by 2% when compared to a model\ntrained specifically for this dataset. Therefore, finetuning might be used to\nreach a state-of-the-art level of performance on a specific population.",

Next, we show that the solution to the PDE converges in the\ntraining time to a zero-loss solution.

In the conventional generative replay, the generative\nmodel is pre-trained for old data and shared in extra memory for later\nincremental learning. In our proposed DF-GR, we train a generative model from\nscratch without using any training data, based on the pre-trained\nclassification model from the past, so we curtail the cost of sharing\npre-trained generative models. Second, we introduce dual-teacher information\ndistillation (DT-ID) for knowledge distillation from two teachers to one\nstudent. In CIL, we use DT-ID to learn new classes incrementally based on the\npre-trained model for old classes and another model (pre-)trained on the new\ndata for new classes.

          "description": "Most environmental data come from a minority of well-monitored sites. An\nongoing challenge in the environmental sciences is transferring knowledge from\nmonitored sites to unmonitored sites. Here, we demonstrate a novel transfer\nlearning framework that accurately predicts depth-specific temperature in\nunmonitored lakes (targets) by borrowing models from well-monitored lakes\n(sources). This method, Meta Transfer Learning (MTL), builds a meta-learning\nmodel to predict transfer performance from candidate source models to targets\nusing lake attributes and candidates' past performance. We constructed source\nmodels at 145 well-monitored lakes using calibrated process-based modeling (PB)\nand a recently developed approach called process-guided deep learning (PGDL).\nWe applied MTL to either PB or PGDL source models (PB-MTL or PGDL-MTL,\nrespectively) to predict temperatures in 305 target lakes treated as\nunmonitored in the Upper Midwestern United States. We show significantly\nimproved performance relative to the uncalibrated process-based General Lake\nModel, where the median RMSE for the target lakes is $2.52^{\\circ}C$. PB-MTL\nyielded a median RMSE of $2.43^{\\circ}C$; PGDL-MTL yielded $2.16^{\\circ}C$; and\na PGDL-MTL ensemble of nine sources per target yielded $1.88^{\\circ}C$. For\nsparsely monitored target lakes, PGDL-MTL often outperformed PGDL models\ntrained on the target lakes themselves. Differences in maximum depth between\nthe source and target were consistently the most important predictors. Our\napproach readily scales to thousands of lakes in the Midwestern United States,\ndemonstrating that MTL with meaningful predictor variables and high-quality\nsource models is a promising approach for many kinds of unmonitored systems and\nenvironmental variables.",

First, most RL methods require intensive data from the exploration\nof the environment to achieve satisfactory performance. Second, the use of\nneural networks in RL renders it hard to interpret the internals of the system\nin a way that humans can understand. To address these two challenges, we\npropose a framework that enables an RL agent to reason over its exploration\nprocess and distill high-level knowledge for effectively guiding its future\nexplorations. Specifically, we propose a novel RL algorithm that learns\nhigh-level knowledge in the form of a finite reward automaton by using the L*\nlearning algorithm. We prove that in episodic RL, a finite reward automaton can\nexpress any non-Markovian bounded reward functions with finitely many reward\nvalues and approximate any non-Markovian bounded reward function (with\ninfinitely many reward values) with arbitrary precision. We also provide a\nlower bound for the episode length such that the proposed RL approach almost\nsurely converges to an optimal policy in the limit. We test this approach on\ntwo RL environments with non-Markovian reward functions, choosing a variety of\ntasks with increasing complexity for each environment. We compare our algorithm\nwith the state-of-the-art RL algorithms for non-Markovian reward functions,\nsuch as Joint Inference of Reward machines and Policies for RL (JIRP), Learning\nReward Machine (LRM), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO2).

          "description": "Modelling the behaviours of other agents is essential for understanding how\nagents interact and making effective decisions. Existing methods for agent\nmodelling commonly assume knowledge of the local observations and chosen\nactions of the modelled agents during execution. To eliminate this assumption,\nwe extract representations from the local information of the controlled agent\nusing encoder-decoder architectures. Using the observations and actions of the\nmodelled agents during training, our models learn to extract representations\nabout the modelled agents conditioned only on the local observations of the\ncontrolled agent. The representations are used to augment the controlled\nagent's decision policy which is trained via deep reinforcement learning; thus,\nduring execution, the policy does not require access to other agents'\ninformation. We provide a comprehensive evaluation and ablations studies in\ncooperative, competitive and mixed multi-agent environments, showing that our\nmethod achieves significantly higher returns than baseline methods which do not\nuse the learned representations.",

          "description": "Neural networks are increasingly used in environmental science applications.\nFurthermore, neural network models are trained by minimizing a loss function,\nand it is crucial to choose the loss function very carefully for environmental\nscience applications, as it determines what exactly is being optimized.\nStandard loss functions do not cover all the needs of the environmental\nsciences, which makes it important for scientists to be able to develop their\nown custom loss functions so that they can implement many of the classic\nperformance measures already developed in environmental science, including\nmeasures developed for spatial model verification. However, there are very few\nresources available that cover the basics of custom loss function development\ncomprehensively, and to the best of our knowledge none that focus on the needs\nof environmental scientists. This document seeks to fill this gap by providing\na guide on how to write custom loss functions targeted toward environmental\nscience applications. Topics include the basics of writing custom loss\nfunctions, common pitfalls, functions to use in loss functions, examples such\nas fractions skill score as loss function, how to incorporate physical\nconstraints, discrete and soft discretization, and concepts such as focal,\nrobust, and adaptive loss. While examples are currently provided in this guide\nfor Python with Keras and the TensorFlow backend, the basic concepts also apply\nto other environments, such as Python with PyTorch. Similarly, while the sample\nloss functions provided here are from meteorology, these are just examples of\nhow to create custom loss functions. Other fields in the environmental sciences\nhave very similar needs for custom loss functions, e.g., for evaluating spatial\nforecasts effectively, and the concepts discussed here can be applied there as\nwell.

Each\ncomposition may introduce an additional expectation. The series of expectations\nmay be nested. Stochastic compositional optimization is gaining popularity in\napplications such as reinforcement learning and meta learning. This paper\npresents a new Stochastically Corrected Stochastic Compositional gradient\nmethod (SCSC). SCSC runs in a single-time scale with a single loop, uses a\nfixed batch size, and guarantees to converge at the same rate as the stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) method for non-compositional stochastic optimization.\nThis is achieved by making a careful improvement to a popular stochastic\ncompositional gradient method. It is easy to apply SGD-improvement techniques\nto accelerate SCSC. This helps SCSC achieve state-of-the-art performance for\nstochastic compositional optimization. In particular, we apply Adam to SCSC,\nand the exhibited rate of convergence matches that of the original Adam on\nnon-compositional stochastic optimization.

In contrast to most related works, we\nassume that the knowledge of the underlying pre- and post-change distributions\nare not known and can only be learned from the training sequences which are\navailable. We further require the probability of the \\emph{estimation error} to\ndecay either exponentially or sub-exponentially fast (corresponding\nrespectively to the large and moderate deviations regimes in information theory\nparlance). Based on the training sequences as well as the test sequence\nconsisting of a single change-point, we design a change-point estimator and\nfurther show that this estimator is optimal by establishing matching (strong)\nconverses.

Next, we show empirically that directly optimizing this objective\ncan be quite challenging. Instead, we propose a surrogate for the trimmed\nlasso, called the $\\textit{generalized soft-min}$. This penalty smoothly\ninterpolates between the classical lasso and the trimmed lasso, while taking\ninto account all possible $k$-sparse patterns.

          "description": "Despite the significant advances in deep learning over the past decade, a\nmajor challenge that limits the wide-spread adoption of deep learning has been\ntheir fragility to adversarial attacks. This sensitivity to making erroneous\npredictions in the presence of adversarially perturbed data makes deep neural\nnetworks difficult to adopt for certain real-world, mission-critical\napplications. While much of the research focus has revolved around adversarial\nexample creation and adversarial hardening, the area of performance measures\nfor assessing adversarial robustness is not well explored. Motivated by this,\nthis study presents the concept of residual error, a new performance measure\nfor not only assessing the adversarial robustness of a deep neural network at\nthe individual sample level, but also can be used to differentiate between\nadversarial and non-adversarial examples to facilitate for adversarial example\ndetection. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid model for approximating the\nresidual error in a tractable manner. Experimental results using the case of\nimage classification demonstrates the effectiveness and efficacy of the\nproposed residual error metric for assessing several well-known deep neural\nnetwork architectures. These results thus illustrate that the proposed measure\ncould be a useful tool for not only assessing the robustness of deep neural\nnetworks used in mission-critical scenarios, but also in the design of\nadversarially robust models.",

In this paper,\nwe study the problem of node data privacy, where graph nodes have potentially\nsensitive data that is kept private, but they could be beneficial for a central\nserver for training a GNN over the graph. To address this problem, we develop a\nprivacy-preserving, architecture-agnostic GNN learning algorithm with formal\nprivacy guarantees based on Local Differential Privacy (LDP). Specifically, we\npropose an LDP encoder and an unbiased rectifier, by which the server can\ncommunicate with the graph nodes to privately collect their data and\napproximate the GNN's first layer. To further reduce the effect of the injected\nnoise, we propose to prepend a simple graph convolution layer, called KProp,\nwhich is based on the multi-hop aggregation of the nodes' features acting as a\ndenoising mechanism. Finally, we propose a robust training framework, in which\nwe benefit from KProp's denoising capability to increase the accuracy of\ninference in the presence of noisy labels.

          "description": "While current state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems\nachieve high accuracy on typical speech, they suffer from significant\nperformance degradation on disordered speech and other atypical speech\npatterns. Personalization of ASR models, a commonly applied solution to this\nproblem, is usually performed in a server-based training environment posing\nproblems around data privacy, delayed model-update times, and communication\ncost for copying data and models between mobile device and server\ninfrastructure. In this paper, we present an approach to on-device based ASR\npersonalization with very small amounts of speaker-specific data. We test our\napproach on a diverse set of 100 speakers with disordered speech and find\nmedian relative word error rate improvement of 71% with only 50 short\nutterances required per speaker. When tested on a voice-controlled home\nautomation platform, on-device personalized models show a median task success\nrate of 81%, compared to only 40% of the unadapted models.",

The 3D visual abstractions are encoded as 3-dimensional\nvisual feature maps. We infer these 3D visual scene feature maps from RGB\nimages of the scene via view prediction: when the generated 3D scene feature\nmap is neurally projected from a camera viewpoint, it should match the\ncorresponding RGB image. We present generative models that condition on the\ndependency tree of an utterance and generate a corresponding visual 3D feature\nmap as well as reason about its plausibility, and detector models that\ncondition on both the dependency tree of an utterance and a related image and\nlocalize the object referents in the 3D feature map inferred from the image.\nOur model outperforms models of language and vision that associate language\nwith 2D CNN activations or 2D images by a large margin in a variety of tasks,\nsuch as, classifying plausibility of utterances, detecting referential\nexpressions, and supplying rewards for trajectory optimization of object\nplacement policies from language instructions. We perform numerous ablations\nand show the improved performance of our detectors is due to its better\ngeneralization across camera viewpoints and lack of object interferences in the\ninferred 3D feature space, and the improved performance of our generators is\ndue to their ability to spatially reason about objects and their configurations\nin 3D when mapping from language to scenes.",

Local explainer models have recently been introduced to\nexplain the predictions of complex machine learning models at the instance\nlevel. In this paper, we propose Local Rule-based Model Interpretability with\nk-optimal Associations (LoRMIkA), a novel model-agnostic approach that obtains\nk-optimal association rules from a neighbourhood of the instance to be\nexplained. Compared with other rule-based approaches in the literature, we\nargue that the most predictive rules are not necessarily the rules that provide\nthe best explanations. Consequently, the LoRMIkA framework provides a flexible\nway to obtain predictive and interesting rules. It uses an efficient search\nalgorithm guaranteed to find the k-optimal rules with respect to objectives\nsuch as confidence, lift, leverage, coverage, and support. It also provides\nmultiple rules which explain the decision and counterfactual rules, which give\nindications for potential changes to obtain different outputs for given\ninstances. We compare our approach to other state-of-the-art approaches in\nlocal model interpretability on three different datasets and achieve\ncompetitive results in terms of local accuracy and interpretability.",

          "description": "Inductive rule learning is arguably among the most traditional paradigms in\nmachine learning. Although we have seen considerable progress over the years in\nlearning rule-based theories, all state-of-the-art learners still learn\ndescriptions that directly relate the input features to the target concept. In\nthe simplest case, concept learning, this is a disjunctive normal form (DNF)\ndescription of the positive class. While it is clear that this is sufficient\nfrom a logical point of view because every logical expression can be reduced to\nan equivalent DNF expression, it could nevertheless be the case that more\nstructured representations, which form deep theories by forming intermediate\nconcepts, could be easier to learn, in very much the same way as deep neural\nnetworks are able to outperform shallow networks, even though the latter are\nalso universal function approximators. In this paper, we empirically compare\ndeep and shallow rule learning with a uniform general algorithm, which relies\non greedy mini-batch based optimization.

          "description": "Inspired by its success in natural language processing and computer vision,\npre-training has attracted substantial attention in cheminformatics and\nbioinformatics, especially for molecule based tasks. A molecule can be\nrepresented by either a graph (where atoms are connected by bonds) or a SMILES\nsequence (where depth-first-search is applied to the molecular graph with\nspecific rules). Existing works on molecule pre-training use either graph\nrepresentations only or SMILES representations only. In this work, we propose\nto leverage both the representations and design a new pre-training algorithm,\ndual-view molecule pre-training (briefly, DMP), that can effectively combine\nthe strengths of both types of molecule representations. The model of DMP\nconsists of two branches: a Transformer branch that takes the SMILES sequence\nof a molecule as input, and a GNN branch that takes a molecular graph as input.\nThe training of DMP contains three tasks: (1) predicting masked tokens in a\nSMILES sequence by the Transformer branch, (2) predicting masked atoms in a\nmolecular graph by the GNN branch, and (3) maximizing the consistency between\nthe two high-level representations output by the Transformer and GNN branches\nseparately. After pre-training, we can use either the Transformer branch (this\none is recommended according to empirical results), the GNN branch, or both for\ndownstream tasks. DMP is tested on nine molecular property prediction tasks and\nachieves state-of-the-art performances on seven of them. Furthermore, we test\nDMP on three retrosynthesis tasks and achieve state-of-the-result on the\nUSPTO-full dataset. Our code will be released soon.",

          "description": "In online reinforcement learning (RL), efficient exploration remains\nparticularly challenging in high-dimensional environments with sparse rewards.\nIn low-dimensional environments, where tabular parameterization is possible,\ncount-based upper confidence bound (UCB) exploration methods achieve minimax\nnear-optimal rates. However, it remains unclear how to efficiently implement\nUCB in realistic RL tasks that involve non-linear function approximation. To\naddress this, we propose a new exploration approach via \\textit{maximizing} the\ndeviation of the occupancy of the next policy from the explored regions. We add\nthis term as an adaptive regularizer to the standard RL objective to balance\nexploration vs. exploitation. We pair the new objective with a provably\nconvergent algorithm, giving rise to a new intrinsic reward that adjusts\nexisting bonuses. The proposed intrinsic reward is easy to implement and\ncombine with other existing RL algorithms to conduct exploration. As a proof of\nconcept, we evaluate the new intrinsic reward on tabular examples across a\nvariety of model-based and model-free algorithms, showing improvements over\ncount-only exploration strategies. When tested on navigation and locomotion\ntasks from MiniGrid and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks, our approach\nsignificantly improves sample efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.

Meanwhile,\ngraph neural network (GNN) has shown promising performance in various node\nclassification tasks. However, for Ethereum transaction data, which could be\nnaturally abstracted to a real-world complex graph, the scarcity of labels and\nthe huge volume of transaction data make it difficult to take advantage of GNN\nmethods. Here in this paper, to address the two challenges, we propose a\nSelf-supervised Incremental deep Graph learning model (SIEGE), for the phishing\nscam detection problem on Ethereum. In our model, two pretext tasks designed\nfrom spatial and temporal perspectives help us effectively learn useful node\nembedding from the huge amount of unlabelled transaction data. And the\nincremental paradigm allows us to efficiently handle large-scale transaction\ndata and help the model maintain good performance when the data distribution is\ndrastically changing.

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are effective in solving many real-world\nproblems. Larger DNN models usually exhibit better quality (e.g., accuracy) but\ntheir excessive computation results in long training and inference time. Model\nsparsification can reduce the computation and memory cost while maintaining\nmodel quality. Most existing sparsification algorithms unidirectionally remove\nweights, while others randomly or greedily explore a small subset of weights in\neach layer. The inefficiency of the algorithms reduces the achievable sparsity\nlevel. In addition, many algorithms still require pre-trained dense models and\nthus suffer from large memory footprint and long training time. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel scheduled grow-and-prune (GaP) methodology without\npre-training the dense models. It addresses the shortcomings of the previous\nworks by repeatedly growing a subset of layers to dense and then pruning back\nto sparse after some training. Experiments have shown that such models can\nmatch or beat the quality of highly optimized dense models at 80% sparsity on a\nvariety of tasks, such as image classification, objective detection, 3D object\npart segmentation, and translation. They also outperform other state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) pruning methods, including pruning from pre-trained dense models. As an\nexample, a 90% sparse ResNet-50 obtained via GaP achieves 77.9% top-1 accuracy\non ImageNet, improving the SOTA results by 1.5%.",

One major challenge of FL comes from heterogeneity in users, which\nmay have distributionally different (or non-iid) data and varying computation\nresources. Just like in centralized learning, FL users also desire model\nrobustness against malicious attackers at test time. Whereas adversarial\ntraining (AT) provides a sound solution for centralized learning, extending its\nusage for FL users has imposed significant challenges, as many users may have\nvery limited training data as well as tight computational budgets, to afford\nthe data-hungry and costly AT. In this paper, we study a novel learning setting\nthat propagates adversarial robustness from high-resource users that can afford\nAT, to those low-resource users that cannot afford it, during the FL process.\nWe show that existing FL techniques cannot effectively propagate adversarial\nrobustness among non-iid users, and propose a simple yet effective propagation\napproach that transfers robustness through carefully designed\nbatch-normalization statistics. We demonstrate the rationality and\neffectiveness of our method through extensive experiments.

          "description": "This paper addresses the problem of policy selection in domains with abundant\nlogged data, but with a very restricted interaction budget. Solving this\nproblem would enable safe evaluation and deployment of offline reinforcement\nlearning policies in industry, robotics, and healthcare domain among others.\nSeveral off-policy evaluation (OPE) techniques have been proposed to assess the\nvalue of policies using only logged data. However, there is still a big gap\nbetween the evaluation by OPE and the full online evaluation in the real\nenvironment. To reduce this gap, we introduce a novel \\emph{active offline\npolicy selection} problem formulation, which combined logged data and limited\nonline interactions to identify the best policy. We rely on the advances in OPE\nto warm start the evaluation. We build upon Bayesian optimization to\niteratively decide which policies to evaluate in order to utilize the limited\nenvironment interactions wisely.

          "description": "This book develops an effective theory approach to understanding deep neural\nnetworks of practical relevance. Beginning from a first-principles\ncomponent-level picture of networks, we explain how to determine an accurate\ndescription of the output of trained networks by solving layer-to-layer\niteration equations and nonlinear learning dynamics. A main result is that the\npredictions of networks are described by nearly-Gaussian distributions, with\nthe depth-to-width aspect ratio of the network controlling the deviations from\nthe infinite-width Gaussian description. We explain how these effectively-deep\nnetworks learn nontrivial representations from training and more broadly\nanalyze the mechanism of representation learning for nonlinear models. From a\nnearly-kernel-methods perspective, we find that the dependence of such models'\npredictions on the underlying learning algorithm can be expressed in a simple\nand universal way. To obtain these results, we develop the notion of\nrepresentation group flow (RG flow) to characterize the propagation of signals\nthrough the network. By tuning networks to criticality, we give a practical\nsolution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. We further explain\nhow RG flow leads to near-universal behavior and lets us categorize networks\nbuilt from different activation functions into universality classes.\nAltogether, we show that the depth-to-width ratio governs the effective model\ncomplexity of the ensemble of trained networks. By using information-theoretic\ntechniques, we estimate the optimal aspect ratio at which we expect the network\nto be practically most useful and show how residual connections can be used to\npush this scale to arbitrary depths. With these tools, we can learn in detail\nabout the inductive bias of architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers.",

A popular data-driven method to detect incipient failures and\nanomalies is the training of normal behaviour models by applying a machine\nlearning technique like feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) or extreme learning\nmachines (ELM). However, the performance of any of these modelling techniques\ncan be deteriorated by the unexpected rise of non-stationarities in the dynamic\nenvironment in which industrial assets operate. This unpredictable statistical\nchange in the measured variable is known as concept drift. In this article a\nwind turbine maintenance case is presented, where non-stationarities of various\nkinds can happen unexpectedly. Such concept drift events are desired to be\ndetected by means of statistical detectors and window-based approaches.\nHowever, in real complex systems, concept drifts are not as clear and evident\nas in artificially generated datasets. In order to evaluate the effectiveness\nof current drift detectors and also to design an appropriate novel technique\nfor this specific industrial application, it is essential to dispose beforehand\nof a characterization of the existent drifts. Under the lack of information in\nthis regard, a methodology for labelling concept drift events in the lifetime\nof wind turbines is proposed. This methodology will facilitate the creation of\na drift database that will serve both as a training ground for concept drift\ndetectors and as a valuable information to enhance the knowledge about\nmaintenance of complex systems.",

          "description": "Vertical federated learning is a collaborative machine learning framework to\ntrain deep leaning models on vertically partitioned data with\nprivacy-preservation. It attracts much attention both from academia and\nindustry. Unfortunately, applying most existing vertical federated learning\nmethods in real-world applications still faces two daunting challenges. First,\nmost existing vertical federated learning methods have a strong assumption that\nat least one party holds the complete set of labels of all data samples, while\nthis assumption is not satisfied in many practical scenarios, where labels are\nhorizontally partitioned and the parties only hold partial labels. Existing\nvertical federated learning methods can only utilize partial labels, which may\nlead to inadequate model update in end-to-end backpropagation. Second,\ncomputational and communication resources vary in parties. Some parties with\nlimited computational and communication resources will become the stragglers\nand slow down the convergence of training. Such straggler problem will be\nexaggerated in the scenarios of horizontally partitioned labels in vertical\nfederated learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel vertical\nfederated learning framework named Cascade Vertical Federated Learning (CVFL)\nto fully utilize all horizontally partitioned labels to train neural networks\nwith privacy-preservation. To mitigate the straggler problem, we design a novel\noptimization objective which can increase straggler's contribution to the\ntrained models. We conduct a series of qualitative experiments to rigorously\nverify the effectiveness of CVFL. It is demonstrated that CVFL can achieve\ncomparable performance (e.g., accuracy for classification tasks) with\ncentralized training. The new optimization objective can further mitigate the\nstraggler problem comparing with only using the asynchronous aggregation\nmechanism during training.",

While LDP is often believed\nto be too stringent to allow for satisfactory utility, our paper challenges\nthis belief. We consider a general setup with unbalanced, heterogeneous data,\ndisparate privacy needs across clients, and unreliable communication, where a\nrandom number/subset of clients is available each round. We propose three LDP\nalgorithms for smooth (strongly) convex FL; each are noisy variations of\ndistributed minibatch SGD. One is accelerated and one involves novel\ntime-varying noise, which we use to obtain the first non-trivial LDP excess\nrisk bound for the fully general non-i.i.d. FL problem. Specializing to i.i.d.\nclients, our risk bounds interpolate between the best known and/or optimal\nbounds in the centralized setting and the cross-device setting, where each\nclient represents just one person's data. Furthermore, we show that in certain\nregimes, our convergence rate (nearly) matches the corresponding non-private\nlower bound or outperforms state of the art non-private algorithms (``privacy\nfor free''). Finally, we validate our theoretical results and illustrate the\npractical utility of our algorithm with numerical experiments.",

          "description": "Recent work in equivariant deep learning bears strong similarities to\nphysics. Fields over a base space are fundamental entities in both subjects, as\nare equivariant maps between these fields. In deep learning, however, these\nmaps are usually defined by convolutions with a kernel, whereas they are\npartial differential operators (PDOs) in physics. Developing the theory of\nequivariant PDOs in the context of deep learning could bring these subjects\neven closer together and lead to a stronger flow of ideas. In this work, we\nderive a $G$-steerability constraint that completely characterizes when a PDO\nbetween feature vector fields is equivariant, for arbitrary symmetry groups\n$G$. We then fully solve this constraint for several important groups. We use\nour solutions as equivariant drop-in replacements for convolutional layers and\nbenchmark them in that role. Finally, we develop a framework for equivariant\nmaps based on Schwartz distributions that unifies classical convolutions and\ndifferential operators and gives insight about the relation between the two.",

The exact invertibility has been achieved\nin the real NVP using a specific pattern to exchange information between two\nseparated groups of dimensions. KRnet has been developed to enhance the\ninformation exchange among data dimensions by incorporating the\nKnothe-Rosenblatt rearrangement into the structure of the transport map.

To alleviate this issue, we will\nadd augmented dimensions that act as a channel for communications among the\ndata dimensions. In the augmented KRnet, a fully nonlinear update is achieved\nin two iterations. We also show that the augmented KRnet can be reformulated as\nthe discretization of a neural ODE, where the exact invertibility is kept such\nthat the adjoint method can be formulated with respect to the discretized ODE\nto obtain the exact gradient.

          "description": "The breakthrough of contrastive learning (CL) has fueled the recent success\nof self-supervised learning (SSL) in high-level vision tasks on RGB images.\nHowever, CL is still ill-defined for low-level vision tasks, such as joint\ndemosaicking and denoising (JDD), in the RAW domain. To bridge this\nmethodological gap, we present a novel CL approach on RAW images, residual\ncontrastive learning (RCL), which aims to learn meaningful representations for\nJDD. Our work is built on the assumption that noise contained in each RAW image\nis signal-dependent, thus two crops from the same RAW image should have more\nsimilar noise distribution than two crops from different RAW images. We use\nresiduals as a discriminative feature and the earth mover's distance to measure\nthe distribution divergence for the contrastive loss. To evaluate the proposed\nCL strategy, we simulate a series of unsupervised JDD experiments with\nlarge-scale data corrupted by synthetic signal-dependent noise, where we set a\nnew benchmark for unsupervised JDD tasks with unknown (random) noise variance.\nOur empirical study not only validates that CL can be applied on distributions\n(c.f. features), but also exposes the lack of robustness of previous non-ML and\nSSL JDD methods when the statistics of the noise are unknown, thus providing\nsome further insight into signal-dependent noise problems.",

          "description": "Decentralized training of deep learning models enables on-device learning\nover networks, as well as efficient scaling to large compute clusters.\nExperiments in earlier works reveal that, even in a data-center setup,\ndecentralized training often suffers from the degradation in the quality of the\nmodel: the training and test performance of models trained in a decentralized\nfashion is in general worse than that of models trained in a centralized\nfashion, and this performance drop is impacted by parameters such as network\nsize, communication topology and data partitioning. We identify the changing\nconsensus distance between devices as a key parameter to explain the gap\nbetween centralized and decentralized training.\n\nWe show in theory that when the training consensus distance is lower than a\ncritical quantity, decentralized training converges as fast as the centralized\ncounterpart. We empirically validate that the relation between generalization\nperformance and consensus distance is consistent with this theoretical\nobservation. Our empirical insights allow the principled design of better\ndecentralized training schemes that mitigate the performance drop. To this end,\nwe provide practical training guidelines and exemplify its effectiveness on the\ndata-center setup as the important first step.",

          "description": "The performance of a reinforcement learning (RL) system depends on the\ncomputational architecture used to approximate a value function. Deep learning\nmethods provide both optimization techniques and architectures for\napproximating nonlinear functions from noisy, high-dimensional observations.\nHowever, prevailing optimization techniques are not designed for\nstrictly-incremental online updates. Nor are standard architectures designed\nfor observations with an a priori unknown structure: for example, light sensors\nrandomly dispersed in space. This paper proposes an online RL prediction\nalgorithm with an adaptive architecture that efficiently finds useful nonlinear\nfeatures. The algorithm is evaluated in a spatial domain with high-dimensional,\nstochastic observations. The algorithm outperforms non-adaptive baseline\narchitectures and approaches the performance of an architecture given\nside-channel information. These results are a step towards scalable RL\nalgorithms for more general problems, where the observation structure is not\navailable.",

However, when data is heterogeneous, most architectures are limited as\nthey employ a single strategy to handle multi-channel graph signals and they\ntypically focus on low-frequency information. In this paper, we present a novel\ngraph convolution operator, termed BankGCN, which keeps benefits of message\npassing models, but extends their capabilities beyond `low-pass' features. It\ndecomposes multi-channel signals on graphs into subspaces and handles\nparticular information in each subspace with an adapted filter. The filters of\nall subspaces have different frequency responses and together form a filter\nbank. Furthermore, each filter in the spectral domain corresponds to a message\npassing scheme, and diverse schemes are implemented via the filter bank.\nImportantly, the filter bank and the signal decomposition are jointly learned\nto adapt to the spectral characteristics of data and to target applications.\nFurthermore, this is implemented almost without extra parameters in comparison\nwith most existing MPGCNs.

          "description": "Vision Transformers (ViT) have been shown to attain highly competitive\nperformance for a wide range of vision applications, such as image\nclassification, object detection and semantic image segmentation. In comparison\nto convolutional neural networks, the Vision Transformer's weaker inductive\nbias is generally found to cause an increased reliance on model regularization\nor data augmentation (``AugReg'' for short) when training on smaller training\ndatasets. We conduct a systematic empirical study in order to better understand\nthe interplay between the amount of training data, AugReg, model size and\ncompute budget. As one result of this study we find that the combination of\nincreased compute and AugReg can yield models with the same performance as\nmodels trained on an order of magnitude more training data: we train ViT models\nof various sizes on the public ImageNet-21k dataset which either match or\noutperform their counterparts trained on the larger, but not publicly available\nJFT-300M dataset.",

In many applications,\nespecially in the natural language processing (NLP) field, this task may be\nnecessary, mainly when considering foreign names. Some machine learning\nalgorithms can satisfactorily perform the prediction. In this paper, we\nexamined and implemented feedforward and recurrent deep neural network models,\nsuch as MLP, RNN, GRU, CNN, and BiLSTM, to classify gender through the first\nname. A dataset of Brazilian names is used to train and evaluate the models. We\nanalyzed the accuracy, recall, precision, and confusion matrix to measure the\nmodels' performances. The results indicate that the gender prediction can be\nperformed from the feature extraction strategy looking at the names as a set of\nstrings.

          "description": "Several years of research have shown that machine-learning systems are\nvulnerable to adversarial examples, both in theory and in practice. Until now,\nsuch attacks have primarily targeted visual models, exploiting the gap between\nhuman and machine perception. Although text-based models have also been\nattacked with adversarial examples, such attacks struggled to preserve semantic\nmeaning and indistinguishability. In this paper, we explore a large class of\nadversarial examples that can be used to attack text-based models in a\nblack-box setting without making any human-perceptible visual modification to\ninputs. We use encoding-specific perturbations that are imperceptible to the\nhuman eye to manipulate the outputs of a wide range of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) systems from neural machine-translation pipelines to web\nsearch engines. We find that with a single imperceptible encoding injection --\nrepresenting one invisible character, homoglyph, reordering, or deletion -- an\nattacker can significantly reduce the performance of vulnerable models, and\nwith three injections most models can be functionally broken. Our attacks work\nagainst currently-deployed commercial systems, including those produced by\nMicrosoft and Google, in addition to open source models published by Facebook\nand IBM. This novel series of attacks presents a significant threat to many\nlanguage processing systems: an attacker can affect systems in a targeted\nmanner without any assumptions about the underlying model. We conclude that\ntext-based NLP systems require careful input sanitization, just like\nconventional applications, and that given such systems are now being deployed\nrapidly at scale, the urgent attention of architects and operators is required.",

However, new classes with\ncompletely unseen data distributions can stream across any device in a\nfederated learning setting, whose data cannot be accessed by the global server\nor other users. To this end, we propose a unified zero-shot framework to handle\nthese aforementioned challenges during federated learning. We simulate two\nscenarios here -- 1) when the new class labels are not reported by the user,\nthe traditional FL setting is used; 2) when new class labels are reported by\nthe user, we synthesize Anonymized Data Impressions by calculating class\nsimilarity matrices corresponding to each device's new classes followed by\nunsupervised clustering to distinguish between new classes across different\nusers. Moreover, our proposed framework can also handle statistical\nheterogeneities in both labels and models across the participating users. We\nempirically evaluate our framework on-device across different communication\nrounds (FL iterations) with new classes in both local and global updates, along\nwith heterogeneous labels and models, on two widely used audio classification\napplications -- keyword spotting and urban sound classification, and observe an\naverage deterministic accuracy increase of ~4.041% and ~4.258% respectively.",

          "description": "Collecting training data from untrusted sources exposes machine learning\nservices to poisoning adversaries, who maliciously manipulate training data to\ndegrade the model accuracy. When trained on offline datasets, poisoning\nadversaries have to inject the poisoned data in advance before training, and\nthe order of feeding these poisoned batches into the model is stochastic. In\ncontrast, practical systems are more usually trained/fine-tuned on sequentially\ncaptured real-time data, in which case poisoning adversaries could dynamically\npoison each data batch according to the current model state. In this paper, we\nfocus on the real-time settings and propose a new attacking strategy, which\naffiliates an accumulative phase with poisoning attacks to secretly (i.e.,\nwithout affecting accuracy) magnify the destructive effect of a (poisoned)\ntrigger batch. By mimicking online learning and federated learning on CIFAR-10,\nwe show that the model accuracy will significantly drop by a single update step\non the trigger batch after the accumulative phase.

          "description": "In today's ML, data can be twisted (changed) in various ways, either for bad\nor good intent. Such twisted data challenges the founding theory of properness\nfor supervised losses which form the basis for many popular losses for class\nprobability estimation. Unfortunately, at its core, properness ensures that the\noptimal models also learn the twist. In this paper, we analyse such class\nprobability-based losses when they are stripped off the mandatory properness;\nwe define twist-proper losses as losses formally able to retrieve the optimum\n(untwisted) estimate off the twists, and show that a natural extension of a\nhalf-century old loss introduced by S. Arimoto is twist proper. We then turn to\na theory that has provided some of the best off-the-shelf algorithms for proper\nlosses, boosting. Boosting can require access to the derivative of the convex\nconjugate of a loss to compute examples weights. Such a function can be hard to\nget, for computational or mathematical reasons; this turns out to be the case\nfor Arimoto's loss. We bypass this difficulty by inverting the problem as\nfollows: suppose a blueprint boosting algorithm is implemented with a general\nweight update function. What are the losses for which boosting-compliant\nminimisation happens? Our answer comes as a general boosting algorithm which\nmeets the optimal boosting dependence on the number of calls to the weak\nlearner; when applied to Arimoto's loss, it leads to a simple optimisation\nalgorithm whose performances are showcased on several domains and twists.",

Therefore, to apply a variety of CVIs to evaluate clustering\nresults is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel internal CVI -- the\nDistance-based Separability Index (DSI), based on a data separability measure.\nWe compared the DSI with eight internal CVIs including studies from early Dunn\n(1974) to most recent CVDD (2019) and an external CVI as ground truth, by using\nclustering results of five clustering algorithms on 12 real and 97 synthetic\ndatasets.

          "description": "This paper investigates two techniques for developing efficient\nself-supervised vision transformers (EsViT) for visual representation learning.\nFirst, we show through a comprehensive empirical study that multi-stage\narchitectures with sparse self-attentions can significantly reduce modeling\ncomplexity but with a cost of losing the ability to capture fine-grained\ncorrespondences between image regions. Second, we propose a new pre-training\ntask of region matching which allows the model to capture fine-grained region\ndependencies and as a result significantly improves the quality of the learned\nvision representations. Our results show that combining the two techniques,\nEsViT achieves 81.3% top-1 on the ImageNet linear probe evaluation,\noutperforming prior arts with around an order magnitude of higher throughput.\nWhen transferring to downstream linear classification tasks, EsViT outperforms\nits supervised counterpart on 17 out of 18 datasets. The code and models will\nbe publicly available.",

[2019] to address the domain generalization problem by\nleveraging data heterogeneity from differing experimental conditions.\nSpecifically, IRM seeks to find a data representation under which an optimal\nclassifier remains invariant across all domains. Despite the conceptual appeal\nof IRM, the effectiveness of the originally proposed invariance penalty has\nrecently been brought into question. In particular, there exists\ncounterexamples for which that invariance penalty can be arbitrarily small for\nnon-invariant data representations. We propose an alternative invariance\npenalty by revisiting the Gramian matrix of the data representation. We discuss\nthe role of its eigenvalues in the relationship between the risk and the\ninvariance penalty, and demonstrate that it is ill-conditioned for said\ncounterexamples.

A well-known advantage of mean\nembeddings and MMD is their low computational cost and low sample complexity.\nHowever, kernel mean embeddings have had limited applications to problems that\nconsist in optimizing distributions, due to the difficulty of characterizing\nwhich Hilbert space vectors correspond to a probability distribution.

To define the artificial labels, we exploit the\nassumption that neural network generators can be trained more easily to map\nnearby latent vectors to data with semantic similarities, than across separate\ncategories. We use generated data samples and their corresponding artificial\nconditioning labels to train a classifier. The classifier is then used to\nself-label real data. To boost the accuracy of the self-labeling, we also use\nthe exponential moving average of the classifier. However, because the\nclassifier might still make mistakes, especially at the beginning of the\ntraining, we also refine the labels through self-attention, by using the\nlabeling of real data samples only when the classifier outputs a high\nclassification probability score. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, STL-10\nand SVHN, and show that both self-labeling and self-attention consistently\nimprove the quality of generated data.

Usually, Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software\nestimates the machining times using the commanded feedrate from the toolpath\nfile using basic kinematic settings. Typically, the methods do not account for\ntoolpath geometry or toolpath tolerance and therefore under estimate the\nmachining cycle times considerably. Removing the need for machine specific\nknowledge, this paper presents a data-driven feedrate and machining cycle time\nprediction method by building a neural network model for each machine tool\naxis. In this study, datasets composed of the commanded feedrate, nominal\nacceleration, toolpath geometry and the measured feedrate were used to train a\nneural network model. Validation trials using a representative industrial thin\nwall structure component on a commercial machining centre showed that this\nmethod estimated the machining time with more than 90% accuracy. This method\nshowed that neural network models have the capability to learn the behavior of\na complex machine tool system and predict cycle times. Further integration of\nthe methods will be critical in the implantation of digital twins in Industry\n4.0.",

          "description": "An important challenge facing modern machine learning is how to rigorously\nquantify the uncertainty of model predictions. Conveying uncertainty is\nespecially important when there are changes to the underlying data distribution\nthat might invalidate the predictive model. Yet, most existing uncertainty\nquantification algorithms break down in the presence of such shifts. We propose\na novel approach that addresses this challenge by constructing \\emph{probably\napproximately correct (PAC)} prediction sets in the presence of covariate\nshift. Our approach focuses on the setting where there is a covariate shift\nfrom the source distribution (where we have labeled training examples) to the\ntarget distribution (for which we want to quantify uncertainty). Our algorithm\nassumes given importance weights that encode how the probabilities of the\ntraining examples change under the covariate shift. In practice, importance\nweights typically need to be estimated; thus, we extend our algorithm to the\nsetting where we are given confidence intervals for the importance weights\nrather than their true value. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\non various covariate shifts designed based on the DomainNet and ImageNet\ndatasets.",

          "description": "We develop a versatile optimization method, which finds the design parameters\nthat minimize time-averaged acoustic cost functionals. The method is\ngradient-free, model-informed, and data-driven with reservoir computing based\non echo state networks. First, we analyse the predictive capabilities of echo\nstate networks both in the short- and long-time prediction of the dynamics. We\nfind that both fully data-driven and model-informed architectures learn the\nchaotic acoustic dynamics, both time-accurately and statistically. Informing\nthe training with a physical reduced-order model with one acoustic mode\nmarkedly improves the accuracy and robustness of the echo state networks,\nwhilst keeping the computational cost low. Echo state networks offer accurate\npredictions of the long-time dynamics, which would be otherwise expensive by\nintegrating the governing equations to evaluate the time-averaged quantity to\noptimize. Second, we couple echo state networks with a Bayesian technique to\nexplore the design thermoacoustic parameter space. The computational method is\nminimally intrusive. Third, we find the set of flame parameters that minimize\nthe time-averaged acoustic energy of chaotic oscillations, which are caused by\nthe positive feedback with a heat source, such as a flame in gas turbines or\nrocket motors. These oscillations are known as thermoacoustic oscillations. The\noptimal set of flame parameters is found with the same accuracy as brute-force\ngrid search, but with a convergence rate that is more than one order of\nmagnitude faster. This work opens up new possibilities for non-intrusive\n(``hands-off'') optimization of chaotic systems, in which the cost of\ngenerating data, for example from high-fidelity simulations and experiments, is\nhigh.",

In this work, we theoretically\nshow that the violation of the Gaussian noise assumption will hinder the causal\ndirection identification, making the causal orientation fully determined by the\ncausal strength as well as the variances of noises in the linear case and the\nnoises of strong non-Gaussianity in the nonlinear case. Consequently, we\npropose a more general entropy-based loss that is theoretically consistent with\nthe likelihood score under any noise distribution. We run extensive empirical\nevaluations on both synthetic data and real-world data to validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method and show that our method achieves the best\nin Structure Hamming Distance, False Discovery Rate, and True Positive Rate\nmatrices.",

Our result is applicable in Reinforcement\nLearning (RL). In particular, we use it to establish the first-known\nconvergence rate of the V-trace algorithm for off-policy TD-learning.

MLRATE is robust to poor\npredictions from the machine learning step: if the predictions are uncorrelated\nwith the outcomes, the estimator performs asymptotically no worse than the\nstandard difference-in-means estimator, while if predictions are highly\ncorrelated with outcomes, the efficiency gains are large. In A/A tests, for a\nset of 48 outcome metrics commonly monitored in Facebook experiments the\nestimator has over 70% lower variance than the simple difference-in-means\nestimator, and about 19% lower variance than the common univariate procedure\nwhich adjusts only for pre-experiment values of the outcome.",

          "description": "Multiple views of data, both naturally acquired (e.g., image and audio) and\nartificially produced (e.g., via adding different noise to data samples), have\nproven useful in enhancing representation learning. Natural views are often\nhandled by multiview analysis tools, e.g., (deep) canonical correlation\nanalysis [(D)CCA], while the artificial ones are frequently used in\nself-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, e.g., SimCLR and Barlow Twins. Both\ntypes of approaches often involve learning neural feature extractors such that\nthe embeddings of data exhibit high cross-view correlations. Although\nintuitive, the effectiveness of correlation-based neural embedding is only\nempirically validated. This work puts forth a theory-backed framework for\nunsupervised multiview learning. Our development starts with proposing a\nmultiview model, where each view is a nonlinear mixture of shared and private\ncomponents. Consequently, the learning problem boils down to shared/private\ncomponent identification and disentanglement. Under this model, latent\ncorrelation maximization is shown to guarantee the extraction of the shared\ncomponents across views (up to certain ambiguities). In addition, the private\ninformation in each view can be provably disentangled from the shared using\nproper regularization design. The method is tested on a series of tasks, e.g.,\ndownstream clustering, which all show promising performance.

Pure Machine Learning (ML) approaches often\nfail in the small sample regime and cannot provide actionable insights beyond\npredictions. A promising modification has been to incorporate expert domain\nknowledge into ML models. The application we consider is predicting the\nprogression of disease under medications, where a plethora of domain knowledge\nis available from pharmacology. Pharmacological models describe the dynamics of\ncarefully-chosen medically meaningful variables in terms of systems of Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODEs). However, these models only describe a limited\ncollection of variables, and these variables are often not observable in\nclinical environments. To close this gap, we propose the latent hybridisation\nmodel (LHM) that integrates a system of expert-designed ODEs with\nmachine-learned Neural ODEs to fully describe the dynamics of the system and to\nlink the expert and latent variables to observable quantities. We evaluated LHM\non synthetic data as well as real-world intensive care data of COVID-19\npatients.

          "description": "Despite the popularisation of machine learning models, more often than not,\nthey still operate as black boxes with no insight into what is happening inside\nthe model. There exist a few methods that allow to visualise and explain why a\nmodel has made a certain prediction. Those methods, however, allow\nvisualisation of the link between the input and output of the model without\npresenting how the model learns to represent the data used to train the model\nas whole. In this paper, a method that addresses that issue is proposed, with a\nfocus on visualising multi-dimensional time-series data. Experiments on a\nhigh-frequency stock market dataset show that the method provides fast and\ndiscernible visualisations. Large datasets can be visualised quickly and on one\nplot, which makes it easy for a user to compare the learned representations of\nthe data. The developed method successfully combines known techniques to\nprovide an insight into the inner workings of time-series classification\nmodels.",

We achieve this by employing a\ntwo-stage distant supervision approach that incorporates evidence into masked\nclaims when generating corrections.

          "description": "State abstraction has been an essential tool for dramatically improving the\nsample efficiency of reinforcement-learning algorithms. Indeed, by exposing and\naccentuating various types of latent structure within the environment,\ndifferent classes of state abstraction have enabled improved theoretical\nguarantees and empirical performance. When dealing with state abstractions that\ncapture structure in the value function, however, a standard assumption is that\nthe true abstraction has been supplied or unrealistically computed a priori,\nleaving open the question of how to efficiently uncover such latent structure\nwhile jointly seeking out optimal behavior. Taking inspiration from the bandit\nliterature, we propose that an agent seeking out latent task structure must\nexplicitly represent and maintain its uncertainty over that structure as part\nof its overall uncertainty about the environment. We introduce a practical\nalgorithm for doing this using two posterior distributions over state\nabstractions and abstract-state values. In empirically validating our approach,\nwe find that substantial performance gains lie in the multi-task setting where\ntasks share a common, low-dimensional representation.",

This paper reformulates HPO as a computer experiment and proposes a\nnovel sequential uniform design (SeqUD) strategy with three-fold advantages: a)\nthe hyperparameter space is adaptively explored with evenly spread design\npoints, without the need of expensive meta-modeling and acquisition\noptimization; b) the batch-by-batch design points are sequentially generated\nwith parallel processing support; c) a new augmented uniform design algorithm\nis developed for the efficient real-time generation of follow-up design points.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on both global optimization tasks and HPO\napplications. The numerical results show that the proposed SeqUD strategy\noutperforms benchmark HPO methods, and it can be therefore a promising and\ncompetitive alternative to existing AutoML tools.",

          "description": "Over recent years, deep learning has become the mainstream data-driven\napproach to solve many important real-world problems. In the successful network\narchitectures, shortcut connections are well established to take the outputs of\nearlier layers as additional inputs to later layers, which have produced\nexcellent results. Despite the extraordinary effectiveness of shortcuts, there\nremain important questions on the underlying mechanism and associated\nfunctionalities. For example, why are shortcuts powerful? Why shortcuts\ngeneralize well? To address these questions, we investigate the representation\nand generalization ability of a sparse shortcut topology. Specifically, we\nfirst demonstrate that this topology can empower a one-neuron-wide deep network\nto approximate any univariate continuous function. Then, we present a novel\nwidth-bounded universal approximator in contrast to depth-bounded universal\napproximators, and also extend the approximation result to a family of networks\nsuch that in the view of approximation ability, these networks are equally\ncompetent. Furthermore, we use the generalization bound theory to show that the\ninvestigated shortcut topology enjoys an excellent generalizability. Finally,\nwe corroborate our theoretical analyses with experiments on some well-known\nbenchmarks.",

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) has been proposed to allow collaborative training of\nmachine learning (ML) models among multiple parties where each party can keep\nits data private. In this paradigm, only model updates, such as model weights\nor gradients, are shared. Many existing approaches have focused on horizontal\nFL, where each party has the entire feature set and labels in the training data\nset. However, many real scenarios follow a vertically-partitioned FL setup,\nwhere a complete feature set is formed only when all the datasets from the\nparties are combined, and the labels are only available to a single party.\nPrivacy-preserving vertical FL is challenging because complete sets of labels\nand features are not owned by one entity. Existing approaches for vertical FL\nrequire multiple peer-to-peer communications among parties, leading to lengthy\ntraining times, and are restricted to (approximated) linear models and just two\nparties. To close this gap, we propose FedV, a framework for secure gradient\ncomputation in vertical settings for several widely used ML models such as\nlinear models, logistic regression, and support vector machines. FedV removes\nthe need for peer-to-peer communication among parties by using functional\nencryption schemes; this allows FedV to achieve faster training times. It also\nworks for larger and changing sets of parties. We empirically demonstrate the\napplicability for multiple types of ML models and show a reduction of 10%-70%\nof training time and 80% to 90% in data transfer with respect to the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

We show that\ntheoretical justifications for recent regularisation schemes trying to enforce\nsuch a constraint suffer from a crucial flaw -- the theoretical link between\nthe regularisation scheme used and bi-Lipschitzness is only valid under\nconditions which do not hold in practice, rendering existing theory of limited\nuse, despite the strong empirical performance of these models. We provide a\ntheoretical explanation for the effectiveness of these regularisation schemes\nusing a frequency analysis perspective, showing that under mild conditions\nthese schemes will enforce a lower Lipschitz bound on the low-frequency\nprojection of images. We then provide empirical evidence supporting our\ntheoretical claims, and perform further experiments which demonstrate that our\nbroader conclusions appear to hold when some of the mathematical assumptions of\nour proof are relaxed, corresponding to the setup used in prior work. In\naddition, we present a simple constructive algorithm to search for counter\nexamples to the distance preservation condition, and discuss possible\nimplications of our theory for future model design.",

Yet, it has not\nachieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level\nprediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery\nhow Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this\npaper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the\nstandard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a\nbroad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent\nOGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the\ngraph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a\ngraph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective\nstructural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured\ndata. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of\nGraphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural\ninformation of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the\nspecial cases of Graphormer.",

          "description": "Robust multi-agent trajectory prediction is essential for the safe control of\nrobots and vehicles that interact with humans. Many existing methods treat\nsocial and temporal information separately and therefore fall short of\nmodelling the joint future trajectories of all agents in a socially consistent\nway. To address this, we propose a new class of Latent Variable Sequential Set\nTransformers which autoregressively model multi-agent trajectories. We refer to\nthese architectures as \"AutoBots\". AutoBots model the contents of sets (e.g.\nrepresenting the properties of agents in a scene) over time and employ\nmulti-head self-attention blocks over these sequences of sets to encode the\nsociotemporal relationships between the different actors of a scene. This\nproduces either the trajectory of one ego-agent or a distribution over the\nfuture trajectories for all agents under consideration. Our approach works for\ngeneral sequences of sets and we provide illustrative experiments modelling the\nsequential structure of the multiple strokes that make up symbols in the\nOmniglot data. For the single-agent prediction case, we validate our model on\nthe NuScenes motion prediction task and achieve competitive results on the\nglobal leaderboard. In the multi-agent forecasting setting, we validate our\nmodel on TrajNet. We find that our method outperforms physical extrapolation\nand recurrent network baselines and generates scene-consistent trajectories.",

Besides, we prove the\nstatistical rate for the eigenspace of the underlying matrix, which is\ncomparable to the rate under the independently missing assumption.

          "description": "Domain adaptation on time series data is an important but challenging task.\nMost of the existing works in this area are based on the learning of the\ndomain-invariant representation of the data with the help of restrictions like\nMMD. However, such extraction of the domain-invariant representation is a\nnon-trivial task for time series data, due to the complex dependence among the\ntimestamps. In detail, in the fully dependent time series, a small change of\nthe time lags or the offsets may lead to difficulty in the domain invariant\nextraction. Fortunately, the stability of the causality inspired us to explore\nthe domain invariant structure of the data. To reduce the difficulty in the\ndiscovery of causal structure, we relax it to the sparse associative structure\nand propose a novel sparse associative structure alignment model for domain\nadaptation. First, we generate the segment set to exclude the obstacle of\noffsets. Second, the intra-variables and inter-variables sparse attention\nmechanisms are devised to extract associative structure time-series data with\nconsidering time lags. Finally, the associative structure alignment is used to\nguide the transfer of knowledge from the source domain to the target one.\nExperimental studies not only verify the good performance of our methods on\nthree real-world datasets but also provide some insightful discoveries on the\ntransferred knowledge.",

In fact, all\nexisting algorithms demand function-approximation assumptions stronger than\nrealizability, and the mounting negative evidence has led to a conjecture that\nsample-efficient learning is impossible in this setting (Chen and Jiang, 2019).\nOur algorithm, BVFT, breaks the hardness conjecture (albeit under a stronger\nnotion of exploratory data) via a tournament procedure that reduces the\nlearning problem to pairwise comparison, and solves the latter with the help of\na state-action partition constructed from the compared functions. We also\ndiscuss how BVFT can be applied to model selection among other extensions and\nopen problems.",

They also offer an\neffective solution in healthcare for bi-directional protection against\nair-borne diseases. Wearing and positioning the mask correctly is essential for\nits function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution\nfor face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and\npositioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such algorithms\ncan be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and\nother indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These application\nscenarios impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The\ninference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing\nsufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably\nlow latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain\non the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address\nthese challenges, we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for\ncorrect facial-mask wear and positioning. The classification task is\nimplemented on an embedded FPGA, performing high-throughput binary operations.\nClassification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling\nmulti-camera, speed-gate settings or statistics collection in crowd settings.\nWhen deployed on a single entrance or gate, the idle power consumption is\nreduced to 1.6W, improving the battery-life of the device. We achieve an\naccuracy of up to 98% for four wearing positions of the MaskedFace-Net dataset.\nTo maintain equivalent classification accuracy for all face structures,\nskin-tones, hair types, and mask types, the algorithms are tested for their\nability to generalize the relevant features over all subjects using the\nGrad-CAM approach.",

          "description": "Predicting all applicable labels for a given image is known as multi-label\nclassification. Compared to the standard multi-class case (where each image has\nonly one label), it is considerably more challenging to annotate training data\nfor multi-label classification. When the number of potential labels is large,\nhuman annotators find it difficult to mention all applicable labels for each\ntraining image. Furthermore, in some settings detection is intrinsically\ndifficult e.g. finding small object instances in high resolution images. As a\nresult, multi-label training data is often plagued by false negatives. We\nconsider the hardest version of this problem, where annotators provide only one\nrelevant label for each image. As a result, training sets will have only one\npositive label per image and no confirmed negatives. We explore this special\ncase of learning from missing labels across four different multi-label image\nclassification datasets for both linear classifiers and end-to-end fine-tuned\ndeep networks. We extend existing multi-label losses to this setting and\npropose novel variants that constrain the number of expected positive labels\nduring training.

          "description": "Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCNs) to edge-perturbing attacks, such as maliciously inserting or\ndeleting graph edges. However, a theoretical proof of such vulnerability\nremains a big challenge, and effective defense schemes are still open issues.\nIn this paper, we first generalize the formulation of edge-perturbing attacks\nand strictly prove the vulnerability of GCNs to such attacks in node\nclassification tasks. Following this, an anonymous graph convolutional network,\nnamed AN-GCN, is proposed to counter against edge-perturbing attacks.\nSpecifically, we present a node localization theorem to demonstrate how the GCN\nlocates nodes during its training phase. In addition, we design a staggered\nGaussian noise based node position generator, and devise a spectral graph\nconvolution based discriminator in detecting the generated node positions.\nFurther, we give the optimization of the above generator and discriminator.\nAN-GCN can classify nodes without taking their position as input. It is\ndemonstrated that the AN-GCN is secure against edge-perturbing attacks in node\nclassification tasks, as AN-GCN classifies nodes without the edge information\nand thus makes it impossible for attackers to perturb edges anymore. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of the general edge-perturbing\nattack model in manipulating the classification results of the target nodes.\nMore importantly, the proposed AN-GCN can achieve 82.7% in node classification\naccuracy without the edge-reading permission, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art GCN.",

This paper is about KD and\nS-T learning, which are being actively studied in recent years. First, we aim\nto provide explanations of what KD is and how/why it works.

          "description": "The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial attack, which\nis an attack that can mislead state-of-the-art classifiers into making an\nincorrect classification with high confidence by deliberately perturbing the\noriginal inputs, raises concerns about the robustness of DNNs to such attacks.\nAdversarial training, which is the main heuristic method for improving\nadversarial robustness and the first line of defense against adversarial\nattacks, requires many sample-by-sample calculations to increase training size\nand is usually insufficiently strong for an entire network. This paper provides\na new perspective on the issue of adversarial robustness, one that shifts the\nfocus from the network as a whole to the critical part of the region close to\nthe decision boundary corresponding to a given class. From this perspective, we\npropose a method to generate a single but image-agnostic adversarial\nperturbation that carries the semantic information implying the directions to\nthe fragile parts on the decision boundary and causes inputs to be\nmisclassified as a specified target. We call the adversarial training based on\nsuch perturbations \"region adversarial training\" (RAT), which resembles\nclassical adversarial training but is distinguished in that it reinforces the\nsemantic information missing in the relevant regions. Experimental results on\nthe MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that this approach greatly improves\nadversarial robustness even using a very small dataset from the training data;\nmoreover, it can defend against FGSM adversarial attacks that have a completely\ndifferent pattern from the model seen during retraining.",

          "description": "Recent works in self-supervised learning have advanced the state-of-the-art\nby relying on the contrastive learning paradigm, which learns representations\nby pushing positive pairs, or similar examples from the same class, closer\ntogether while keeping negative pairs far apart. Despite the empirical\nsuccesses, theoretical foundations are limited -- prior analyses assume\nconditional independence of the positive pairs given the same class label, but\nrecent empirical applications use heavily correlated positive pairs (i.e., data\naugmentations of the same image). Our work analyzes contrastive learning\nwithout assuming conditional independence of positive pairs using a novel\nconcept of the augmentation graph on data. Edges in this graph connect\naugmentations of the same data, and ground-truth classes naturally form\nconnected sub-graphs. We propose a loss that performs spectral decomposition on\nthe population augmentation graph and can be succinctly written as a\ncontrastive learning objective on neural net representations. Minimizing this\nobjective leads to features with provable accuracy guarantees under linear\nprobe evaluation. By standard generalization bounds, these accuracy guarantees\nalso hold when minimizing the training contrastive loss. Empirically, the\nfeatures learned by our objective can match or outperform several strong\nbaselines on benchmark vision datasets. In all, this work provides the first\nprovable analysis for contrastive learning where guarantees for linear probe\nevaluation can apply to realistic empirical settings.",

Training such an adaptive scorer efficiently is a challenging\nproblem; in order to precisely quantify the effect of a data instance at a\ngiven time during the training, it is typically necessary to first complete the\nentire training process. To efficiently optimize data usage, we propose a\nreinforcement learning approach called Differentiable Data Selection (DDS). In\nDDS, we formulate a scorer network as a learnable function of the training\ndata, which can be efficiently updated along with the main model being trained.\nSpecifically, DDS updates the scorer with an intuitive reward signal: it should\nup-weigh the data that has a similar gradient with a dev set upon which we\nwould finally like to perform well.

Cascade\nprediction aims to predict the individuals who will potentially repost the\nmessage on the social network.

However, they\ndecrease the convergence speed of training algorithms. Adaptive regularization\nschemes can solve overfitting more intelligently. They usually do not affect\nthe entire network weights. This paper detects a subset of the weighting layers\nthat cause overfitting. The overfitting recognizes by matrix and tensor\ncondition numbers. An adaptive regularization scheme entitled Adaptive Low-Rank\n(ALR) is proposed that converges a subset of the weighting layers to their\nLow-Rank Factorization (LRF). It happens by minimizing a new Tikhonov-based\nloss function. ALR also encourages lazy weights to contribute to the\nregularization when epochs grow up. It uses a damping sequence to increment\nlayer selection likelihood in the last generations. Thus before falling the\ntraining accuracy, ALR reduces the lazy weights and regularizes the network\nsubstantially. The experimental results show that ALR regularizes the deep\nnetworks well with high training speed and low resource usage.",

          "description": "Understanding the semantics of human movement -- the what, how and why of the\nmovement -- is an important problem that requires datasets of human actions\nwith semantic labels. Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale\nvideo datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D\nhuman motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body\nmotions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we\npresent BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions\nbeing performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about\n43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of\nabstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and\nframe labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame\nlabel is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the\nmocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence\nlabels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action\ncategories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action\nrecognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To\ndemonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of\nmodels on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting\nlearning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve\nas a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition. The dataset,\nbaseline method, and evaluation code is made available, and supported for\nacademic research purposes at https://babel.is.tue.mpg.de/.",

In this work, we address the question of how to determine whether a\nparametric model, such as a stochastic block model or latent space model, fits\na dataset well and will extrapolate to similar data. We use recent results in\nrandom matrix theory to derive a general goodness-of-fit test for dyadic data.\nWe show that our method, when applied to a specific model of interest, provides\nan straightforward, computationally fast way of selecting parameters in a\nnumber of commonly used network models. For example, we show how to select the\ndimension of the latent space in latent space models. Unlike other network\ngoodness-of-fit methods, our general approach does not require simulating from\na candidate parametric model, which can be cumbersome with large graphs, and\neliminates the need to choose a particular set of statistics on the graph for\ncomparison. It also allows us to perform goodness-of-fit tests on partial\nnetwork data, such as Aggregated Relational Data. We show with simulations that\nour method performs well in many situations of interest.

Different sources contribute complementary explanatory factors.\nSimilarly, research studies often collect multimodal imaging data, each of\nwhich can provide shared and unique information. This observation motivated the\ndesign of powerful multimodal self-supervised representation-learning\nalgorithms. In this paper, we unify recent work on multimodal self-supervised\nlearning under a single framework. Observing that most self-supervised methods\noptimize similarity metrics between a set of model components, we propose a\ntaxonomy of all reasonable ways to organize this process. We first evaluate\nmodels on toy multimodal MNIST datasets and then apply them to a multimodal\nneuroimaging dataset with Alzheimer's disease patients. We find that (1)\nmultimodal contrastive learning has significant benefits over its unimodal\ncounterpart, (2) the specific composition of multiple contrastive objectives is\ncritical to performance on a downstream task, (3) maximization of the\nsimilarity between representations has a regularizing effect on a neural\nnetwork, which can sometimes lead to reduced downstream performance but still\nreveal multimodal relations. Results show that the proposed approach\noutperforms previous self-supervised encoder-decoder methods based on canonical\ncorrelation analysis (CCA) or the mixture-of-experts multimodal variational\nautoEncoder (MMVAE) on various datasets with a linear evaluation protocol.\nImportantly, we find a promising solution to uncover connections between\nmodalities through a jointly shared subspace that can help advance work in our\nsearch for neuroimaging biomarkers.",

          "description": "Learning with noisy labels has attracted a lot of attention in recent years,\nwhere the mainstream approaches are in pointwise manners. Meanwhile, pairwise\nmanners have shown great potential in supervised metric learning and\nunsupervised contrastive learning. Thus, a natural question is raised: does\nlearning in a pairwise manner mitigate label noise? To give an affirmative\nanswer, in this paper, we propose a framework called Class2Simi: it transforms\ndata points with noisy class labels to data pairs with noisy similarity labels,\nwhere a similarity label denotes whether a pair shares the class label or not.\nThrough this transformation, the reduction of the noise rate is theoretically\nguaranteed, and hence it is in principle easier to handle noisy similarity\nlabels. Amazingly, DNNs that predict the clean class labels can be trained from\nnoisy data pairs if they are first pretrained from noisy data points.\nClass2Simi is computationally efficient because not only this transformation is\non-the-fly in mini-batches, but also it just changes loss computation on top of\nmodel prediction into a pairwise manner. Its effectiveness is verified by\nextensive experiments.",

However, images generated by various\nMRI scanners (e.g. GE Healthcare vs Siemens) differ both in intensity and noise\ndistribution, preventing algorithms trained on MRIs from one scanner to\ngeneralize to data from other scanners successfully. We propose a method for\nimage normalization to solve this problem. MRI normalization is challenging\nbecause it requires both normalizing intensity values and mapping between the\nnoise distributions of different scanners. We utilize a cycle-consistent\ngenerative adversarial network to learn a bidirectional mapping between MRIs\nproduced by GE Healthcare and Siemens scanners. This allows us learning the\nmapping between two different scanner types without matched data, which is not\ncommonly available. To ensure the preservation of breast shape and structures\nwithin the breast, we propose two technical innovations. First, we incorporate\na mutual information loss with the CycleGAN architecture to ensure that the\nstructure of the breast is maintained. Second, we propose a modified\ndiscriminator architecture which utilizes a smaller field-of-view to ensure the\npreservation of finer details in the breast tissue. Quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations show that the second proposed method was able to\nconsistently preserve a high level of detail in the breast structure while also\nperforming the proper intensity normalization and noise mapping. Our results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model can successfully learn a bidirectional\nmapping between MRIs produced by different vendors, potentially enabling\nimproved accuracy of downstream computational algorithms for diagnosis and\ndetection of breast cancer.

In this work, we\nstudy scientific LMs for KG completion, exploring whether we can tap into their\nlatent knowledge to enhance biomedical link prediction. We evaluate several\ndomain-specific LMs, fine-tuning them on datasets centered on drugs and\ndiseases that we represent as KGs and enrich with textual entity descriptions.\nWe integrate the LM-based models with KG embedding models, using a router\nmethod that learns to assign each input example to either type of model and\nprovides a substantial boost in performance. Finally, we demonstrate the\nadvantage of LM models in the inductive setting with novel scientific entities.\nOur datasets and code are made publicly available.",

          "description": "Following their success in natural language processing, transformers have\nrecently shown much promise for computer vision. The self-attention operation\nunderlying transformers yields global interactions between all tokens ,i.e.\nwords or image patches, and enables flexible modelling of image data beyond the\nlocal interactions of convolutions. This flexibility, however, comes with a\nquadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering application to long\nsequences and high-resolution images. We propose a \"transposed\" version of\nself-attention that operates across feature channels rather than tokens, where\nthe interactions are based on the cross-covariance matrix between keys and\nqueries. The resulting cross-covariance attention (XCA) has linear complexity\nin the number of tokens, and allows efficient processing of high-resolution\nimages. Our cross-covariance image transformer (XCiT) is built upon XCA. It\ncombines the accuracy of conventional transformers with the scalability of\nconvolutional architectures. We validate the effectiveness and generality of\nXCiT by reporting excellent results on multiple vision benchmarks, including\nimage classification and self-supervised feature learning on ImageNet-1k,\nobject detection and instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation\non ADE20k.",

In this work, we\nadopt a perspective based on the role of individual examples.

Our extensive investigation reveals\nsurprising yet simple relationships between the prediction depth of a given\ninput and the model's uncertainty, confidence, accuracy and speed of learning\nfor that data point. We further categorize difficult examples into three\ninterpretable groups, demonstrate how these groups are processed differently\ninside deep models and showcase how this understanding allows us to improve\nprediction accuracy. Insights from our study lead to a coherent view of a\nnumber of separately reported phenomena in the literature: early layers\ngeneralize while later layers memorize; early layers converge faster and\nnetworks learn easy data and simple functions first.",

However, we pay a price for the savings: lower precision\nmay yield larger round-off error and hence larger prediction error. As\napplications proliferate, users must choose which precision to use to train a\nnew model, and chip manufacturers must decide which precisions to manufacture.\nWe view these precision choices as a hyperparameter tuning problem, and borrow\nideas from meta-learning to learn the tradeoff between memory and error.

We use matrix factorization to find non-dominated configurations (the\nPareto frontier) with a limited number of network evaluations.

          "description": "The dominant paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale\npre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or\ndomains. As we pre-train larger models, conventional fine-tuning, which\nretrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an\nexample, deploying many independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with\n175B parameters, is extremely expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or\nLoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank\ndecomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly\nreducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. For GPT-3,\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\ncomputation hardware requirement by 3 times compared to full fine-tuning. LoRA\nperforms on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on both GPT-3 and\nGPT-2, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput,\nand no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation\ninto rank-deficiency in language model adaptations, which sheds light on the\nefficacy of LoRA.

Yet, its passive nature inevitably prevents it from being\nimmune to unknown attackers. To achieve a proactive defense, we need a more\nfundamental understanding of adversarial examples, beyond the popular bounded\nthreat model. In this paper, we provide a causal viewpoint of adversarial\nvulnerability: the cause is the confounder ubiquitously existing in learning,\nwhere attackers are precisely exploiting the confounding effect. Therefore, a\nfundamental solution for adversarial robustness is causal intervention. As the\nconfounder is unobserved in general, we propose to use the instrumental\nvariable that achieves intervention without the need for confounder\nobservation. We term our robust training method as Causal intervention by\ninstrumental Variable (CiiV). It has a differentiable retinotopic sampling\nlayer and a consistency loss, which is stable and guaranteed not to suffer from\ngradient obfuscation.

          "description": "Reasoning about the behaviour of physical objects is a key capability of\nagents operating in physical worlds. Humans are very experienced in physical\nreasoning while it remains a major challenge for AI. To facilitate research\naddressing this problem, several benchmarks have been proposed recently.\nHowever, these benchmarks do not enable us to measure an agent's granular\nphysical reasoning capabilities when solving a complex reasoning task. In this\npaper, we propose a new benchmark for physical reasoning that allows us to test\nindividual physical reasoning capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire\nthese capabilities, we propose a general hierarchy of physical reasoning\ncapabilities with increasing complexity. Our benchmark tests capabilities\naccording to this hierarchy through generated physical reasoning tasks in the\nvideo game Angry Birds. This benchmark enables us to conduct a comprehensive\nagent evaluation by measuring the agent's granular physical reasoning\ncapabilities. We conduct an evaluation with human players, learning agents, and\nheuristic agents and determine their capabilities. Our evaluation shows that\nlearning agents, with good local generalization ability, still struggle to\nlearn the underlying physical reasoning capabilities and perform worse than\ncurrent state-of-the-art heuristic agents and humans.

          "description": "World models improve a learning agent's ability to efficiently operate in\ninteractive and situated environments. This work focuses on the task of\nbuilding world models of text-based game environments. Text-based games, or\ninteractive narratives, are reinforcement learning environments in which agents\nperceive and interact with the world using textual natural language. These\nenvironments contain long, multi-step puzzles or quests woven through a world\nthat is filled with hundreds of characters, locations, and objects. Our world\nmodel learns to simultaneously: (1) predict changes in the world caused by an\nagent's actions when representing the world as a knowledge graph; and (2)\ngenerate the set of contextually relevant natural language actions required to\noperate in the world. We frame this task as a Set of Sequences generation\nproblem by exploiting the inherent structure of knowledge graphs and actions\nand introduce both a transformer-based multi-task architecture and a loss\nfunction to train it. A zero-shot ablation study on never-before-seen textual\nworlds shows that our methodology significantly outperforms existing textual\nworld modeling techniques as well as the importance of each of our\ncontributions.",

          "description": "Classical machine learning frameworks assume access to a possibly large\ndataset in order to train a predictive model. In many practical applications\nhowever, data does not arrive all at once, but in batches over time. This\ncreates a natural trade-off between accuracy of a model and time to obtain such\na model. A greedy predictor could produce non-trivial predictions by\nimmediately training on batches as soon as these become available but, it may\nalso make sub-optimal use of future data. On the other hand, a tardy predictor\ncould wait for a long time to aggregate several batches into a larger dataset,\nbut ultimately deliver a much better performance. In this work, we consider\nsuch a streaming learning setting, which we dub {\\em anytime learning at\nmacroscale} (ALMA). It is an instance of anytime learning applied not at the\nlevel of a single chunk of data, but at the level of the entire sequence of\nlarge batches. We first formalize this learning setting, we then introduce\nmetrics to assess how well learners perform on the given task for a given\nmemory and compute budget, and finally we test several baseline approaches on\nstandard benchmarks repurposed for anytime learning at macroscale. The general\nfinding is that bigger models always generalize better. In particular, it is\nimportant to grow model capacity over time if the initial model is relatively\nsmall. Moreover, updating the model at an intermediate rate strikes the best\ntrade off between accuracy and time to obtain a useful predictor.",

          "description": "Federated learning is a distributed learning paradigm where multiple agents,\neach only with access to local data, jointly learn a global model. There has\nrecently been an explosion of research aiming not only to improve the accuracy\nrates of federated learning, but also provide certain guarantees around social\ngood properties such as total error. One branch of this research has taken a\ngame-theoretic approach, and in particular, prior work has viewed federated\nlearning as a hedonic game, where error-minimizing players arrange themselves\ninto federating coalitions. This past work proves the existence of stable\ncoalition partitions, but leaves open a wide range of questions, including how\nfar from optimal these stable solutions are. In this work, we motivate and\ndefine a notion of optimality given by the average error rates among federating\nagents (players). First, we provide and prove the correctness of an efficient\nalgorithm to calculate an optimal (error minimizing) arrangement of players.\nNext, we analyze the relationship between the stability and optimality of an\narrangement. First, we show that for some regions of parameter space, all\nstable arrangements are optimal (Price of Anarchy equal to 1). However, we show\nthis is not true for all settings: there exist examples of stable arrangements\nwith higher cost than optimal (Price of Anarchy greater than 1). Finally, we\ngive the first constant-factor bound on the performance gap between stability\nand optimality, proving that the total error of the worst stable solution can\nbe no higher than 9 times the total error of an optimal solution (Price of\nAnarchy bound of 9).",

Information theoretically, one can\nachieve strong error bounds with $O(k \\log n)$ samples for arbitrary $\\Sigma$\nand $w^*$; however, no efficient algorithms are known to match these guarantees\neven with $o(n)$ samples, without further assumptions on $\\Sigma$ or $w^*$. As\nfar as hardness, computational lower bounds are only known with worst-case\ndesign matrices. Random-design instances are known which are hard for the\nLasso, but these instances can generally be solved by Lasso after a simple\nchange-of-basis (i.e. preconditioning).\n\nIn this work, we give upper and lower bounds clarifying the power of\npreconditioning in sparse linear regression. First, we show that the\npreconditioned Lasso can solve a large class of sparse linear regression\nproblems nearly optimally: it succeeds whenever the dependency structure of the\ncovariates, in the sense of the Markov property, has low treewidth -- even if\n$\\Sigma$ is highly ill-conditioned. Second, we construct (for the first time)\nrandom-design instances which are provably hard for an optimally preconditioned\nLasso. In fact, we complete our treewidth classification by proving that for\nany treewidth-$t$ graph, there exists a Gaussian Markov Random Field on this\ngraph such that the preconditioned Lasso, with any choice of preconditioner,\nrequires $\\Omega(t^{1/20})$ samples to recover $O(\\log n)$-sparse signals when\ncovariates are drawn from this model.",

          "description": "The expanding usage of complex machine learning methods like deep learning\nhas led to an explosion in human activity recognition, particularly applied to\nhealth. In particular, as part of a larger body sensor network system, face and\nfull-body analysis is becoming increasingly common for evaluating health\nstatus. However, complex models which handle private and sometimes protected\ndata, raise concerns about the potential leak of identifiable data. In this\nwork, we focus on the case of a deep network model trained on images of\nindividual faces. Full-face video recordings taken from 493 individuals\nundergoing an eye-tracking based evaluation of neurological function were used.\nOutputs, gradients, intermediate layer outputs, loss, and labels were used as\ninputs for a deep network with an added support vector machine emission layer\nto recognize membership in the training data. The inference attack method and\nassociated mathematical analysis indicate that there is a low likelihood of\nunintended memorization of facial features in the deep learning model. In this\nstudy, it is showed that the named model preserves the integrity of training\ndata with reasonable confidence. The same process can be implemented in similar\nconditions for different models.",

          "description": "Graph-level representations are critical in various real-world applications,\nsuch as predicting the properties of molecules. But in practice, precise graph\nannotations are generally very expensive and time-consuming. To address this\nissue, graph contrastive learning constructs instance discrimination task which\npulls together positive pairs (augmentation pairs of the same graph) and pushes\naway negative pairs (augmentation pairs of different graphs) for unsupervised\nrepresentation learning. However, since for a query, its negatives are\nuniformly sampled from all graphs, existing methods suffer from the critical\nsampling bias issue, i.e., the negatives likely having the same semantic\nstructure with the query, leading to performance degradation. To mitigate this\nsampling bias issue, in this paper, we propose a Prototypical Graph Contrastive\nLearning (PGCL) approach. Specifically, PGCL models the underlying semantic\nstructure of the graph data via clustering semantically similar graphs into the\nsame group, and simultaneously encourages the clustering consistency for\ndifferent augmentations of the same graph. Then given a query, it performs\nnegative sampling via drawing the graphs from those clusters that differ from\nthe cluster of query, which ensures the semantic difference between query and\nits negative samples. Moreover, for a query, PGCL further reweights its\nnegative samples based on the distance between their prototypes (cluster\ncentroids) and the query prototype such that those negatives having moderate\nprototype distance enjoy relatively large weights. This reweighting strategy is\nproved to be more effective than uniform sampling. Experimental results on\nvarious graph benchmarks testify the advantages of our PGCL over\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

Recently,\npre-trained transformer-based language models (PTLMs) on large unlabeled corpus\nhave produced state-of-the-art results in many downstream natural language\nprocessing tasks. Inspired by this development, here we present molecular\nembeddings obtained by training an efficient transformer encoder model,\nreferred to as MoLFormer. This model was employed with a linear attention\nmechanism and highly paralleized training on 1D SMILES sequences of 1.1 billion\nunlabeled molecules from the PubChem and ZINC datasets. Experiments show that\nthe learned molecular representation performs competitively, when compared to\nexisting graph-based and fingerprint-based supervised learning baselines, on\nthe challenging tasks of predicting properties of QM8 and QM9 molecules.\nFurther task-specific fine-tuning of the MoLFormerr representation improves\nperformance on several of those property prediction benchmarks.

In machine learning,\nsignificant improvements are usually achieved at the price of an increasing\ncomputational complexity and thanks to bigger datasets.

Their\ncomplexity is to such an extent that these models are commonly seen as\nblack-boxes providing a prediction or a decision which can not be interpreted\nor justified. Nevertheless, whether these models are used autonomously or as a\nsimple decision-making support tool, they are already being used in machine\nlearning applications where health and human life are at stake. Therefore, it\nappears to be an obvious necessity not to blindly believe everything coming out\nof those models without a detailed understanding of their predictions or\ndecisions. Accordingly, this thesis aims at improving the interpretability of\nmodels built by a specific family of machine learning algorithms, the so-called\ntree-based methods.

Here, we provide a comprehensive\nreview and systematic comparison of eight statistical and machine learning\nmethods for probabilistic wind gust forecasting via ensemble postprocessing,\nthat can be divided in three groups: State of the art postprocessing techniques\nfrom statistics (ensemble model output statistics (EMOS), member-by-member\npostprocessing, isotonic distributional regression), established machine\nlearning methods (gradient-boosting extended EMOS, quantile regression forests)\nand neural network-based approaches (distributional regression network,\nBernstein quantile network, histogram estimation network). The methods are\nsystematically compared using six years of data from a high-resolution,\nconvection-permitting ensemble prediction system that was run operationally at\nthe German weather service, and hourly observations at 175 surface weather\nstations in Germany. While all postprocessing methods yield calibrated\nforecasts and are able to correct the systematic errors of the raw ensemble\npredictions, incorporating information from additional meteorological predictor\nvariables beyond wind gusts leads to significant improvements in forecast\nskill. In particular, we propose a flexible framework of locally adaptive\nneural networks with different probabilistic forecast types as output, which\nnot only significantly outperform all benchmark postprocessing methods but also\nlearn physically consistent relations associated with the diurnal cycle,\nespecially the evening transition of the planetary boundary layer.",

          "description": "In this paper, we present SANTA, a scalable framework to automatically\nnormalize E-commerce attribute values (e.g. \"Win 10 Pro\") to a fixed set of\npre-defined canonical values (e.g. \"Windows 10\"). Earlier works on attribute\nnormalization focused on fuzzy string matching (also referred as syntactic\nmatching in this paper). In this work, we first perform an extensive study of\nnine syntactic matching algorithms and establish that 'cosine' similarity leads\nto best results, showing 2.7% improvement over commonly used Jaccard index.\nNext, we argue that string similarity alone is not sufficient for attribute\nnormalization as many surface forms require going beyond syntactic matching\n(e.g. \"720p\" and \"HD\" are synonyms). While semantic techniques like\nunsupervised embeddings (e.g. word2vec/fastText) have shown good results in\nword similarity tasks, we observed that they perform poorly to distinguish\nbetween close canonical forms, as these close forms often occur in similar\ncontexts. We propose to learn token embeddings using a twin network with\ntriplet loss. We propose an embedding learning task leveraging raw attribute\nvalues and product titles to learn these embeddings in a self-supervised\nfashion. We show that providing supervision using our proposed task improves\nover both syntactic and unsupervised embeddings based techniques for attribute\nnormalization. Experiments on a real-world attribute normalization dataset of\n50 attributes show that the embeddings trained using our proposed approach\nobtain 2.3% improvement over best string matching and 19.3% improvement over\nbest unsupervised embeddings.",

Recent work has\nshown that autoregressive generative models with cross-entropy objective\nfunctions exhibit smooth power-law relationships, or scaling laws, that predict\nmodel quality from model size, training set size, and the available compute\nbudget. These scaling laws allow one to choose nearly optimal hyper-parameters\ngiven constraints on available training data, model parameter count, or\ntraining computation budget. In this paper, we demonstrate that acoustic models\ntrained with an auto-predictive coding loss behave as if they are subject to\nsimilar scaling laws. We extend previous work to jointly predict loss due to\nmodel size, to training set size, and to the inherent \"irreducible loss\" of the\ntask.

However,\nthese advantages come with extra coding cost/complexity and communication\noverhead (referred to as \\emph{privacy cost}) that must be considered given the\nlimited computing/communications resources at MUs/MAP, the rationality and\nincentive competition among MUs in contributing data to the MAP. This article\nproposes a novel coded FL-based framework for a privacy-aware mobile\napplication service to address these challenges.

Then, each selected MU can propose a contract to the MAP\naccording to its expected trainable local data and privacy-protected coded\ndata. To find the optimal contracts that can maximize utilities of the MAP and\nall the participating MUs while maintaining high learning quality of the whole\nsystem, we first develop a multi-principal one-agent contract-based problem\nleveraging coded FL-based multiple utility functions under the MUs' privacy\ncost, the MAP's limited computing resource, and asymmetric information between\nthe MAP and MUs. Then, we transform the problem into an equivalent\nlow-complexity problem and develop an iterative algorithm to solve it.\nExperiments with a real-world dataset show that our framework can speed up\ntraining time up to 49% and improve prediction accuracy up to 4.6 times while\nenhancing network's social welfare, i.e., total utility of all participating\nentities, up to 114% under the privacy cost consideration compared with those\nof baseline methods.",

          "description": "Attributed network embedding (ANE) is to learn low-dimensional vectors so\nthat not only the network structure but also node attributes can be preserved\nin the embedding space. Existing ANE models do not consider the specific\ncombination between graph structure and attributes. While each node has its\nstructural characteristics, such as highly-interconnected neighbors along with\ntheir certain patterns of attribute distribution, each node's neighborhood\nshould be not only depicted by multi-hop nodes, but consider certain clusters\nor social circles. To model such information, in this paper, we propose a novel\nANE model, Context Co-occurrence-aware Attributed Network Embedding (CoANE).\nThe basic idea of CoANE is to model the context attributes that each node's\ninvolved diverse patterns, and apply the convolutional mechanism to encode\npositional information by treating each attribute as a channel. The learning of\ncontext co-occurrence can capture the latent social circles of each node. To\nbetter encode structural and semantic knowledge of nodes, we devise a three-way\nobjective function, consisting of positive graph likelihood, contextual\nnegative sampling, and attribute reconstruction. We conduct experiments on five\nreal datasets in the tasks of link prediction, node label classification, and\nnode clustering. The results exhibit that CoANE can significantly outperform\nstate-of-the-art ANE models.",

Furthermore, we develop various graph neural network (GNN) models that\nproject electrodes onto the nodes of a graph, where the node features are\nrepresented as EEG channel samples collected over a trial, and nodes can be\nconnected by weighted/unweighted edges according to a flexible policy\nformulated by a neuroscientist.

Another practical advantage of our GNN-based framework is that it can\nbe used in EEG channel selection, which is critical for reducing computational\ncost, and designing portable EEG headsets.",

          "description": "Recent works demonstrated the promise of using resistive random access memory\n(ReRAM) as an emerging technology to perform inherently parallel analog domain\nin-situ matrix-vector multiplication -- the intensive and key computation in\nDNNs. With weights stored in the ReRAM crossbar cells as conductance, when the\ninput vector is applied to word lines, the matrix-vector multiplication results\ncan be generated as the current in bit lines. A key problem is that the weight\ncan be either positive or negative, but the in-situ computation assumes all\ncells on each crossbar column with the same sign. The current architectures\neither use two ReRAM crossbars for positive and negative weights, or add an\noffset to weights so that all values become positive. Neither solution is\nideal: they either double the cost of crossbars, or incur extra offset\ncircuity. To better solve this problem, this paper proposes FORMS, a\nfine-grained ReRAM-based DNN accelerator with polarized weights. Instead of\ntrying to represent the positive/negative weights, our key design principle is\nto enforce exactly what is assumed in the in-situ computation -- ensuring that\nall weights in the same column of a crossbar have the same sign. It naturally\navoids the cost of an additional crossbar. Such weights can be nicely generated\nusing alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) regularized\noptimization, which can exactly enforce certain patterns in DNN weights. To\nachieve high accuracy, we propose to use fine-grained sub-array columns, which\nprovide a unique opportunity for input zero-skipping, significantly avoiding\nunnecessary computations. It also makes the hardware much easier to implement.\nPutting all together, with the same optimized models, FORMS achieves\nsignificant throughput improvement and speed up in frame per second over ISAAC\nwith similar area cost.",

          "description": "Learning to classify time series with limited data is a practical yet\nchallenging problem. Current methods are primarily based on hand-designed\nfeature extraction rules or domain-specific data augmentation. Motivated by the\nadvances in deep speech processing models and the fact that voice data are\nunivariate temporal signals, in this paper, we propose Voice2Series (V2S), a\nnovel end-to-end approach that reprograms acoustic models for time series\nclassification, through input transformation learning and output label mapping.\nLeveraging the representation learning power of a large-scale pre-trained\nspeech processing model, on 30 different time series tasks we show that V2S\neither outperforms or is tied with state-of-the-art methods on 20 tasks, and\nimproves their average accuracy by 1.84%. We further provide a theoretical\njustification of V2S by proving its population risk is upper bounded by the\nsource risk and a Wasserstein distance accounting for feature alignment via\nreprogramming. Our results offer new and effective means to time series\nclassification.",

          "description": "Pruning the weights of randomly initialized neural networks plays an\nimportant role in the context of lottery ticket hypothesis. Ramanujan et al.\n(2020) empirically showed that only pruning the weights can achieve remarkable\nperformance instead of optimizing the weight values. However, to achieve the\nsame level of performance as the weight optimization, the pruning approach\nrequires more parameters in the networks before pruning and thus more memory\nspace. To overcome this parameter inefficiency, we introduce a novel framework\nto prune randomly initialized neural networks with iteratively randomizing\nweight values (IteRand). Theoretically, we prove an approximation theorem in\nour framework, which indicates that the randomizing operations are provably\neffective to reduce the required number of the parameters. We also empirically\ndemonstrate the parameter efficiency in multiple experiments on CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet.",

          "description": "We revisit the question of predicting both Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}$ and\n$h^{2,1}$ of complete intersection Calabi-Yau (CICY) 3-folds using machine\nlearning (ML), considering both the old and new datasets built respectively by\nCandelas-Dale-Lutken-Schimmrigk / Green-H\\\"ubsch-Lutken and by\nAnderson-Gao-Gray-Lee. In real world applications, implementing a ML system\nrarely reduces to feed the brute data to the algorithm. Instead, the typical\nworkflow starts with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) which aims at\nunderstanding better the input data and finding an optimal representation. It\nis followed by the design of a validation procedure and a baseline model.\nFinally, several ML models are compared and combined, often involving neural\nnetworks with a topology more complicated than the sequential models typically\nused in physics. By following this procedure, we improve the accuracy of ML\ncomputations for Hodge numbers with respect to the existing literature. First,\nwe obtain 97% (resp. 99%) accuracy for $h^{1,1}$ using a neural network\ninspired by the Inception model for the old dataset, using only 30% (resp. 70%)\nof the data for training. For the new one, a simple linear regression leads to\nalmost 100% accuracy with 30% of the data for training. The computation of\n$h^{2,1}$ is less successful as we manage to reach only 50% accuracy for both\ndatasets, but this is still better than the 16% obtained with a simple neural\nnetwork (SVM with Gaussian kernel and feature engineering and sequential\nconvolutional network reach at best 36%).

          "description": "Multivariable time series classification problems are increasing in\nprevalence and complexity in a variety of domains, such as biology and finance.\nWhile deep learning methods are an effective tool for these problems, they\noften lack interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel modular prototype\nlearning framework for multivariable time series classification. In the first\nstage of our framework, encoders extract features from each variable\nindependently. Prototype layers identify single-variable prototypes in the\nresulting feature spaces. The next stage of our framework represents the\nmultivariable time series sample points in terms of their similarity to these\nsingle-variable prototypes. This results in an inherently interpretable\nrepresentation of multivariable patterns, on which prototype learning is\napplied to extract representative examples i.e. multivariable prototypes. Our\nframework is thus able to explicitly identify both informative patterns in the\nindividual variables, as well as the relationships between the variables. We\nvalidate our framework on a simulated dataset with embedded patterns, as well\nas a real human activity recognition problem. Our framework attains comparable\nor superior classification performance to existing time series classification\nmethods on these tasks.

          "description": "Graphs are versatile tools for representing structured data. As a result, a\nvariety of machine learning methods have been studied for graph data analysis.\nAlthough many such learning methods depend on the measurement of differences\nbetween input graphs, defining an appropriate distance metric for graphs\nremains a controversial issue. Hence, we propose a supervised distance metric\nlearning method for the graph classification problem. Our method, named\ninterpretable graph metric learning (IGML), learns discriminative metrics in a\nsubgraph-based feature space, which has a strong graph representation\ncapability. By introducing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weight of each\nsubgraph, IGML can identify a small number of important subgraphs that can\nprovide insight into the given classification task. Because our formulation has\na large number of optimization variables, an efficient algorithm that uses\npruning techniques based on safe screening and working set selection methods is\nalso proposed. An important property of IGML is that solution optimality is\nguaranteed because the problem is formulated as a convex problem and our\npruning strategies only discard unnecessary subgraphs. Furthermore, we show\nthat IGML is also applicable to other structured data such as itemset and\nsequence data, and that it can incorporate vertex-label similarity by using a\ntransportation-based subgraph feature. We empirically evaluate the\ncomputational efficiency and classification performance of IGML on several\nbenchmark datasets and provide some illustrative examples of how IGML\nidentifies important subgraphs from a given graph dataset.",

We support our claims\nthrough rigorous empirical evaluations of many state of the art calibration\napproaches on standard datasets. We find that many calibration approaches with\nthe likes of label smoothing, mixup etc. lower the utility of a DNN by\ndegrading its refinement. Even under natural data shift, this\ncalibration-refinement trade-off holds for the majority of calibration methods.\nThese findings call for an urgent retrospective into some popular pathways\ntaken for modern DNN calibration.",

This can be a barrier to model uptake in\nimportant domains such as biomedicine. There has been recent work on general\ninterpretable representation learning (Onoe and Durrett, 2020), but these\ndomain-agnostic representations do not readily transfer to the important domain\nof biomedicine. In this paper, we create a new entity type system and training\nset from a large corpus of biomedical texts by mapping entities to concepts in\na medical ontology, and from these to Wikipedia pages whose categories are our\ntypes. From this mapping we derive Biomedical Interpretable Entity\nRepresentations(BIERs), in which dimensions correspond to fine-grained entity\ntypes, and values are predicted probabilities that a given entity is of the\ncorresponding type. We propose a novel method that exploits BIER's final sparse\nand intermediate dense representations to facilitate model and entity type\ndebugging. We show that BIERs achieve strong performance in biomedical tasks\nincluding named entity disambiguation and entity label classification, and we\nprovide error analysis to highlight the utility of their interpretability,\nparticularly in low-supervision settings.

          "description": "Path representations are critical in a variety of transportation\napplications, such as estimating path ranking in path recommendation systems\nand estimating path travel time in navigation systems. Existing studies often\nlearn task-specific path representations in a supervised manner, which require\na large amount of labeled training data and generalize poorly to other tasks.\nWe propose an unsupervised learning framework Path InfoMax (PIM) to learn\ngeneric path representations that work for different downstream tasks. We first\npropose a curriculum negative sampling method, for each input path, to generate\na small amount of negative paths, by following the principles of curriculum\nlearning. Next, \\emph{PIM} employs mutual information maximization to learn\npath representations from both a global and a local view. In the global view,\nPIM distinguishes the representations of the input paths from those of the\nnegative paths. In the local view, \\emph{PIM} distinguishes the input path\nrepresentations from the representations of the nodes that appear only in the\nnegative paths. This enables the learned path representations to encode both\nglobal and local information at different scales. Extensive experiments on two\ndownstream tasks, ranking score estimation and travel time estimation, using\ntwo road network datasets suggest that PIM significantly outperforms other\nunsupervised methods and is also able to be used as a pre-training method to\nenhance supervised path representation learning.",

          "description": "We give a novel, unified derivation of conditional PAC-Bayesian and mutual\ninformation (MI) generalization bounds. We derive conditional MI bounds as an\ninstance, with special choice of prior, of conditional MAC-Bayesian (Mean\nApproximately Correct) bounds, itself derived from conditional PAC-Bayesian\nbounds, where `conditional' means that one can use priors conditioned on a\njoint training and ghost sample. This allows us to get nontrivial PAC-Bayes and\nMI-style bounds for general VC classes, something recently shown to be\nimpossible with standard PAC-Bayesian/MI bounds. Second, it allows us to get\nfaster rates of order $O \\left(({\\text{KL}}/n)^{\\gamma}\\right)$ for $\\gamma >\n1/2$ if a Bernstein condition holds and for exp-concave losses (with\n$\\gamma=1$), which is impossible with both standard PAC-Bayes generalization\nand MI bounds.

Nevertheless, this common practice is\nsuboptimal and can incur an unnecessary use of resources. It is more\ncost-efficient to instead leverage the low-fidelity tuning observations to\nmeasure inter-task similarity and transfer knowledge from existing to new tasks\naccordingly.

          "description": "This work presents a fully data-driven, black-box pipeline to obtain an\noptimal control policy for a multi-loop building control problem based on\nhistorical building and weather data, thus without the need for complex\nphysics-based modelling. We demonstrate the method for joint control of room\ntemperature and bidirectional EV charging to maximize the occupant thermal\ncomfort and energy savings while leaving enough energy in the EV battery for\nthe next trip. We modelled the room temperature with a recurrent neural network\nand EV charging with a piece-wise linear function. Using these models as a\nsimulation environment, we applied a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nalgorithm to obtain an optimal control policy. The learnt policy achieves on\naverage 17% energy savings over the heating season and 19% better comfort\nsatisfaction than a standard RB room temperature controller. When a\nbidirectional EV is additionally connected and a two-tariff electricity pricing\nis applied, the MIMO DRL policy successfully leverages the battery and\ndecreases the overall cost of electricity compared to two standard RB\ncontrollers, one controlling the room temperature and another controlling the\nbidirectional EV (dis-)charging. Finally, we demonstrate a successful transfer\nof the learnt DRL policy from simulation onto a real building, the DFAB HOUSE\nat Empa Duebendorf in Switzerland, achieving up to 30% energy savings while\nmaintaining similar comfort levels compared to a conventional RB room\ntemperature controller over three weeks during the heating season.",

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) has been recognized as a viable distributed learning\nparadigm which trains a machine learning model collaboratively with massive\nmobile devices in the wireless edge while protecting user privacy. Although\nvarious communication schemes have been proposed to expedite the FL process,\nmost of them have assumed ideal wireless channels which provide reliable and\nlossless communication links between the server and mobile clients.\nUnfortunately, in practical systems with limited radio resources such as\nconstraint on the training latency and constraints on the transmission power\nand bandwidth, transmission of a large number of model parameters inevitably\nsuffers from quantization errors (QE) and transmission outage (TO). In this\npaper, we consider such non-ideal wireless channels, and carry out the first\nanalysis showing that the FL convergence can be severely jeopardized by TO and\nQE, but intriguingly can be alleviated if the clients have uniform outage\nprobabilities. These insightful results motivate us to propose a robust FL\nscheme, named FedTOE, which performs joint allocation of wireless resources and\nquantization bits across the clients to minimize the QE while making the\nclients have the same TO probability. Extensive experimental results are\npresented to show the superior performance of FedTOE for a deep learning-based\nclassification task with transmission latency constraints.",

          "description": "Prediction of survival in patients diagnosed with a brain tumour is\nchallenging because of heterogeneous tumour behaviours and responses to\ntreatment. Better estimations of prognosis would support treatment planning and\npatient support. Advances in machine learning have informed development of\nclinical predictive models, but their integration into clinical practice is\nalmost non-existent. One reasons for this is the lack of interpretability of\nmodels. In this paper, we use a novel brain tumour dataset to compare two\ninterpretable rule list models against popular machine learning approaches for\nbrain tumour survival prediction. All models are quantitatively evaluated using\nstandard performance metrics. The rule lists are also qualitatively assessed\nfor their interpretability and clinical utility. The interpretability of the\nblack box machine learning models is evaluated using two post-hoc explanation\ntechniques, LIME and SHAP. Our results show that the rule lists were only\nslightly outperformed by the black box models. We demonstrate that rule list\nalgorithms produced simple decision lists that align with clinical expertise.\nBy comparison, post-hoc interpretability methods applied to black box models\nmay produce unreliable explanations of local model predictions. Model\ninterpretability is essential for understanding differences in predictive\nperformance and for integration into clinical practice.",

Unfortunately, these approaches still require centrally\ncollected unpaired records, potentially violating privacy and security issues.\nAlthough the recent federated learning (FL) allows a neural network to be\ntrained without data exchange, the basic assumption of the FL is that all\nclients have their own training data from a similar domain, which is different\nfrom our image-to-image translation scenario in which each client has images\nfrom its unique domain and the goal is to learn image translation between\ndifferent domains without accessing the target domain data. To address this,\nhere we propose a novel federated CycleGAN architecture that can learn image\ntranslation in an unsupervised manner while maintaining the data privacy.\nSpecifically, our approach arises from a novel observation that CycleGAN loss\ncan be decomposed into the sum of client specific local objectives that can be\nevaluated using only their data. This local objective decomposition allows\nmultiple clients to participate in federated CycleGAN training without\nsacrificing performance. Furthermore, our method employs novel switchable\ngenerator and discriminator architecture using Adaptive Instance Normalization\n(AdaIN) that significantly reduces the band-width requirement of the federated\nlearning.

We propose a Multi-hop Heterogeneous\nNeighborhood information Fusion graph representation learning method (MHNF).\nSpecifically, we first propose a hybrid metapath autonomous extraction model to\nefficiently extract multi-hop hybrid neighbors. Then, we propose a hop-level\nheterogeneous Information aggregation model, which selectively aggregates\ndifferent-hop neighborhood information within the same hybrid metapath.\nFinally, a hierarchical semantic attention fusion model (HSAF) is proposed,\nwhich can efficiently integrate different-hop and different-path neighborhood\ninformation respectively. This paper can solve the problem of aggregating the\nmulti-hop neighborhood information and can learn hybrid metapaths for target\ntask, reducing the limitation of manually specifying metapaths. In addition,\nHSAF can extract the internal node information of the metapaths and better\nintegrate the semantic information of different levels. Experimental results on\nreal datasets show that MHNF is superior to state-of-the-art methods in node\nclassification and clustering tasks (10.94% - 69.09% and 11.58% - 394.93%\nrelative improvement on average, respectively).",

          "description": "Two crucial requirements for a successful adoption of deep learning (DL) in\nthe wild are: (1) robustness to distributional shifts, and (2) model\ncompactness for achieving efficiency. Unfortunately, efforts towards\nsimultaneously achieving Out-of-Distribution (OOD) robustness and extreme model\ncompactness without sacrificing accuracy have mostly been unsuccessful. This\nraises an important question: \"Is the inability to create compact, accurate,\nand robust deep neural networks (CARDs) fundamental?\" To answer this question,\nwe perform a large-scale analysis for a range of popular model compression\ntechniques which uncovers several intriguing patterns. Notably, in contrast to\ntraditional pruning approaches (e.g., fine tuning and gradual magnitude\npruning), we find that \"lottery ticket-style\" pruning approaches can\nsurprisingly be used to create high performing CARDs. Specifically, we are able\nto create extremely compact CARDs that are dramatically more robust than their\nsignificantly larger and full-precision counterparts while matching (or\nbeating) their test accuracy, simply by pruning and/or quantizing. To better\nunderstand these differences, we perform sensitivity analysis in the Fourier\ndomain for CARDs trained using different data augmentation methods. Motivated\nby our analysis, we develop a simple domain-adaptive test-time ensembling\napproach (CARD-Deck) that uses a gating module to dynamically select an\nappropriate CARD from the CARD-Deck based on their spectral-similarity with\ntest samples. By leveraging complementary frequency biases of different\ncompressed models, the proposed approach builds a \"winning hand\" of CARDs that\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10-C accuracies (i.e., 96.8% clean\nand 92.75% robust) with dramatically better memory usage than their\nnon-compressed counterparts. We also present some theoretical evidences\nsupporting our empirical findings.",

          "description": "In Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, perception is both security and safety\ncritical. Despite various prior studies on its security issues, all of them\nonly consider attacks on camera- or LiDAR-based AD perception alone. However,\nproduction AD systems today predominantly adopt a Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF)\nbased design, which in principle can be more robust against these attacks under\nthe assumption that not all fusion sources are (or can be) attacked at the same\ntime. In this paper, we present the first study of security issues of MSF-based\nperception in AD systems. We directly challenge the basic MSF design assumption\nabove by exploring the possibility of attacking all fusion sources\nsimultaneously. This allows us for the first time to understand how much\nsecurity guarantee MSF can fundamentally provide as a general defense strategy\nfor AD perception.\n\nWe formulate the attack as an optimization problem to generate a\nphysically-realizable, adversarial 3D-printed object that misleads an AD system\nto fail in detecting it and thus crash into it. We propose a novel attack\npipeline that addresses two main design challenges: (1) non-differentiable\ntarget camera and LiDAR sensing systems, and (2) non-differentiable cell-level\naggregated features popularly used in LiDAR-based AD perception. We evaluate\nour attack on MSF included in representative open-source industry-grade AD\nsystems in real-world driving scenarios. Our results show that the attack\nachieves over 90% success rate across different object types and MSF. Our\nattack is also found stealthy, robust to victim positions, transferable across\nMSF algorithms, and physical-world realizable after being 3D-printed and\ncaptured by LiDAR and camera devices. To concretely assess the end-to-end\nsafety impact, we further perform simulation evaluation and show that it can\ncause a 100% vehicle collision rate for an industry-grade AD system.",

Therefore, it could be trivially distributed for\nlarge-scale clustering and few-shot tasks. Furthermore, we provides a thorough\nconvergence analysis based on point-to-set maps. Were port comprehensive\nclustering and few-shot learning experiments over various data sets, showing\nthat our method yields competitive performances, in term of accuracy and\noptimization quality, while scaling up to large problems. Using standard\ntraining on the base classes, without resorting to complex meta-learning and\nepisodic-training strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art\nfew-shot methods by significant margins, across various models, settings and\ndata sets. Surprisingly, we found that even standard clustering procedures\n(e.g., K-means), which correspond to particular, non-regularized cases of our\ngeneral model, already achieve competitive performances in comparison to the\nstate-of-the-art in few-shot learning. These surprising results point to the\nlimitations of the current few-shot benchmarks, and question the viability of a\nlarge body of convoluted few-shot learning techniques in the recent literature.",

Existing estimation\nalgorithms either require intensive training on target tasks or have\ndifficulties in evaluating the transferability between layers. We propose a\nsimple, efficient, and effective transferability measure named TransRate. With\nsingle pass through the target data, TransRate measures the transferability as\nthe mutual information between the features of target examples extracted by a\npre-trained model and labels of them. We overcome the challenge of efficient\nmutual information estimation by resorting to coding rate that serves as an\neffective alternative to entropy. TransRate is theoretically analyzed to be\nclosely related to the performance after transfer learning. Despite its\nextraordinary simplicity in 10 lines of codes, TransRate performs remarkably\nwell in extensive evaluations on 22 pre-trained models and 16 downstream tasks.",

Although much recent research\nhas focused on the development of safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms\nthat produce a safe policy after training, ensuring safety during training as\nwell remains an open problem. A fundamental challenge is performing exploration\nwhile still satisfying constraints in an unknown Markov decision process (MDP).\nIn this work, we address this problem for the chance-constrained setting. We\npropose a new algorithm, SAILR, that uses an intervention mechanism based on\nadvantage functions to keep the agent safe throughout training and optimizes\nthe agent's policy using off-the-shelf RL algorithms designed for unconstrained\nMDPs. Our method comes with strong guarantees on safety during both training\nand deployment (i.e., after training and without the intervention mechanism)\nand policy performance compared to the optimal safety-constrained policy. In\nour experiments, we show that SAILR violates constraints far less during\ntraining than standard safe RL and constrained MDP approaches and converges to\na well-performing policy that can be deployed safely without intervention.

The latent components are assumed to\nreside in the probability simplex, and are transformed by an unknown\npost-nonlinear mixing system. This problem finds various applications in signal\nand data analytics, e.g., nonlinear hyperspectral unmixing, image embedding,\nand nonlinear clustering. Linear mixture learning problems are already\nill-posed, as identifiability of the target latent components is hard to\nestablish in general. With unknown nonlinearity involved, the problem is even\nmore challenging. Prior work offered a function equation-based formulation for\nprovable latent component identification. However, the identifiability\nconditions are somewhat stringent and unrealistic. In addition, the\nidentifiability analysis is based on the infinite sample (i.e., population)\ncase, while the understanding for practical finite sample cases has been\nelusive. Moreover, the algorithm in the prior work trades model expressiveness\nwith computational convenience, which often hinders the learning performance.\nOur contribution is threefold. First, new identifiability conditions are\nderived under largely relaxed assumptions. Second, comprehensive sample\ncomplexity results are presented -- which are the first of the kind.

A popular strategy\nfor mitigating this problem is to learn control policies by imitating a set of\nexpert demonstrations.

To address this\nshortcoming, we propose Probabilistic Planning for Demonstration Discovery\n(P2D2), a technique for automatically discovering demonstrations without access\nto an expert. We formulate discovering demonstrations as a search problem and\nleverage widely-used planning algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree\nto find demonstration trajectories. These demonstrations are used to initialize\na policy, then refined by a generic RL algorithm. We provide theoretical\nguarantees of P2D2 finding successful trajectories, as well as bounds for its\nsampling complexity.

However, existing methods resort to flattening the brain\nconnectome (i.e., graph) through vectorization which overlooks its topological\nproperties. To address this limitation and inspired from the emerging graph\nneural networks (GNNs), we design a novel regression GNN model (namely RegGNN)\nfor predicting IQ scores from brain connectivity. On top of that, we introduce\na novel, fully modular sample selection method to select the best samples to\nlearn from for our target prediction task. However, since such deep learning\narchitectures are computationally expensive to train, we further propose a\n\\emph{learning-based sample selection} method that learns how to choose the\ntraining samples with the highest expected predictive power on unseen samples.\nFor this, we capitalize on the fact that connectomes (i.e., their adjacency\nmatrices) lie in the symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix cone. Our results\non full-scale and verbal IQ prediction outperforms comparison methods in autism\nspectrum disorder cohorts and achieves a competitive performance for\nneurotypical subjects using 3-fold cross-validation.

To evaluate both the subjectivity of the task and the performance of our\nmethod, we collected a dataset of 300 varying images from multiple sources and\nasked five people, a photographic researcher and four other persons, to\nannotate the main characters. Our analysis showed a relatively high agreement\nbetween different annotators. The proposed method achieved a promising F1 score\nof 0.83 on the full image set and 0.96 on a subset evaluated as most clear and\nimportant cases by the photographic researcher.",

Our approach devises a\nmeta-learning objective that differentiates through a sequential learning\nprocess. Specifically, we train a linear model over the representations to\nmatch different augmented views of the same image together, each view presented\nsequentially. The linear model is then evaluated on both its ability to\nclassify images it just saw, and also on images from previous iterations. This\ngives rise to representations that favor quick knowledge retention with minimal\nforgetting. We evaluate SPeCiaL in the Continual Few-Shot Learning setting, and\nshow that it can match or outperform other supervised pretraining approaches.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks can be trained in reciprocal space, by acting on the\neigenvalues and eigenvectors of suitable transfer operators in direct space.\nAdjusting the eigenvalues, while freezing the eigenvectors, yields a\nsubstantial compression of the parameter space. This latter scales by\ndefinition with the number of computing neurons. The classification scores, as\nmeasured by the displayed accuracy, are however inferior to those attained when\nthe learning is carried in direct space, for an identical architecture and by\nemploying the full set of trainable parameters (with a quadratic dependence on\nthe size of neighbor layers). In this Letter, we propose a variant of the\nspectral learning method as appeared in Giambagli et al {Nat. Comm.} 2021,\nwhich leverages on two sets of eigenvalues, for each mapping between adjacent\nlayers. The eigenvalues act as veritable knobs which can be freely tuned so as\nto (i) enhance, or alternatively silence, the contribution of the input nodes,\n(ii) modulate the excitability of the receiving nodes with a mechanism which we\ninterpret as the artificial analogue of the homeostatic plasticity. The number\nof trainable parameters is still a linear function of the network size, but the\nperformances of the trained device gets much closer to those obtained via\nconventional algorithms, these latter requiring however a considerably heavier\ncomputational cost. The residual gap between conventional and spectral\ntrainings can be eventually filled by employing a suitable decomposition for\nthe non trivial block of the eigenvectors matrix. Each spectral parameter\nreflects back on the whole set of inter-nodes weights, an attribute which we\nshall effectively exploit to yield sparse networks with stunning classification\nabilities, as compared to their homologues trained with conventional means.",

          "description": "Machine learning approaches applied to NLP are often evaluated by summarizing\ntheir performance in a single number, for example accuracy. Since most test\nsets are constructed as an i.i.d. sample from the overall data, this approach\noverly simplifies the complexity of language and encourages overfitting to the\nhead of the data distribution. As such, rare language phenomena or text about\nunderrepresented groups are not equally included in the evaluation. To\nencourage more in-depth model analyses, researchers have proposed the use of\nmultiple test sets, also called challenge sets, that assess specific\ncapabilities of a model. In this paper, we develop a framework based on this\nidea which is able to generate controlled perturbations and identify subsets in\ntext-to-scalar, text-to-text, or data-to-text settings. By applying this\nframework to the GEM generation benchmark, we propose an evaluation suite made\nof 80 challenge sets, demonstrate the kinds of analyses that it enables and\nshed light onto the limits of current generation models.",

In this paper, we define a new problem, Network Space Search\n(NSS), as searching for favorable network spaces instead of a single\narchitecture. We propose an NSS method to directly search for efficient-aware\nnetwork spaces automatically, reducing the manual effort and immense cost in\ndiscovering satisfactory ones. The resultant network spaces, named Elite\nSpaces, are discovered from Expanded Search Space with minimal human expertise\nimposed. The Pareto-efficient Elite Spaces are aligned with the Pareto front\nunder various complexity constraints and can be further served as NAS search\nspaces, benefiting differentiable NAS approaches (e.g. In CIFAR-100, an\naveragely 2.3% lower error rate and 3.7% closer to target constraint than the\nbaseline with around 90% fewer samples required to find satisfactory networks).\nMoreover, our NSS approach is capable of searching for superior spaces in\nfuture unexplored spaces, revealing great potential in searching for network\nspaces automatically.

This procedure is\nparticularly challenging due to limited field of view, poor manoeuvrability of\nthe fetoscope, poor visibility due to fluid turbidity, variability in light\nsource, and unusual position of the placenta. This may lead to increased\nprocedural time and incomplete ablation, resulting in persistent TTTS.\nComputer-assisted intervention may help overcome these challenges by expanding\nthe fetoscopic field of view through video mosaicking and providing better\nvisualization of the vessel network. However, the research and development in\nthis domain remain limited due to unavailability of high-quality data to encode\nthe intra- and inter-procedure variability. Through the \\textit{Fetoscopic\nPlacental Vessel Segmentation and Registration (FetReg)} challenge, we present\na large-scale multi-centre dataset for the development of generalized and\nrobust semantic segmentation and video mosaicking algorithms for the fetal\nenvironment with a focus on creating drift-free mosaics from long duration\nfetoscopy videos. In this paper, we provide an overview of the FetReg dataset,\nchallenge tasks, evaluation metrics and baseline methods for both segmentation\nand registration. Baseline methods results on the FetReg dataset shows that our\ndataset poses interesting challenges, offering large opportunity for the\ncreation of novel methods and models through a community effort initiative\nguided by the FetReg challenge.",

          "description": "How related are the representations learned by neural language models,\ntranslation models, and language tagging tasks? We answer this question by\nadapting an encoder-decoder transfer learning method from computer vision to\ninvestigate the structure among 100 different feature spaces extracted from\nhidden representations of various networks trained on language tasks. This\nmethod reveals a low-dimensional structure where language models and\ntranslation models smoothly interpolate between word embeddings, syntactic and\nsemantic tasks, and future word embeddings. We call this low-dimensional\nstructure a language representation embedding because it encodes the\nrelationships between representations needed to process language for a variety\nof NLP tasks. We find that this representation embedding can predict how well\neach individual feature space maps to human brain responses to natural language\nstimuli recorded using fMRI. Additionally, we find that the principal dimension\nof this structure can be used to create a metric which highlights the brain's\nnatural language processing hierarchy. This suggests that the embedding\ncaptures some part of the brain's natural language representation structure.",

          "description": "This paper presents stability analysis tools for model predictive control\n(MPC) with and without terminal weight. Stability analysis of MPC with a\nlimited horizon but without terminal weight is a long-standing open problem. By\nusing a modified value function as an Lyapunov function candidate and the\nprinciple of optimality, this paper establishes stability conditions for this\ntype of widely spread MPC algorithms. A new stability guaranteed MPC algorithm\nwithout terminal weight (MPCS) is presented. With the help of designing a new\nsublevel set defined by the value function of one-step ahead stage cost,\nconditions for checking its recursive feasibility and stability of the proposed\nMPC algorithm are presented. The new stability condition and the derived MPCS\novercome the difficulties arising in the existing terminal weight based MPC\nframework, including the need of searching a suitable terminal weight and\npossible poor performance caused by an inappropriate terminal weight. This work\nis further extended to MPC with a terminal weight for the completeness.\nNumerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed tool, whereas the existing stability analysis tools are either not\napplicable or lead to quite conservative results. It shows that the proposed\ntools offer a number of mechanisms to achieve stability: adjusting state and/or\ncontrol weights, extending the length of horizon, and adding a simple extra\nconstraint on the first or second state in the optimisation.",

          "description": "In this paper we present LiM (\"Less is More\"), a malware classification\nframework that leverages Federated Learning to detect and classify malicious\napps in a privacy-respecting manner. Information about newly installed apps is\nkept locally on users' devices, so that the provider cannot infer which apps\nwere installed by users. At the same time, input from all users is taken into\naccount in the federated learning process and they all benefit from better\nclassification performance. A key challenge of this setting is that users do\nnot have access to the ground truth (i.e. they cannot correctly identify\nwhether an app is malicious). To tackle this, LiM uses a safe semi-supervised\nensemble that maximizes classification accuracy with respect to a baseline\nclassifier trained by the service provider (i.e. the cloud). We implement LiM\nand show that the cloud server has F1 score of 95%, while clients have perfect\nrecall with only 1 false positive in >100 apps, using a dataset of 25K clean\napps and 25K malicious apps, 200 users and 50 rounds of federation.\nFurthermore, we conduct a security analysis and demonstrate that LiM is robust\nagainst both poisoning attacks by adversaries who control half of the clients,\nand inference attacks performed by an honest-but-curious cloud server. Further\nexperiments with MaMaDroid's dataset confirm resistance against poisoning\nattacks and a performance improvement due to the federation.",

We\ndownloaded a total of 120 training samples, including 58 ASD and 62 TD\nparticipants, which were obtained from the public repository: Autism Brain\nImaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I). Our methodology and results have five main\nparts. First, we utilize a group ICA model to extract functional networks from\nthe ASD group and rank the top 20 regions of interest (ROIs). Second, we\nutilize a dictionary learning model to extract functional networks from the ASD\ngroup and rank the top 20 ROIs. Third, we merged the 40 selected ROIs from the\ntwo models together as the ASD functional networks. Fourth, we generate three\ncorresponding masks based on the 20 selected ROIs from group ICA, the 20 ROIs\nselected from dictionary learning, and the 40 combined ROIs selected from both.\nFinally, we extract ROIs for all training samples using the above three masks,\nand the calculated functional connectivity was used as features for ASD and TD\nclassification. The classification results showed that the functional networks\nderived from ICA and dictionary learning together outperform those derived from\na single ICA model or a single dictionary learning model.",

To date, work on performative\nprediction has focused on finding performatively stable models, which are the\nfixed points of repeated retraining. However, stable solutions can be far from\noptimal when evaluated in terms of the performative risk, the loss experienced\nby the decision maker when deploying a model. In this paper, we shift attention\nbeyond performative stability and focus on optimizing the performative risk\ndirectly. We identify a natural set of properties of the loss function and\nmodel-induced distribution shift under which the performative risk is convex, a\nproperty which does not follow from convexity of the loss alone. Furthermore,\nwe develop algorithms that leverage our structural assumptions to optimize the\nperformative risk with better sample efficiency than generic methods for\nderivative-free convex optimization.",

          "description": "Fine-grained location prediction on smart phones can be used to improve\napp/system performance. Application scenarios include video quality adaptation\nas a function of the 5G network quality at predicted user locations, and\naugmented reality apps that speed up content rendering based on predicted user\nlocations. Such use cases require prediction error in the same range as the GPS\nerror, and no existing works on location prediction can achieve this level of\naccuracy. We present a system for fine-grained location prediction (FGLP) of\nmobile users, based on GPS traces collected on the phones. FGLP has two\ncomponents: a federated learning framework and a prediction model. The\nframework runs on the phones of the users and also on a server that coordinates\nlearning from all users in the system. FGLP represents the user location data\nas relative points in an abstract 2D space, which enables learning across\ndifferent physical spaces. The model merges Bidirectional Long Short-Term\nMemory (BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), where BiLSTM learns\nthe speed and direction of the mobile users, and CNN learns information such as\nuser movement preferences. FGLP uses federated learning to protect user privacy\nand reduce bandwidth consumption. Our experimental results, using a dataset\nwith over 600,000 users, demonstrate that FGLP outperforms baseline models in\nterms of prediction accuracy. We also demonstrate that FGLP works well in\nconjunction with transfer learning, which enables model reusability. Finally,\nbenchmark results on several types of Android phones demonstrate FGLP's\nfeasibility in real life.",

          "description": "Recently developed large pre-trained language models, e.g., BERT, have\nachieved remarkable performance in many downstream natural language processing\napplications. These pre-trained language models often contain hundreds of\nmillions of parameters and suffer from high computation and latency in\nreal-world applications. It is desirable to reduce the computation overhead of\nthe models for fast training and inference while keeping the model performance\nin downstream applications. Several lines of work utilize knowledge\ndistillation to compress the teacher model to a smaller student model. However,\nthey usually discard the teacher's knowledge when in inference. Differently, in\nthis paper, we propose RefBERT to leverage the knowledge learned from the\nteacher, i.e., facilitating the pre-computed BERT representation on the\nreference sample and compressing BERT into a smaller student model. To\nguarantee our proposal, we provide theoretical justification on the loss\nfunction and the usage of reference samples. Significantly, the theoretical\nresult shows that including the pre-computed teacher's representations on the\nreference samples indeed increases the mutual information in learning the\nstudent model. Finally, we conduct the empirical evaluation and show that our\nRefBERT can beat the vanilla TinyBERT over 8.1\\% and achieves more than 94\\% of\nthe performance of $\\BERTBASE$ on the GLUE benchmark. Meanwhile, RefBERT is\n7.4x smaller and 9.5x faster on inference than BERT$_{\\rm BASE}$.",

          "description": "A key limitation in using various modern methods of machine learning in\ndeveloping feedback control policies is the lack of appropriate methodologies\nto analyze their long-term dynamics, in terms of making any sort of guarantees\n(even statistically) about robustness. The central reasons for this are largely\ndue to the so-called curse of dimensionality, combined with the black-box\nnature of the resulting control policies themselves. This paper aims at the\nfirst of these issues. Although the full state space of a system may be quite\nlarge in dimensionality, it is a common feature of most model-based control\nmethods that the resulting closed-loop systems demonstrate dominant dynamics\nthat are rapidly driven to some lower-dimensional sub-space within. In this\nwork we argue that the dimensionality of this subspace is captured by tools\nfrom fractal geometry, namely various notions of a fractional dimension. We\nthen show that the dimensionality of trajectories induced by model free\nreinforcement learning agents can be influenced adding a post processing\nfunction to the agents reward signal. We verify that the dimensionality\nreduction is robust to noise being added to the system and show that that the\nmodified agents are more actually more robust to noise and push disturbances in\ngeneral for the systems we examined.",

          "description": "In label-noise learning, the transition matrix plays a key role in building\nstatistically consistent classifiers. Existing consistent estimators for the\ntransition matrix have been developed by exploiting anchor points. However, the\nanchor-point assumption is not always satisfied in real scenarios. In this\npaper, we propose an end-to-end framework for solving label-noise learning\nwithout anchor points, in which we simultaneously optimize two objectives: the\ncross entropy loss between the noisy label and the predicted probability by the\nneural network, and the volume of the simplex formed by the columns of the\ntransition matrix. Our proposed framework can identify the transition matrix if\nthe clean class-posterior probabilities are sufficiently scattered. This is by\nfar the mildest assumption under which the transition matrix is provably\nidentifiable and the learned classifier is statistically consistent.\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of the proposed method.",

The loss\nfunction is inspired by, and embodies, the structure of established stochastic\nnumerical integrators (here, Euler-Maruyama and Milstein); our approximations\ncan thus benefit from error analysis of these underlying numerical schemes.\nThey also lend themselves naturally to \"physics-informed\" gray-box\nidentification when approximate coarse models, such as mean field equations,\nare available.

          "description": "Large-scale modern data often involves estimation and testing for\nhigh-dimensional unknown parameters. It is desirable to identify the sparse\nsignals, ``the needles in the haystack'', with accuracy and false discovery\ncontrol. However, the unprecedented complexity and heterogeneity in modern data\nstructure require new machine learning tools to effectively exploit\ncommonalities and to robustly adjust for both sparsity and heterogeneity. In\naddition, estimates for high-dimensional parameters often lack uncertainty\nquantification. In this paper, we propose a novel Spike-and-Nonparametric\nmixture prior (SNP) -- a spike to promote the sparsity and a nonparametric\nstructure to capture signals. In contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, the\nproposed methods solve the estimation and testing problem at once with several\nmerits: 1) an accurate sparsity estimation; 2) point estimates with\nshrinkage/soft-thresholding property; 3) credible intervals for uncertainty\nquantification; 4) an optimal multiple testing procedure that controls false\ndiscovery rate.

          "description": "Recent work has discovered that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies\nare vulnerable to adversarial examples. These attacks mislead the policy of DRL\nagents by perturbing the state of the environment observed by agents. They are\nfeasible in principle but too slow to fool DRL policies in real time. We\npropose a new attack to fool DRL policies that is both effective and efficient\nenough to be mounted in real time. We utilize the Universal Adversarial\nPerturbation (UAP) method to compute effective perturbations independent of the\nindividual inputs to which they are applied. Via an extensive evaluation using\nAtari 2600 games, we show that our technique is effective, as it fully degrades\nthe performance of both deterministic and stochastic policies (up to 100%, even\nwhen the $l_\\infty$ bound on the perturbation is as small as 0.005). We also\nshow that our attack is efficient, incurring an online computational cost of\n0.027ms on average. It is faster compared to the response time (0.6ms on\naverage) of agents with different DRL policies, and considerably faster than\nprior attacks (2.7ms on average). Furthermore, we demonstrate that known\ndefenses are ineffective against universal perturbations. We propose an\neffective detection technique which can form the basis for robust defenses\nagainst attacks based on universal perturbations.",

          "description": "Counterfactuals, serving as one of the emerging type of model\ninterpretations, have recently received attention from both researchers and\npractitioners. Counterfactual explanations formalize the exploration of\n``what-if'' scenarios, and are an instance of example-based reasoning using a\nset of hypothetical data samples. Counterfactuals essentially show how the\nmodel decision alters with input perturbations. Existing methods for generating\ncounterfactuals are mainly algorithm-based, which are time-inefficient and\nassume the same counterfactual universe for different queries. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Model-based Counterfactual Synthesizer (MCS)\nframework for interpreting machine learning models. We first analyze the\nmodel-based counterfactual process and construct a base synthesizer using a\nconditional generative adversarial net (CGAN). To better approximate the\ncounterfactual universe for those rare queries, we novelly employ the umbrella\nsampling technique to conduct the MCS framework training. Besides, we also\nenhance the MCS framework by incorporating the causal dependence among\nattributes with model inductive bias, and validate its design correctness from\nthe causality identification perspective. Experimental results on several\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness as well as efficiency of our proposed\nMCS framework, and verify the advantages compared with other alternatives.",

Policies learned through\nself-play may adopt arbitrary conventions and implicitly rely on multi-step\nreasoning based on fragile assumptions about other agents' actions and thus\nfail when paired with humans or independently trained agents at test time. To\naddress this, we present off-belief learning (OBL).

When $\\pi_0$ is uniform random, OBL converges to an optimal policy\nthat does not rely on inferences based on other agents' behavior (an optimal\ngrounded policy). OBL can be iterated in a hierarchy, where the optimal policy\nfrom one level becomes the input to the next, thereby introducing multi-level\ncognitive reasoning in a controlled manner. Unlike existing approaches, which\nmay converge to any equilibrium policy, OBL converges to a unique policy,\nmaking it suitable for zero-shot coordination (ZSC).

          "description": "Estimation of the longitudinal slip ratio of tires is important in boosting\nthe control performance of the vehicle under driving and braking conditions. In\nthis paper, the slip ratio is estimated using four machine learning algorithms\n(Neural Network, Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest and Support Vector\nMachine) based on the acceleration signals from the tri-axial MEMS\naccelerometers utilized in the intelligent tire system. The experimental data\nare collected through the MTS experimental platform. The corresponding\nacceleration signals within the tire contact patch are extracted after\nfiltering to be used for the training the aforesaid machine learning\nalgorithms. A comparison is provided between the implemented ML algorithms\nusing a 10-fold CV. NRMS errors in the CV results indicate that NN has the\nhighest accuracy in comparison with other techniques. The NRSM errors of NN,\nGBM, RF, and SVM are 2.59\\%, 3.30\\%, 4.21\\%, and 5.34\\%, respectively. Among\nthese techniques, GBM has a more stable results as it has the smallest output\nvariance. The present study with the fusion of intelligent tire system and\nmachine learning algorithms paves the way for the accurate estimation of tire\nslip ratio, which is critical for the development of reliable vehicle control\nalgorithms.",

          "description": "The theory of spectral filtering is a remarkable tool to understand the\nstatistical properties of learning with kernels. For least squares, it allows\nto derive various regularization schemes that yield faster convergence rates of\nthe excess risk than with Tikhonov regularization. This is typically achieved\nby leveraging classical assumptions called source and capacity conditions,\nwhich characterize the difficulty of the learning task. In order to understand\nestimators derived from other loss functions, Marteau-Ferey et al. have\nextended the theory of Tikhonov regularization to generalized self concordant\nloss functions (GSC), which contain, e.g., the logistic loss. In this paper, we\ngo a step further and show that fast and optimal rates can be achieved for GSC\nby using the iterated Tikhonov regularization scheme, which is intrinsically\nrelated to the proximal point method in optimization, and overcomes the\nlimitation of the classical Tikhonov regularization.",

Backdoor attackers tamper with training\ndata to embed a vulnerability in models that are trained on that data. This\nvulnerability is then activated at inference time by placing a \"trigger\" into\nthe model's input. Typical backdoor attacks insert the trigger directly into\nthe training data, although the presence of such an attack may be visible upon\ninspection. In contrast, the Hidden Trigger Backdoor Attack achieves poisoning\nwithout placing a trigger into the training data at all. However, this hidden\ntrigger attack is ineffective at poisoning neural networks trained from\nscratch. We develop a new hidden trigger attack, Sleeper Agent, which employs\ngradient matching, data selection, and target model re-training during the\ncrafting process. Sleeper Agent is the first hidden trigger backdoor attack to\nbe effective against neural networks trained from scratch. We demonstrate its\neffectiveness on ImageNet and in black-box settings.

          "description": "Petabytes of data are generated each day by emerging Internet of Things\n(IoT), but only few of them can be finally collected and used for Machine\nLearning (ML) purposes due to the apprehension of data & privacy leakage, which\nseriously retarding ML's growth. To alleviate this problem, Federated learning\nis proposed to perform model training by multiple clients' combined data\nwithout the dataset sharing within the cluster. Nevertheless, federated\nlearning introduces massive communication overhead as the synchronized data in\neach epoch is of the same size as the model, and thereby leading to a low\ncommunication efficiency. Consequently, variant methods mainly focusing on the\ncommunication rounds reduction and data compression are proposed to reduce the\ncommunication overhead of federated learning. In this paper, we propose\nOverlap-FedAvg, a framework that parallels the model training phase with model\nuploading & downloading phase, so that the latter phase can be totally covered\nby the former phase. Compared to vanilla FedAvg, Overlap-FedAvg is further\ndeveloped with a hierarchical computing strategy, a data compensation mechanism\nand a nesterov accelerated gradients~(NAG) algorithm. Besides, Overlap-FedAvg\nis orthogonal to many other compression methods so that they can be applied\ntogether to maximize the utilization of the cluster. Furthermore, the\ntheoretical analysis is provided to prove the convergence of the proposed\nOverlap-FedAvg framework. Extensive experiments on both conventional and\nrecurrent tasks with multiple models and datasets also demonstrate that the\nproposed Overlap-FedAvg framework substantially boosts the federated learning\nprocess.",

We\npropose a classification system based on a simple neural network architecture\nthat scores the classical stages as well as pre-REM sleep in mice. When\nrestricted to the classical stages, the optimized network showed\nstate-of-the-art classification performance with an out-of-sample F1 score of\n0.95 in male C57BL/6J mice.

The result is\ncomparable to previous attempts to score transitional stages in other species\nsuch as transition sleep in rats or N1 sleep in humans. Nevertheless, we\nobserved that the sequence of predictions including pre-REM typically\ntransitioned from Non-REM to REM reflecting sleep dynamics observed by human\nscorers.

          "description": "Thanks to the combination of state-of-the-art accelerators and highly\noptimized open software frameworks, there has been tremendous progress in the\nperformance of deep neural networks. While these developments have been\nresponsible for many breakthroughs, progress towards solving large-scale\nproblems, such as video encoding and semantic segmentation in 3D, is hampered\nbecause access to on-premise memory is often limited. Instead of relying on\n(optimal) checkpointing or invertibility of the network layers -- to recover\nthe activations during backpropagation -- we propose to approximate the\ngradient of convolutional layers in neural networks with a multi-channel\nrandomized trace estimation technique. Compared to other methods, this approach\nis simple, amenable to analyses, and leads to a greatly reduced memory\nfootprint. Even though the randomized trace estimation introduces stochasticity\nduring training, we argue that this is of little consequence as long as the\ninduced errors are of the same order as errors in the gradient due to the use\nof stochastic gradient descent. We discuss the performance of networks trained\nwith stochastic backpropagation and how the error can be controlled while\nmaximizing memory usage and minimizing computational overhead.",

The Italian National Institute of\nStatistics (Istat) is currently carrying out several Big Data pilot studies.\nOne of these studies, the ICT Big Data pilot, aims at exploiting massive\namounts of textual data automatically scraped from the websites of Italian\nenterprises in order to predict a set of target variables (e.g. e-commerce)\nthat are routinely observed by the traditional ICT Survey. In this paper, we\nshow that Deep Learning techniques can successfully address this problem.\nEssentially, we tackle a text classification task: an algorithm must learn to\ninfer whether an Italian enterprise performs e-commerce from the textual\ncontent of its website. To reach this goal, we developed a sophisticated\nprocessing pipeline and evaluated its performance through extensive\nexperiments. Our pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks and relies on Word\nEmbeddings to encode raw texts into grayscale images (i.e. normalized numeric\nmatrices). Web-scraped texts are huge and have very low signal to noise ratio:\nto overcome these issues, we adopted a framework known as False Positive\nReduction, which has seldom (if ever) been applied before to text\nclassification tasks. Several original contributions enable our processing\npipeline to reach good classification results.

          "description": "Among interpretable machine learning methods, the class of Generalised\nAdditive Neural Networks (GANNs) is referred to as Self-Explaining Neural\nNetworks (SENN) because of the linear dependence on explicit functions of the\ninputs. In binary classification this shows the precise weight that each input\ncontributes towards the logit. The nomogram is a graphical representation of\nthese weights. We show that functions of individual and pairs of variables can\nbe derived from a functional Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) representation,\nenabling an efficient feature selection to be carried by application of the\nlogistic Lasso. This process infers the structure of GANNs which otherwise\nneeds to be predefined. As this method is particularly suited for tabular data,\nit starts by fitting a generic flexible model, in this case a Multi-layer\nPerceptron (MLP) to which the ANOVA decomposition is applied. This has the\nfurther advantage that the resulting GANN can be replicated as a SENN, enabling\nfurther refinement of the univariate and bivariate component functions to take\nplace. The component functions are partial responses hence the SENN is a\npartial response network. The Partial Response Network (PRN) is equally as\ntransparent as a traditional logistic regression model, but capable of\nnon-linear classification with comparable or superior performance to the\noriginal MLP. In other words, the PRN is a fully interpretable representation\nof the MLP, at the level of univariate and bivariate effects. The performance\nof the PRN is shown to be competitive for benchmark data, against\nstate-of-the-art machine learning methods including GBM, SVM and Random\nForests. It is also compared with spline-based Sparse Additive Models (SAM)\nshowing that a semi-parametric representation of the GAM as a neural network\ncan be as effective as the SAM though less constrained by the need to set\nspline nodes.",

The World\nHealth Organization (WHO) has provided guidelines on how to reduce the spread\nof the virus and one of the most important measures is social distancing.\nMaintaining a minimum of one meter distance from other people is strongly\nsuggested to reduce the risk of infection. This has created a strong interest\nin monitoring the social distances either as a safety measure or to study how\nthe measures have affected human behavior and country-wise differences in this.\nThe need for automatic social distance estimation algorithms is evident, but\nthere is no suitable test benchmark for such algorithms. Collecting images with\nmeasured ground-truth pair-wise distances between all the people using\ndifferent camera settings is cumbersome. Furthermore, performance evaluation\nfor social distance estimation algorithms is not straightforward and there is\nno widely accepted evaluation protocol. In this paper, we provide a dataset of\nvarying images with measured pair-wise social distances under different camera\npositionings and focal length values. We suggest a performance evaluation\nprotocol and provide a benchmark to easily evaluate social distance estimation\nalgorithms. We also propose a method for automatic social distance estimation.\nOur method takes advantage of object detection and human pose estimation. It\ncan be applied on any single image as long as focal length and sensor size\ninformation are known. The results on our benchmark are encouraging with 92%\nhuman detection rate and only 28.9% average error in distance estimation among\nthe detected people.",

In tabular Markov Decision Problems (MDPs), under persistent\nexploration and suitable parameterization, global optimality may be obtained.\nBy contrast, in continuous space, the non-convexity poses a pathological\nchallenge as evidenced by existing convergence results being mostly limited to\nstationarity or arbitrary local extrema. To close this gap, we step towards\npersistent exploration in continuous space through policy parameterizations\ndefined by distributions of heavier tails defined by tail-index parameter\nalpha, which increases the likelihood of jumping in state space. Doing so\ninvalidates smoothness conditions of the score function common to PG. Thus, we\nestablish how the convergence rate to stationarity depends on the policy's tail\nindex alpha, a Holder continuity parameter, integrability conditions, and an\nexploration tolerance parameter introduced here for the first time. Further, we\ncharacterize the dependence of the set of local maxima on the tail index\nthrough an exit and transition time analysis of a suitably defined Markov\nchain, identifying that policies associated with Levy Processes of a heavier\ntail converge to wider peaks. This phenomenon yields improved stability to\nperturbations in supervised learning, which we corroborate also manifests in\nimproved performance of policy search, especially when myopic and farsighted\nincentives are misaligned.",

          "description": "Recent works have shown that interval bound propagation (IBP) can be used to\ntrain verifiably robust neural networks. Reseachers observe an intriguing\nphenomenon on these IBP trained networks: CROWN, a bounding method based on\ntight linear relaxation, often gives very loose bounds on these networks. We\nalso observe that most neurons become dead during the IBP training process,\nwhich could hurt the representation capability of the network. In this paper,\nwe study the relationship between IBP and CROWN, and prove that CROWN is always\ntighter than IBP when choosing appropriate bounding lines. We further propose a\nrelaxed version of CROWN, linear bound propagation (LBP), that can be used to\nverify large networks to obtain lower verified errors than IBP. We also design\na new activation function, parameterized ramp function (ParamRamp), which has\nmore diversity of neuron status than ReLU.

In order to rely on\nvirtual tests the employed sensor models have to be validated. For this reason,\nit is necessary to quantify the discrepancy between simulation and reality in\norder to determine whether a certain fidelity is sufficient for a desired\nintended use. There exists no sound method to measure this\nsimulation-to-reality gap of radar perception for autonomous driving. We\naddress this problem by introducing a multi-layered evaluation approach, which\nconsists of a combination of an explicit and an implicit sensor model\nevaluation.

In order to demonstrate the method, we evaluated the\nfidelity of three typical radar model types (ideal, data-driven, ray\ntracing-based) and their applicability for virtually testing radar-based\nmulti-object tracking.

          "description": "Pre-trained language models have been successful on text classification\ntasks, but are prone to learning spurious correlations from biased datasets,\nand are thus vulnerable when making inferences in a new domain. Prior works\nreveal such spurious patterns via post-hoc explanation algorithms which compute\nthe importance of input features. Further, the model is regularized to align\nthe importance scores with human knowledge, so that the unintended model\nbehaviors are eliminated. However, such a regularization technique lacks\nflexibility and coverage, since only importance scores towards a pre-defined\nlist of features are adjusted, while more complex human knowledge such as\nfeature interaction and pattern generalization can hardly be incorporated. In\nthis work, we propose to refine a learned language model for a target domain by\ncollecting human-provided compositional explanations regarding observed biases.\nBy parsing these explanations into executable logic rules, the human-specified\nrefinement advice from a small set of explanations can be generalized to more\ntraining examples. We additionally introduce a regularization term allowing\nadjustments for both importance and interaction of features to better rectify\nmodel behavior.

In our quantitative evaluation, we compare the models\nbased on the smoothed BLEU-4, METEOR, and ROUGE-L machine translation metrics,\nand in our qualitative evaluation, we perform a manual open-coding of the most\ncommon errors committed by the models when compared to ground truth captions.\nOur investigation reveals new insights into the relationship between\nmetric-based performance and model prediction errors grounded in an empirically\nderived error taxonomy that can be used to drive future research efforts",

          "description": "Recent results in supervised learning suggest that while overparameterized\nmodels have the capacity to overfit, they in fact generalize quite well. We ask\nwhether the same phenomenon occurs for offline contextual bandits. Our results\nare mixed. Value-based algorithms benefit from the same generalization behavior\nas overparameterized supervised learning, but policy-based algorithms do not.\nWe show that this discrepancy is due to the \\emph{action-stability} of their\nobjectives. An objective is action-stable if there exists a prediction\n(action-value vector or action distribution) which is optimal no matter which\naction is observed. While value-based objectives are action-stable,\npolicy-based objectives are unstable. We formally prove upper bounds on the\nregret of overparameterized value-based learning and lower bounds on the regret\nfor policy-based algorithms. In our experiments with large neural networks,\nthis gap between action-stable value-based objectives and unstable policy-based\nobjectives leads to significant performance differences.",

          "description": "Ensemble classifiers have been investigated by many in the artificial\nintelligence and machine learning community. Majority voting and weighted\nmajority voting are two commonly used combination schemes in ensemble learning.\nHowever, understanding of them is incomplete at best, with some properties even\nmisunderstood. In this paper, we present a group of properties of these two\nschemes formally under a dataset-level geometric framework. Two key factors,\nevery component base classifier's performance and dissimilarity between each\npair of component classifiers are evaluated by the same metric - the Euclidean\ndistance. Consequently, ensembling becomes a deterministic problem and the\nperformance of an ensemble can be calculated directly by a formula. We prove\nseveral theorems of interest and explain their implications for ensembles. In\nparticular, we compare and contrast the effect of the number of component\nclassifiers on these two types of ensemble schemes. Empirical investigation is\nalso conducted to verify the theoretical results when other metrics such as\naccuracy are used. We believe that the results from this paper are very useful\nfor us to understand the fundamental properties of these two combination\nschemes and the principles of ensemble classifiers in general. The results are\nalso helpful for us to investigate some issues in ensemble classifiers, such as\nensemble performance prediction, selecting a small number of base classifiers\nto obtain efficient and effective ensembles.",

          "description": "Adversarial training has been the topic of dozens of studies and a leading\nmethod for defending against adversarial attacks. Yet, it remains largely\nunknown (a) how adversarially-robust ImageNet classifiers (R classifiers)\ngeneralize to out-of-distribution examples; and (b) how their generalization\ncapability relates to their hidden representations. In this paper, we perform a\nthorough, systematic study to answer these two questions across AlexNet,\nGoogLeNet, and ResNet-50 architectures. We found that while standard ImageNet\nclassifiers have a strong texture bias, their R counterparts rely heavily on\nshapes. Remarkably, adversarial training induces three simplicity biases into\nhidden neurons in the process of 'robustifying' the network. That is, each\nconvolutional neuron in R networks often changes to detecting (1) pixel-wise\nsmoother patterns i.e. a mechanism that blocks high-frequency noise from\npassing through the network; (2) more lower-level features i.e. textures and\ncolors (instead of objects); and (3) fewer types of inputs. Our findings reveal\nthe interesting mechanisms that made networks more adversarially robust and\nalso explain some recent findings. Our findings reveal the interesting\nmechanisms that made networks more adversarially robust and also explain some\nrecent findings e.g. why R networks benefit from much larger capacity (Xie and\nYuille, 2020) and can act as a strong image prior in image synthesis (Santurkar\net al., 2019).",

          "description": "Neural architecture search (NAS) has seen a steep rise in interest over the\nlast few years. Many algorithms for NAS consist of searching through a space of\narchitectures by iteratively choosing an architecture, evaluating its\nperformance by training it, and using all prior evaluations to come up with the\nnext choice. The evaluation step is noisy - the final accuracy varies based on\nthe random initialization of the weights. Prior work has focused on devising\nnew search algorithms to handle this noise, rather than quantifying or\nunderstanding the level of noise in architecture evaluations. In this work, we\nshow that (1) the simplest hill-climbing algorithm is a powerful baseline for\nNAS, and (2), when the noise in popular NAS benchmark datasets is reduced to a\nminimum, hill-climbing to outperforms many popular state-of-the-art algorithms.\nWe further back up this observation by showing that the number of local minima\nis substantially reduced as the noise decreases, and by giving a theoretical\ncharacterization of the performance of local search in NAS. Based on our\nfindings, for NAS research we suggest (1) using local search as a baseline, and\n(2) denoising the training pipeline when possible.",

Such data records the aggregated counts of events\nsolely during specific time intervals -- such as the number of patients\nadmitted to the hospital or the volume of vehicles passing traffic loop\ndetectors -- and not the exact occurrence time of the events. First, we\nestablish the Mean Behavior Poisson (MBP) process, a novel Poisson process with\na direct parameter correspondence to the popular self-exciting Hawkes process.\nThe event intensity function of the MBP is the expected intensity over all\npossible Hawkes realizations with the same parameter set. We fit MBP in the\ninterval-censored setting using an interval-censored Poisson log-likelihood\n(IC-LL). We use the parameter equivalence to uncover the parameters of the\nassociated Hawkes process. Second, we introduce two novel exogenous functions\nto distinguish the exogenous from the endogenous events. We propose the\nmulti-impulse exogenous function when the exogenous events are observed as\nevent time and the latent homogeneous Poisson process exogenous function when\nthe exogenous events are presented as interval-censored volumes. Third, we\nprovide several approximation methods to estimate the intensity and compensator\nfunction of MBP when no analytical solution exists. Fourth and finally, we\nconnect the interval-censored loss of MBP to a broader class of Bregman\ndivergence-based functions. Using the connection, we show that the current\nstate of the art in popularity estimation (Hawkes Intensity Process (HIP)\n(Rizoiu et al.,2017b)) is a particular case of the MBP process.

          "description": "Due to advances in deep learning, the performance of automatic beat and\ndownbeat tracking in musical audio signals has seen great improvement in recent\nyears. In training such deep learning based models, data augmentation has been\nfound an important technique. However, existing data augmentation methods for\nthis task mainly target at balancing the distribution of the training data with\nrespect to their tempo. In this paper, we investigate another approach for data\naugmentation, to account for the composition of the training data in terms of\nthe percussive and non-percussive sound sources. Specifically, we propose to\nemploy a blind drum separation model to segregate the drum and non-drum sounds\nfrom each training audio signal, filtering out training signals that are\ndrumless, and then use the obtained drum and non-drum stems to augment the\ntraining data. We report experiments on four completely unseen test sets,\nvalidating the effectiveness of the proposed method, and accordingly the\nimportance of drum sound composition in the training data for beat and downbeat\ntracking.",

          "description": "In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, fermentation processes play a critical\nrole on productivity and profit. A fermentation process uses living cells with\ncomplex biological mechanisms, and this leads to high variability in the\nprocess outputs. By building on the biological mechanisms of protein and\nimpurity growth, we introduce a stochastic model to characterize the\naccumulation of the protein and impurity levels in the fermentation process.\nHowever, a common challenge in industry is the availability of only very\nlimited amount of data especially in the development and early stage of\nproduction. This adds an additional layer of uncertainty, referred to as model\nrisk, due to the difficulty of estimating the model parameters with limited\ndata. In this paper, we study the harvesting decision for a fermentation\nprocess under model risk. In particular, we adopt a Bayesian approach to update\nthe unknown parameters of the growth-rate distributions, and use the resulting\nposterior distributions to characterize the impact of model risk on\nfermentation output variability. The harvesting problem is formulated as a\nMarkov decision process model with knowledge states that summarize the\nposterior distributions and hence incorporate the model risk in\ndecision-making. The resulting model is solved by using a reinforcement\nlearning algorithm based on Bayesian sparse sampling. We provide analytical\nresults on the structure of the optimal policy and its objective function, and\nexplicitly study the impact of model risk on harvesting decisions. Our case\nstudies at MSD Animal Health demonstrate that the proposed model and solution\napproach improve the harvesting decisions in real life by achieving\nsubstantially higher average output from a fermentation batch along with lower\nbatch-to-batch variability.",

          "description": "Recommender Systems (RS) have employed knowledge distillation which is a\nmodel compression technique training a compact student model with the knowledge\ntransferred from a pre-trained large teacher model. Recent work has shown that\ntransferring knowledge from the teacher's intermediate layer significantly\nimproves the recommendation quality of the student. However, they transfer the\nknowledge of individual representation point-wise and thus have a limitation in\nthat primary information of RS lies in the relations in the representation\nspace. This paper proposes a new topology distillation approach that guides the\nstudent by transferring the topological structure built upon the relations in\nthe teacher space. We first observe that simply making the student learn the\nwhole topological structure is not always effective and even degrades the\nstudent's performance. We demonstrate that because the capacity of the student\nis highly limited compared to that of the teacher, learning the whole\ntopological structure is daunting for the student. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel method named Hierarchical Topology Distillation (HTD) which\ndistills the topology hierarchically to cope with the large capacity gap. Our\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors. We also provide\nin-depth analyses to ascertain the benefit of distilling the topology for RS.",

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a wide class of connectionist models for\ngraph processing. They perform an iterative message passing operation on each\nnode and its neighbors, to solve classification/ clustering tasks --- on some\nnodes or on the whole graph --- collecting all such messages, regardless of\ntheir order. Despite the differences among the various models belonging to this\nclass, most of them adopt the same computation scheme, based on a local\naggregation mechanism and, intuitively, the local computation framework is\nmainly responsible for the expressive power of GNNs. In this paper, we prove\nthat the Weisfeiler--Lehman test induces an equivalence relationship on the\ngraph nodes that exactly corresponds to the unfolding equivalence, defined on\nthe original GNN model. Therefore, the results on the expressive power of the\noriginal GNNs can be extended to general GNNs which, under mild conditions, can\nbe proved capable of approximating, in probability and up to any precision, any\nfunction on graphs that respects the unfolding equivalence.",

          "description": "Although the adoption rate of deep neural networks (DNNs) has tremendously\nincreased in recent years, a solution for their vulnerability against\nadversarial examples has not yet been found. As a result, substantial research\nefforts are dedicated to fix this weakness, with many studies typically using a\nsubset of source images to generate adversarial examples, treating every image\nin this subset as equal. We demonstrate that, in fact, not every source image\nis equally suited for this kind of assessment. To do so, we devise a\nlarge-scale model-to-model transferability scenario for which we meticulously\nanalyze the properties of adversarial examples, generated from every suitable\nsource image in ImageNet by making use of two of the most frequently deployed\nattacks. In this transferability scenario, which involves seven distinct DNN\nmodels, including the recently proposed vision transformers, we reveal that it\nis possible to have a difference of up to $12.5\\%$ in model-to-model\ntransferability success, $1.01$ in average $L_2$ perturbation, and $0.03$\n($8/225$) in average $L_{\\infty}$ perturbation when $1,000$ source images are\nsampled randomly among all suitable candidates. We then take one of the first\nsteps in evaluating the robustness of images used to create adversarial\nexamples, proposing a number of simple but effective methods to identify\nunsuitable source images, thus making it possible to mitigate extreme cases in\nexperimentation and support high-quality benchmarking.",

          "description": "Recently, linear regression models, such as EASE and SLIM, have shown to\noften produce rather competitive results against more sophisticated deep\nlearning models. On the other side, the (weighted) matrix factorization\napproaches have been popular choices for recommendation in the past and widely\nadopted in the industry. In this work, we aim to theoretically understand the\nrelationship between these two approaches, which are the cornerstones of\nmodel-based recommendations. Through the derivation and analysis of the\nclosed-form solutions for two basic regression and matrix factorization\napproaches, we found these two approaches are indeed inherently related but\nalso diverge in how they \"scale-down\" the singular values of the original\nuser-item interaction matrix. This analysis also helps resolve the questions\nrelated to the regularization parameter range and model complexities. We\nfurther introduce a new learning algorithm in searching (hyper)parameters for\nthe closed-form solution and utilize it to discover the nearby models of the\nexisting solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the basic models\nand their closed-form solutions are indeed quite competitive against the\nstate-of-the-art models, thus, confirming the validity of studying the basic\nmodels.

Compared to\ntraditional \"test-time\" defenses, these defense mechanisms \"dynamically\nretrain\" the model based on test time input via transductive learning; and\ntheoretically, attacking these defenses boils down to bilevel optimization,\nwhich seems to raise the difficulty for adaptive attacks. In this paper, we\nfirst formalize and analyze modeling aspects of transductive robustness. Then,\nwe propose the principle of attacking model space for solving bilevel attack\nobjectives, and present an instantiation of the principle which breaks previous\ntransductive defenses. These attacks thus point to significant difficulties in\nthe use of transductive learning to improve adversarial robustness.

          "description": "Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to improve the generalization of several\nrelated tasks by learning them jointly. As a comparison, in addition to the\njoint training scheme, modern meta-learning allows unseen tasks with limited\nlabels during the test phase, in the hope of fast adaptation over them. Despite\nthe subtle difference between MTL and meta-learning in the problem formulation,\nboth learning paradigms share the same insight that the shared structure\nbetween existing training tasks could lead to better generalization and\nadaptation. In this paper, we take one important step further to understand the\nclose connection between these two learning paradigms, through both theoretical\nanalysis and empirical investigation. Theoretically, we first demonstrate that\nMTL shares the same optimization formulation with a class of gradient-based\nmeta-learning (GBML) algorithms. We then prove that for over-parameterized\nneural networks with sufficient depth, the learned predictive functions of MTL\nand GBML are close. In particular, this result implies that the predictions\ngiven by these two models are similar over the same unseen task. Empirically,\nwe corroborate our theoretical findings by showing that, with proper\nimplementation, MTL is competitive against state-of-the-art GBML algorithms on\na set of few-shot image classification benchmarks. Since existing GBML\nalgorithms often involve costly second-order bi-level optimization, our\nfirst-order MTL method is an order of magnitude faster on large-scale datasets\nsuch as mini-ImageNet. We believe this work could help bridge the gap between\nthese two learning paradigms, and provide a computationally efficient\nalternative to GBML that also supports fast task adaptation.",

          "description": "Recent development of Deep Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated superior\nperformance of neural networks in solving challenging problems with large or\neven continuous state spaces. One specific approach is to deploy neural\nnetworks to approximate value functions by minimising the Mean Squared Bellman\nError function. Despite great successes of Deep Reinforcement Learning,\ndevelopment of reliable and efficient numerical algorithms to minimise the\nBellman Error is still of great scientific interest and practical demand. Such\na challenge is partially due to the underlying optimisation problem being\nhighly non-convex or using incorrect gradient information as done in\nSemi-Gradient algorithms. In this work, we analyse the Mean Squared Bellman\nError from a smooth optimisation perspective combined with a Residual Gradient\nformulation. Our contribution is two-fold.\n\nFirst, we analyse critical points of the error function and provide technical\ninsights on the optimisation procure and design choices for neural networks.\nWhen the existence of global minima is assumed and the objective fulfils\ncertain conditions we can eliminate suboptimal local minima when using\nover-parametrised neural networks. We can construct an efficient Approximate\nNewton's algorithm based on our analysis and confirm theoretical properties of\nthis algorithm such as being locally quadratically convergent to a global\nminimum numerically.\n\nSecond, we demonstrate feasibility and generalisation capabilities of the\nproposed algorithm empirically using continuous control problems and provide a\nnumerical verification of our critical point analysis. We outline the short\ncoming of Semi-Gradients. To benefit from an approximate Newton's algorithm\ncomplete derivatives of the Mean Squared Bellman error must be considered\nduring training.",

In this paper, we\nstudy the problem of graph data augmentation for Graph Convolutional Network\n(GCN) in the context of improving the node embeddings for semi-supervised node\nclassification. Specifically, we conduct cosine similarity based cross\noperation on the original features to create new graph features, including new\nnode attributes and new graph topologies, and we combine them as new pairwise\ninputs for specific GCNs. Then, we propose an attentional integrating model to\nweighted sum the hidden node embeddings encoded by these GCNs into the final\nnode embeddings. We also conduct a disparity constraint on these hidden node\nembeddings when training to ensure that non-redundant information is captured\nfrom different features.

We further propose MIDAS-F, to solve the problem by\nwhich anomalies are incorporated into the algorithm's internal states, creating\na `poisoning' effect that can allow future anomalies to slip through\nundetected.

          "description": "Deep generative models such as GANs have driven impressive advances in\nconditional image synthesis in recent years. A persistent challenge has been to\ngenerate diverse versions of output images from the same input image, due to\nthe problem of mode collapse: because only one ground truth output image is\ngiven per input image, only one mode of the conditional distribution is\nmodelled. In this paper, we focus on this problem of multimodal conditional\nimage synthesis and build on the recently proposed technique of Implicit\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE). Prior IMLE-based methods required\ndifferent architectures for different tasks, which limit their applicability,\nand were lacking in fine details in the generated images. We propose CAM-Net, a\nunified architecture that can be applied to a broad range of tasks.\nAdditionally, it is capable of generating convincing high frequency details,\nachieving a reduction of the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by up to 45.3%\ncompared to the baseline.",

          "description": "Much work has been done recently to make neural networks more interpretable,\nand one obvious approach is to arrange for the network to use only a subset of\nthe available features. In linear models, Lasso (or $\\ell_1$-regularized)\nregression assigns zero weights to the most irrelevant or redundant features,\nand is widely used in data science. However the Lasso only applies to linear\nmodels. Here we introduce LassoNet, a neural network framework with global\nfeature selection. Our approach enforces a hierarchy: specifically a feature\ncan participate in a hidden unit only if its linear representative is active.\nUnlike other approaches to feature selection for neural nets, our method uses a\nmodified objective function with constraints, and so integrates feature\nselection with the parameter learning directly. As a result, it delivers an\nentire regularization path of solutions with a range of feature sparsity. On\nsystematic experiments, LassoNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods for feature selection and regression. The LassoNet method uses\nprojected proximal gradient descent, and generalizes directly to deep networks.\nIt can be implemented by adding just a few lines of code to a standard neural\nnetwork.",

Towards formally\nexplaining such structures of the Hessian, we show that the new eigenspace\nstructure can be explained by approximating the Hessian using Kronecker\nfactorization; we also prove the low rank structure for random data at random\ninitialization for over-parametrized two-layer neural nets.

          "description": "Variational autoencoders have been widely applied for natural language\ngeneration, however, there are two long-standing problems: information\nunder-representation and posterior collapse. The former arises from the fact\nthat only the last hidden state from the encoder is transformed to the latent\nspace, which is insufficient to summarize data. The latter comes as a result of\nthe imbalanced scale between the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence in\nthe objective function. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose the\ndiscrete variational attention model with categorical distribution over the\nattention mechanism owing to the discrete nature in languages. Our approach is\ncombined with an auto-regressive prior to capture the sequential dependency\nfrom observations, which can enhance the latent space for language generation.\nMoreover, thanks to the property of discreteness, the training of our proposed\napproach does not suffer from posterior collapse. Furthermore, we carefully\nanalyze the superiority of discrete latent space over the continuous space with\nthe common Gaussian distribution.

          "description": "This paper proposes a Lasso-type estimator for a high-dimensional sparse\nparameter identified by a single index conditional moment restriction (CMR). In\naddition to this parameter, the moment function can also depend on a nuisance\nfunction, such as the propensity score or the conditional choice probability,\nwhich we estimate by modern machine learning tools. We first adjust the moment\nfunction so that the gradient of the future loss function is insensitive\n(formally, Neyman-orthogonal) with respect to the first-stage regularization\nbias, preserving the single index property. We then take the loss function to\nbe an indefinite integral of the adjusted moment function with respect to the\nsingle index. The proposed Lasso estimator converges at the oracle rate, where\nthe oracle knows the nuisance function and solves only the parametric problem.\nWe demonstrate our method by estimating the short-term heterogeneous impact of\nConnecticut's Jobs First welfare reform experiment on women's welfare\nparticipation decision.",

          "description": "We introduce a novel perspective on Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL);\nwhereas existing approaches infer a posterior over the transition distribution\nor Q-function, we characterise the uncertainty in the Bellman operator. Our\nBayesian Bellman operator (BBO) framework is motivated by the insight that when\nbootstrapping is introduced, model-free approaches actually infer a posterior\nover Bellman operators, not value functions. In this paper, we use BBO to\nprovide a rigorous theoretical analysis of model-free Bayesian RL to better\nunderstand its relationshipto established frequentist RL methodologies. We\nprove that Bayesian solutions are consistent with frequentist RL solutions,\neven when approximate inference isused, and derive conditions for which\nconvergence properties hold. Empirically, we demonstrate that algorithms\nderived from the BBO framework have sophisticated deep exploration properties\nthat enable them to solve continuous control tasks at which state-of-the-art\nregularised actor-critic algorithms fail catastrophically",

          "description": "We analyze (stochastic) gradient descent (SGD) with delayed updates on smooth\nquasi-convex and non-convex functions and derive concise, non-asymptotic,\nconvergence rates. We show that the rate of convergence in all cases consists\nof two terms: (i) a stochastic term which is not affected by the delay, and\n(ii) a higher order deterministic term which is only linearly slowed down by\nthe delay. Thus, in the presence of noise, the effects of the delay become\nnegligible after a few iterations and the algorithm converges at the same\noptimal rate as standard SGD. This result extends a line of research that\nshowed similar results in the asymptotic regime or for strongly-convex\nquadratic functions only. We further show similar results for SGD with more\nintricate form of delayed gradients---compressed gradients under error\ncompensation and for local~SGD where multiple workers perform local steps\nbefore communicating with each other. In all of these settings, we improve upon\nthe best known rates. These results show that SGD is robust to compressed\nand/or delayed stochastic gradient updates.

We propose a novel definition of this direction as the\ndirection of the vector pointing toward the closest point of the support of the\nclosest inaccurate class in decision space. To evaluate the alignment with this\ndirection after adversarial training, we apply a metric that uses generative\nadversarial networks to produce the smallest residual needed to change the\nclass present in the image.

Here, we prove rigorously that, indeed,\nthe Bayes-optimal prediction and inference of randomly but continuously\ntransforming environments, a common natural setting, relies on short-term\nspike-timing-dependent plasticity, a hallmark of biological synapses. Further,\nthis dynamic Bayesian inference through plasticity enables circuits of the\ncerebral cortex in simulations to recognize previously unseen, highly distorted\ndynamic stimuli. Strikingly, this also introduces a biologically-modelled AI,\nthe first to overcome multiple limitations of deep learning and outperform\nartificial neural networks in a visual task.

Such systems may\nbehave chaotically under certain conditions, and so the ability to detect chaos\nbased on empirical measurement is an important step in characterizing and\npredicting these processes. Classifying a system as chaotic usually requires\nestimating its largest Lyapunov exponent, which quantifies the average rate of\nconvergence or divergence of initially close trajectories in state space, and\nfor which a positive value is generally accepted as an operational definition\nof chaos. Estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent from observations of a\nprocess is especially challenging in systems affected by dynamical noise, which\nis the case for many models of real-world processes, in particular models of\nbiological systems. We describe a novel method for estimating the largest\nLyapunov exponent from data, based on training Deep Learning models on\nsynthetically generated trajectories, and demonstrate that this method yields\naccurate and noise-robust predictions given relatively short inputs and across\na range of different dynamical systems. Our method is unique in that it can\nanalyze tree-shaped data, a ubiquitous topology in biological settings, and\nspecifically in dynamics over lineages of cells or organisms. We also\ncharacterize the types of input information extracted by our models for their\npredictions, allowing for a deeper understanding into the different ways by\nwhich chaos can be analyzed in different topologies.",

          "description": "Training sparse networks to converge to the same performance as dense neural\narchitectures has proven to be elusive. Recent work suggests that\ninitialization is the key. However, while this direction of research has had\nsome success, focusing on initialization alone appears to be inadequate. In\nthis paper, we take a broader view of training sparse networks and consider the\nrole of regularization, optimization, and architecture choices on sparse\nmodels. We propose a simple experimental framework, Same Capacity Sparse vs\nDense Comparison (SC-SDC), that allows for a fair comparison of sparse and\ndense networks. Furthermore, we propose a new measure of gradient flow,\nEffective Gradient Flow (EGF), that better correlates to performance in sparse\nnetworks. Using top-line metrics, SC-SDC and EGF, we show that default choices\nof optimizers, activation functions and regularizers used for dense networks\ncan disadvantage sparse networks. Based upon these findings, we show that\ngradient flow in sparse networks can be improved by reconsidering aspects of\nthe architecture design and the training regime. Our work suggests that\ninitialization is only one piece of the puzzle and taking a wider view of\ntailoring optimization to sparse networks yields promising results.",

Often,\nabsolute distance measurements are often unreliable or simply unavailable and\nonly proxies to absolute distances in the form of similarities are available.\nHence we ask the following: Given only \\emph{comparisons} of similarities\namongst a set of entities, what can be said about the geometry of the\nunderlying space form? To study this question, we introduce the notions of the\n\\textit{ordinal capacity} of a target space form and \\emph{ordinal spread} of\nthe similarity measurements. The latter is an indicator of complex patterns in\nthe measurements, while the former quantifies the capacity of a space form to\naccommodate a set of measurements with a specific ordinal spread profile. We\nprove that the ordinal capacity of a space form is related to its dimension and\nthe sign of its curvature. This leads to a lower bound on the Euclidean and\nspherical embedding dimension of what we term similarity graphs. More\nimportantly, we show that the statistical behavior of the ordinal spread random\nvariables defined on a similarity graph can be used to identify its underlying\nspace form. We support our theoretical claims with experiments on weighted\ntrees, single-cell RNA expression data and spherical cartographic measurements.",

          "description": "Weak supervision has shown promising results in many natural language\nprocessing tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Existing work mainly\nfocuses on learning deep NER models only with weak supervision, i.e., without\nany human annotation, and shows that by merely using weakly labeled data, one\ncan achieve good performance, though still underperforms fully supervised NER\nwith manually/strongly labeled data. In this paper, we consider a more\npractical scenario, where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data\nand a large amount of weakly labeled data. Unfortunately, we observe that\nweakly labeled data does not necessarily improve, or even deteriorate the model\nperformance (due to the extensive noise in the weak labels) when we train deep\nNER models over a simple or weighted combination of the strongly labeled and\nweakly labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-stage\ncomputational framework -- NEEDLE with three essential ingredients: (1) weak\nlabel completion, (2) noise-aware loss function, and (3) final fine-tuning over\nthe strongly labeled data. Through experiments on E-commerce query NER and\nBiomedical NER, we demonstrate that NEEDLE can effectively suppress the noise\nof the weak labels and outperforms existing methods. In particular, we achieve\nnew SOTA F1-scores on 3 Biomedical NER datasets: BC5CDR-chem 93.74,\nBC5CDR-disease 90.69, NCBI-disease 92.28.",

However, the exact tradeoff between fairness and accuracy with a\nreal-valued target is not clear. In this paper, we characterize the inherent\ntradeoff between statistical parity and accuracy in the regression setting by\nproviding a lower bound on the error of any fair regressor. Our lower bound is\nsharp, algorithm-independent, and admits a simple interpretation: when the\nmoments of the target differ between groups, any fair algorithm has to make a\nlarge error on at least one of the groups. We further extend this result to\ngive a lower bound on the joint error of any (approximately) fair algorithm,\nusing the Wasserstein distance to measure the quality of the approximation. On\nthe upside, we establish the first connection between individual fairness,\naccuracy parity, and the Wasserstein distance by showing that if a regressor is\nindividually fair, it also approximately verifies the accuracy parity, where\nthe gap is given by the Wasserstein distance between the two groups. Inspired\nby our theoretical results, we develop a practical algorithm for fair\nregression through the lens of representation learning, and conduct experiments\non a real-world dataset to corroborate our findings.",

          "description": "The simultaneous rise of machine learning as a service and concerns over user\nprivacy have increasingly motivated the need for private inference (PI). While\nrecent work demonstrates PI is possible using cryptographic primitives, the\ncomputational overheads render it impractical. The community is largely\nunprepared to address these overheads, as the source of slowdown in PI stems\nfrom the ReLU operator whereas optimizations for plaintext inference focus on\noptimizing FLOPs. In this paper we re-think the ReLU computation and propose\noptimizations for PI tailored to properties of neural networks. Specifically,\nwe reformulate ReLU as an approximate sign test and introduce a novel\ntruncation method for the sign test that significantly reduces the cost per\nReLU. These optimizations result in a specific type of stochastic ReLU. The key\nobservation is that the stochastic fault behavior is well suited for the\nfault-tolerant properties of neural network inference. Thus, we provide\nsignificant savings without impacting accuracy. We collectively call the\noptimizations Circa and demonstrate improvements of up to 4.7x storage and 3x\nruntime over baseline implementations; we further show that Circa can be used\non top of recent PI optimizations to obtain 1.8x additional speedup.",

Previous works\non memory mechanisms show benefits of using episodic-based data structures for\ndiscrete action problems in terms of sample-efficiency. The application of\nepisodic memory for continuous control with a large action space is not\ntrivial. Our study aims to answer the question: can episodic memory be used to\nimprove agent's performance in continuous control? Our proposed algorithm\ncombines episodic memory with Actor-Critic architecture by modifying critic's\nobjective. We further improve performance by introducing episodic-based replay\nbuffer prioritization. We evaluate our algorithm on OpenAI gym domains and show\ngreater sample-efficiency compared with the state-of-the art model-free\noff-policy algorithms.",

          "description": "In this paper, we present a novel method to constrain invexity on Neural\nNetworks (NN). Invex functions ensure every stationary point is global minima.\nHence, gradient descent commenced from any point will lead to the global\nminima. Another advantage of invexity on NN is to divide data space locally\ninto two connected sets with a highly non-linear decision boundary by simply\nthresholding the output. To this end, we formulate a universal invex function\napproximator and employ it to enforce invexity in NN. We call it Input Invex\nNeural Networks (II-NN). We first fit data with a known invex function,\nfollowed by modification with a NN, compare the direction of the gradient and\npenalize the direction of gradient on NN if it contradicts with the direction\nof reference invex function. In order to penalize the direction of the gradient\nwe perform Gradient Clipped Gradient Penalty (GC-GP). We applied our method to\nthe existing NNs for both image classification and regression tasks. From the\nextensive empirical and qualitative experiments, we observe that our method\ngives the performance similar to ordinary NN yet having invexity. Our method\noutperforms linear NN and Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN) with a large\nmargin. We publish our code and implementation details at github.",

In large dimension,\nthe probability of reaching a reward vanishes and the agent receives little\nlearning signal. Methods such as Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) tackle this\nissue by also learning from realized but unplanned-for goals. But HER is known\nto introduce bias, and can converge to low-return policies by overestimating\nchancy outcomes. First, we vindicate HER by proving that it is actually\nunbiased in deterministic environments, such as many optimal control settings.\nNext, for stochastic environments in continuous spaces, we tackle sparse\nrewards by directly taking the infinitely sparse reward limit. We fully\nformalize the problem of multi-goal RL with infinitely sparse Dirac rewards at\neach goal.

In order to avoid training two separate models, we show that it is\npossible to train neural networks in such a way that a predefined 'core'\nsubnetwork can be split-off from the trained full network with remarkable good\nperformance. We extend on prior methods that focused only on core networks of\nsmaller width, while we focus on supporting arbitrary core network\narchitectures. Our proposed training scheme switches consecutively between\noptimizing only the core part of the network and the full one. The accuracy of\nthe full model remains comparable, while the core network achieves better\nperformance than when it is trained in isolation.

Two major components of prosody are pitch\nand rhythm. Disentangling the prosody information, particularly the rhythm\ncomponent, from the speech is challenging because it involves breaking the\nsynchrony between the input speech and the disentangled speech representation.\nAs a result, most existing prosody style transfer algorithms would need to rely\non some form of text transcriptions to identify the content information, which\nconfines their application to high-resource languages only. Recently,\nSpeechSplit has made sizeable progress towards unsupervised prosody style\ntransfer, but it is unable to extract high-level global prosody style in an\nunsupervised manner. In this paper, we propose AutoPST, which can disentangle\nglobal prosody style from speech without relying on any text transcriptions.\nAutoPST is an Autoencoder-based Prosody Style Transfer framework with a\nthorough rhythm removal module guided by the self-expressive representation\nlearning.

          "description": "Language is an interface to the outside world. In order for embodied agents\nto use it, language must be grounded in other, sensorimotor modalities. While\nthere is an extended literature studying how machines can learn grounded\nlanguage, the topic of how to learn spatio-temporal linguistic concepts is\nstill largely uncharted. To make progress in this direction, we here introduce\na novel spatio-temporal language grounding task where the goal is to learn the\nmeaning of spatio-temporal descriptions of behavioral traces of an embodied\nagent. This is achieved by training a truth function that predicts if a\ndescription matches a given history of observations. The descriptions involve\ntime-extended predicates in past and present tense as well as spatio-temporal\nreferences to objects in the scene. To study the role of architectural biases\nin this task, we train several models including multimodal Transformer\narchitectures; the latter implement different attention computations between\nwords and objects across space and time. We test models on two classes of\ngeneralization: 1) generalization to randomly held-out sentences; 2)\ngeneralization to grammar primitives. We observe that maintaining object\nidentity in the attention computation of our Transformers is instrumental to\nachieving good performance on generalization overall, and that summarizing\nobject traces in a single token has little influence on performance. We then\ndiscuss how this opens new perspectives for language-guided autonomous embodied\nagents. We also release our code under open-source license as well as\npretrained models and datasets to encourage the wider community to build upon\nand extend our work in the future.",

          "description": "Predicting the future motion of multiple agents is necessary for planning in\ndynamic environments. This task is challenging for autonomous driving since\nagents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) and their associated behaviors may be\ndiverse and influence each other. Most prior work has focused on first\npredicting independent futures for each agent based on all past motion, and\nthen planning against these independent predictions. However, planning against\nfixed predictions can suffer from the inability to represent the future\ninteraction possibilities between different agents, leading to sub-optimal\nplanning. In this work, we formulate a model for predicting the behavior of all\nagents jointly in real-world driving environments in a unified manner. Inspired\nby recent language modeling approaches, we use a masking strategy as the query\nto our model, enabling one to invoke a single model to predict agent behavior\nin many ways, such as potentially conditioned on the goal or full future\ntrajectory of the autonomous vehicle or the behavior of other agents in the\nenvironment. Our model architecture fuses heterogeneous world state in a\nunified Transformer architecture by employing attention across road elements,\nagent interactions and time steps. We evaluate our approach on autonomous\ndriving datasets for behavior prediction, and achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance. Our work demonstrates that formulating the problem of behavior\nprediction in a unified architecture with a masking strategy may allow us to\nhave a single model that can perform multiple motion prediction and planning\nrelated tasks effectively.",

Integration of BSR\noperations enables the TVM runtime execution to leverage structured pattern\nsparsity induced by model regularization.\n\nThis integrated view of pruning algorithms enables us to study relationships\nbetween modeling decisions and their direct impact on sparsity-enhanced\nexecution. Our main findings are: 1) we validate that performance benefits of\nstructured sparsity block regularization must be enabled by the BSR\naugmentations to TVM, with 4x speedup relative to vanilla PyTorch and 2.2x\nspeedup relative to standard TVM compilation (without expanded BSR support). 2)\nfor BERT attention weights, the end-to-end optimal block sparsity shape in this\nCPU inference context is not a square block (as in \\cite{gray2017gpu}) but\nrather a linear 32x1 block 3) the relationship between performance and block\nsize / shape is is suggestive of how model regularization parameters interact\nwith task scheduler optimizations resulting in the observed end-to-end\nperformance.",

          "description": "The planning of attractive and cost efficient public transport systems is a\nhighly complex optimization process involving many steps. Integrating\nrobustness from a passenger's point of view makes the task even more\nchallenging. With numerous different definitions of robustness in literature, a\nreal-world acceptable evaluation of the robustness of a public transport system\nis to simulate its performance under a large number of possible scenarios.\nUnfortunately, this is computationally very expensive. In this paper, we\ntherefore explore a new way of such a scenario-based robustness approximation\nby using methods from machine learning. We achieve a fast approach with a very\nhigh accuracy by gathering a subset of key features of a public transport\nsystem and its passenger demand and training an artificial neural network to\nlearn the outcome of a given set of robustness tests. The network is then able\nto predict the robustness of untrained instances with high accuracy using only\nits key features, allowing for a robustness oracle for transport planners that\napproximates the robustness in constant time. Such an oracle can be used as\nblack box to increase the robustness within a local search framework for\nintegrated public transportation planning. In computational experiments with\ndifferent benchmark instances we demonstrate an excellent quality of our\npredictions.",

          "description": "Reinforcement learning is made much more complex when the agent's observation\nis partial or noisy. This case corresponds to a partially observable Markov\ndecision process (POMDP). One strategy to seek good performance in POMDPs is to\nendow the agent with a finite memory, whose update is governed by the policy.\nHowever, policy optimization is non-convex in that case and can lead to poor\ntraining performance for random initialization. The performance can be\nempirically improved by constraining the memory architecture, then sacrificing\noptimality to facilitate training. Here we study this trade-off in the two-arm\nbandit problem, and compare two extreme cases: (i) the random access memory\nwhere any transitions between $M$ memory states are allowed and (ii) a fixed\nmemory where the agent can access its last $m$ actions and rewards. For (i),\nthe probability $q$ to play the worst arm is known to be exponentially small in\n$M$ for the optimal policy. Our main result is to show that similar performance\ncan be reached for (ii) as well, despite the simplicity of the memory\narchitecture: using a conjecture on Gray-ordered binary necklaces, we find\npolicies for which $q$ is exponentially small in $2^m$ i.e. $q\\sim\\alpha^{2^m}$\nfor some $\\alpha < 1$. Interestingly, we observe empirically that training from\nrandom initialization leads to very poor results for (i), and significantly\nbetter results for (ii).",

The latter is a long-standing\nproblem during the training of VAEs as the optimization is trapped to a\ndisastrous local optimum. In this paper, we propose Discrete Auto-regressive\nVariational Attention Model (DAVAM) to address the challenges.

Using heuristic methods from physics, we find in the\nridgeless case that locality is key in determining the learning curve exponent\n$\\beta$ (that relates the test error $\\epsilon_t\\sim P^{-\\beta}$ to the size of\nthe training set $P$), whereas translational invariance is not. In particular,\nif the filter size of the teacher $t$ is smaller than that of the student $s$,\n$\\beta$ is a function of $s$ only and does not depend on the input dimension.\nWe confirm our predictions on $\\beta$ empirically. Theoretically, in some cases\n(including when teacher and student are equal) it can be shown that this\nprediction is an upper bound on performance.

          "description": "The training of deep learning models poses vast challenges of including\nparameter tuning and ordering of training data. Significant research has been\ndone in Curriculum learning for optimizing the sequence of training data.\nRecent works have focused on using complex reinforcement learning techniques to\nfind the optimal data ordering strategy to maximize learning for a given\nnetwork. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient technique based on\ncontinuous optimization. We call this new approach Training Sequence\nOptimization (TSO). There are three critical components in our proposed\napproach: (a) An encoder network maps/embeds training sequence into continuous\nspace. (b) A predictor network uses the continuous representation of a strategy\nas input and predicts the accuracy for fixed network architecture. (c) A\ndecoder further maps a continuous representation of a strategy to the ordered\ntraining dataset. The performance predictor and encoder enable us to perform\ngradient-based optimization in the continuous space to find the embedding of\noptimal training data ordering with potentially better accuracy. Experiments\nshow that we can gain 2AP with our generated optimal curriculum strategy over\nthe random strategy using the CIFAR-100 dataset and have better boosts than the\nstate of the art CL algorithms. We do an ablation study varying the\narchitecture, dataset and sample sizes showcasing our approach's robustness.",

          "description": "A variety of dimensionality reduction techniques have been applied for\ncomputations involving large matrices. The underlying matrix is randomly\ncompressed into a smaller one, while approximately retaining many of its\noriginal properties. As a result, much of the expensive computation can be\nperformed on the small matrix. The sketching of positive semidefinite (PSD)\nmatrices is well understood, but there are many applications where the related\nmatrices are not PSD, including Hessian matrices in non-convex optimization and\ncovariance matrices in regression applications involving complex numbers. In\nthis paper, we present novel dimensionality reduction methods for non-PSD\nmatrices, as well as their ``square-roots\", which involve matrices with complex\nentries. We show how these techniques can be used for multiple downstream\ntasks. In particular, we show how to use the proposed matrix sketching\ntechniques for both convex and non-convex optimization, $\\ell_p$-regression for\nevery $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$, and vector-matrix-vector queries.",

Instead of directly comparing the weights, activations, or outputs\nof two models, we compare their behavioral patterns on the same set of test\ninputs. Specifically, the behavioral pattern of a model is represented as a\ndecision distance vector (DDV), in which each element is the distance between\nthe model's reactions to a pair of inputs. The knowledge similarity between two\nmodels is measured with the cosine similarity between their DDVs. To evaluate\nModelDiff, we created a benchmark that contains 144 pairs of models that cover\nmost popular model reuse methods, including transfer learning, model\ncompression, and model stealing. Our method achieved 91.7% correctness on the\nbenchmark, which demonstrates the effectiveness of using ModelDiff for model\nreuse detection.

We provide\nevidence that demonstrates that learning of features in the synthetic domain by\na stereo matching network is heavily influenced by two \"shortcuts\" presented in\nthe synthetic data: (1) identical local statistics (RGB colour features)\nbetween matching pixels in the synthetic stereo images and (2) lack of realism\nin synthetic textures on 3D objects simulated in game engines.

While traditionally thought of as an aspect of over-training, recent\nwork suggests that the memorization risk manifests especially strongly when the\ntraining datasets are noisy and memorization is the only recourse.\nUnfortunately, most code intelligence tasks rely on rather noise-prone and\nrepetitive data sources, such as GitHub, which, due to their sheer size, cannot\nbe manually inspected and evaluated. We evaluate the memorization and\ngeneralization tendencies in neural code intelligence models through a case\nstudy across several benchmarks and model families by leveraging established\napproaches from other fields that use DNNs, such as introducing targeted noise\ninto the training dataset.

Vanilla NAS\nevaluates each architecture by training from scratch, which gives the true\nperformance but is extremely time-consuming.

However, the performance estimation can be\nvery inaccurate due to the co-adaption among operations. In this paper, we\npropose few-shot NAS that uses multiple supernetworks, called sub-supernet,\neach covering different regions of the search space to alleviate the undesired\nco-adaption. Compared to one-shot NAS, few-shot NAS improves the accuracy of\narchitecture evaluation with a small increase of evaluation cost. With only up\nto 7 sub-supernets, few-shot NAS establishes new SoTAs: on ImageNet, it finds\nmodels that reach 80.5% top-1 accuracy at 600 MB FLOPS and 77.5% top-1 accuracy\nat 238 MFLOPS; on CIFAR10, it reaches 98.72% top-1 accuracy without using extra\ndata or transfer learning.

Few studies have tackled this\nchallenging problem from a machine learning point-of-view due to a shortage of\nhigh-resolution datasets with many historical observations globally. In this\npaper, we present a novel satellite-based dataset called ``CloudCast''. It\nconsists of 70,080 images with 10 different cloud types for multiple layers of\nthe atmosphere annotated on a pixel level. The spatial resolution of the\ndataset is 928 x 1530 pixels (3x3 km per pixel) with 15-min intervals between\nframes for the period 2017-01-01 to 2018-12-31. All frames are centered and\nprojected over Europe. To supplement the dataset, we conduct an evaluation\nstudy with current state-of-the-art video prediction methods such as\nconvolutional long short-term memory networks, generative adversarial networks,\nand optical flow-based extrapolation methods. As the evaluation of video\nprediction is difficult in practice, we aim for a thorough evaluation in the\nspatial and temporal domain. Our benchmark models show promising results but\nwith ample room for improvement. This is the first publicly available\nglobal-scale dataset with high-resolution cloud types on a high temporal\ngranularity to the authors' best knowledge.",

          "description": "In design, fabrication, and control problems, we are often faced with the\ntask of synthesis, in which we must generate an object or configuration that\nsatisfies a set of constraints while maximizing one or more objective\nfunctions. The synthesis problem is typically characterized by a physical\nprocess in which many different realizations may achieve the goal. This\nmany-to-one map presents challenges to the supervised learning of feed-forward\nsynthesis, as the set of viable designs may have a complex structure. In\naddition, the non-differentiable nature of many physical simulations prevents\ndirect optimization. We address both of these problems with a two-stage neural\nnetwork architecture that we may consider to be an autoencoder. We first learn\nthe decoder: a differentiable surrogate that approximates the many-to-one\nphysical realization process. We then learn the encoder, which maps from goal\nto design, while using the fixed decoder to evaluate the quality of the\nrealization. We evaluate the approach on two case studies: extruder path\nplanning in additive manufacturing and constrained soft robot inverse\nkinematics. We compare our approach to direct optimization of design using the\nlearned surrogate, and to supervised learning of the synthesis problem. We find\nthat our approach produces higher quality solutions than supervised learning,\nwhile being competitive in quality with direct optimization, at a greatly\nreduced computational cost.",

          "description": "Tabular data are ubiquitous for the widespread applications of tables and\nhence have attracted the attention of researchers to extract underlying\ninformation. One of the critical problems in mining tabular data is how to\nunderstand their inherent semantic structures automatically. Existing studies\ntypically adopt Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to model the spatial\ninformation of tabular structures yet ignore more diverse relational\ninformation between cells, such as the hierarchical and paratactic\nrelationships. To simultaneously extract spatial and relational information\nfrom tables, we propose a novel neural network architecture, TabularNet. The\nspatial encoder of TabularNet utilizes the row/column-level Pooling and the\nBidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) to capture statistical information\nand local positional correlation, respectively. For relational information, we\ndesign a new graph construction method based on the WordNet tree and adopt a\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) based encoder that focuses on the\nhierarchical and paratactic relationships between cells. Our neural network\narchitecture can be a unified neural backbone for different understanding tasks\nand utilized in a multitask scenario. We conduct extensive experiments on three\nclassification tasks with two real-world spreadsheet data sets, and the results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TabularNet over state-of-the-art\nbaselines.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of minimizing regret in an $N$ agent heterogeneous\nstochastic linear bandits framework, where the agents (users) are similar but\nnot all identical. We model user heterogeneity using two popularly used ideas\nin practice; (i) A clustering framework where users are partitioned into groups\nwith users in the same group being identical to each other, but different\nacross groups, and (ii) a personalization framework where no two users are\nnecessarily identical, but a user's parameters are close to that of the\npopulation average. In the clustered users' setup, we propose a novel\nalgorithm, based on successive refinement of cluster identities and regret\nminimization. We show that, for any agent, the regret scales as\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T/N})$, if the agent is in a `well separated' cluster, or\nscales as $\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{1}{2} + \\varepsilon}/(N)^{\\frac{1}{2}\n-\\varepsilon})$ if its cluster is not well separated, where $\\varepsilon$ is\npositive and arbitrarily close to $0$. Our algorithm is adaptive to the cluster\nseparation, and is parameter free -- it does not need to know the number of\nclusters, separation and cluster size, yet the regret guarantee adapts to the\ninherent complexity. In the personalization framework, we introduce a natural\nalgorithm where, the personal bandit instances are initialized with the\nestimates of the global average model. We show that, an agent $i$ whose\nparameter deviates from the population average by $\\epsilon_i$, attains a\nregret scaling of $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon_i\\sqrt{T})$. This demonstrates that\nif the user representations are close (small $\\epsilon_i)$, the resulting\nregret is low, and vice-versa. The results are empirically validated and we\nobserve superior performance of our adaptive algorithms over non-adaptive\nbaselines.",

In this paper, we investigate the global structure of\nattention scores computed using this dot product mechanism on a typical\ndistribution of inputs, and study the principal components of their variation.\nThrough eigen analysis of full attention score matrices, as well as of their\nindividual rows, we find that most of the variation among attention scores lie\nin a low-dimensional eigenspace. Moreover, we find significant overlap between\nthese eigenspaces for different layers and even different transformer models.\nBased on this, we propose to compute scores only for a partial subset of token\npairs, and use them to estimate scores for the remaining pairs. Beyond\ninvestigating the accuracy of reconstructing attention scores themselves, we\ninvestigate training transformer models that employ these approximations, and\nanalyze the effect on overall accuracy.

          "description": "A driver's gaze is critical for determining their attention, state,\nsituational awareness, and readiness to take over control from partially\nautomated vehicles. Estimating the gaze direction is the most obvious way to\ngauge a driver's state under ideal conditions when limited to using\nnon-intrusive imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the vehicular environment\nintroduces a variety of challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh\nillumination, nighttime conditions, and reflective eyeglasses. Relying on head\npose alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable and erroneous. In\nthis study, we offer solutions to address these problems encountered in the\nreal world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate that using an\ninfrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization suffices. To\nhandle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we adopt image-to-image\ntranslation using generative adversarial networks to pre-process images prior\nto gaze estimation. Our proposed Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN) is\ntrained to preserve the driver's gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from\nface images. GPCycleGAN is based on the well-known CycleGAN approach - with the\naddition of a gaze classifier and a gaze consistency loss for additional\nsupervision.

While improving the\ndifferent components of these systems has been the focus of numerous studies,\nestimating the impact of such improvements on the revenue has been overlooked\nin the literature despite its practical importance. Indeed, quantifying the\nbenefit of a change in a system serves as support for investment decisions.\nThis is a challenging problem as it corresponds to the difference between the\ngenerated value and the value that would have been generated keeping the system\nas before. The latter is not observable. Moreover, the expected impact can be\nsmall in relative value. In this paper, we cast the problem as counterfactual\nprediction of unobserved revenue. The impact on revenue is then the difference\nbetween the observed and the estimated revenue. The originality of this work\nlies in the innovative application of econometric methods proposed for\nmacroeconomic applications to a new problem setting. Broadly applicable, the\napproach benefits from only requiring revenue data observed for\norigin-destination pairs in the network of the airline at each day, before and\nafter a change in the system is applied. We report results using real\nlarge-scale data from Air Canada. We compare a deep neural network\ncounterfactual predictions model with econometric models.

This one-step algorithm beats the previously reported\nresults of iterative algorithms on a large portion of the D4RL benchmark. The\nsimple one-step baseline achieves this strong performance without many of the\ntricks used by previously proposed iterative algorithms and is more robust to\nhyperparameters.

Separate DL models were trained on 70\\% of the processed data for\n\"Local\" protocols as well as 93 American College of Radiology (\"ACR\") protocols\nand 48 \"General\" protocols. The DL Models were assessed in an \"auto-protocoling\n(AP)\" inference mode which returns the top recommendation and in a \"clinical\ndecision support (CDS)\" inference mode which returns up to 10 protocols for\nradiologist review. The accuracy of each protocol recommendation was computed\nand analyzed based on the difference between the normalized output score of the\ncorresponding neural net for the top two recommendations.\n\nResults: The top predicted protocol in AP mode was correct for 82.8%, 73.8%,\nand 69.3% of the test cases for \"General\", \"ACR\", and \"Local\" protocol classes,\nrespectively. Higher levels of accuracy over 96% were obtained for all protocol\nclasses in CDS mode. However, at current validation performance levels, the\nproposed models offer modest, positive, financial impact on large-scale imaging\nnetworks.\n\nConclusions: DL-based protocol automation is feasible and can be tuned to\nroute substantial fractions of exams for auto-protocoling, with higher accuracy\nwith more general protocols. Economic analyses of the tested algorithms\nindicate that improved algorithm performance is required to yield a practical\nexam auto-protocoling tool for sub-specialized imaging exams.",

At the same time,\nshrinking profit margins in the energy markets let wind farm managers explore\noptions for cost reductions in the turbine operation and maintenance.\nSensor-based condition monitoring facilitates remote diagnostics of turbine\nsubsystems, enabling faster responses when unforeseen maintenance is required.\nCondition monitoring with data from the turbines' supervisory control and data\nacquisition (SCADA) systems was proposed and SCADA-based fault detection and\ndiagnosis approaches introduced based on single-task normal operation models of\nturbine state variables. As the number of SCADA channels has grown strongly,\nthousands of independent single-target models are in place today for monitoring\na single turbine. Multi-target learning was recently proposed to limit the\nnumber of models. This study applied multi-target neural networks to the task\nof early fault detection in drive-train components. The accuracy and delay of\ndetecting gear bearing faults were compared to state-of-the-art single-target\napproaches. We found that multi-target multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) detected\nfaults at least as early and in many cases earlier than single-target MLPs. The\nmulti-target MLPs could detect faults up to several days earlier than the\nsingle-target models. This can deliver a significant advantage in the planning\nand performance of maintenance work. At the same time, the multi-target MLPs\nachieved the same level of prediction stability.",

Since insurance is required for registering a car, obtaining a\nmortgage, and participating in certain businesses, it is especially important\nthat the models which price insurance policies are fair and non-discriminatory.\nBlack box models can make it very difficult to know which covariates are\ninfluencing the results. SHAP values enable interpretation of various black box\nmodels, but little progress has been made in two-part models. In this paper, we\npropose mSHAP (or multiplicative SHAP), a method for computing SHAP values of\ntwo-part models using the SHAP values of the individual models. This method\nwill allow for the predictions of two-part models to be explained at an\nindividual observation level. After developing mSHAP, we perform an in-depth\nsimulation study. Although the kernelSHAP algorithm is also capable of\ncomputing approximate SHAP values for a two-part model, a comparison with our\nmethod demonstrates that mSHAP is exponentially faster. Ultimately, we apply\nmSHAP to a two-part ratemaking model for personal auto property damage\ninsurance coverage.

This paper\nproposes PatchMix, a data augmentation method that creates new samples by\ncomposing patches from pairs of images in a grid-like pattern. These new\nsamples' ground truth labels are set as proportional to the number of patches\nfrom each image. We then add a set of additional losses at the patch-level to\nregularize and to encourage good representations at both the patch and image\nlevels. A ResNet-50 model trained on ImageNet using PatchMix exhibits superior\ntransfer learning capabilities across a wide array of benchmarks. Although\nPatchMix can rely on random pairings and random grid-like patterns for mixing,\nwe explore evolutionary search as a guiding strategy to discover optimal\ngrid-like patterns and image pairing jointly. For this purpose, we conceive a\nfitness function that bypasses the need to re-train a model to evaluate each\nchoice. In this way, PatchMix outperforms a base model on CIFAR-10 (+1.91),\nCIFAR-100 (+5.31), Tiny Imagenet (+3.52), and ImageNet (+1.16) by significant\nmargins, also outperforming previous state-of-the-art pairwise augmentation\nstrategies.",

In a market-driven context, current approaches\nto collect and analyze users feedback are based on techniques leveraging\ninformation extracted from product reviews and social media. These approaches\nare hardly applicable in bespoke software development, or in contexts in which\none needs to gather information from specific users. In such cases, companies\nneed to resort to face-to-face interviews to get feedback on their products. In\nthis paper, we propose to utilize biometric data, in terms of physiological and\nvoice features, to complement interviews with information about the engagement\nof the user on the discussed product-relevant topics. We evaluate our approach\nby interviewing users while gathering their physiological data (i.e.,\nbiofeedback) using an Empatica E4 wristband, and capturing their voice through\nthe default audio-recorder of a common laptop. Our results show that we can\npredict users' engagement by training supervised machine learning algorithms on\nbiometric data, and that voice features alone can be sufficiently effective.\nThe performance of the prediction algorithms is maximised when pre-processing\nthe training data with the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE).\nThe results of our work suggest that biofeedback and voice analysis can be used\nto facilitate prioritization of requirements oriented to product improvement,\nand to steer the interview based on users' engagement.

While there is a rich literature on VC, most proposed\nmethods are trained and evaluated on clean speech recordings. However, many\nacoustic environments are noisy and reverberant, severely restricting the\napplicability of popular VC methods to such scenarios. To address this\nlimitation, we propose Voicy, a new VC framework particularly tailored for\nnoisy speech. Our method, which is inspired by the de-noising auto-encoders\nframework, is comprised of four encoders (speaker, content, phonetic and\nacoustic-ASR) and one decoder. Importantly, Voicy is capable of performing\nnon-parallel zero-shot VC, an important requirement for any VC system that\nneeds to work on speakers not seen during training. We have validated our\napproach using a noisy reverberant version of the LibriSpeech dataset.\nExperimental results show that Voicy outperforms other tested VC techniques in\nterms of naturalness and target speaker similarity in noisy reverberant\nenvironments.",

The best-known previous result on $\\ell_2$ estimation error for\nthis problem is $O\\left( \\frac{s\\log\\left( {d}/{s}\\right)}{n2^b}\\right)$.\nSurprisingly, we show that when sample size $n$ exceeds a minimum threshold\n$n^*(s, d, b)$, we can achieve an $\\ell_2$ estimation error of $O\\left(\n\\frac{s}{n2^b}\\right)$. This implies that when $n>n^*(s, d, b)$ the convergence\nrate does not depend on the ambient dimension $d$ and is the same as knowing\nthe support of the distribution beforehand.\n\nWe next ask the question: ``what is the minimum $n^*(s, d, b)$ that allows\ndimension-free convergence?''. To upper bound $n^*(s, d, b)$, we develop novel\nlocalization schemes to accurately and efficiently localize the unknown\nsupport. For the non-interactive setting, we show that $n^*(s, d, b) = O\\left(\n\\min \\left( {d^2\\log^2 d}/{2^b}, {s^4\\log^2 d}/{2^b}\\right) \\right)$.

We label a system state to\nbe stable if it's immediate past and future states reside in the same regime.\nHowever, at a given time step we don't have the prior knowledge about whether\nsystem is in stable or unstable region. In this paper, we develop and train a\nfeed forward (multi-layer perceptron) Neural Network to classify the system\nstates of a Lorenz system as stable and unstable. We pose this task as a\nsupervised learning problem where we train the neural network on Lorenz system\nwhich have states labeled as stable or unstable. We then test the ability of\nthe neural network models to identify the stable and unstable states on a\ndifferent Lorenz system that is generated using different initial conditions.\nWe also evaluate the classification performance in the mismatched case i.e.,\nwhen the initial conditions for training and validation data are sampled from\ndifferent intervals. We show that certain normalization schemes can greatly\nimprove the performance of neural networks in especially these mismatched\nscenarios. The classification framework developed in the paper can be a\npreprocessor for a larger context of sequential decision making framework where\nthe decision making is performed based on observed stable or unstable states.",

          "description": "Online learning with expert advice is widely used in various machine learning\ntasks. It considers the problem where a learner chooses one from a set of\nexperts to take advice and make a decision. In many learning problems, experts\nmay be related, henceforth the learner can observe the losses associated with a\nsubset of experts that are related to the chosen one. In this context, the\nrelationship among experts can be captured by a feedback graph, which can be\nused to assist the learner's decision making. However, in practice, the nominal\nfeedback graph often entails uncertainties, which renders it impossible to\nreveal the actual relationship among experts. To cope with this challenge, the\npresent work studies various cases of potential uncertainties, and develops\nnovel online learning algorithms to deal with uncertainties while making use of\nthe uncertain feedback graph. The proposed algorithms are proved to enjoy\nsublinear regret under mild conditions. Experiments on real datasets are\npresented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel algorithms.",

          "description": "Machine learning models using transaction records as inputs are popular among\nfinancial institutions. The most efficient models use deep-learning\narchitectures similar to those in the NLP community, posing a challenge due to\ntheir tremendous number of parameters and limited robustness. In particular,\ndeep-learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: a little change in\nthe input harms the model's output.\n\nIn this work, we examine adversarial attacks on transaction records data and\ndefences from these attacks. The transaction records data have a different\nstructure than the canonical NLP or time series data, as neighbouring records\nare less connected than words in sentences, and each record consists of both\ndiscrete merchant code and continuous transaction amount. We consider a\nblack-box attack scenario, where the attack doesn't know the true decision\nmodel, and pay special attention to adding transaction tokens to the end of a\nsequence. These limitations provide more realistic scenario, previously\nunexplored in NLP world.\n\nThe proposed adversarial attacks and the respective defences demonstrate\nremarkable performance using relevant datasets from the financial industry. Our\nresults show that a couple of generated transactions are sufficient to fool a\ndeep-learning model. Further, we improve model robustness via adversarial\ntraining or separate adversarial examples detection. This work shows that\nembedding protection from adversarial attacks improves model robustness,\nallowing a wider adoption of deep models for transaction records in banking and\nfinance.",

          "description": "Short Message Service (SMS) is a very popular service used for communication\nby mobile users. However, this popular service can be abused by executing\nillegal activities and influencing security risks. Nowadays, many automatic\nmachine learning (AutoML) tools exist which can help domain experts and lay\nusers to build high-quality ML models with little or no machine learning\nknowledge. In this work, a classification performance comparison was conducted\nbetween three automatic ML tools for SMS spam message filtering. These tools\nare mljar-supervised AutoML, H2O AutoML, and Tree-based Pipeline Optimization\nTool (TPOT) AutoML. Experimental results showed that ensemble models achieved\nthe best classification performance. The Stacked Ensemble model, which was\nbuilt using H2O AutoML, achieved the best performance in terms of Log Loss\n(0.8370), true positive (1088/1116), and true negative (281/287) metrics. There\nis a 19.05\\% improvement in Log Loss with respect to TPOT AutoML and 10.53\\%\nimprovement with respect to mljar-supervised AutoML. The satisfactory filtering\nperformance achieved with AutoML tools provides a potential application for\nAutoML tools to automatically determine the best ML model that can perform best\nfor SMS spam message filtering.",

          "description": "Although modern machine learning and deep learning methods allow for complex\nand in-depth data analytics, the predictive models generated by these methods\nare often highly complex, and lack transparency. Explainable AI (XAI) methods\nare used to improve the interpretability of these complex models, and in doing\nso improve transparency. However, the inherent fitness of these explainable\nmethods can be hard to evaluate. In particular, methods to evaluate the\nfidelity of the explanation to the underlying black box require further\ndevelopment, especially for tabular data. In this paper, we (a) propose a three\nphase approach to developing an evaluation method; (b) adapt an existing\nevaluation method primarily for image and text data to evaluate models trained\non tabular data; and (c) evaluate two popular explainable methods using this\nevaluation method. Our evaluations suggest that the internal mechanism of the\nunderlying predictive model, the internal mechanism of the explainable method\nused and model and data complexity all affect explanation fidelity. Given that\nexplanation fidelity is so sensitive to context and tools and data used, we\ncould not clearly identify any specific explainable method as being superior to\nanother.",

          "description": "Classification by neural nets and by tree-based methods are powerful tools of\nmachine learning. There exist interesting visualizations of the inner workings\nof these and other classifiers. Here we pursue a different goal, which is to\nvisualize the cases being classified, either in training data or in test data.\nAn important aspect is whether a case has been classified to its given class\n(label) or whether the classifier wants to assign it to different class. This\nis reflected in the (conditional and posterior) probability of the alternative\nclass (PAC). A high PAC indicates label bias, i.e. the possibility that the\ncase was mislabeled. The PAC is used to construct a silhouette plot which is\nsimilar in spirit to the silhouette plot for cluster analysis (Rousseeuw,\n1987). The average silhouette width can be used to compare different\nclassifications of the same dataset. We will also draw quasi residual plots of\nthe PAC versus a data feature, which may lead to more insight in the data. One\nof these data features is how far each case lies from its given class. The\ngraphical displays are illustrated and interpreted on benchmark data sets\ncontaining images, mixed features, and tweets.",

In this work, we derive the layerwise weight dynamics of\ninfinite-width neural networks with nonlinear activations trained by gradient\ndescent. We show theoretically that weight updates are aligned with input\ncorrelations from intermediate layers weighted by error, and demonstrate\nempirically that the result also holds in finite-width wide networks. The\nalignment result allows us to formulate backpropagation-free learning rules,\nnamed Align-zero and Align-ada, that theoretically achieve the same alignment\nas backpropagation.
