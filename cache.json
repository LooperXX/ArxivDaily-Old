          "description": "We analyze bias in historical corpora as encoded in diachronic distributional\nsemantic models by focusing on two specific forms of bias, namely a political\n(i.e., anti-communism) and racist (i.e., antisemitism) one. For this, we use a\nnew corpus of German parliamentary proceedings, DeuPARL, spanning the period\n1867--2020. We complement this analysis of historical biases in diachronic word\nembeddings with a novel measure of bias on the basis of term co-occurrences and\ngraph-based label propagation. The results of our bias measurements align with\ncommonly perceived historical trends of antisemitic and anti-communist biases\nin German politics in different time periods, thus indicating the viability of\nanalyzing historical bias trends using semantic spaces induced from historical\ncorpora.",

          "description": "Question generation (QG) is a natural language generation task where a model\nis trained to ask questions corresponding to some input text. Most recent\napproaches frame QG as a sequence-to-sequence problem and rely on additional\nfeatures and mechanisms to increase performance; however, these often increase\nmodel complexity, and can rely on auxiliary data unavailable in practical use.\nA single Transformer-based unidirectional language model leveraging transfer\nlearning can be used to produce high quality questions while disposing of\nadditional task-specific complexity. Our QG model, finetuned from GPT-2 Small,\noutperforms several paragraph-level QG baselines on the SQuAD dataset by 0.95\nMETEOR points. Human evaluators rated questions as easy to answer, relevant to\ntheir context paragraph, and corresponding well to natural human speech. Also\nintroduced is a new set of baseline scores on the RACE dataset, which has not\npreviously been used for QG tasks. Further experimentation with varying model\ncapacities and datasets with non-identification type questions is recommended\nin order to further verify the robustness of pretrained Transformer-based LMs\nas question generators.",

In this paper we establish a\ndataset of 622K examples from 154K documents. We pretrain a large language\nmodel to serve as the foundation for autoregressive approaches to the task.

          "description": "Most previous methods for text data augmentation are limited to simple tasks\nand weak baselines. We explore data augmentation on hard tasks (i.e., few-shot\nnatural language understanding) and strong baselines (i.e., pretrained models\nwith over one billion parameters). Under this setting, we reproduced a large\nnumber of previous augmentation methods and found that these methods bring\nmarginal gains at best and sometimes degrade the performance much. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation method FlipDA that jointly\nuses a generative model and a classifier to generate label-flipped data.\nCentral to the idea of FlipDA is the discovery that generating label-flipped\ndata is more crucial to the performance than generating label-preserved data.\nExperiments show that FlipDA achieves a good tradeoff between effectiveness and\nrobustness---it substantially improves many tasks while not negatively\naffecting the others.",

          "description": "Benefiting from large-scale pre-training, we have witnessed significant\nperformance boost on the popular Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. Despite\nrapid progress, it remains unclear whether these state-of-the-art (SOTA) models\nare robust when encountering examples in the wild. To study this, we introduce\nAdversarial VQA, a new large-scale VQA benchmark, collected iteratively via an\nadversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop procedure. Through this new benchmark,\nwe discover several interesting findings. (i) Surprisingly, we find that during\ndataset collection, non-expert annotators can easily attack SOTA VQA models\nsuccessfully. (ii) Both large-scale pre-trained models and adversarial training\nmethods achieve far worse performance on the new benchmark than over standard\nVQA v2 dataset, revealing the fragility of these models while demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our adversarial dataset. (iii) When used for data\naugmentation, our dataset can effectively boost model performance on other\nrobust VQA benchmarks. We hope our Adversarial VQA dataset can shed new light\non robustness study in the community and serve as a valuable benchmark for\nfuture work.",

          "description": "Time is an important dimension in our physical world. Lots of facts can\nevolve with respect to time. For example, the U.S. President might change every\nfour years. Therefore, it is important to consider the time dimension and\nempower the existing QA models to reason over time. However, the existing QA\ndatasets contain rather few time-sensitive questions, hence not suitable for\ndiagnosing or benchmarking the model's temporal reasoning capability. In order\nto promote research in this direction, we propose to construct a time-sensitive\nQA dataset. The dataset is constructed by 1) mining time-evolving facts from\nWikiData and align them to their corresponding Wikipedia page, 2) employing\ncrowd workers to verify and calibrate these noisy facts, 3) generating\nquestion-answer pairs based on the annotated time-sensitive facts. Our dataset\nposes two novel challenges: 1) the model needs to understand both explicit and\nimplicit mention of time information in the long document, 2) the model needs\nto perform temporal reasoning like comparison, addition, subtraction. We\nevaluate different SoTA long-document QA systems like BigBird and FiD on our\ndataset. The best-performing model FiD can only achieve 46\\% accuracy, still\nfar behind the human performance of 87\\%. We demonstrate that these models are\nstill lacking the ability to perform robust temporal understanding and\nreasoning. Therefore, we believe that our dataset could serve as a benchmark to\nempower future studies in temporal reasoning.

          "description": "Creating abstractive summaries from meeting transcripts has proven to be\nchallenging due to the limited amount of labeled data available for training\nneural network models. Moreover, Transformer-based architectures have proven to\nbeat state-of-the-art models in summarizing news data. In this paper, we\nutilize a Transformer-based Pointer Generator Network to generate abstract\nsummaries for meeting transcripts. This model uses 2 LSTMs as an encoder and a\ndecoder, a Pointer network which copies words from the inputted text, and a\nGenerator network to produce out-of-vocabulary words (hence making the summary\nabstractive). Moreover, a coverage mechanism is used to avoid repetition of\nwords in the generated summary. First, we show that training the model on a\nnews summary dataset and using zero-shot learning to test it on the meeting\ndataset proves to produce better results than training it on the AMI meeting\ndataset. Second, we show that training this model first on out-of-domain data,\nsuch as the CNN-Dailymail dataset, followed by a fine-tuning stage on the AMI\nmeeting dataset is able to improve the performance of the model significantly.\nWe test our model on a testing set from the AMI dataset and report the ROUGE-2\nscore of the generated summary to compare with previous literature. We also\nreport the Factual score of our summaries since it is a better benchmark for\nabstractive summaries since the ROUGE-2 score is limited to measuring\nword-overlaps. We show that our improved model is able to improve on previous\nmodels by at least 5 ROUGE-2 scores, which is a substantial improvement. Also,\na qualitative analysis of the summaries generated by our model shows that these\nsummaries and human-readable and indeed capture most of the important\ninformation from the transcripts.",

This paper introduces a novel framework for joint analysis\nof AI-related policy documents and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)\nresearch papers. The collected documents are enriched with metadata and\ninterconnections, using various NLP methods combined with a methodology\ninspired by Institutional Grammar. Based on the information extracted from\ncollected documents, we showcase a series of analyses that help understand\ninteractions, similarities, and differences between documents at different\nstages of institutionalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork to use automatic language analysis tools to understand the dynamics\nbetween XI-ML methods and regulations. We believe that such a system\ncontributes to better cooperation between XAI researchers and AI policymakers.",

          "description": "Recent work building open-domain chatbots has demonstrated that increasing\nmodel size improves performance. On the other hand, latency and connectivity\nconsiderations dictate the move of digital assistants on the device. Giving a\ndigital assistant like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant the ability to discuss\njust about anything leads to the need for reducing the chatbot model size such\nthat it fits on the user's device. We demonstrate that low parameter models can\nsimultaneously retain their general knowledge conversational abilities while\nimproving in a specific domain. Additionally, we propose a generic framework\nthat accounts for variety in question types, tracks reference throughout\nmulti-turn conversations, and removes inconsistent and potentially toxic\nresponses. Our framework seamlessly transitions between chatting and performing\ntransactional tasks, which will ultimately make interactions with digital\nassistants more human-like. We evaluate our framework on 1 internal and 4\npublic benchmark datasets using both automatic (Perplexity) and human (SSA -\nSensibleness and Specificity Average) evaluation metrics and establish\ncomparable performance while reducing model parameters by 90%.",

          "description": "The advent of contextualised language models has brought gains in search\neffectiveness, not just when applied for re-ranking the output of classical\nweighting models such as BM25, but also when used directly for passage indexing\nand retrieval, a technique which is called dense retrieval. In the existing\nliterature in neural ranking, two dense retrieval families have become\napparent: single representation, where entire passages are represented by a\nsingle embedding (usually BERT's [CLS] token, as exemplified by the recent ANCE\napproach), or multiple representations, where each token in a passage is\nrepresented by its own embedding (as exemplified by the recent ColBERT\napproach). These two families have not been directly compared. However, because\nof the likely importance of dense retrieval moving forward, a clear\nunderstanding of their advantages and disadvantages is paramount. To this end,\nthis paper contributes a direct study on their comparative effectiveness,\nnoting situations where each method under/over performs w.r.t. each other, and\nw.r.t. a BM25 baseline. We observe that, while ANCE is more efficient than\nColBERT in terms of response time and memory usage, multiple representations\nare statistically more effective than the single representations for MAP and\nMRR@10. We also show that multiple representations obtain better improvements\nthan single representations for queries that are the hardest for BM25, as well\nas for definitional queries, and those with complex information needs.",

          "description": "Query expansion with pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) is a powerful approach\nto enhance the effectiveness in information retrieval. Recently, with the rapid\nadvance of deep learning techniques, neural text generation has achieved\npromising success in many natural language tasks. To leverage the strength of\ntext generation for information retrieval, in this article, we propose a novel\napproach which effectively integrates text generation models into PRF-based\nquery expansion. In particular, our approach generates augmented query terms\nvia neural text generation models conditioned on both the initial query and\npseudo-relevance feedback. Moreover, in order to train the generative model, we\nadopt the conditional generative adversarial nets (CGANs) and propose the\nPRF-CGAN method in which both the generator and the discriminator are\nconditioned on the pseudo-relevance feedback. We evaluate the performance of\nour approach on information retrieval tasks using two benchmark datasets. The\nexperimental results show that our approach achieves comparable performance or\noutperforms traditional query expansion methods on both the retrieval and\nreranking tasks.",

In this work, we propose to avoid\nmanual annotation and generate a large-scale training dataset for video\nquestion answering making use of automatic cross-modal supervision. We leverage\na question generation transformer trained on text data and use it to generate\nquestion-answer pairs from transcribed video narrations. Given narrated videos,\nwe then automatically generate the HowToVQA69M dataset with 69M\nvideo-question-answer triplets. To handle the open vocabulary of diverse\nanswers in this dataset, we propose a training procedure based on a contrastive\nloss between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer\ntransformer. We introduce the zero-shot VideoQA task and show excellent\nresults, in particular for rare answers. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method\nto significantly outperform the state of the art on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA,\nActivityNet-QA and How2QA.

          "description": "As speech-enabled devices such as smartphones and smart speakers become\nincreasingly ubiquitous, there is growing interest in building automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) systems that can run directly on-device; end-to-end (E2E)\nspeech recognition models such as recurrent neural network transducers and\ntheir variants have recently emerged as prime candidates for this task. Apart\nfrom being accurate and compact, such systems need to decode speech with low\nuser-perceived latency (UPL), producing words as soon as they are spoken. This\nwork examines the impact of various techniques - model architectures, training\ncriteria, decoding hyperparameters, and endpointer parameters - on UPL. Our\nanalyses suggest that measures of model size (parameters, input chunk sizes),\nor measures of computation (e.g., FLOPS, RTF) that reflect the model's ability\nto process input frames are not always strongly correlated with observed UPL.\nThus, conventional algorithmic latency measurements might be inadequate in\naccurately capturing latency observed when models are deployed on embedded\ndevices. Instead, we find that factors affecting token emission latency, and\nendpointing behavior have a larger impact on UPL. We achieve the best trade-off\nbetween latency and word error rate when performing ASR jointly with\nendpointing, while utilizing the recently proposed alignment regularization\nmechanism.",

          "description": "Rapid progress in natural language processing has led to its utilization in a\nvariety of industrial and enterprise settings, including in its use for\ninformation extraction, specifically named entity recognition and relation\nextraction, from documents such as engineering manuals and field maintenance\nreports. While named entity recognition is a well-studied problem, existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches require large labelled datasets which are hard to\nacquire for sensitive data such as maintenance records. Further, industrial\ndomain experts tend to distrust results from black box machine learning models,\nespecially when the extracted information is used in downstream predictive\nmaintenance analytics. We overcome these challenges by developing three\napproaches built on the foundation of domain expert knowledge captured in\ndictionaries and ontologies. We develop a syntactic and semantic rules-based\napproach and an approach leveraging a pre-trained language model, fine-tuned\nfor a question-answering task on top of our base dictionary lookup to extract\nentities of interest from maintenance records. We also develop a preliminary\nontology to represent and capture the semantics of maintenance records. Our\nevaluations on a real-world aviation maintenance records dataset show promising\nresults and help identify challenges specific to named entity recognition in\nthe context of noisy industrial data.",

          "description": "Moving towards human-like linguistic performance is often argued to require\ncompositional generalisation. Whether neural networks exhibit this ability is\ntypically studied using artificial languages, for which the compositionality of\ninput fragments can be guaranteed and their meanings algebraically composed.\nHowever, compositionality in natural language is vastly more complex than this\nrigid, arithmetics-like version of compositionality, and as such artificial\ncompositionality tests do not allow us to draw conclusions about how neural\nmodels deal with compositionality in more realistic scenarios. In this work, we\nre-instantiate three compositionality tests from the literature and reformulate\nthem for neural machine translation (NMT). The results highlight two main\nissues: the inconsistent behaviour of NMT models and their inability to\n(correctly) modulate between local and global processing. Aside from an\nempirical study, our work is a call to action: we should rethink the evaluation\nof compositionality in neural networks of natural language, where composing\nmeaning is not as straightforward as doing the math.",

          "description": "In the domain of Morphology, Inflection is a fundamental and important task\nthat gained a lot of traction in recent years, mostly via SIGMORPHON's\nshared-tasks. With average accuracy above 0.9 over the scores of all languages,\nthe task is considered mostly solved using relatively generic neural\nsequence-to-sequence models, even with little data provided. In this work, we\npropose to re-evaluate morphological inflection models by employing harder\ntrain-test splits that will challenge the generalization capacity of the\nmodels. In particular, as opposed to the na\\\"ive split-by-form, we propose a\nsplit-by-lemma method to challenge the performance on existing benchmarks. Our\nexperiments with the three top-ranked systems on the SIGMORPHON's 2020\nshared-task show that the lemma-split presents an average drop of 30 percentage\npoints in macro-average for the 90 languages included. The effect is most\nsignificant for low-resourced languages with a drop as high as 95 points, but\neven high-resourced languages lose about 10 points on average.

          "description": "Recently, several Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) approaches have been\ndevised to represent entities and relations in dense vector space and employed\nin downstream tasks such as link prediction. A few KGE techniques address\ninterpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations\n(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric\ninterpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in\nhigher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the\nability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,\nmodeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of\ninterpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to\nachieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional\nspace. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view\nthe relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding\nvector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in\nwhich we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE\nconsiders the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing\nexpressivity and interpretability. Our empirical results on four well-known\nbenchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance for the KG completion task.",

          "description": "Fine-tuned language models use greedy decoding to answer reading\ncomprehension questions with relative success. However, this approach does not\nensure that the answer is a span in the given passage, nor does it guarantee\nthat it is the most probable one. Does greedy decoding actually perform worse\nthan an algorithm that does adhere to these properties? To study the\nperformance and optimality of greedy decoding, we present exact-extract, a\ndecoding algorithm that efficiently finds the most probable answer span in the\ncontext. We compare the performance of T5 with both decoding algorithms on\nzero-shot and few-shot extractive question answering. When no training examples\nare available, exact-extract significantly outperforms greedy decoding.\nHowever, greedy decoding quickly converges towards the performance of\nexact-extract with the introduction of a few training examples, becoming more\nextractive and increasingly likelier to generate the most probable span as the\ntraining set grows. We also show that self-supervised training can bias the\nmodel towards extractive behavior, increasing performance in the zero-shot\nsetting without resorting to annotated examples. Overall, our results suggest\nthat pretrained language models are so good at adapting to extractive question\nanswering, that it is often enough to fine-tune on a small training set for the\ngreedy algorithm to emulate the optimal decoding strategy.",

In response,\nwe describe Bridger, a system for facilitating discovery of scholars and their\nwork, to explore design tradeoffs among relevant and novel recommendations. We\nconstruct a faceted representation of authors using information extracted from\ntheir papers and inferred personas.

In studies with\ncomputer science researchers, our approach substantially improves users'\nabilities to do so.

          "description": "Recently, pre-trained language models such as BERT have been applied to\ndocument ranking for information retrieval, which first pre-train a general\nlanguage model on an unlabeled large corpus and then conduct ranking-specific\nfine-tuning on expert-labeled relevance datasets. Ideally, an IR system would\nmodel relevance from a user-system dualism: the user's view and the system's\nview. User's view judges the relevance based on the activities of \"real users\"\nwhile the system's view focuses on the relevance signals from the system side,\ne.g., from the experts or algorithms, etc. Inspired by the user-system\nrelevance views and the success of pre-trained language models, in this paper\nwe propose a novel ranking framework called Pre-Rank that takes both user's\nview and system's view into consideration, under the pre-training and\nfine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, to model the user's view of relevance,\nPre-Rank pre-trains the initial query-document representations based on\nlarge-scale user activities data such as the click log. To model the system's\nview of relevance, Pre-Rank further fine-tunes the model on expert-labeled\nrelevance data. More importantly, the pre-trained representations, are\nfine-tuned together with handcrafted learning-to-rank features under a wide and\ndeep network architecture. In this way, Pre-Rank can model the relevance by\nincorporating the relevant knowledge and signals from both real search users\nand the IR experts. To verify the effectiveness of Pre-Rank, we showed two\nimplementations by using BERT and SetRank as the underlying ranking model,\nrespectively. Experimental results base on three publicly available benchmarks\nshowed that in both of the implementations, Pre-Rank can respectively\noutperform the underlying ranking models and achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances.",

However, little work has\ninvestigated attacks against decision making algorithms that use text\nembeddings, and their output is a ranking. In this paper, we focus on ranking\nalgorithms for recruitment process, that employ text embeddings for ranking\napplicants resumes when compared to a job description. We demonstrate both\nwhite box and black box attacks that identify text items, that based on their\nlocation in embedding space, have significant contribution in increasing the\nsimilarity score between a resume and a job description. The adversary then\nuses these text items to improve the ranking of their resume among others. We\ntested recruitment algorithms that use the similarity scores obtained from\nUniversal Sentence Encoder (USE) and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency\n(TF IDF) vectors. Our results show that in both adversarial settings, on\naverage the attacker is successful. We also found that attacks against TF IDF\nis more successful compared to USE.",

This has led to various attempts of compressing such models, but\nexisting methods have not considered the differences in the predictive power of\nvarious model components or in the generalizability of the compressed models.\nTo understand the connection between model compression and out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, we define the task of compressing language representation\nmodels such that they perform best in a domain adaptation setting.

Owing to sophisticated pre-training objectives and huge\nmodel parameters, large-scale PTMs can effectively capture knowledge from\nmassive labeled and unlabeled data. By storing knowledge into huge parameters\nand fine-tuning on specific tasks, the rich knowledge implicitly encoded in\nhuge parameters can benefit a variety of downstream tasks, which has been\nextensively demonstrated via experimental verification and empirical analysis.\nIt is now the consensus of the AI community to adopt PTMs as backbone for\ndownstream tasks rather than learning models from scratch. In this paper, we\ntake a deep look into the history of pre-training, especially its special\nrelation with transfer learning and self-supervised learning, to reveal the\ncrucial position of PTMs in the AI development spectrum. Further, we\ncomprehensively review the latest breakthroughs of PTMs. These breakthroughs\nare driven by the surge of computational power and the increasing availability\nof data, towards four important directions: designing effective architectures,\nutilizing rich contexts, improving computational efficiency, and conducting\ninterpretation and theoretical analysis.

          "description": "Medical imaging technologies, including computed tomography (CT) or chest\nX-Ray (CXR), are largely employed to facilitate the diagnosis of the COVID-19.\nSince manual report writing is usually too time-consuming, a more intelligent\nauxiliary medical system that could generate medical reports automatically and\nimmediately is urgently needed. In this article, we propose to use the medical\nvisual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the\nCOVID-19 scans and generate the medical report automatically based on the\ndetected lesion regions. To produce more accurate medical reports and minimize\nthe visual-and-linguistic differences, this model adopts an alternate learning\nstrategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.\nTo be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the\nknowledge from medical texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize\nthe acquired knowledge for professional medical sentences generations through\nobservations of medical images. In practice, for automatic medical report\ngeneration on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical\nfindings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital\nof Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun\nYat-sen University, Zhuhai, China. Besides, to alleviate the insufficiency of\nthe COVID-19 training samples, our model was first trained on the large-scale\nChinese CX-CHR dataset and then transferred to the COVID-19 CT dataset for\nfurther fine-tuning. The experimental results showed that Medical-VLBERT\nachieved state-of-the-art performances on terminology prediction and report\ngeneration with the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset and the CX-CHR dataset.

In clinical research studies, especially comparative\neffectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially\ncause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical\nanalyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies\nto examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured\nSBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much\nof the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language\nprocessing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from\nunstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system\nfocusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH\nconcepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract\nSBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the\ndifference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured\nEHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the\nInternational Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show\nthat the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of\n0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH\ninformation and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864\npatients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more\ndetailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only\ncaptured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical\nnarratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of\npatients' SBDoH factors.",

          "description": "Handwritten mathematical expressions (HMEs) contain ambiguities in their\ninterpretations, even for humans sometimes. Several math symbols are very\nsimilar in the writing style, such as dot and comma or 0, O, and o, which is a\nchallenge for HME recognition systems to handle without using contextual\ninformation. To address this problem, this paper presents a Transformer-based\nMath Language Model (TMLM). Based on the self-attention mechanism, the\nhigh-level representation of an input token in a sequence of tokens is computed\nby how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long\ndependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical\nexpression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of\napproximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the\nperplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e.,\nthe N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we\ncombine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition\nsystem using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates. The\nexpression rates on the testing sets of CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 were\nimproved by 2.97 and 0.83 percentage points, respectively.",

A DEMix\nlayer is a collection of expert feedforward networks, each specialized to a\ndomain, that makes the LM modular: experts can be mixed, added or removed after\ninitial training. Extensive experiments with autoregressive transformer LMs (up\nto 1.3B parameters) show that DEMix layers reduce test-time perplexity,\nincrease training efficiency, and enable rapid adaptation with little overhead.\nWe show that mixing experts during inference, using a parameter-free weighted\nensemble, allows the model to better generalize to heterogeneous or unseen\ndomains. We also show that experts can be added to iteratively incorporate new\ndomains without forgetting older ones, and that experts can be removed to\nrestrict access to unwanted domains, without additional training. Overall,\nthese results demonstrate benefits of explicitly conditioning on textual\ndomains during language modeling.",

          "description": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have become increasingly more\ncomplex and widespread. With recent developments in neural networks, a growing\nconcern is whether it is responsible to use these models. Concerns such as\nsafety and ethics can be partially addressed by providing explanations.\nFurthermore, when models do fail, providing explanations is paramount for\naccountability purposes. To this end, interpretability serves to provide these\nexplanations in terms that are understandable to humans. Central to what is\nunderstandable is how explanations are communicated. Therefore, this survey\nprovides a categorization of how recent interpretability methods communicate\nexplanations and discusses the methods in depth. Furthermore, the survey\nfocuses on post-hoc methods, which provide explanations after a model is\nlearned and generally model-agnostic. A common concern for this class of\nmethods is whether they accurately reflect the model. Hence, how these post-hoc\nmethods are evaluated is discussed throughout the paper.",

          "description": "Vision-and-language(V&L) models take image and text as input and learn to\ncapture the associations between them. Prior studies show that pre-trained V&L\nmodels can significantly improve the model performance for downstream tasks\nsuch as Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, V&L models are less effective\nwhen applied in the medical domain (e.g., on X-ray images and clinical notes)\ndue to the domain gap. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of applying\npre-trained V&L models in medical applications. In particular, we identify that\nthe visual representation in general V&L models is not suitable for processing\nmedical data. To overcome this limitation, we propose BERTHop, a\ntransformer-based model based on PixelHop++ and VisualBERT, for better\ncapturing the associations between the two modalities.

However, there are relatively lesser amounts of study that\nconverges on embracing positivity, reinforcing supportive and reassuring\ncontent in online forums. Consequently, we propose creating an English-Kannada\nHope speech dataset, KanHope and comparing several experiments to benchmark the\ndataset. The dataset consists of 6,176 user-generated comments in code mixed\nKannada scraped from YouTube and manually annotated as bearing hope speech or\nNot-hope speech. In addition, we introduce DC-BERT4HOPE, a dual-channel model\nthat uses the English translation of KanHope for additional training to promote\nhope speech detection. The approach achieves a weighted F1-score of 0.756,\nbettering other models. Henceforth, KanHope aims to instigate research in\nKannada while broadly promoting researchers to take a pragmatic approach\ntowards online content that encourages, positive, and supportive.",

          "description": "Understanding documents from their visual snapshots is an emerging problem\nthat requires both advanced computer vision and NLP methods. The recent advance\nin OCR enables the accurate recognition of text blocks, yet it is still\nchallenging to extract key information from documents due to the diversity of\ntheir layouts. Although recent studies on pre-trained language models show the\nimportance of incorporating layout information on this task, the conjugation of\ntexts and their layouts still follows the style of BERT optimized for\nunderstanding the 1D text. This implies there is room for further improvement\nconsidering the 2D nature of text layouts. This paper introduces a pre-trained\nlanguage model, BERT Relying On Spatiality (BROS), which effectively utilizes\nthe information included in individual text blocks and their layouts.\nSpecifically, BROS encodes spatial information by utilizing relative positions\nand learns spatial dependencies between OCR blocks with a novel area-masking\nstrategy. These two novel approaches lead to an efficient encoding of spatial\nlayout information highlighted by the robust performance of BROS under\nlow-resource environments. We also introduce a general-purpose parser that can\nbe combined with BROS to extract key information even when there is no order\ninformation between text blocks. BROS shows its superiority on four public\nbenchmarks---FUNSD, SROIE*, CORD, and SciTSR---and its robustness in practical\ncases where order information of text blocks is not available. Further\nexperiments with a varying number of training examples demonstrate the high\ntraining efficiency of our approach. Our code will be open to the public.",

          "description": "People convey information extremely effectively through spoken interaction\nusing multiple channels of information transmission: the lexical channel of\nwhat is said, and the non-lexical channel of how it is said. We propose\nstudying human perception of spoken communication as a means to better\nunderstand how information is encoded across these channels, focusing on the\nquestion 'What characteristics of communicative context affect listener's\nexpectations of speech?'. To investigate this, we present a novel behavioural\ntask testing whether listeners can discriminate between the true utterance in a\ndialogue and utterances sampled from other contexts with the same lexical\ncontent. We characterize how perception - and subsequent discriminative\ncapability - is affected by different degrees of additional contextual\ninformation across both the lexical and non-lexical channel of speech. Results\ndemonstrate that people can effectively discriminate between different prosodic\nrealisations, that non-lexical context is informative, and that this channel\nprovides more salient information than the lexical channel, highlighting the\nimportance of the non-lexical channel in spoken interaction.",

          "description": "Conventional Intent Detection (ID) models are usually trained offline, which\nrelies on a fixed dataset and a predefined set of intent classes. However, in\nreal-world applications, online systems usually involve continually emerging\nnew user intents, which pose a great challenge to the offline training\nparadigm. Recently, lifelong learning has received increasing attention and is\nconsidered to be the most promising solution to this challenge. In this paper,\nwe propose Lifelong Intent Detection (LID), which continually trains an ID\nmodel on new data to learn newly emerging intents while avoiding\ncatastrophically forgetting old data. Nevertheless, we find that existing\nlifelong learning methods usually suffer from a serious imbalance between old\nand new data in the LID task. Therefore, we propose a novel lifelong learning\nmethod, Multi-Strategy Rebalancing (MSR), which consists of cosine\nnormalization, hierarchical knowledge distillation, and inter-class margin loss\nto alleviate the multiple negative effects of the imbalance problem.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which\nsignificantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods\non the ATIS, SNIPS, HWU64, and CLINC150 benchmarks.",

The mode as well as other high probability\ntranslations found by beam search have been shown to often be inadequate in a\nnumber of ways. This prevents practitioners from improving translation quality\nthrough better search, as these idiosyncratic translations end up being\nselected by the decoding algorithm, a problem known as the beam search curse.\nRecently, a sampling-based approximation to minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding\nhas been proposed as an alternative decision rule for NMT that would likely not\nsuffer from the same problems. We analyse this approximation and establish that\nit has no equivalent to the beam search curse, i.e. better search always leads\nto better translations. We also design different approximations aimed at\ndecoupling the cost of exploration from the cost of robust estimation of\nexpected utility. This allows for exploration of much larger hypothesis spaces,\nwhich we show to be beneficial. We also show that it can be beneficial to make\nuse of strategies like beam search and nucleus sampling to construct hypothesis\nspaces efficiently.

          "description": "Multi-head attention, a collection of several attention mechanisms that\nindependently attend to different parts of the input, is the key ingredient in\nthe Transformer (Vaswaniet al., 2017). Recent work has shown, however, that a\nlarge proportion of the heads in a Transformer's multi-head attention mechanism\ncan be safely pruned away without significantly harming the performance of the\nmodel; such pruning leads to models that are noticeably smaller and faster in\npractice. Our work introduces a new head pruning technique that we term\ndifferentiable subset pruning. Intuitively, our method learns per-head\nimportance variables and then enforces a user-specified hard constraint on the\nnumber of unpruned heads. The importance variables are learned via stochastic\ngradient descent. We conduct experiments on natural language inference and\nmachine translation; we show that differentiable subset pruning performs\ncomparably or better than Voita et al. (2019) while offering the same exact\ncontrol over the number of heads as Michel et al. (2019).",

          "description": "Current open-domain question answering systems often follow a\nRetriever-Reader architecture, where the retriever first retrieves relevant\npassages and the reader then reads the retrieved passages to form an answer. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple and effective passage reranking method, named\nReader-guIDEd Reranker (RIDER), which does not involve training and reranks the\nretrieved passages solely based on the top predictions of the reader before\nreranking. We show that RIDER, despite its simplicity, achieves 10 to 20\nabsolute gains in top-1 retrieval accuracy and 1 to 4 Exact Match (EM) gains\nwithout refining the retriever or reader. In addition, RIDER, without any\ntraining, outperforms state-of-the-art transformer-based supervised rerankers.\nRemarkably, RIDER achieves 48.3 EM on the Natural Questions dataset and 66.4 EM\non the TriviaQA dataset when only 1,024 tokens (7.8 passages on average) are\nused as the reader input after passage reranking.",

          "description": "Neural text generation models are typically trained by maximizing\nlog-likelihood with the sequence cross entropy loss, which encourages an exact\ntoken-by-token match between a target sequence with a generated sequence. Such\ntraining objective is sub-optimal when the target sequence not perfect, e.g.,\nwhen the target sequence is corrupted with noises, or when only weak sequence\nsupervision is available. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nEdit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL), which computes the matching loss of a\ntarget n-gram with all n-grams in the generated sequence. EISL draws\ninspirations from convolutional networks (ConvNets) which are shift-invariant\nto images, hence is robust to the shift of n-grams to tolerate edits in the\ntarget sequences. Moreover, the computation of EISL is essentially a\nconvolution operation with target n-grams as kernels, which is easy to\nimplement with existing libraries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EISL, we\nconduct experiments on three tasks: machine translation with noisy target\nsequences, unsupervised text style transfer, and non-autoregressive machine\ntranslation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms\ncross entropy loss on these three tasks.",

          "description": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can achieve promising results with outrageous\nlarge amount of parameters but constant computation cost, and thus it has\nbecome a trend in model scaling. Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring\nquality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this\nwork, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe\nthat load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,\ncontrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely\nactivated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can\nsignificantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step\nforward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits\nexperts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This\nstrategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,\nand our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is\nmore effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$\ntrillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in\ncomparison with the recent SOTAs on $2048$ TPU cores. The proposed giant model\nachieves substantial speedup in convergence over the same-size baseline.",

          "description": "Recent work has shown success in incorporating pre-trained models like BERT\nto improve NLP systems. However, existing pre-trained models lack of causal\nknowledge which prevents today's NLP systems from thinking like humans. In this\npaper, we investigate the problem of injecting causal knowledge into\npre-trained models. There are two fundamental problems: 1) how to collect\nvarious granularities of causal pairs from unstructured texts; 2) how to\neffectively inject causal knowledge into pre-trained models. To address these\nissues, we extend the idea of CausalBERT from previous studies, and conduct\nexperiments on various datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. In addition, we\nadopt a regularization-based method to preserve the already learned knowledge\nwith an extra regularization term while injecting causal knowledge. Extensive\nexperiments on 7 datasets, including four causal pair classification tasks, two\ncausal QA tasks and a causal inference task, demonstrate that CausalBERT\ncaptures rich causal knowledge and outperforms all pre-trained models-based\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving a new causal inference benchmark.",

Additionally, we release an inference\ndataset, which contains annotations automatically generated by RadGraph\nBenchmark across 220,763 MIMIC-CXR reports (around 6 million entities and 4\nmillion relations) and 500 CheXpert reports (13,783 entities and 9,908\nrelations) with mappings to associated chest radiographs. Our freely available\ndataset can facilitate a wide range of research in medical natural language\nprocessing, as well as computer vision and multi-modal learning when linked to\nchest radiographs.",

Indeed, it is still a challenge to subjective\ninformation extraction systems to identify opinions and feelings in context. In\nsentiment-based NLP tasks, there are few resources to information extraction,\nabove all offensive or hateful opinions in context. To fill this important gap,\nthis short paper provides a new cross-lingual and contextual offensive lexicon,\nwhich consists of explicit and implicit offensive and swearing expressions of\nopinion, which were annotated in two different classes: context dependent and\ncontext-independent offensive.

To answer these\nquestions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a\nnew English-French dataset comprising supporting context words for 14K\ntranslations that professional translators found useful for pronoun\ndisambiguation. Using SCAT, we perform an in-depth analysis of the context used\nto disambiguate, examining positional and lexical characteristics of the\nsupporting words.

Numerous works have been proposed\nto utilize textual data for social and anti-social behaviour analysis, by\npredicting the contexts mostly for highly-resourced languages like English.\nHowever, some languages are under-resourced, e.g., South Asian languages like\nBengali, that lack computational resources for accurate natural language\nprocessing (NLP). In this paper, we propose an explainable approach for hate\nspeech detection from the under-resourced Bengali language, which we called\nDeepHateExplainer. Bengali texts are first comprehensively preprocessed, before\nclassifying them into political, personal, geopolitical, and religious hates\nusing a neural ensemble method of transformer-based neural architectures (i.e.,\nmonolingual Bangla BERT-base, multilingual BERT-cased/uncased, and\nXLM-RoBERTa). Important(most and least) terms are then identified using\nsensitivity analysis and layer-wise relevance propagation(LRP), before\nproviding human-interpretable explanations. Finally, we compute\ncomprehensiveness and sufficiency scores to measure the quality of explanations\nw.r.t faithfulness. Evaluations against machine learning~(linear and tree-based\nmodels) and neural networks (i.e., CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM with word\nembeddings) baselines yield F1-scores of 78%, 91%, 89%, and 84%, for political,\npersonal, geopolitical, and religious hates, respectively, outperforming both\nML and DNN baselines.",

          "description": "Political stance detection has become an important task due to the\nincreasingly polarized political ideologies. Most existing works focus on\nidentifying perspectives in news articles or social media posts, while social\nentities, such as individuals and organizations, produce these texts and\nactually take stances. In this paper, we propose the novel task of entity\nstance prediction, which aims to predict entities' stances given their social\nand political context. Specifically, we retrieve facts from Wikipedia about\nsocial entities regarding contemporary U.S. politics. We then annotate social\nentities' stances towards political ideologies with the help of domain experts.\nAfter defining the task of entity stance prediction, we propose a graph-based\nsolution, which constructs a heterogeneous information network from collected\nfacts and adopts gated relational graph convolutional networks for\nrepresentation learning. Our model is then trained with a combination of\nsupervised, self-supervised and unsupervised loss functions, which are\nmotivated by multiple social and political phenomenons. We conduct extensive\nexperiments to compare our method with existing text and graph analysis\nbaselines. Our model achieves highest stance detection accuracy and yields\ninspiring insights regarding social entity stances. We further conduct ablation\nstudy and parameter analysis to study the mechanism and effectiveness of our\nproposed approach.",

To monitor the pandemic trend, existing studies rely on\nthe aggregation of traditional statistical models and epidemic spread theory.\nIn other words, historical statistics of COVID-19, as well as the population\nmobility data, become the essential knowledge for monitoring the pandemic\ntrend. However, these solutions can barely provide precise prediction and\nsatisfactory explanations on the long-term disease surveillance while the\nubiquitous social media resources can be the key enabler for solving this\nproblem. For example, serious discussions may occur on social media before and\nafter some breaking events take place. These events, such as marathon and\nparade, may impact the spread of the virus. To take advantage of the social\nmedia data, we propose a novel framework, Social Media enhAnced pandemic\nsuRveillance Technique (SMART), which is composed of two modules: (i)\ninformation extraction module to construct heterogeneous knowledge graphs based\non the extracted events and relationships among them; (ii) time series\nprediction module to provide both short-term and long-term forecasts of the\nconfirmed cases and fatality at the state-level in the United States and to\ndiscover risk factors for COVID-19 interventions.

We infer this\ndistribution from a sample of typologically diverse training languages via\nLaplace approximation. The use of such a prior outperforms baseline models with\nan uninformative prior (so-called \"fine-tuning\") in both zero-shot and few-shot\nsettings. This shows that the prior is imbued with universal phonological\nknowledge. Moreover, we harness additional language-specific side information\nas distant supervision for held-out languages. Specifically, we condition\nlanguage models on features from typological databases, by concatenating them\nto hidden states or generating weights with hyper-networks. These features\nappear beneficial in the few-shot setting, but not in the zero-shot setting.\nSince the paucity of digital texts affects the majority of the world's\nlanguages, we hope that these findings will help broaden the scope of\napplications for language technology.",

          "description": "Intelligent recommendation and reminder systems are the need of the\nfast-pacing life. Current intelligent systems such as Siri, Google Assistant,\nMicrosoft Cortona, etc., have limited capability. For example, if you want to\nwake up at 6 am because you have an upcoming trip, you have to set the alarm\nmanually. Besides, these systems do not recommend or remind what else to carry,\nsuch as carrying an umbrella during a likely rain. The present work proposes a\nsystem that takes an email as input and returns a recommendation-cumreminder\nlist. As a first step, we parse the emails, recognize the entities using named\nentity recognition (NER). In the second step, information retrieval over the\nweb is done to identify nearby places, climatic conditions, etc. Imperative\nsentences from the reviews of all places are extracted and passed to the object\nextraction module. The main challenge lies in extracting the objects (items) of\ninterest from the review. To solve it, a modified Machine Reading\nComprehension-NER (MRC-NER) model is trained to tag objects of interest by\nformulating annotation rules as a query. The objects so found are recommended\nto the user one day in advance. The final reminder list of objects is pruned by\nour proposed model for tracking objects kept during the \"packing activity.\"\nEventually, when the user leaves for the event/trip, an alert is sent\ncontaining the reminding list items. Our approach achieves superior performance\ncompared to several baselines by as much as 30% on recall and 10% on precision.",

          "description": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is a long-standing problem of recommender\nsystems. Many novel methods have been proposed, ranging from classical matrix\nfactorization to recent graph convolutional network-based approaches. After\nrecent fierce debates, researchers started to focus on linear graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs) with a layer combination, which show\nstate-of-the-art accuracy in many datasets. In this work, we extend them based\non neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), because the linear GCN\nconcept can be interpreted as a differential equation, and present the method\nof Learnable-Time ODE-based Collaborative Filtering (LT-OCF). The main novelty\nin our method is that after redesigning linear GCNs on top of the NODE regime,\ni) we learn the optimal architecture rather than relying on manually designed\nones, ii) we learn smooth ODE solutions that are considered suitable for CF,\nand iii) we test with various ODE solvers that internally build a diverse set\nof neural network connections. We also present a novel training method\nspecialized to our method. In our experiments with three benchmark datasets,\nGowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-Book, our method consistently shows better\naccuracy than existing methods, e.g., a recall of 0.0411 by LightGCN vs. 0.0442\nby LT-OCF and an NDCG of 0.0315 by LightGCN vs. 0.0341 by LT-OCF in\nAmazon-Book. One more important discovery in our experiments that is worth\nmentioning is that our best accuracy was achieved by dense connections rather\nthan linear connections.",

          "description": "The advent of contextualised language models has brought gains in search\neffectiveness, not just when applied for re-ranking the output of classical\nweighting models such as BM25, but also when used directly for passage indexing\nand retrieval, a technique which is called dense retrieval. In the existing\nliterature in neural ranking, two dense retrieval families have become\napparent: single representation, where entire passages are represented by a\nsingle embedding (usually BERT's [CLS] token, as exemplified by the recent ANCE\napproach), or multiple representations, where each token in a passage is\nrepresented by its own embedding (as exemplified by the recent ColBERT\napproach). These two families have not been directly compared. However, because\nof the likely importance of dense retrieval moving forward, a clear\nunderstanding of their advantages and disadvantages is paramount. To this end,\nthis paper contributes a direct study on their comparative effectiveness,\nnoting situations where each method under/over performs w.r.t. each other, and\nw.r.t. a BM25 baseline. We observe that, while ANCE is more efficient than\nColBERT in terms of response time and memory usage, multiple representations\nare statistically more effective than the single representations for MAP and\nMRR@10. We also show that multiple representations obtain better improvements\nthan single representations for queries that are the hardest for BM25, as well\nas for definitional queries, and those with complex information needs.",

Building on these lines is our paper focused on the application of\nsentiment analysis for recommendation in the insurance domain. We tried\nbuilding the following Machine Learning models namely, Logistic Regression,\nMultinomial Naive Bayes, and the mighty Random Forest for analyzing the\npolarity of a given feedback line given by a customer. Then we used this\npolarity along with other attributes like Age, Gender, Locality, Income, and\nthe list of other products already purchased by our existing customers as input\nfor our recommendation model. Then we matched the polarity score along with the\nuser's profiles and generated the list of insurance products to be recommended\nin descending order. Despite our model's simplicity and the lack of the key\ndata sets, the results seemed very logical and realistic. So, by developing the\nmodel with more enhanced methods and with access to better and true data\ngathered from an insurance industry may be the sector could be very well\nbenefitted from the amalgamation of sentiment analysis with a recommendation.",

In this paper, we propose a novel latent\nfactor model called COMET (COnvolutional diMEnsion inTeraction), which\nsimultaneously model the high-order interaction patterns among historical\ninteractions and embedding dimensions. To be specific, COMET stacks the\nembeddings of historical interactions horizontally at first, which results in\ntwo \"embedding maps\". In this way, internal interactions and dimensional\ninteractions can be exploited by convolutional neural networks with kernels of\ndifferent sizes simultaneously. A fully-connected multi-layer perceptron is\nthen applied to obtain two interaction vectors. Lastly, the representations of\nusers and items are enriched by the learnt interaction vectors, which can\nfurther be used to produce the final prediction.

The key of\nrecommender systems is to predict how likely users will interact with items\nbased on their historical online behaviors, e.g., clicks, add-to-cart,\npurchases, etc. To exploit these user-item interactions, there are increasing\nefforts on considering the user-item interactions as a user-item bipartite\ngraph and then performing information propagation in the graph via Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs). Given the power of GNNs in graph representation learning,\nthese GNN-based recommendation methods have remarkably boosted the\nrecommendation performance. Despite their success, most existing GNN-based\nrecommender systems overlook the existence of interactions caused by unreliable\nbehaviors (e.g., random/bait clicks) and uniformly treat all the interactions,\nwhich can lead to sub-optimal and unstable performance. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the drawbacks (e.g., non-adaptive propagation and non-robustness)\nof existing GNN-based recommendation methods. To address these drawbacks, we\npropose the Graph Trend Networks for recommendations (GTN) with principled\ndesigns that can capture the adaptive reliability of the interactions.\nComprehensive experiments and ablation studies are presented to verify and\nunderstand the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

          "description": "The top search results matching a user query that are displayed on the first\npage are critical to the effectiveness and perception of a search system. A\nsearch ranking system typically orders the results by independent\nquery-document scores to produce a slate of search results. However, such\nunilateral scoring methods may fail to capture inter-document dependencies that\nusers are sensitive to, thus producing a sub-optimal slate. Further, in\npractice, many real-world applications such as e-commerce search require\nenforcing certain distributional criteria at the slate-level, due to business\nobjectives or long term user retention goals. Unilateral scoring of results\ndoes not explicitly support optimizing for such objectives with respect to a\nslate. Hence, solutions to the slate optimization problem must consider the\noptimal selection and order of the documents, along with adherence to\nslate-level distributional criteria. To that end, we propose a hybrid framework\nextended from traditional slate optimization to solve the conditional slate\noptimization problem. We introduce conditional sequential slate optimization\n(CSSO), which jointly learns to optimize for traditional ranking metrics as\nwell as prescribed distribution criteria of documents within the slate. The\nproposed method can be applied to practical real world problems such as\nenforcing diversity in e-commerce search results, mitigating bias in top\nresults and personalization of results. Experiments on public datasets and\nreal-world data from e-commerce datasets show that CSSO outperforms popular\ncomparable ranking methods in terms of adherence to distributional criteria\nwhile producing comparable or better relevance metrics.",

In response,\nwe describe Bridger, a system for facilitating discovery of scholars and their\nwork, to explore design tradeoffs among relevant and novel recommendations. We\nconstruct a faceted representation of authors using information extracted from\ntheir papers and inferred personas. We explore approaches both for recommending\nnew content and for displaying it in a manner that helps researchers to\nunderstand the work of authors who they are unfamiliar with. In studies with\ncomputer science researchers, our approach substantially improves users'\nabilities to do so. We develop an approach that locates commonalities and\ncontrasts between scientists---retrieving partially similar authors, rather\nthan aiming for strict similarity. We find this approach helps users discover\nauthors useful for generating novel research ideas of relevance to their work,\nat a higher rate than a state-of-art neural model.

However, most existing neural recommendation systems\ninitialize the user and item embeddings randomly. In this work, we propose a\nnew initialization scheme for user and item embeddings called Laplacian\nEigenmaps with Popularity-based Regularization for Isolated Data (LEPORID).\nLEPORID endows the embeddings with information regarding multi-scale\nneighborhood structures on the data manifold and performs adaptive\nregularization to compensate for high embedding variance on the tail of the\ndata distribution.

In contrast to the recent surprising finding that the\nsimple K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) method often outperforms neural recommendation\nsystems, we show that existing neural systems initialized with LEPORID often\nperform on par or better than KNN. To maximize the effects of the\ninitialization, we propose the Dual-Loss Residual Recommendation (DLR2)\nnetwork, which, when initialized with LEPORID, substantially outperforms both\ntraditional and state-of-the-art neural recommender systems.",

However, existing works\non extended DP are limited to few metrics, such as the Euclidean metric.\nConsequently, they have only a small number of applications, such as\nlocation-based services and document processing. In this paper, we propose a\ncouple of mechanisms providing extended DP with a different metric: angular\ndistance (or cosine distance). Our mechanisms are based on locality sensitive\nhashing (LSH), which can be applied to the angular distance and work well for\npersonal data in a high-dimensional space. We theoretically analyze the privacy\nproperties of our mechanisms, and prove extended DP for input data by taking\ninto account that LSH preserves the original metric only approximately. We\napply our mechanisms to friend matching based on high-dimensional personal data\nwith angular distance in the local model, and evaluate our mechanisms using two\nreal datasets. We show that LDP requires a very large privacy budget and that\nRAPPOR does not work in this application.

          "description": "All learning algorithms for recommendations face inevitable and critical\ntrade-off between exploiting partial knowledge of a user's preferences for\nshort-term satisfaction and exploring additional user preferences for long-term\ncoverage. Although exploration is indispensable for long success of a\nrecommender system, the exploration has been considered as the risk to decrease\nuser satisfaction. The reason for the risk is that items chosen for exploration\nfrequently mismatch with the user's interests. To mitigate this risk,\nrecommender systems have mixed items chosen for exploration into a\nrecommendation list, disguising the items as recommendations to elicit feedback\non the items to discover the user's additional tastes. This mix-in approach has\nbeen widely used in many recommenders, but there is rare research, evaluating\nthe effectiveness of the mix-in approach or proposing a new approach for\neliciting user feedback without deceiving users. In this work, we aim to\npropose a new approach for feedback elicitation without any deception and\ncompare our approach to the conventional mix-in approach for evaluation. To\nthis end, we designed a recommender interface that reveals which items are for\nexploration and conducted a within-subject study with 94 MTurk workers. Our\nresults indicated that users left significantly more feedback on items chosen\nfor exploration with our interface. Besides, users evaluated that our new\ninterface is better than the conventional mix-in interface in terms of novelty,\ndiversity, transparency, trust, and satisfaction. Finally, path analysis show\nthat, in only our new interface, exploration caused to increase user-centric\nevaluation metrics. Our work paves the way for how to design an interface,\nwhich utilizes learning algorithm based on users' feedback signals, giving\nbetter user experience and gathering more feedback data.",

          "description": "Recently, pre-trained language models such as BERT have been applied to\ndocument ranking for information retrieval, which first pre-train a general\nlanguage model on an unlabeled large corpus and then conduct ranking-specific\nfine-tuning on expert-labeled relevance datasets. Ideally, an IR system would\nmodel relevance from a user-system dualism: the user's view and the system's\nview. User's view judges the relevance based on the activities of \"real users\"\nwhile the system's view focuses on the relevance signals from the system side,\ne.g., from the experts or algorithms, etc. Inspired by the user-system\nrelevance views and the success of pre-trained language models, in this paper\nwe propose a novel ranking framework called Pre-Rank that takes both user's\nview and system's view into consideration, under the pre-training and\nfine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, to model the user's view of relevance,\nPre-Rank pre-trains the initial query-document representations based on\nlarge-scale user activities data such as the click log. To model the system's\nview of relevance, Pre-Rank further fine-tunes the model on expert-labeled\nrelevance data. More importantly, the pre-trained representations, are\nfine-tuned together with handcrafted learning-to-rank features under a wide and\ndeep network architecture. In this way, Pre-Rank can model the relevance by\nincorporating the relevant knowledge and signals from both real search users\nand the IR experts. To verify the effectiveness of Pre-Rank, we showed two\nimplementations by using BERT and SetRank as the underlying ranking model,\nrespectively. Experimental results base on three publicly available benchmarks\nshowed that in both of the implementations, Pre-Rank can respectively\noutperform the underlying ranking models and achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances.",

          "description": "Recently, several Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) approaches have been\ndevised to represent entities and relations in dense vector space and employed\nin downstream tasks such as link prediction. A few KGE techniques address\ninterpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations\n(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric\ninterpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in\nhigher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the\nability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,\nmodeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of\ninterpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to\nachieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional\nspace. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view\nthe relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding\nvector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in\nwhich we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE\nconsiders the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing\nexpressivity and interpretability.

          "description": "Being light-weight and cost-effective, IR-based approaches for bug\nlocalization have shown promise in finding software bugs. However, the accuracy\nof these approaches heavily depends on their used bug reports. A significant\nnumber of bug reports contain only plain natural language texts.

On the other hand, there is a piece of recent\nevidence that suggests that even these natural language-only reports contain\nenough good keywords that could help localize the bugs successfully. On one\nhand, these findings suggest that natural language-only bug reports might be a\nsufficient source for good query keywords. On the other hand, they cast serious\ndoubt on the query selection practices in the IR-based bug localization. In\nthis article, we attempted to clear the sky on this aspect by conducting an\nin-depth empirical study that critically examines the state-of-the-art query\nselection practices in IR-based bug localization. In particular, we use a\ndataset of 2,320 bug reports, employ ten existing approaches from the\nliterature, exploit the Genetic Algorithm-based approach to construct optimal,\nnear-optimal search queries from these bug reports, and then answer three\nresearch questions. We confirmed that the state-of-the-art query construction\napproaches are indeed not sufficient for constructing appropriate queries (for\nbug localization) from certain natural language-only bug reports although they\ncontain such queries. We also demonstrate that optimal queries and non-optimal\nqueries chosen from bug report texts are significantly different in terms of\nseveral keyword characteristics, which has led us to actionable insights.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate 27%--34% improvement in the performance of\nnon-optimal queries through the application of our actionable insights to them.",

          "description": "Traditional industrial recommenders are usually trained on a single business\ndomain and then serve for this domain. However, in large commercial platforms,\nit is often the case that the recommenders need to make click-through rate\n(CTR) predictions for multiple business domains. Different domains have\noverlapping user groups and items. Thus, there exist commonalities. Since the\nspecific user groups have disparity and the user behaviors may change in\nvarious business domains, there also have distinctions. The distinctions result\nin domain-specific data distributions, making it hard for a single shared model\nto work well on all domains. To learn an effective and efficient CTR model to\nhandle multiple domains simultaneously, we present Star Topology Adaptive\nRecommender (STAR). Concretely, STAR has the star topology, which consists of\nthe shared centered parameters and domain-specific parameters. The shared\nparameters are applied to learn commonalities of all domains, and the\ndomain-specific parameters capture domain distinction for more refined\nprediction. Given requests from different business domains, STAR can adapt its\nparameters conditioned on the domain characteristics. The experimental result\nfrom production data validates the superiority of the proposed STAR model.\nSince 2020, STAR has been deployed in the display advertising system of\nAlibaba, obtaining averaging 8.0% improvement on CTR and 6.0% on RPM (Revenue\nPer Mille).",

          "description": "Learning to rank systems has become an important aspect of our daily life.\nHowever, the implicit user feedback that is used to train many learning to rank\nmodels is usually noisy and suffered from user bias (i.e., position bias).\nThus, obtaining an unbiased model using biased feedback has become an important\nresearch field for IR. Existing studies on unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) can\nbe generalized into two families-algorithms that attain unbiasedness with\nlogged data, offline learning, and algorithms that achieve unbiasedness by\nestimating unbiased parameters with real-time user interactions, namely online\nlearning. While there exist many algorithms from both families, there lacks a\nunified way to compare and benchmark them. As a result, it can be challenging\nfor researchers to choose the right technique for their problems or for people\nwho are new to the field to learn and understand existing algorithms. To solve\nthis problem, we introduced ULTRA, which is a flexible, extensible, and easily\nconfigure ULTR toolbox. Its key features include support for multiple ULTR\nalgorithms with configurable hyperparameters, a variety of built-in click\nmodels that can be used separately to simulate clicks, different ranking model\narchitecture and evaluation metrics, and simple learning to rank pipeline\ncreation. In this paper, we discuss the general framework of ULTR, briefly\ndescribe the algorithms in ULTRA, detailed the structure, and pipeline of the\ntoolbox. We experimented on all the algorithms supported by ultra and showed\nthat the toolbox performance is reasonable. Our toolbox is an important\nresource for researchers to conduct experiments on ULTR algorithms with\ndifferent configurations as well as testing their own algorithms with the\nsupported features.",

          "description": "Prediction over tabular data is an essential task in many data science\napplications such as recommender systems, online advertising, medical\ntreatment, etc. Tabular data is structured into rows and columns, with each row\nas a data sample and each column as a feature attribute. Both the columns and\nrows of the tabular data carry useful patterns that could improve the model\nprediction performance. However, most existing models focus on the cross-column\npatterns yet overlook the cross-row patterns as they deal with single samples\nindependently. In this work, we propose a general learning framework named\nRetrieval & Interaction Machine (RIM) that fully exploits both cross-row and\ncross-column patterns among tabular data. Specifically, RIM first leverages\nsearch engine techniques to efficiently retrieve useful rows of the table to\nassist the label prediction of the target row, then uses feature interaction\nnetworks to capture the cross-column patterns among the target row and the\nretrieved rows so as to make the final label prediction. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on 11 datasets of three important tasks, i.e., CTR prediction\n(classification), top-n recommendation (ranking) and rating prediction\n(regression).

          "description": "Recently, we have witnessed the bloom of neural ranking models in the\ninformation retrieval (IR) field. So far, much effort has been devoted to\ndeveloping effective neural ranking models that can generalize well on new\ndata. There has been less attention paid to the robustness perspective. Unlike\nthe effectiveness which is about the average performance of a system under\nnormal purpose, robustness cares more about the system performance in the worst\ncase or under malicious operations instead. When a new technique enters into\nthe real-world application, it is critical to know not only how it works in\naverage, but also how would it behave in abnormal situations. So we raise the\nquestion in this work: Are neural ranking models robust? To answer this\nquestion, firstly, we need to clarify what we refer to when we talk about the\nrobustness of ranking models in IR. We show that robustness is actually a\nmulti-dimensional concept and there are three ways to define it in IR: 1) The\nperformance variance under the independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.)\nsetting; 2) The out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability; and 3) The\ndefensive ability against adversarial operations. The latter two definitions\ncan be further specified into two different perspectives respectively, leading\nto 5 robustness tasks in total. Based on this taxonomy, we build corresponding\nbenchmark datasets, design empirical experiments, and systematically analyze\nthe robustness of several representative neural ranking models against\ntraditional probabilistic ranking models and learning-to-rank (LTR) models. The\nempirical results show that there is no simple answer to our question. While\nneural ranking models are less robust against other IR models in most cases,\nsome of them can still win 1 out of 5 tasks. This is the first comprehensive\nstudy on the robustness of neural ranking models.",

          "description": "Question Answering (QA), a popular and promising technique for intelligent\ninformation access, faces a dilemma about data as most other AI techniques. On\none hand, modern QA methods rely on deep learning models which are typically\ndata-hungry. Therefore, it is expected to collect and fuse all the available QA\ndatasets together in a common site for developing a powerful QA model. On the\nother hand, real-world QA datasets are typically distributed in the form of\nisolated islands belonging to different parties. Due to the increasing\nawareness of privacy security, it is almost impossible to integrate the data\nscattered around, or the cost is prohibited. A possible solution to this\ndilemma is a new approach known as federated learning, which is a\nprivacy-preserving machine learning technique over distributed datasets. In\nthis work, we propose to adopt federated learning for QA with the special\nconcern on the statistical heterogeneity of the QA data. Here the heterogeneity\nrefers to the fact that annotated QA data are typically with non-identical and\nindependent distribution (non-IID) and unbalanced sizes in practice.\nTraditional federated learning methods may sacrifice the accuracy of individual\nmodels under the heterogeneous situation. To tackle this problem, we propose a\nnovel Federated Matching framework for QA, named FedMatch, with a\nbackbone-patch architecture. The shared backbone is to distill the common\nknowledge of all the participants while the private patch is a compact and\nefficient module to retain the domain information for each participant. To\nfacilitate the evaluation, we build a benchmark collection based on several QA\ndatasets from different domains to simulate the heterogeneous situation in\npractice. Empirical studies demonstrate that our model can achieve significant\nimprovements against the baselines over all the datasets.",

          "description": "Recommendation for new users, also called user cold start, has been a\nwell-recognized challenge for online recommender systems. Most existing methods\nview the crux as the lack of initial data. However, in this paper, we argue\nthat there are neglected problems: 1) New users' behaviour follows much\ndifferent distributions from regular users. 2) Although personalized features\nare involved, heavily imbalanced samples prevent the model from balancing\nnew/regular user distributions, as if the personalized features are\noverwhelmed. We name the problem as the ``submergence\" of personalization. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a novel module: Personalized COld Start MOdules\n(POSO). Considering from a model architecture perspective, POSO personalizes\nexisting modules by introducing multiple user-group-specialized sub-modules.\nThen, it fuses their outputs by personalized gates, resulting in comprehensive\nrepresentations. In such way, POSO projects imbalanced features to even\nmodules. POSO can be flexibly integrated into many existing modules and\neffectively improves their performance with negligible computational overheads.\nThe proposed method shows remarkable advantage in industrial scenario. It has\nbeen deployed on the large-scale recommender system of Kwai, and improves new\nuser Watch Time by a large margin (+7.75%). Moreover, POSO can be further\ngeneralized to regular users, inactive users and returning users (+2%-3% on\nWatch Time), as well as item cold start (+3.8% on Watch Time). Its\neffectiveness has also been verified on public dataset (MovieLens 20M). We\nbelieve such practical experience can be well generalized to other scenarios.",

Prior\nwork on supervised query suggestion models suffered from selection and exposure\nbias, and relied on sparse and noisy immediate user-feedback (e.g., clicks),\nleading to low quality suggestions. Reinforcement Learning techniques employed\nto reformulate a query using terms from search results, have limited\nscalability to large-scale industry applications. To recommend high quality\nrelated search queries, we train a Deep Reinforcement Learning model to predict\nthe query a user would enter next. The reward signal is composed of long-term\nsession-based user feedback, syntactic relatedness and estimated naturalness of\ngenerated query. Over the baseline supervised model, our proposed approach\nachieves a significant relative improvement in terms of recommendation\ndiversity (3%), down-stream user-engagement (4.2%) and per-sentence word\nrepetitions (82%).",

          "description": "Recently, Graph Convolution Network (GCN) based methods have achieved\noutstanding performance for recommendation. These methods embed users and items\nin Euclidean space, and perform graph convolution on user-item interaction\ngraphs. However, real-world datasets usually exhibit tree-like hierarchical\nstructures, which make Euclidean space less effective in capturing user-item\nrelationship. In contrast, hyperbolic space, as a continuous analogue of a\ntree-graph, provides a promising alternative. In this paper, we propose a fully\nhyperbolic GCN model for recommendation, where all operations are performed in\nhyperbolic space. Utilizing the advantage of hyperbolic space, our method is\nable to embed users/items with less distortion and capture user-item\ninteraction relationship more accurately. Extensive experiments on public\nbenchmark datasets show that our method outperforms both Euclidean and\nhyperbolic counterparts and requires far lower embedding dimensionality to\nachieve comparable performance.",

          "description": "Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) recently emerged as a powerful paradigm\nfor recommendation based on implicit feedback collaborative filtering. However,\nstandard CML methods learn fixed user and item representations, which fails to\ncapture the complex interests of users. Existing extensions of CML also either\nignore the heterogeneity of user-item relations, i.e. that a user can\nsimultaneously like very different items, or the latent item-item relations,\ni.e. that a user's preference for an item depends, not only on its intrinsic\ncharacteristics, but also on items they previously interacted with. In this\npaper, we present a hierarchical CML model that jointly captures latent\nuser-item and item-item relations from implicit data. Our approach is inspired\nby translation mechanisms from knowledge graph embedding and leverages\nmemory-based attention networks. We empirically show the relevance of this\njoint relational modeling, by outperforming existing CML models on\nrecommendation tasks on several real-world datasets. Our experiments also\nemphasize the limits of current CML relational models on very sparse datasets.",

          "description": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is one of the core tasks in recommender\nsystems (RS). It predicts a personalized click probability for each user-item\npair. Recently, researchers have found that the performance of CTR model can be\nimproved greatly by taking user behavior sequence into consideration,\nespecially long-term user behavior sequence. The report on an e-commerce\nwebsite shows that 23\\% of users have more than 1000 clicks during the past 5\nmonths. Though there are numerous works focus on modeling sequential user\nbehaviors, few works can handle long-term user behavior sequence due to the\nstrict inference time constraint in real world system. Two-stage methods are\nproposed to push the limit for better performance. At the first stage, an\nauxiliary task is designed to retrieve the top-$k$ similar items from long-term\nuser behavior sequence. At the second stage, the classical attention mechanism\nis conducted between the candidate item and $k$ items selected in the first\nstage. However, information gap happens between retrieval stage and the main\nCTR task. This goal divergence can greatly diminishing the performance gain of\nlong-term user sequence. In this paper, inspired by Reformer, we propose a\nlocality-sensitive hashing (LSH) method called ETA (End-to-end Target\nAttention) which can greatly reduce the training and inference cost and make\nthe end-to-end training with long-term user behavior sequence possible. Both\noffline and online experiments confirm the effectiveness of our model. We\ndeploy ETA into a large-scale real world E-commerce system and achieve extra\n3.1\\% improvements on GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) compared to a two-stage\nlong user sequence CTR model.",

          "description": "User-item interactions in recommendations can be naturally de-noted as a\nuser-item bipartite graph. Given the success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in\ngraph representation learning, GNN-based C methods have been proposed to\nadvance recommender systems. These methods often make recommendations based on\nthe learned user and item embeddings. However, we found that they do not\nperform well wit sparse user-item graphs which are quite common in real-world\nrecommendations. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel perspective to\nbuild GNN-based CF methods for recommendations which leads to the proposed\nframework Localized Graph Collaborative Filtering (LGCF). One key advantage of\nLGCF is that it does not need to learn embeddings for each user and item, which\nis challenging in sparse scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, LGCF aims at encoding useful CF information into a localized\ngraph and making recommendations based on such graph. Extensive experiments on\nvarious datasets validate the effectiveness of LGCF especially in sparse\nscenarios.

Recently, we\nhave witnessed an explosive growth of research interests on the first-stage\nsemantic retrieval models. We believe it is the right time to survey current\nstatus, learn from existing methods, and gain some insights for future\ndevelopment. In this paper, we describe the current landscape of the\nfirst-stage retrieval models under a unified framework to clarify the\nconnection between classical term-based retrieval methods, early semantic\nretrieval methods and neural semantic retrieval methods.

          "description": "User response prediction, which aims to predict the probability that a user\nwill provide a predefined positive response in a given context such as clicking\non an ad or purchasing an item, is crucial to many industrial applications such\nas online advertising, recommender systems, and search ranking. However, due to\nthe high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these\ntasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies\nin predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing\nfeature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order\ncross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing\nmethods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model\narchitecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with\nequal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel\narchitecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross\nnetwork's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at\nthe vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of\ndifferent cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head\nattention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to\nperform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed\nmodel can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets.

          "description": "In the current deep learning based recommendation system, the embedding\nmethod is generally employed to complete the conversion from the\nhigh-dimensional sparse feature vector to the low-dimensional dense feature\nvector. However, as the dimension of the input vector of the embedding layer is\ntoo large, the addition of the embedding layer significantly slows down the\nconvergence speed of the entire neural network, which is not acceptable in\nreal-world scenarios. In addition, as the interaction between users and items\nincreases and the relationship between items becomes more complicated, the\nembedding method proposed for sequence data is no longer suitable for graphic\ndata in the current real environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the\nDual-modal Graph Embedding Method (DGEM) to solve these problems. DGEM includes\ntwo modes, static and dynamic. We first construct the item graph to extract the\ngraph structure and use random walk of unequal probability to capture the\nhigh-order proximity between the items. Then we generate the graph embedding\nvector through the Skip-Gram model, and finally feed the downstream deep neural\nnetwork for the recommendation task. The experimental results show that DGEM\ncan mine the high-order proximity between items and enhance the expression\nability of the recommendation model. Meanwhile it also improves the\nrecommendation performance by utilizing the time dependent relationship between\nitems.",

However, relying on user interaction data is problematic because one\nfirst needs a massive user base to build a sufficient log; public query logs\nare insufficient on their own. Given the recent success of causal language\nmodels (such as the Text-To-Text Transformer (T5) model) at text generation\ntasks, we explore the capacity of these models to generate potential query\nintents. We find that to encourage diversity in the generated queries, it is\nbeneficial to adapt the model by including a new Distributional Causal Language\nModeling (DCLM) objective during fine-tuning and a representation replacement\nduring inference. Across six standard evaluation benchmarks, we find that our\nmethod (which we call IntenT5) improves search result diversity and attains\n(and sometimes exceeds) the diversity obtained when using query suggestions\nbased on a proprietary query log.

The second tier modality alignment optimizes the textual-visual joint\nembedding loss function using a double batch-hard triplet loss with soft-margin\noptimization. The third modality alignment incorporates two types of\ncross-modality alignments as the auxiliary loss regularizations to further\nreduce the alignment errors in the joint learning of the two modality-specific\nembedding functions.

These\nmodels learn to compute a ranking score between the given query and document.\nThe majority of existing models are trained in pairwise fashion using\nhuman-judged labels directly without further calibration. The traditional\npairwise schemes can be time-consuming and require pre-defined\npositive-negative document pairs for training, potentially leading to learning\nbias due to document distribution mismatch between training and test\nconditions. Some popular existing listwise schemes rely on the strong\npre-defined probabilistic assumptions and stark difference between relevant and\nnon-relevant documents for the given query, which may limit the model potential\ndue to the low-quality or ambiguous relevance labels. To address these\nconcerns, we turn to a physics-inspired ranking balance scheme and propose\nPoolRank, a pooling-based listwise learning framework. The proposed scheme has\nfour major advantages: (1) PoolRank extracts training information from the best\ncandidates at the local level based on model performance and relative ranking\namong abundant document candidates. (2) By combining four pooling-based loss\ncomponents in a multi-task learning fashion, PoolRank calibrates the ranking\nbalance for the partially relevant and the highly non-relevant documents\nautomatically without costly human inspection. (3) PoolRank can be easily\ngeneralized to any neural retrieval model without requiring additional\nlearnable parameters or model structure modifications.

In this survey paper, we first proposed a\ntwo-level taxonomy of cross-domain recommendation which classifies different\nrecommendation scenarios and recommendation tasks. We then introduce and\nsummarize existing cross-domain recommendation approaches under different\nrecommendation scenarios in a structured manner. We also organize datasets\ncommonly used. We conclude this survey by providing several potential research\ndirections about this field.",

          "description": "Exposure bias is a well-known issue in recommender systems where items and\nsuppliers are not equally represented in the recommendation results. This is\nespecially problematic when bias is amplified over time as a few popular items\nare repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists. This phenomenon can be\nviewed as a recommendation feedback loop: the system repeatedly recommends\ncertain items at different time points and interactions of users with those\nitems will amplify bias towards those items over time. This issue has been\nextensively studied in the literature on model-based or neighborhood-based\nrecommendation algorithms, but less work has been done on online recommendation\nmodels such as those based on multi-armed Bandit algorithms. In this paper, we\nstudy exposure bias in a class of well-known bandit algorithms known as Linear\nCascade Bandits. We analyze these algorithms on their ability to handle\nexposure bias and provide a fair representation for items and suppliers in the\nrecommendation results. Our analysis reveals that these algorithms fail to\ntreat items and suppliers fairly and do not sufficiently explore the item space\nfor each user. To mitigate this bias, we propose a discounting factor and\nincorporate it into these algorithms that controls the exposure of items at\neach time step. To show the effectiveness of the proposed discounting factor on\nmitigating exposure bias, we perform experiments on two datasets using three\ncascading bandit algorithms and our experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod improves the exposure fairness for items and suppliers.",

While\nthere has been much work in streamlining, caching, and modifying transformer\narchitectures for production, here we explore a new direction: distilling a\nlarge pre-trained translation model into a lightweight bi-encoder which can be\nefficiently cached and queried. We argue from a probabilistic perspective that\nsequence-to-sequence models are a conceptually ideal---albeit highly\nimpractical---retriever. We derive a new distillation objective, implementing\nit as a data augmentation scheme.

          "description": "Motives or goals are recognized in psychology literature as the most\nfundamental drive that explains and predicts why people do what they do,\nincluding when they browse the web. Although providing enormous value, these\nhigher-ordered goals are often unobserved, and little is known about how to\nleverage such goals to assist people's browsing activities. This paper proposes\nto take a new approach to address this problem, which is fulfilled through a\nnovel neural framework, Goal-directed Web Browsing (GoWeB). We adopt a\npsychologically-sound taxonomy of higher-ordered goals and learn to build their\nrepresentations in a structure-preserving manner. Then we incorporate the\nresulting representations for enhancing the experiences of common activities\npeople perform on the web. Experiments on large-scale data from Microsoft Edge\nweb browser show that GoWeB significantly outperforms competitive baselines for\nin-session web page recommendation, re-visitation classification, and\ngoal-based web page grouping. A follow-up analysis further characterizes how\nthe variety of human motives can affect the difference observed in human\nbehavioral patterns.",

          "description": "The online estimation of rhythmic information, such as beat positions,\ndownbeat positions, and meter, is critical for many real-time music\napplications. Musical rhythm comprises complex hierarchical relationships\nacross time, rendering its analysis intrinsically challenging and at times\nsubjective. Furthermore, systems which attempt to estimate rhythmic information\nin real-time must be causal and must produce estimates quickly and efficiently.\nIn this work, we introduce an online system for joint beat, downbeat, and meter\ntracking, which utilizes causal convolutional and recurrent layers, followed by\na pair of sequential Monte Carlo particle filters applied during inference. The\nproposed system does not need to be primed with a time signature in order to\nperform downbeat tracking, and is instead able to estimate meter and adjust the\npredictions over time. Additionally, we propose an information gate strategy to\nsignificantly decrease the computational cost of particle filtering during the\ninference step, making the system much faster than previous sampling-based\nmethods. Experiments on the GTZAN dataset, which is unseen during training,\nshow that the system outperforms various online beat and downbeat tracking\nsystems and achieves comparable performance to a baseline offline joint method.",

We train VATT end-to-end from scratch using multimodal\ncontrastive losses and evaluate its performance by the downstream tasks of\nvideo action recognition, audio event classification, image classification, and\ntext-to-video retrieval. Furthermore, we study a modality-agnostic\nsingle-backbone Transformer by sharing weights among the three modalities.

          "description": "Computer-generated holographic (CGH) displays show great potential and are\nemerging as the next-generation displays for augmented and virtual reality, and\nautomotive heads-up displays. One of the critical problems harming the wide\nadoption of such displays is the presence of speckle noise inherent to\nholography, that compromises its quality by introducing perceptible artifacts.\nAlthough speckle noise suppression has been an active research area, the\nprevious works have not considered the perceptual characteristics of the Human\nVisual System (HVS), which receives the final displayed imagery. However, it is\nwell studied that the sensitivity of the HVS is not uniform across the visual\nfield, which has led to gaze-contingent rendering schemes for maximizing the\nperceptual quality in various computer-generated imagery. Inspired by this, we\npresent the first method that reduces the \"perceived speckle noise\" by\nintegrating foveal and peripheral vision characteristics of the HVS, along with\nthe retinal point spread function, into the phase hologram computation.\nSpecifically, we introduce the anatomical and statistical retinal receptor\ndistribution into our computational hologram optimization, which places a\nhigher priority on reducing the perceived foveal speckle noise while being\nadaptable to any individual's optical aberration on the retina. Our method\ndemonstrates superior perceptual quality on our emulated holographic display.\nOur evaluations with objective measurements and subjective studies demonstrate\na significant reduction of the human perceived noise.",

In extensive\nexperiments, we show that gesture properties related to gesture meaning\n(semantics and category) are predictable from text features (time-aligned BERT\nembeddings) alone, but not from prosodic audio features, while rhythm-related\ngesture properties (phase) on the other hand can be predicted from either\naudio, text (with word-level timing information), or both.

          "description": "The combination of the traditional convolutional network (i.e., an\nauto-encoder) and the graph convolutional network has attracted much attention\nin clustering, in which the auto-encoder extracts the node attribute feature\nand the graph convolutional network captures the topological graph feature.\nHowever, the existing works (i) lack a flexible combination mechanism to\nadaptively fuse those two kinds of features for learning the discriminative\nrepresentation and (ii) overlook the multi-scale information embedded at\ndifferent layers for subsequent cluster assignment, leading to inferior\nclustering results. To this end, we propose a novel deep clustering method\nnamed Attention-driven Graph Clustering Network (AGCN). Specifically, AGCN\nexploits a heterogeneity-wise fusion module to dynamically fuse the node\nattribute feature and the topological graph feature. Moreover, AGCN develops a\nscale-wise fusion module to adaptively aggregate the multi-scale features\nembedded at different layers. Based on a unified optimization framework, AGCN\ncan jointly perform feature learning and cluster assignment in an unsupervised\nfashion. Compared with the existing deep clustering methods, our method is more\nflexible and effective since it comprehensively considers the numerous and\ndiscriminative information embedded in the network and directly produces the\nclustering results. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results on commonly\nused benchmark datasets validate that our AGCN consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

The effectiveness of LTH for low-complexity acoustic modeling is\nassessed by investigating various data augmentation and compression schemes,\nand we report an efficient joint framework for low-complexity multi-device ASC,\ncalled Acoustic Lottery.

While existing approaches can only fill\nin a short segment with a fixed number of notes, or a fixed time span between\nthe past and future contexts, our model can infill a variable number of notes\n(up to 128) for different time spans. We achieve so with three major technical\ncontributions. First, we adapt XLNet, an autoregressive model originally\nproposed for unsupervised model pre-training, to music score infilling. Second,\nwe propose a new, musically specialized positional encoding called relative bar\nencoding that better informs the model of notes' position within the past and\nfuture context. Third, to capitalize relative bar encoding, we perform\nlook-ahead onset prediction to predict the onset of a note one time step before\npredicting the other attributes of the note.

But the problem\nwith binaural audio recording is that it requires a specialized setup which is\nnot possible to fabricate within handheld devices as compared to traditional\nmono audio that can be recorded with a single microphone. In order to overcome\nthis drawback, prior works have tried to uplift the mono recorded audio to\nbinaural audio as a post processing step conditioning on the visual input. But\nall the prior approaches missed other most important information required for\nthe task, i.e. distance of different sound producing objects from the recording\nsetup. In this work, we argue that the depth map of the scene can act as a\nproxy for encoding distance information of objects in the scene and show that\nadding depth features along with image features improves the performance both\nqualitatively and quantitatively.

To\nthis end, we propose the Blocked Message Passing Network (BMP-Net). The model\nconsists of two modules. The concept module generates semantically meaningful\nfeatures for primitive concepts, whereas the visual module extracts visual\nfeatures for attributes and objects from input images. A message passing\nmechanism is used in the concept module to capture the relations between\nprimitive concepts. Furthermore, to prevent the model from being biased towards\nseen composite concepts and reduce the entanglement between attributes and\nobjects, we propose a blocking mechanism that equalizes the information\navailable to the model for both seen and unseen concepts.

Our key idea is to leverage content that has already been edited\nto learn fine-grained audiovisual patterns that trigger cuts. To do this, we\nfirst collected a data source of more than 10K videos, from which we extract\nmore than 255K cuts. We devise a model that learns to discriminate between real\nand artificial cuts via contrastive learning. We set up a new task and a set of\nbaselines to benchmark video cut generation. We observe that our proposed model\noutperforms the baselines by large margins. To demonstrate our model in\nreal-world applications, we conduct human studies in a collection of unedited\nvideos.

          "description": "Recent research has shown that non-additive image steganographic frameworks\neffectively improve security performance through adjusting distortion\ndistribution. However, as far as we know, all of the existing non-additive\nproposals are based on handcrafted policies, and can only be applied to a\nspecific image domain, which heavily prevent non-additive steganography from\nreleasing its full potentiality. In this paper, we propose an automatic\nnon-additive steganographic distortion learning framework called MCTSteg to\nremove the above restrictions. Guided by the reinforcement learning paradigm,\nwe combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and steganalyzer-based environmental\nmodel to build MCTSteg. MCTS makes sequential decisions to adjust distortion\ndistribution without human intervention. Our proposed environmental model is\nused to obtain feedbacks from each decision. Due to its self-learning\ncharacteristic and domain-independent reward function, MCTSteg has become the\nfirst reported universal non-additive steganographic framework which can work\nin both spatial and JPEG domains. Extensive experimental results show that\nMCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted\nfeature-based and deep-learning-based steganalyzers. In both spatial and JPEG\ndomains, the security performance of MCTSteg steadily outperforms the state of\nthe art by a clear margin under different scenarios.",

However, due to\nthe high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these\ntasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies\nin predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing\nfeature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order\ncross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing\nmethods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model\narchitecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with\nequal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel\narchitecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross\nnetwork's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at\nthe vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of\ndifferent cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head\nattention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to\nperform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed\nmodel can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets.

However, deep models\nintroduce a large number of parameters, which is hard to optimize due to the\nlack of explicit semantic labels and brings considerable training cost. As a\nresult, the retrieval accuracy and training efficiency of existing unsupervised\ndeep hashing are still limited. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we\npropose a simple and efficient \\emph{Lightweight Augmented Graph Network\nHashing} (LAGNH) method with a two-pronged strategy. For one thing, we extract\nthe inner structure of the image as the auxiliary semantics to enhance the\nsemantic supervision of the unsupervised hash learning process. For another, we\ndesign a lightweight network structure with the assistance of the auxiliary\nsemantics, which greatly reduces the number of network parameters that needs to\nbe optimized and thus greatly accelerates the training process. Specifically,\nwe design a cross-modal attention module based on the auxiliary semantic\ninformation to adaptively mitigate the adverse effects in the deep image\nfeatures. Besides, the hash codes are learned by multi-layer message passing\nwithin an adversarial regularized graph convolutional network.

We use the Recipe1M\ndataset for the technical description and empirical validation. In\npreprocessing, we perform deep feature calibration by combining deep feature\nengineering with semantic context features derived from raw text-image input\ndata. We leverage LSTM to identify key terms, NLP methods to produce ranking\nscores for key terms before generating the key term feature. We leverage\nwideResNet50 to extract and encode the image category semantics to help\nsemantic alignment of the learned recipe and image embeddings in the joint\nlatent space. In joint embedding learning, we perform deep feature calibration\nby optimizing the batch-hard triplet loss function with soft-margin and double\nnegative sampling, also utilizing the category-based alignment loss and\ndiscriminator-based alignment loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nSEJE approach with the deep feature calibration significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

          "description": "Temporal Action Localization (TAL) task in which the aim is to predict the\nstart and end of each action and its class label has many applications in the\nreal world. But due to its complexity, researchers have not reached great\nresults compared to the action recognition task. The complexity is related to\npredicting precise start and end times for different actions in any video. In\nthis paper, we propose a new network based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and\ntwo novel post-processing ideas for TAL task. Specifically, we propose a new\ndesign for the output layer of the GRU resulting in the so-called GRU-Splitted\nmodel. Moreover, linear interpolation is used to generate the action proposals\nwith precise start and end times. Finally, to rank the generated proposals\nappropriately, we use a Learn to Rank (LTR) approach. We evaluated the\nperformance of the proposed method on Thumos14 dataset. Results show the\nsuperiority of the performance of the proposed method compared to\nstate-of-the-art.

          "description": "A lifespan face synthesis (LFS) model aims to generate a set of\nphoto-realistic face images of a person's whole life, given only one snapshot\nas reference. The generated face image given a target age code is expected to\nbe age-sensitive reflected by bio-plausible transformations of shape and\ntexture, while being identity preserving. This is extremely challenging because\nthe shape and texture characteristics of a face undergo separate and highly\nnonlinear transformations w.r.t. age. Most recent LFS models are based on\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) whereby age code conditional\ntransformations are applied to a latent face representation. They benefit\ngreatly from the recent advancements of GANs. However, without explicitly\ndisentangling their latent representations into the texture, shape and identity\nfactors, they are fundamentally limited in modeling the nonlinear age-related\ntransformation on texture and shape whilst preserving identity. In this work, a\nnovel LFS model is proposed to disentangle the key face characteristics\nincluding shape, texture and identity so that the unique shape and texture age\ntransformations can be modeled effectively. This is achieved by extracting\nshape, texture and identity features separately from an encoder. Critically,\ntwo transformation modules, one conditional convolution based and the other\nchannel attention based, are designed for modeling the nonlinear shape and\ntexture feature transformations respectively. This is to accommodate their\nrather distinct aging processes and ensure that our synthesized images are both\nage-sensitive and identity preserving. Extensive experiments show that our LFS\nmodel is clearly superior to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

          "description": "In the last years, AI systems, in particular neural networks, have seen a\ntremendous increase in performance, and they are now used in a broad range of\napplications. Unlike classical symbolic AI systems, neural networks are trained\nusing large data sets and their inner structure containing possibly billions of\nparameters does not lend itself to human interpretation. As a consequence, it\nis so far not feasible to provide broad guarantees for the correct behaviour of\nneural networks during operation if they process input data that significantly\ndiffer from those seen during training. However, many applications of AI\nsystems are security- or safety-critical, and hence require obtaining\nstatements on the robustness of the systems when facing unexpected events,\nwhether they occur naturally or are induced by an attacker in a targeted way.\nAs a step towards developing robust AI systems for such applications, this\npaper presents how the robustness of AI systems can be practically examined and\nwhich methods and metrics can be used to do so. The robustness testing\nmethodology is described and analysed for the example use case of traffic sign\nrecognition in autonomous driving.",

          "description": "Weakly-supervised learning (WSL) has recently triggered substantial interest\nas it mitigates the lack of pixel-wise annotations.\n\nGiven global image labels, WSL methods yield pixel-level predictions\n(segmentations), which enable to interpret class predictions. Despite their\nrecent success, mostly with natural images, such methods can face important\nchallenges when the foreground and background regions have similar visual cues,\nyielding high false-positive rates in segmentations, as is the case in\nchallenging histology images. WSL training is commonly driven by standard\nclassification losses, which implicitly maximize model confidence, and locate\nthe discriminative regions linked to classification decisions. Therefore, they\nlack mechanisms for modeling explicitly non-discriminative regions and reducing\nfalse-positive rates. We propose novel regularization terms, which enable the\nmodel to seek both non-discriminative and discriminative regions, while\ndiscouraging unbalanced segmentations. We introduce high uncertainty as a\ncriterion to localize non-discriminative regions that do not affect classifier\ndecision, and describe it with original Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence losses\nevaluating the deviation of posterior predictions from the uniform\ndistribution. Our KL terms encourage high uncertainty of the model when the\nlatter inputs the latent non-discriminative regions. Our loss integrates: (i) a\ncross-entropy seeking a foreground, where model confidence about class\nprediction is high; (ii) a KL regularizer seeking a background, where model\nuncertainty is high; and (iii) log-barrier terms discouraging unbalanced\nsegmentations. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies over the public\nGlaS colon cancer data and a Camelyon16 patch-based benchmark for breast cancer\nshow substantial improvements over state-of-the-art WSL methods, and confirm\nthe effect of our new regularizers.",

          "description": "In Fluorescein Angiography (FA), an exogenous dye is injected in the\nbloodstream to image the vascular structure of the retina. The injected dye can\ncause adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, anaphylactic shock, and even\ndeath. In contrast, color fundus imaging is a non-invasive technique used for\nphotographing the retina but does not have sufficient fidelity for capturing\nits vascular structure. The only non-invasive method for capturing retinal\nvasculature is optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCTA). However, OCTA\nequipment is quite expensive, and stable imaging is limited to small areas on\nthe retina.

Despite\nrapid progress, it remains unclear whether these state-of-the-art (SOTA) models\nare robust when encountering examples in the wild. To study this, we introduce\nAdversarial VQA, a new large-scale VQA benchmark, collected iteratively via an\nadversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop procedure. Through this new benchmark,\nwe discover several interesting findings. (i) Surprisingly, we find that during\ndataset collection, non-expert annotators can easily attack SOTA VQA models\nsuccessfully. (ii) Both large-scale pre-trained models and adversarial training\nmethods achieve far worse performance on the new benchmark than over standard\nVQA v2 dataset, revealing the fragility of these models while demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our adversarial dataset. (iii) When used for data\naugmentation, our dataset can effectively boost model performance on other\nrobust VQA benchmarks.

          "description": "In this paper, we present an efficient and robust deep learning solution for\nnovel view synthesis of complex scenes. In our approach, a 3D scene is\nrepresented as a light field, i.e., a set of rays, each of which has a\ncorresponding color when reaching the image plane. For efficient novel view\nrendering, we adopt a 4D parameterization of the light field, where each ray is\ncharacterized by a 4D parameter. We then formulate the light field as a 4D\nfunction that maps 4D coordinates to corresponding color values. We train a\ndeep fully connected network to optimize this implicit function and memorize\nthe 3D scene. Then, the scene-specific model is used to synthesize novel views.\nDifferent from previous light field approaches which require dense view\nsampling to reliably render novel views, our method can render novel views by\nsampling rays and querying the color for each ray from the network directly,\nthus enabling high-quality light field rendering with a sparser set of training\nimages. Our method achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis results while\nmaintaining an interactive frame rate.",

We choose to use a standard CNN-RNN cascade as the\nbackbone of our proposed model for sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning.\nApart from learning through the RGB input modality, we construct an aural\nstream which operates on sequences of extracted mel-spectrograms. Our extensive\nexperiments on the challenging and newly assembled Aff-Wild2 dataset verify the\nvalidity of our intuitive multi-stream and multi-modal approach towards emotion\nrecognition in-the-wild.

          "description": "Monocular 3D object detection is an important task for autonomous driving\nconsidering its advantage of low cost. It is much more challenging than\nconventional 2D cases due to its inherent ill-posed property, which is mainly\nreflected in the lack of depth information. Recent progress on 2D detection\noffers opportunities to better solving this problem. However, it is non-trivial\nto make a general adapted 2D detector work in this 3D task. In this paper, we\nstudy this problem with a practice built on a fully convolutional single-stage\ndetector and propose a general framework FCOS3D. Specifically, we first\ntransform the commonly defined 7-DoF 3D targets to the image domain and\ndecouple them as 2D and 3D attributes. Then the objects are distributed to\ndifferent feature levels with consideration of their 2D scales and assigned\nonly according to the projected 3D-center for the training procedure.\nFurthermore, the center-ness is redefined with a 2D Gaussian distribution based\non the 3D-center to fit the 3D target formulation. All of these make this\nframework simple yet effective, getting rid of any 2D detection or 2D-3D\ncorrespondence priors. Our solution achieves 1st place out of all the\nvision-only methods in the nuScenes 3D detection challenge of NeurIPS 2020.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d.",

          "description": "The goals of this research were to search for Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) architectures, suitable for an on-device processor with limited computing\nresources, performing at substantially lower Network Architecture Search (NAS)\ncosts. A new algorithm entitled an Early Exit Population Initialisation (EE-PI)\nfor Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) was developed to achieve both goals. The EE-PI\nreduces the total number of parameters in the search process by filtering the\nmodels with fewer parameters than the maximum threshold. It will look for a new\nmodel to replace those models with parameters more than the threshold. Thereby,\nreducing the number of parameters, memory usage for model storage and\nprocessing time while maintaining the same performance or accuracy. The search\ntime was reduced to 0.52 GPU day. This is a huge and significant achievement\ncompared to the NAS of 4 GPU days achieved using NSGA-Net, 3,150 GPU days by\nthe AmoebaNet model, and the 2,000 GPU days by the NASNet model. As well, Early\nExit Evolutionary Algorithm networks (EEEA-Nets) yield network architectures\nwith minimal error and computational cost suitable for a given dataset as a\nclass of network algorithms. Using EEEA-Net on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImageNet datasets, our experiments showed that EEEA-Net achieved the lowest\nerror rate among state-of-the-art NAS models, with 2.46% for CIFAR-10, 15.02%\nfor CIFAR-100, and 23.8% for ImageNet dataset.

          "description": "With the rise of Transformers as the standard for language processing, and\ntheir advancements in computer vision, along with their unprecedented size and\namounts of training data, many have come to believe that they are not suitable\nfor small sets of data. This trend leads to great concerns, including but not\nlimited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the\nexclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this\npaper, we dispel the myth that transformers are \"data hungry\" and therefore can\nonly be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the\nright size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with\nstate-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets, often with better accuracy and fewer\nparameters. Our model eliminates the requirement for class token and positional\nembeddings through a novel sequence pooling strategy and the use of\nconvolution/s. It is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as little as\n0.28M parameters while achieving good results. Our model can reach 98.00%\naccuracy when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is a significant\nimprovement over previous Transformer based models. It also outperforms many\nmodern CNN based approaches, such as ResNet, and even some recent NAS-based\napproaches, such as Proxyless-NAS. Our simple and compact design democratizes\ntransformers by making them accessible to those with limited computing\nresources and/or dealing with small datasets.

          "description": "Probabilistic point cloud registration methods are becoming more popular\nbecause of their robustness. However, unlike point-to-plane variants of\niterative closest point (ICP) which incorporate local surface geometric\ninformation such as surface normals, most probabilistic methods (e.g., coherent\npoint drift (CPD)) ignore such information and build Gaussian mixture models\n(GMMs) with isotropic Gaussian covariances. This results in sphere-like GMM\ncomponents which only penalize the point-to-point distance between the two\npoint clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel method called CPD with Local\nSurface Geometry (LSG-CPD) for rigid point cloud registration. Our method\nadaptively adds different levels of point-to-plane penalization on top of the\npoint-to-point penalization based on the flatness of the local surface. This\nresults in GMM components with anisotropic covariances. We formulate point\ncloud registration as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and solve\nit with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E step, we\ndemonstrate that the computation can be recast into simple matrix manipulations\nand efficiently computed on a GPU. In the M step, we perform an unconstrained\noptimization on a matrix Lie group to efficiently update the rigid\ntransformation of the registration. The proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness on various\ndatasets captured with range scanners, RGBD cameras, and LiDARs. Also, it is\nsignificantly faster than modern implementations of CPD. The source code is\navailable at https://github.com/ChirikjianLab/LSG-CPD.git.",

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables a learning machine to adapt from\na labeled source domain to an unlabeled domain under the distribution shift.\nThanks to the strong representation ability of deep neural networks, recent\nremarkable achievements in UDA resort to learning domain-invariant features.\nIntuitively, the hope is that a good feature representation, together with the\nhypothesis learned from the source domain, can generalize well to the target\ndomain. However, the learning processes of domain-invariant features and source\nhypothesis inevitably involve domain-specific information that would degrade\nthe generalizability of UDA models on the target domain. In this paper,\nmotivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis that only partial parameters are\nessential for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are\nessential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in\nUDA. Such parameters are termed transferable parameters. In contrast, the other\nparameters tend to fit domain-specific details and often fail to generalize,\nwhich we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose\nTransferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect brought by\ndomain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the\nmemorization of domain-invariant information. Specifically, according to the\ndistribution discrepancy degree, we divide all parameters into transferable and\nuntransferable ones in each training iteration. We then perform separate\nupdates rules for the two types of parameters. Extensive experiments on image\nclassification and regression tasks (keypoint detection) show that TransPar\noutperforms prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments\ndemonstrate that TransPar can be integrated into the most popular deep UDA\nnetworks and be easily extended to handle any data distribution shift\nscenarios.",

To this end,\nwe explicitly model the surface of the person using a multi-layer perceptron\n(MLP) which is embedded into the canonical space of the SMPL body model. With\nclassical forward rendering, the represented surface can be rasterized using\nthe topology of a template mesh. For each surface point of the template mesh,\nthe MLP is evaluated to predict the actual surface location. To handle\npose-dependent deformations, the MLP is conditioned on the SMPL pose\nparameters. We show that this surface representation as well as the pose\nparameters can be learned in a self-supervised fashion using the principle of\nanalysis-by-synthesis and differentiable rasterization.

Subsequently, a range of\ndata augmentation techniques are then incorporated into this work including\nflipping, rotation, shearing, zooming, and brightness control. Results show\nthat these augmentation techniques further improve the test accuracy of the\nfinal model to 95.40%.

          "description": "Geometry Projection is a powerful depth estimation method in monocular 3D\nobject detection. It estimates depth dependent on heights, which introduces\nmathematical priors into the deep model. But projection process also introduces\nthe error amplification problem, in which the error of the estimated height\nwill be amplified and reflected greatly at the output depth. This property\nleads to uncontrollable depth inferences and also damages the training\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose a Geometry Uncertainty Projection Network\n(GUP Net) to tackle the error amplification problem at both inference and\ntraining stages. Specifically, a GUP module is proposed to obtains the\ngeometry-guided uncertainty of the inferred depth, which not only provides high\nreliable confidence for each depth but also benefits depth learning.\nFurthermore, at the training stage, we propose a Hierarchical Task Learning\nstrategy to reduce the instability caused by error amplification. This learning\nalgorithm monitors the learning situation of each task by a proposed indicator\nand adaptively assigns the proper loss weights for different tasks according to\ntheir pre-tasks situation. Based on that, each task starts learning only when\nits pre-tasks are learned well, which can significantly improve the stability\nand efficiency of the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. The overall model can infer more reliable\nobject depth than existing methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art\nimage-based monocular 3D detectors by 3.74% and 4.7% AP40 of the car and\npedestrian categories on the KITTI benchmark.",

Finally, a rule-based slide-level\nclassification algorithm is trained on the partitions of the circularly\ndistorted 2D manifold. This process results in a simple rule set that is\nevaluated automatically but highly transparent for human verification.

          "description": "The recently-developed DETR approach applies the transformer encoder and\ndecoder architecture to object detection and achieves promising performance. In\nthis paper, we handle the critical issue, slow training convergence, and\npresent a conditional cross-attention mechanism for fast DETR training. Our\napproach is motivated by that the cross-attention in DETR relies highly on the\ncontent embeddings for localizing the four extremities and predicting the box,\nwhich increases the need for high-quality content embeddings and thus the\ntraining difficulty. Our approach, named conditional DETR, learns a conditional\nspatial query from the decoder embedding for decoder multi-head\ncross-attention. The benefit is that through the conditional spatial query,\neach cross-attention head is able to attend to a band containing a distinct\nregion, e.g., one object extremity or a region inside the object box. This\nnarrows down the spatial range for localizing the distinct regions for object\nclassification and box regression, thus relaxing the dependence on the content\nembeddings and easing the training. Empirical results show that conditional\nDETR converges 6.7x faster for the backbones R50 and R101 and 10x faster for\nstronger backbones DC5-R50 and DC5-R101.

          "description": "Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that\nrequires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing\nlearning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated\nmedical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust\nmedical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised\napproaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,\nand also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic\ninformation, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we\npresent SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly\nadvances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe\nan unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and\npredicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive\nobjective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach\nworks surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully\nsupervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can\nbe viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust\nto representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation\nby distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular\ndatasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT\ndataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of\nlabeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of\n90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to\nprevious best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion,\nshowing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream\ntasks, such as medical image synthesis and registration.",

          "description": "In recent years graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches have become a\npopular strategy for processing point cloud data, regularly achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks. To date, the research\ncommunity has primarily focused on improving model expressiveness, with\nsecondary thought given to how to design models that can run efficiently on\nresource constrained mobile devices including smartphones or mixed reality\nheadsets. In this work we make a step towards improving the efficiency of these\nmodels by making the observation that these GNN models are heavily limited by\nthe representational power of their first, feature extracting, layer. We find\nthat it is possible to radically simplify these models so long as the feature\nextraction layer is retained with minimal degradation to model performance;\nfurther, we discover that it is possible to improve performance overall on\nModelNet40 and S3DIS by improving the design of the feature extractor. Our\napproach reduces memory consumption by 20$\\times$ and latency by up to\n9.9$\\times$ for graph layers in models such as DGCNN; overall, we achieve\nspeed-ups of up to 4.5$\\times$ and peak memory reductions of 72.5%.",

          "description": "Pathology is practiced by visual inspection of histochemically stained\nslides. Most commonly, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is used in the\ndiagnostic workflow and it is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis. However,\nin many cases, especially for non-neoplastic diseases, additional \"special\nstains\" are used to provide different levels of contrast and color to tissue\ncomponents and allow pathologists to get a clearer diagnostic picture. In this\nstudy, we demonstrate the utility of supervised learning-based computational\nstain transformation from H&E to different special stains (Masson's Trichrome,\nperiodic acid-Schiff and Jones silver stain) using tissue sections from kidney\nneedle core biopsies. Based on evaluation by three renal pathologists, followed\nby adjudication by a fourth renal pathologist, we show that the generation of\nvirtual special stains from existing H&E images improves the diagnosis in\nseveral non-neoplastic kidney diseases sampled from 58 unique subjects. A\nsecond study performed by three pathologists found that the quality of the\nspecial stains generated by the stain transformation network was statistically\nequivalent to those generated through standard histochemical staining. As the\ntransformation of H&E images into special stains can be achieved within 1 min\nor less per patient core specimen slide, this stain-to-stain transformation\nframework can improve the quality of the preliminary diagnosis when additional\nspecial stains are needed, along with significant savings in time and cost,\nreducing the burden on healthcare system and patients.",

          "description": "Deep learning and convolutional neural networks allow achieving impressive\nperformance in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic\nsegmentation (SS). However, recent studies have shown evident weaknesses of\nsuch models against adversarial perturbations. In a real-world scenario\ninstead, like autonomous driving, more attention should be devoted to\nreal-world adversarial examples (RWAEs), which are physical objects (e.g.,\nbillboards and printable patches) optimized to be adversarial to the entire\nperception pipeline. This paper presents an in-depth evaluation of the\nrobustness of popular SS models by testing the effects of both digital and\nreal-world adversarial patches. These patches are crafted with powerful attacks\nenriched with a novel loss function. Firstly, an investigation on the\nCityscapes dataset is conducted by extending the Expectation Over\nTransformation (EOT) paradigm to cope with SS. Then, a novel attack\noptimization, called scene-specific attack, is proposed. Such an attack\nleverages the CARLA driving simulator to improve the transferability of the\nproposed EOT-based attack to a real 3D environment. Finally, a printed physical\nbillboard containing an adversarial patch was tested in an outdoor driving\nscenario to assess the feasibility of the studied attacks in the real world.\nExhaustive experiments revealed that the proposed attack formulations\noutperform previous work to craft both digital and real-world adversarial\npatches for SS. At the same time, the experimental results showed how these\nattacks are notably less effective in the real world, hence questioning the\npractical relevance of adversarial attacks to SS models for autonomous/assisted\ndriving.",

Large data bias, which is caused by the disparity\nratio between the small data scale and large navigation space, makes the VLN\ntask challenging. Previous works have proposed various data augmentation\nmethods to reduce data bias. However, these works do not explicitly reduce the\ndata bias across different house scenes. Therefore, the agent would overfit to\nthe seen scenes and achieve poor navigation performance in the unseen scenes.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose the Random Environmental Mixup (REM) method,\nwhich generates cross-connected house scenes as augmented data via mixuping\nenvironment. Specifically, we first select key viewpoints according to the room\nconnection graph for each scene. Then, we cross-connect the key views of\ndifferent scenes to construct augmented scenes. Finally, we generate augmented\ninstruction-path pairs in the cross-connected scenes. The experimental results\non benchmark datasets demonstrate that our augmentation data via REM help the\nagent reduce its performance gap between the seen and unseen environment and\nimprove the overall performance, making our model the best existing approach on\nthe standard VLN benchmark.",

          "description": "Existing GAN inversion methods are stuck in a paradox that the inverted codes\ncan either achieve high-fidelity reconstruction, or retain the editing\ncapability. Having only one of them clearly cannot realize real image editing.\nIn this paper, we resolve this paradox by introducing consecutive images (\\eg,\nvideo frames or the same person with different poses) into the inversion\nprocess. The rationale behind our solution is that the continuity of\nconsecutive images leads to inherent editable directions. This inborn property\nis used for two unique purposes: 1) regularizing the joint inversion process,\nsuch that each of the inverted code is semantically accessible from one of the\nother and fastened in a editable domain; 2) enforcing inter-image coherence,\nsuch that the fidelity of each inverted code can be maximized with the\ncomplement of other images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nalternative significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of\nreconstruction fidelity and editability on both the real image dataset and\nsynthesis dataset. Furthermore, our method provides the first support of\nvideo-based GAN inversion, and an interesting application of unsupervised\nsemantic transfer from consecutive images.

          "description": "Autonomous parking systems start with the detection of available parking\nslots. Parking slot detection performance has been dramatically improved by\ndeep learning techniques. Deep learning-based object detection methods can be\ncategorized into one-stage and two-stage approaches. Although it is well-known\nthat the two-stage approach outperforms the one-stage approach in general\nobject detection, they have performed similarly in parking slot detection so\nfar. We consider this is because the two-stage approach has not yet been\nadequately specialized for parking slot detection. Thus, this paper proposes a\nhighly specialized two-stage parking slot detector that uses region-specific\nmulti-scale feature extraction. In the first stage, the proposed method finds\nthe entrance of the parking slot as a region proposal by estimating its center,\nlength, and orientation. The second stage of this method designates specific\nregions that most contain the desired information and extracts features from\nthem. That is, features for the location and orientation are separately\nextracted from only the specific regions that most contain the locational and\norientational information. In addition, multi-resolution feature maps are\nutilized to increase both positioning and classification accuracies. A\nhigh-resolution feature map is used to extract detailed information (location\nand orientation), while another low-resolution feature map is used to extract\nsemantic information (type and occupancy). In experiments, the proposed method\nwas quantitatively evaluated with two large-scale public parking slot detection\ndatasets and outperformed previous methods, including both one-stage and\ntwo-stage approaches.",

          "description": "Image quality assessment (IQA) is an important research topic for\nunderstanding and improving visual experience. The current state-of-the-art IQA\nmethods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The performance of\nCNN-based models is often compromised by the fixed shape constraint in batch\ntraining. To accommodate this, the input images are usually resized and cropped\nto a fixed shape, causing image quality degradation. To address this, we design\na multi-scale image quality Transformer (MUSIQ) to process native resolution\nimages with varying sizes and aspect ratios. With a multi-scale image\nrepresentation, our proposed method can capture image quality at different\ngranularities. Furthermore, a novel hash-based 2D spatial embedding and a scale\nembedding is proposed to support the positional embedding in the multi-scale\nrepresentation. Experimental results verify that our method can achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on multiple large scale IQA datasets such as\nPaQ-2-PiQ, SPAQ and KonIQ-10k.",

          "description": "Robots in our daily surroundings are increasing day by day. Their usability\nand acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction\ncapability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the\nmost sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no\nspecific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it\nlargely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we\ninvestigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of\npeople is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as\nhuman beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we\ndo position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group\nactivity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality,\nfirst, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine\na position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation\ncan be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very\ndiverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we\nprovide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and\ngroup detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also\nput forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible\nconcerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on\nmethods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation\napproaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and\nlimitations in current literature along with possible future research\ndirections based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing\nmethods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and\nprovide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.",

          "description": "Deep Learning has celebrated resounding successes in many application areas\nof relevance to the Internet-of-Things, for example, computer vision and\nmachine listening. To fully harness the power of deep leaning for the IoT,\nthese technologies must ultimately be brought directly to the edge. The obvious\nchallenge is that deep learning techniques can only be implemented on strictly\nresource-constrained edge devices if the models are radically downsized. This\ntask relies on different model compression techniques, such as network pruning,\nquantization and the recent advancement of XNOR-Net. This paper examines the\nsuitability of these techniques for audio classification in microcontrollers.\nWe present an XNOR-Net for end-to-end raw audio classification and a\ncomprehensive empirical study comparing this approach with\npruning-and-quantization methods. We show that raw audio classification with\nXNOR yields comparable performance to regular full precision networks for small\nnumbers of classes while reducing memory requirements 32-fold and computation\nrequirements 58-fold. However, as the number of classes increases\nsignificantly, performance degrades and pruning-and-quantization based\ncompression techniques take over as the preferred technique being able to\nsatisfy the same space constraints but requiring about 8x more computation. We\nshow that these insights are consistent between raw audio classification and\nimage classification using standard benchmark sets.To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study applying XNOR to end-to-end audio\nclassification and evaluating it in the context of alternative techniques.

The data-driven methods have a stronger prior knowledge\nlearning capability for huge data, especially for nonlinear statistical\nfeatures; however, the interpretability of the networks is poor, and they are\nover-dependent on training data. In this paper, we systematically investigate\nthe coupling of model-driven and data-driven methods, which has rarely been\nconsidered in the remote sensing image restoration and fusion communities.

However, many existing methods, especially low-cost\nones, are difficult to achieve real-time and long-term object detection and\ntracking. Here, a non-imaging strategy is proposed, including two stages, to\nrealize fast-moving object detection and tracking in real-time and for the long\nterm: 1) a contour-moments-based method is proposed to optimize the Hadamard\npattern sequence. And then reconstructing projection curves of the object based\non single-pixel imaging technology. The projection curve, which including the\nobject location information, is reconstructed directly with the measurements\ncollected by a single-pixel detector; 2) The fastest changing position in the\nprojection curve can be obtained by solving first-order gradients. A gradient\ndifferential is used in two first-order gradients to calculate a differential\ncurve with the sudden change positions. Finally, we can obtain the boundary\ninformation of the fast-moving object. We experimentally demonstrate that our\napproach can achieve a temporal resolution of 105 frames per second at a 1.28%\nsampling rate by using a 22,000 Hz digital micro-mirror device. The detection\nand tracking algorithm of the proposed strategy is computationally efficient.\nCompared with the state-of-the-art methods, our approach can make the sampling\nrate lower. Additionally, the strategy acquires not more than 1MB of data for\neach frame, which is capable of fast-moving object real-time and long-term\ndetection and tracking.",

We propose a novel\nadversarial training-based model by Attention Guided Knowledge Distillation and\nBi-directional Metric Learning (AGKD-BML). The attention knowledge is obtained\nfrom a weight-fixed model trained on a clean dataset, referred to as a teacher\nmodel, and transferred to a model that is under training on adversarial\nexamples (AEs), referred to as a student model. In this way, the student model\nis able to focus on the correct region, as well as correcting the intermediate\nfeatures corrupted by AEs to eventually improve the model accuracy. Moreover,\nto efficiently regularize the representation in feature space, we propose a\nbidirectional metric learning. Specifically, given a clean image, it is first\nattacked to its most confusing class to get the forward AE. A clean image in\nthe most confusing class is then randomly picked and attacked back to the\noriginal class to get the backward AE. A triplet loss is then used to shorten\nthe representation distance between original image and its AE, while enlarge\nthat between the forward and backward AEs.

          "description": "Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the change detection (CD) task to\nprovide not only the change locations but also the detailed semantic categories\n(before and after the observation intervals). This fine-grained change\ninformation is more useful in land-cover/land-use (LC/LU) applications. Recent\nstudies indicate that the SCD can be modeled through a triple-branch\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN), which contains two temporal branches and a\nchange branch. However, in this architecture, the connections between the\ntemporal branches and the change branch are weak. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel CNN architecture for the SCD, where the\ntemporal features are re-used and are deeply merged in the temporal branch.\nFurthermore, we elaborate on this architecture to model the bi-temporal\nsemantic correlations. The resulting Bi-temporal Semantic Reasoning Network\n(Bi-SRNet) contains two types of semantic reasoning blocks to reason both\nsingle-temporal and cross-temporal semantic correlations, as well as a novel\nloss function to improve the semantic consistency of change detection results.\nExperimental results on a benchmark dataset show that the proposed architecture\nobtains significant accuracy improvements over the existing approaches, while\nthe added designs in the Bi-SRNet further improves the segmentation of both\nsemantic categories and the changed areas.

          "description": "Real world traffic sign recognition is an important step towards building\nautonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to\nadversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and\ngenerate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based\nattack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of\nthese algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)\niteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast\nmoving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally\nwithout considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,\nthis paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world\nroad sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)\nwe leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip\nthose zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural\nperturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a\nsingle perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance\nof the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function\nthat can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real\nworld data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the\nattack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a\nquarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also\nprovides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.\nWe provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility:\nhttps://github.com/AdvAttack/RoadSignAttack.",

However, it remains nontrivial to better\nadaptively balance effective multi-modal information in the feature fusion\nphase. In this letter, we propose a novel gated recoding network (GRNet) to\nevaluate the information validity of the two modes, and balance their\ninfluence. Our framework is divided into three phases: perception phase,\nrecoding mixing phase and feature integration phase. First, A perception\nencoder is adopted to extract multi-level single-modal features, which lays the\nfoundation for multi-modal semantic comparative analysis. Then, a\nmodal-adaptive gate unit (MGU) is proposed to suppress the invalid information\nand transfer the effective modal features to the recoding mixer and the hybrid\nbranch decoder. The recoding mixer is responsible for recoding and mixing the\nbalanced multi-modal information. Finally, the hybrid branch decoder completes\nthe multi-level feature integration under the guidance of an optional edge\nguidance stream (OEGS). Experiments and analysis on eight popular benchmarks\nverify that our framework performs favorably against 9 state-of-art methods.",

          "description": "Vehicle tracking is an essential task in the multi-object tracking (MOT)\nfield. A distinct characteristic in vehicle tracking is that the trajectories\nof vehicles are fairly smooth in both the world coordinate and the image\ncoordinate. Hence, models that capture motion consistencies are of high\nnecessity. However, tracking with the standalone motion-based trackers is quite\nchallenging because targets could get lost easily due to limited information,\ndetection error and occlusion. Leveraging appearance information to assist\nobject re-identification could resolve this challenge to some extent. However,\ndoing so requires extra computation while appearance information is sensitive\nto occlusion as well. In this paper, we try to explore the significance of\nmotion patterns for vehicle tracking without appearance information. We propose\na novel approach that tackles the association issue for long-term tracking with\nthe exclusive fully-exploited motion information. We address the tracklet\nembedding issue with the proposed reconstruct-to-embed strategy based on deep\ngraph convolutional neural networks (GCN). Comprehensive experiments on the\nKITTI-car tracking dataset and UA-Detrac dataset show that the proposed method,\nthough without appearance information, could achieve competitive performance\nwith the state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers.

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the knowledge learnt\nfrom a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous work is\nmainly built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn\ndomain-invariant representations. With the recent exponential increase in\napplying Vision Transformer (ViT) to vision tasks, the capability of ViT in\nadapting cross-domain knowledge, however, remains unexplored in the literature.\nTo fill this gap, this paper first comprehensively investigates the\ntransferability of ViT on a variety of domain adaptation tasks. Surprisingly,\nViT demonstrates superior transferability over its CNNs-based counterparts with\na large margin, while the performance can be further improved by incorporating\nadversarial adaptation. Notwithstanding, directly using CNNs-based adaptation\nstrategies fails to take the advantage of ViT's intrinsic merits (e.g.,\nattention mechanism and sequential image representation) which play an\nimportant role in knowledge transfer. To remedy this, we propose an unified\nframework, namely Transferable Vision Transformer (TVT), to fully exploit the\ntransferability of ViT for domain adaptation. Specifically, we delicately\ndevise a novel and effective unit, which we term Transferability Adaption\nModule (TAM). By injecting learned transferabilities into attention blocks, TAM\ncompels ViT focus on both transferable and discriminative features. Besides, we\nleverage discriminative clustering to enhance feature diversity and separation\nwhich are undermined during adversarial domain alignment. To verify its\nversatility, we perform extensive studies of TVT on four benchmarks and the\nexperimental results demonstrate that TVT attains significant improvements\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art UDA methods.",

Three\ndifferent tasks are considered in the competition, simulating realistic\nscenarios as both random and skilled forgeries are simultaneously considered on\neach task. The results obtained in SVC-onGoing prove the high potential of deep\nlearning methods in comparison with traditional methods. In particular, the\nbest signature verification system has obtained Equal Error Rate (EER) values\nof 3.33% (Task 1), 7.41% (Task 2), and 6.04% (Task 3).

          "description": "The current state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) for Alzheimer's\nDisease diagnosis use different biomarker combinations to classify patients,\nbut do not allow extracting knowledge about the interactions of biomarkers.\nHowever, to improve our understanding of the disease, it is paramount to\nextract such knowledge from the learned model. In this paper, we propose a Deep\nFactorization Machine model that combines the ability of DNNs to learn complex\nrelationships and the ease of interpretability of a linear model. The proposed\nmodel has three parts: (i) an embedding layer to deal with sparse categorical\ndata, (ii) a Factorization Machine to efficiently learn pairwise interactions,\nand (iii) a DNN to implicitly model higher order interactions. In our\nexperiments on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed model classifies cognitive normal, mild cognitive\nimpaired, and demented patients more accurately than competing models. In\naddition, we show that valuable knowledge about the interactions among\nbiomarkers can be obtained.",

To this end, we design a novel framework employing\nthe U-Net structure to maintain the rich spatial clues, with a multi-layer\nfeature aggregation (MFA) method to simultaneously provide the details obtained\nby the shallow layers in the stylization processing. In particular, an encoder\nbased on the dense block and a decoder form a symmetrical structure of U-Net\nare jointly staked to realize an effective feature extraction and image\nreconstruction. Besides, a transfer module based on MFA and \"adaptive instance\nnormalization\" (AdaIN) is inserted in the skip connection positions to achieve\nthe stylization.

          "description": "Video objection detection is a challenging task because isolated video frames\nmay encounter appearance deterioration, which introduces great confusion for\ndetection. One of the popular solutions is to exploit the temporal information\nand enhance per-frame representation through aggregating features from\nneighboring frames. Despite achieving improvements in detection, existing\nmethods focus on the selection of higher-level video frames for aggregation\nrather than modeling lower-level temporal relations to increase the feature\nrepresentation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel solution named\nTF-Blender,which includes three modules: 1) Temporal relation mod-els the\nrelations between the current frame and its neighboring frames to preserve\nspatial information. 2). Feature adjustment enriches the representation of\nevery neigh-boring feature map; 3) Feature blender combines outputs from the\nfirst two modules and produces stronger features for the later detection tasks.\nFor its simplicity, TF-Blender can be effortlessly plugged into any detection\nnetwork to improve detection behavior. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet VID\nand YouTube-VIS benchmarks indicate the performance guarantees of using\nTF-Blender on recent state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Deep learning is gaining instant popularity in computer aided diagnosis of\nCOVID-19. Due to the high sensitivity of Computed Tomography (CT) to this\ndisease, CT-based COVID-19 detection with visual models is currently at the\nforefront of medical imaging research. Outcomes published in this direction are\nfrequently claiming highly accurate detection under deep transfer learning.\nThis is leading medical technologists to believe that deep transfer learning is\nthe mainstream solution for the problem. However, our critical analysis of the\nliterature reveals an alarming performance disparity between different\npublished results. Hence, we conduct a systematic thorough investigation to\nanalyze the effectiveness of deep transfer learning for COVID-19 detection with\nCT images. Exploring 14 state-of-the-art visual models with over 200 model\ntraining sessions, we conclusively establish that the published literature is\nfrequently overestimating transfer learning performance for the problem, even\nin the prestigious scientific sources. The roots of overestimation trace back\nto inappropriate data curation. We also provide case studies that consider more\nrealistic scenarios, and establish transparent baselines for the problem. We\nhope that our reproducible investigation will help in curbing hype-driven\nclaims for the critical problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, and pave the way for a\nmore transparent performance evaluation of techniques for CT-based COVID-19\ndetection.",

          "description": "3D single object tracking is a key issue for autonomous following robot,\nwhere the robot should robustly track and accurately localize the target for\nefficient following. In this paper, we propose a 3D tracking method called\n3D-SiamRPN Network to track a single target object by using raw 3D point cloud\ndata. The proposed network consists of two subnetworks. The first subnetwork is\nfeature embedding subnetwork which is used for point cloud feature extraction\nand fusion. In this subnetwork, we first use PointNet++ to extract features of\npoint cloud from template and search branches. Then, to fuse the information of\nfeatures in the two branches and obtain their similarity, we propose two cross\ncorrelation modules, named Pointcloud-wise and Point-wise respectively. The\nsecond subnetwork is region proposal network(RPN), which is used to get the\nfinal 3D bounding box of the target object based on the fusion feature from\ncross correlation modules. In this subnetwork, we utilize the regression and\nclassification branches of a region proposal subnetwork to obtain proposals and\nscores, thus get the final 3D bounding box of the target object. Experimental\nresults on KITTI dataset show that our method has a competitive performance in\nboth Success and Precision compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and could\nrun in real-time at 20.8 FPS. Additionally, experimental results on H3D dataset\ndemonstrate that our method also has good generalization ability and could\nachieve good tracking performance in a new scene without re-training.",

          "description": "The physical and clinical constraints surrounding diffusion-weighted imaging\n(DWI) often limit the spatial resolution of the produced images to voxels up to\n8 times larger than those of T1w images. Thus, the detailed information\ncontained in T1w imagescould help in the synthesis of diffusion images in\nhigher resolution. However, the non-Euclidean nature of diffusion imaging\nhinders current deep generative models from synthesizing physically plausible\nimages. In this work, we propose the first Riemannian network architecture for\nthe direct generation of diffusion tensors (DT) and diffusion orientation\ndistribution functions (dODFs) from high-resolution T1w images. Our integration\nof the Log-Euclidean Metric into a learning objective guarantees, unlike\nstandard Euclidean networks, the mathematically-valid synthesis of diffusion.\nFurthermore, our approach improves the fractional anisotropy mean squared error\n(FA MSE) between the synthesized diffusion and the ground-truth by more than\n23% and the cosine similarity between principal directions by almost 5% when\ncompared to our baselines. We validate our generated diffusion by comparing the\nresulting tractograms to our expected real data. We observe similar fiber\nbundles with streamlines having less than 3% difference in length, less than 1%\ndifference in volume, and a visually close shape. While our method is able to\ngenerate high-resolution diffusion images from structural inputs in less than\n15 seconds, we acknowledge and discuss the limits of diffusion inference solely\nrelying on T1w images. Our results nonetheless suggest a relationship between\nthe high-level geometry of the brain and the overall white matter architecture.",

          "description": "A number of deep learning based algorithms have been proposed to recover\nhigh-quality videos from low-quality compressed ones.

However, these methods usually suffer from a narrow\ntemporal scope, thus may miss some useful details from some frames outside the\nneighboring ones. In this paper, to boost artifact removal, on the one hand, we\npropose a Recursive Fusion (RF) module to model the temporal dependency within\na long temporal range. Specifically, RF utilizes both the current reference\nframes and the preceding hidden state to conduct better spatiotemporal\ncompensation. On the other hand, we design an efficient and effective\nDeformable Spatiotemporal Attention (DSTA) module such that the model can pay\nmore effort on restoring the artifact-rich areas like the boundary area of a\nmoving object.

Existing\napproaches use images of unexpected objects from external datasets or require\nadditional training (e.g., retraining segmentation networks or training an\nextra network), which necessitate a non-trivial amount of labor intensity or\nlengthy inference time. One possible alternative is to use prediction scores of\na pre-trained network such as the max logits (i.e., maximum values among\nclasses before the final softmax layer) for detecting such objects. However,\nthe distribution of max logits of each predicted class is significantly\ndifferent from each other, which degrades the performance of identifying\nunexpected objects in urban-scene segmentation. To address this issue, we\npropose a simple yet effective approach that standardizes the max logits in\norder to align the different distributions and reflect the relative meanings of\nmax logits within each predicted class. Moreover, we consider the local regions\nfrom two different perspectives based on the intuition that neighboring pixels\nshare similar semantic information. In contrast to previous approaches, our\nmethod does not utilize any external datasets or require additional training,\nwhich makes our method widely applicable to existing pre-trained segmentation\nmodels. Such a straightforward approach achieves a new state-of-the-art\nperformance on the publicly available Fishyscapes Lost & Found leaderboard with\na large margin.",

Specifically,\nrecent work has empirically shown that the superior performance of the\nautomated data augmentation methods stems from increasing the diversity of\naugmented data \\cite{autoaug, randaug}. However, two factors regarding the\ndiversity of augmented data are still missing: 1) the explicit definition (and\nthus measurement) of diversity and 2) the quantifiable relationship between\ndiversity and its regularization effects. To bridge this gap, we propose a\ndiversity measure called Variance Diversity and theoretically show that the\nregularization effect of data augmentation is promised by Variance Diversity.\nWe validate in experiments that the relative gain from automated data\naugmentation in test accuracy is highly correlated to Variance Diversity. An\nunsupervised sampling-based framework, \\textbf{DivAug}, is designed to directly\nmaximize Variance Diversity and hence strengthen the regularization effect.\nWithout requiring a separate search process, the performance gain from DivAug\nis comparable with the state-of-the-art method with better efficiency.\nMoreover, under the semi-supervised setting, our framework can further improve\nthe performance of semi-supervised learning algorithms compared to RandAugment,\nmaking it highly applicable to real-world problems, where labeled data is\nscarce.

The former avoids\nthe significant reduction of network width, while the latter mitigates the\ndetriment of reduction in network depth. Technically, we propose\nmicro-factorized convolution, which factorizes a convolution matrix into low\nrank matrices, to integrate sparse connectivity into convolution.

          "description": "Domain adaptation (DA) paves the way for label annotation and dataset bias\nissues by the knowledge transfer from a label-rich source domain to a related\nbut unlabeled target domain. A mainstream of DA methods is to align the feature\ndistributions of the two domains. However, the majority of them focus on the\nentire image features where irrelevant semantic information, e.g., the messy\nbackground, is inevitably embedded. Enforcing feature alignments in such case\nwill negatively influence the correct matching of objects and consequently lead\nto the semantically negative transfer due to the confusion of irrelevant\nsemantics. To tackle this issue, we propose Semantic Concentration for Domain\nAdaptation (SCDA), which encourages the model to concentrate on the most\nprincipal features via the pair-wise adversarial alignment of prediction\ndistributions. Specifically, we train the classifier to class-wisely maximize\nthe prediction distribution divergence of each sample pair, which enables the\nmodel to find the region with large differences among the same class of\nsamples. Meanwhile, the feature extractor attempts to minimize that\ndiscrepancy, which suppresses the features of dissimilar regions among the same\nclass of samples and accentuates the features of principal parts. As a general\nmethod, SCDA can be easily integrated into various DA methods as a regularizer\nto further boost their performance. Extensive experiments on the cross-domain\nbenchmarks show the efficacy of SCDA.",

          "description": "Retrieving occlusion relation among objects in a single image is challenging\ndue to sparsity of boundaries in image. We observe two key issues in existing\nworks: firstly, lack of an architecture which can exploit the limited amount of\ncoupling in the decoder stage between the two subtasks, namely occlusion\nboundary extraction and occlusion orientation prediction, and secondly,\nimproper representation of occlusion orientation. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel architecture called Occlusion-shared and Path-separated Network (OPNet),\nwhich solves the first issue by exploiting rich occlusion cues in shared\nhigh-level features and structured spatial information in task-specific\nlow-level features. We then design a simple but effective orthogonal occlusion\nrepresentation (OOR) to tackle the second issue.

We consider the case of a popular visual discovery\nproduct, where these representations are trained with multi-task learning, from\nuse-case specific visual understanding (e.g. skin tone classification) to\ngeneral representation learning for all visual content (e.g. embeddings for\nretrieval). In this work, we describe how we (1) generate a dataset with over a\nbillion images via large weakly-supervised pretraining to improve the\nperformance of these visual representations, and (2) leverage Transformers to\nreplace the traditional convolutional backbone, with insights into both system\nand performance improvements, especially at 1B+ image scale. To support this\nbackbone model, we detail a systematic approach to deriving weakly-supervised\nimage annotations from heterogenous text signals, demonstrating the benefits of\nclustering techniques to handle the long-tail distribution of image labels.\nThrough a comprehensive study of offline and online evaluation, we show that\nlarge-scale Transformer-based pretraining provides significant benefits to\nindustry computer vision applications. The model is deployed in a production\nvisual shopping system, with 36% improvement in top-1 relevance and 23%\nimprovement in click-through volume.

          "description": "The combination of the traditional convolutional network (i.e., an\nauto-encoder) and the graph convolutional network has attracted much attention\nin clustering, in which the auto-encoder extracts the node attribute feature\nand the graph convolutional network captures the topological graph feature.\nHowever, the existing works (i) lack a flexible combination mechanism to\nadaptively fuse those two kinds of features for learning the discriminative\nrepresentation and (ii) overlook the multi-scale information embedded at\ndifferent layers for subsequent cluster assignment, leading to inferior\nclustering results. To this end, we propose a novel deep clustering method\nnamed Attention-driven Graph Clustering Network (AGCN). Specifically, AGCN\nexploits a heterogeneity-wise fusion module to dynamically fuse the node\nattribute feature and the topological graph feature. Moreover, AGCN develops a\nscale-wise fusion module to adaptively aggregate the multi-scale features\nembedded at different layers. Based on a unified optimization framework, AGCN\ncan jointly perform feature learning and cluster assignment in an unsupervised\nfashion. Compared with the existing deep clustering methods, our method is more\nflexible and effective since it comprehensively considers the numerous and\ndiscriminative information embedded in the network and directly produces the\nclustering results.

They can\ncapture an infinite depth-of-field and offer greater freedom from optical\ndistortion over their lens-based counterparts. However, the inherent\nlimitations of a pinhole system result in lower sharpness from blur caused by\noptical diffraction and higher noise levels due to low light throughput of the\nsmall aperture, requiring very long exposure times to capture well-exposed\nimages. In this paper, we explore an image restoration pipeline using deep\nlearning and domain-knowledge of the pinhole system to enhance the pinhole\nimage quality through a joint denoise and deblur approach. Our approach allows\nfor more practical exposure times for hand-held photography and provides higher\nimage quality, making it more suitable for daily photography compared to other\nlensless cameras while keeping size and cost low.

          "description": "With the increasing popularity of deep learning on edge devices, compressing\nlarge neural networks to meet the hardware requirements of resource-constrained\ndevices became a significant research direction. Numerous compression\nmethodologies are currently being used to reduce the memory sizes and energy\nconsumption of neural networks. Knowledge distillation (KD) is among such\nmethodologies and it functions by using data samples to transfer the knowledge\ncaptured by a large model (teacher) to a smaller one(student). However, due to\nvarious reasons, the original training data might not be accessible at the\ncompression stage. Therefore, data-free model compression is an ongoing\nresearch problem that has been addressed by various works. In this paper, we\npoint out that catastrophic forgetting is a problem that can potentially be\nobserved in existing data-free distillation methods. Moreover, the sample\ngeneration strategies in some of these methods could result in a mismatch\nbetween the synthetic and real data distributions. To prevent such problems, we\npropose a data-free KD framework that maintains a dynamic collection of\ngenerated samples over time. Additionally, we add the constraint of matching\nthe real data distribution in sample generation strategies that target maximum\ninformation gain. Our experiments demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy\nof the student models obtained via KD when compared with state-of-the-art\napproaches on the SVHN, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.",

Scene graphs, composed of\nnodes as objects and directed-edges as relationships among objects, offer an\nalternative representation of a scene that is more semantically grounded than\nimages. We hypothesize that a generative model for scene graphs might be able\nto learn the underlying semantic structure of real-world scenes more\neffectively than images, and hence, generate realistic novel scenes in the form\nof scene graphs. In this work, we explore a new task for the unconditional\ngeneration of semantic scene graphs. We develop a deep auto-regressive model\ncalled SceneGraphGen which can directly learn the probability distribution over\nlabelled and directed graphs using a hierarchical recurrent architecture. The\nmodel takes a seed object as input and generates a scene graph in a sequence of\nsteps, each step generating an object node, followed by a sequence of\nrelationship edges connecting to the previous nodes. We show that the scene\ngraphs generated by SceneGraphGen are diverse and follow the semantic patterns\nof real-world scenes. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of the\ngenerated graphs in image synthesis, anomaly detection and scene graph\ncompletion.",

In addition, for video\nfacial editing, previous methods either simply apply transformations frame by\nframe or utilize multiple frames in a concatenated or iterative fashion, which\nleads to noticeable visual flickers. In this paper, we propose a unified\ntemporally consistent facial video editing framework termed UniFaceGAN. Based\non a 3D reconstruction model and a simple yet efficient dynamic training sample\nselection mechanism, our framework is designed to handle face swapping and face\nreenactment simultaneously. To enforce the temporal consistency, a novel 3D\ntemporal loss constraint is introduced based on the barycentric coordinate\ninterpolation.

          "description": "We train embodied neural networks to plan and navigate unseen complex 3D\nenvironments, emphasising real-world deployment. Rather than requiring prior\nknowledge of the agent or environment, the planner learns to model the state\ntransitions and rewards. To avoid the potentially hazardous trial-and-error of\nreinforcement learning, we focus on differentiable planners such as Value\nIteration Networks (VIN), which are trained offline from safe expert\ndemonstrations. Although they work well in small simulations, we address two\nmajor limitations that hinder their deployment. First, we observed that current\ndifferentiable planners struggle to plan long-term in environments with a high\nbranching complexity. While they should ideally learn to assign low rewards to\nobstacles to avoid collisions, we posit that the constraints imposed on the\nnetwork are not strong enough to guarantee the network to learn sufficiently\nlarge penalties for every possible collision. We thus impose a structural\nconstraint on the value iteration, which explicitly learns to model any\nimpossible actions. Secondly, we extend the model to work with a limited\nperspective camera under translation and rotation, which is crucial for real\nrobot deployment. Many VIN-like planners assume a 360 degrees or overhead view\nwithout rotation. In contrast, our method uses a memory-efficient lattice map\nto aggregate CNN embeddings of partial observations, and models the rotational\ndynamics explicitly using a 3D state-space grid (translation and rotation). Our\nproposals significantly improve semantic navigation and exploration on several\n2D and 3D environments, succeeding in settings that are otherwise challenging\nfor this class of methods. As far as we know, we are the first to successfully\nperform differentiable planning on the difficult Active Vision Dataset,\nconsisting of real images captured from a robot.",

          "description": "Collaborative SLAM enables a group of agents to simultaneously co-localize\nand jointly map an environment, thus paving the way to wide-ranging\napplications of multi-robot perception and multi-user AR experiences by\neliminating the need for external infrastructure or pre-built maps. This\narticle presents COVINS, a novel collaborative SLAM system, that enables\nmulti-agent, scalable SLAM in large environments and for large teams of more\nthan 10 agents. The paradigm here is that each agent runs visual-inertial\nodomety independently onboard in order to ensure its autonomy, while sharing\nmap information with the COVINS server back-end running on a powerful local PC\nor a remote cloud server. The server back-end establishes an accurate\ncollaborative global estimate from the contributed data, refining the joint\nestimate by means of place recognition, global optimization and removal of\nredundant data, in order to ensure an accurate, but also efficient SLAM\nprocess. A thorough evaluation of COVINS reveals increased accuracy of the\ncollaborative SLAM estimates, as well as efficiency in both removing redundant\ninformation and reducing the coordination overhead, and demonstrates successful\noperation in a large-scale mission with 12 agents jointly performing SLAM.",

The main benefit of DARTS is the effectiveness achieved through\nthe weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture\nsearch. In this work, we investigate DARTS in a systematic case study of\ninverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a\ncontrolled manner. Although we demonstrate that the success of DARTS can be\nextended from image classification to reconstruction, our experiments yield\nthree fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DARTS-based methods: First,\nthe results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final\nperformance is highly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And\nthird, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training\ndoes not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. Thus, we\nconclude the necessity to 1) report the results of any DARTS-based methods from\nseveral runs along with its underlying performance statistics, 2) show the\ncorrelation of the training and final architecture performance, and 3)\ncarefully consider if the computational efficiency of DARTS outweighs the costs\nof hyperparameter optimization and multiple runs.",

To tackle such a severely ill-posed problem, we propose\na physically-interpretable, compact, efficient, and end-to-end learning-based\nframework, namely AGD-Net. Precisely, by taking advantage of the imaging\nprocess, we first formulate the problem explicitly based on the classic\ngradient descent algorithm. Then, we design a lightweight neural network with a\nmulti-stage architecture to mimic the formed amended gradient descent process,\nin which efficient convolution and novel spectral zero-mean normalization are\nproposed to effectively extract spatial-spectral features for regressing an\ninitialization, a basic gradient, and an incremental gradient. Besides, based\non the approximate low-rank property of HS images, we propose a novel rank loss\nto promote the similarity between the global structures of reconstructed and\nground-truth HS images, which is optimized with our singular value weighting\nstrategy during training. Moreover, AGD-Net, a single network after one-time\ntraining, is flexible to handle the reconstruction with various spectral\nresponse functions. Extensive experiments over three commonly-used benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that AGD-Net can improve the reconstruction quality by\nmore than 1.0 dB on average while saving 67$\\times$ parameters and 32$\\times$\nFLOPs, compared with state-of-the-art methods.

          "description": "We propose a method that efficiently learns distributions over articulation\nmodel parameters directly from depth images without the need to know\narticulation model categories a priori. By contrast, existing methods that\nlearn articulation models from raw observations typically only predict point\nestimates of the model parameters, which are insufficient to guarantee the safe\nmanipulation of articulated objects. Our core contributions include a novel\nrepresentation for distributions over rigid body transformations and\narticulation model parameters based on screw theory, von Mises-Fisher\ndistributions, and Stiefel manifolds. Combining these concepts allows for an\nefficient, mathematically sound representation that implicitly satisfies the\nconstraints that rigid body transformations and articulations must adhere to.\nLeveraging this representation, we introduce a novel deep learning based\napproach, DUST-net, that performs category-independent articulation model\nestimation while also providing model uncertainties. We evaluate our approach\non several benchmarking datasets and real-world objects and compare its\nperformance with two current state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate\nthat DUST-net can successfully learn distributions over articulation models for\nnovel objects across articulation model categories, which generate point\nestimates with better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods and effectively\ncapture the uncertainty over predicted model parameters due to noisy inputs.",

          "description": "Over-parameterized deep networks trained using gradient-based optimizers are\na popular choice for solving classification and ranking problems. Without\nappropriately tuned $\\ell_2$ regularization or weight decay, such networks have\nthe tendency to make output scores (logits) and network weights large, causing\ntraining loss to become too small and the network to lose its adaptivity\n(ability to move around) in the parameter space. Although regularization is\ntypically understood from an overfitting perspective, we highlight its role in\nmaking the network more adaptive and enabling it to escape more easily from\nweights that generalize poorly. To provide such a capability, we propose a\nmethod called Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization (LAWN), that can be\nstacked onto any gradient-based optimizer. LAWN controls the logits by\nconstraining the weight norms of layers in the final homogeneous sub-network.\nEmpirically, we show that the resulting LAWN variant of the optimizer makes a\ndeep network more adaptive to finding minimas with superior generalization\nperformance on large-scale image classification and recommender systems.

          "description": "Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization (WSTAL) aims to localize\nactions in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels. Currently, most\nstate-of-the-art WSTAL methods follow a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline:\nproducing snippet-level predictions first and then aggregating to the\nvideo-level prediction. However, we argue that existing methods have overlooked\ntwo important drawbacks: 1) inadequate use of motion information and 2) the\nincompatibility of prevailing cross-entropy training loss. In this paper, we\nanalyze that the motion cues behind the optical flow features are complementary\ninformative. Inspired by this, we propose to build a context-dependent motion\nprior, termed as motionness. Specifically, a motion graph is introduced to\nmodel motionness based on the local motion carrier (e.g., optical flow). In\naddition, to highlight more informative video snippets, a motion-guided loss is\nproposed to modulate the network training conditioned on motionness scores.\nExtensive ablation studies confirm that motionness efficaciously models\naction-of-interest, and the motion-guided loss leads to more accurate results.\nBesides, our motion-guided loss is a plug-and-play loss function and is\napplicable with existing WSTAL methods.

          "description": "Recognizing and localizing objects in the 3D space is a crucial ability for\nan AI agent to perceive its surrounding environment. While significant progress\nhas been achieved with expensive LiDAR point clouds, it poses a great challenge\nfor 3D object detection given only a monocular image. While there exist\ndifferent alternatives for tackling this problem, it is found that they are\neither equipped with heavy networks to fuse RGB and depth information or\nempirically ineffective to process millions of pseudo-LiDAR points. With\nin-depth examination, we realize that these limitations are rooted in\ninaccurate object localization. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nlightweight approach, dubbed Progressive Coordinate Transforms (PCT) to\nfacilitate learning coordinate representations. Specifically, a localization\nboosting mechanism with confidence-aware loss is introduced to progressively\nrefine the localization prediction. In addition, semantic image repre-\nsentation is also exploited to compensate for the usage of patch proposals.\nDespite being lightweight and simple, our strategy leads to superior\nimprovements on the KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset monocular 3D detection\nbenchmarks. At the same time, our proposed PCT shows great generalization to\nmost coordinate- based 3D detection frameworks.

          "description": "Common deep neural networks (DNNs) for image classification have been shown\nto rely on shortcut opportunities (SO) in the form of predictive and\neasy-to-represent visual factors. This is known as shortcut learning and leads\nto impaired generalization. In this work, we show that common DNNs also suffer\nfrom shortcut learning when predicting only basic visual object factors of\nvariation (FoV) such as shape, color, or texture. We argue that besides\nshortcut opportunities, generalization opportunities (GO) are also an inherent\npart of real-world vision data and arise from partial independence between\npredicted classes and FoVs. We also argue that it is necessary for DNNs to\nexploit GO to overcome shortcut learning. Our core contribution is to introduce\nthe Diagnostic Vision Benchmark suite DiagViB-6, which includes datasets and\nmetrics to study a network's shortcut vulnerability and generalization\ncapability for six independent FoV. In particular, DiagViB-6 allows controlling\nthe type and degree of SO and GO in a dataset.

          "description": "To accommodate rapid changes in the real world, the cognition system of\nhumans is capable of continually learning concepts. On the contrary,\nconventional deep learning models lack this capability of preserving previously\nlearned knowledge. When a neural network is fine-tuned to learn new tasks, its\nperformance on previously trained tasks will significantly deteriorate. Many\nrecent works on incremental object detection tackle this problem by introducing\nadvanced regularization. Although these methods have shown promising results,\nthe benefits are often short-lived after the first incremental step. Under\nmulti-step incremental learning, the trade-off between old knowledge preserving\nand new task learning becomes progressively more severe. Thus, the performance\nof regularization-based incremental object detectors gradually decays for\nsubsequent learning steps. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this performance\ndecay on multi-step incremental detection tasks by proposing a dilatable\nincremental object detector (DIODE). For the task-shared parameters, our method\nadaptively penalizes the changes of important weights for previous tasks. At\nthe same time, the structure of the model is dilated or expanded by a limited\nnumber of task-specific parameters to promote new task learning. Extensive\nexperiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets demonstrate substantial\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art methods. Notably, compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods, our method achieves up to 6.0% performance\nimprovement by increasing the number of parameters by just 1.2% for each newly\nlearned task.",

          "description": "With the availability of many datasets tailored for autonomous driving in\nreal-world urban scenes, semantic segmentation for urban driving scenes\nachieves significant progress. However, semantic segmentation for off-road,\nunstructured environments is not widely studied. Directly applying existing\nsegmentation networks often results in performance degradation as they cannot\novercome intrinsic problems in such environments, such as illumination changes.\nIn this paper, a built-in memory module for semantic segmentation is proposed\nto overcome these problems. The memory module stores significant\nrepresentations of training images as memory items. In addition to the encoder\nembedding like items together, the proposed memory module is specifically\ndesigned to cluster together instances of the same class even when there are\nsignificant variances in embedded features. Therefore, it makes segmentation\nnetworks better deal with unexpected illumination changes. A triplet loss is\nused in training to minimize redundancy in storing discriminative\nrepresentations of the memory module. The proposed memory module is general so\nthat it can be adopted in a variety of networks. We conduct experiments on the\nRobot Unstructured Ground Driving (RUGD) dataset and RELLIS dataset, which are\ncollected from off-road, unstructured natural environments. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed memory module improves the performance of\nexisting segmentation networks and contributes to capturing unclear objects\nover various off-road, unstructured natural scenes with equivalent\ncomputational cost and network parameters. As the proposed method can be\nintegrated into compact networks, it presents a viable approach for\nresource-limited small autonomous platforms.",

          "description": "In clinical practice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with multiple\ncontrasts is usually acquired in a single study to assess different properties\nof the same region of interest in human body. The whole acquisition process can\nbe accelerated by having one or more modalities under-sampled in the k-space.\nRecent researches demonstrate that, considering the redundancy between\ndifferent contrasts or modalities, a target MRI modality under-sampled in the\nk-space can be better reconstructed with the helps from a fully-sampled\nsequence (i.e., the reference modality). It implies that, in the same study of\nthe same subject, multiple sequences can be utilized together toward the\npurpose of highly efficient multi-modal reconstruction. However, we find that\nmulti-modal reconstruction can be negatively affected by subtle spatial\nmisalignment between different sequences, which is actually common in clinical\npractice. In this paper, we integrate the spatial alignment network with\nreconstruction, to improve the quality of the reconstructed target modality.\nSpecifically, the spatial alignment network estimates the spatial misalignment\nbetween the fully-sampled reference and the under-sampled target images, and\nwarps the reference image accordingly. Then, the aligned fully-sampled\nreference image joins the under-sampled target image in the reconstruction\nnetwork, to produce the high-quality target image. Considering the contrast\ndifference between the target and the reference, we particularly design the\ncross-modality-synthesis-based registration loss, in combination with the\nreconstruction loss, to jointly train the spatial alignment network and the\nreconstruction network. Our experiments on both clinical MRI and multi-coil\nk-space raw data demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our spatial\nalignment network.

          "description": "Brain aging, and more specifically the difference between the chronological\nand the biological age of a person, may be a promising biomarker for\nidentifying neurodegenerative diseases. For this purpose accurate prediction is\nimportant but the localisation of the areas that play a significant role in the\nprediction is also crucial, in order to gain clinicians' trust and reassurance\nabout the performance of a prediction model. Most interpretability methods are\nfocused on classification tasks and cannot be directly transferred to\nregression tasks. In this study, we focus on the task of brain age regression\nfrom 3D brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) images using a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork, termed prediction model. We interpret its predictions by extracting\nimportance maps, which discover the parts of the brain that are the most\nimportant for brain age. In order to do so, we assume that voxels that are not\nuseful for the regression are resilient to noise addition. We implement a noise\nmodel which aims to add as much noise as possible to the input without harming\nthe performance of the prediction model. We average the importance maps of the\nsubjects and end up with a population-based importance map, which displays the\nregions of the brain that are influential for the task. We test our method on\n13,750 3D brain MR images from the UK Biobank, and our findings are consistent\nwith the existing neuropathology literature, highlighting that the hippocampus\nand the ventricles are the most relevant regions for brain aging.",

However, the existing\nmodels require complex architectures or redundant computational resources to\ntrade with the acceptable accuracy. To tackle this limitation, this paper\nproposes HandFoldingNet, an accurate and efficient hand pose estimator that\nregresses the hand joint locations from the normalized 3D hand point cloud\ninput. The proposed model utilizes a folding-based decoder that folds a given\n2D hand skeleton into the corresponding joint coordinates.

The\nquery expression in referring segmentation typically indicates the target\nobject by describing its relationship with others. Therefore, to find the\ntarget one among all instances in the image, the model must have a holistic\nunderstanding of the whole image. To achieve this, we reformulate referring\nsegmentation as a direct attention problem: finding the region in the image\nwhere the query language expression is most attended to. We introduce\ntransformer and multi-head attention to build a network with an encoder-decoder\nattention mechanism architecture that \"queries\" the given image with the\nlanguage expression. Furthermore, we propose a Query Generation Module, which\nproduces multiple sets of queries with different attention weights that\nrepresent the diversified comprehensions of the language expression from\ndifferent aspects. At the same time, to find the best way from these\ndiversified comprehensions based on visual clues, we further propose a Query\nBalance Module to adaptively select the output features of these queries for a\nbetter mask generation.

          "description": "Using publicly available data to determine the performance of methodological\ncontributions is important as it facilitates reproducibility and allows\nscrutiny of the published results. In lung nodule classification, for example,\nmany works report results on the publicly available LIDC dataset. In theory,\nthis should allow a direct comparison of the performance of proposed methods\nand assess the impact of individual contributions. When analyzing seven recent\nworks, however, we find that each employs a different data selection process,\nleading to largely varying total number of samples and ratios between benign\nand malignant cases. As each subset will have different characteristics with\nvarying difficulty for classification, a direct comparison between the proposed\nmethods is thus not always possible, nor fair. We study the particular effect\nof truthing when aggregating labels from multiple experts. We show that\nspecific choices can have severe impact on the data distribution where it may\nbe possible to achieve superior performance on one sample distribution but not\non another. While we show that we can further improve on the state-of-the-art\non one sample selection, we also find that on a more challenging sample\nselection, on the same database, the more advanced models underperform with\nrespect to very simple baseline methods, highlighting that the selected data\ndistribution may play an even more important role than the model architecture.\nThis raises concerns about the validity of claimed methodological\ncontributions.

          "description": "Open-set semi-supervised learning (open-set SSL) investigates a challenging\nbut practical scenario where out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are contained in\nthe unlabeled data. While the mainstream technique seeks to completely filter\nout the OOD samples for semi-supervised learning (SSL), we propose a novel\ntraining mechanism that could effectively exploit the presence of OOD data for\nenhanced feature learning while avoiding its adverse impact on the SSL. We\nachieve this goal by first introducing a warm-up training that leverages all\nthe unlabeled data, including both the in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples.\nSpecifically, we perform a pretext task that enforces our feature extractor to\nobtain a high-level semantic understanding of the training images, leading to\nmore discriminative features that can benefit the downstream tasks. Since the\nOOD samples are inevitably detrimental to SSL, we propose a novel cross-modal\nmatching strategy to detect OOD samples. Instead of directly applying binary\nclassification, we train the network to predict whether the data sample is\nmatched to an assigned one-hot class label. The appeal of the proposed\ncross-modal matching over binary classification is the ability to generate a\ncompatible feature space that aligns with the core classification task.\nExtensive experiments show that our approach substantially lifts the\nperformance on open-set SSL and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large\nmargin.",

Unfortunately, the ground is not\nflat, as it features steep slopes; bumpy roads; or objects, such as curbs,\nflower beds, and so forth. To tackle the problem, this paper presents a novel\nground segmentation method called \\textit{Patchwork}, which is robust for\naddressing the under-segmentation problem and operates at more than 40 Hz. In\nthis paper, a point cloud is encoded into a Concentric Zone Model-based\nrepresentation to assign an appropriate density of cloud points among bins in a\nway that is not computationally complex. This is followed by Region-wise Ground\nPlane Fitting, which is performed to estimate the partial ground for each bin.\nFinally, Ground Likelihood Estimation is introduced to dramatically reduce\nfalse positives. As experimentally verified on SemanticKITTI and rough terrain\ndatasets, our proposed method yields promising performance compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods, showing faster speed compared with existing plane\nfitting--based methods.

          "description": "Two-stage methods have dominated Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection for\nseveral years. Recently, one-stage HOI detection methods have become popular.\nIn this paper, we aim to explore the essential pros and cons of two-stage and\none-stage methods. With this as the goal, we find that conventional two-stage\nmethods mainly suffer from positioning positive interactive human-object pairs,\nwhile one-stage methods are challenging to make an appropriate trade-off on\nmulti-task learning, i.e., object detection, and interaction classification.\nTherefore, a core problem is how to take the essence and discard the dregs from\nthe conventional two types of methods. To this end, we propose a novel\none-stage framework with disentangling human-object detection and interaction\nclassification in a cascade manner. In detail, we first design a human-object\npair generator based on a state-of-the-art one-stage HOI detector by removing\nthe interaction classification module or head and then design a relatively\nisolated interaction classifier to classify each human-object pair. Two cascade\ndecoders in our proposed framework can focus on one specific task, detection or\ninteraction classification. In terms of the specific implementation, we adopt a\ntransformer-based HOI detector as our base model.

          "description": "While state-of-the-art 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) achieve very\ngood results on action recognition datasets, they are computationally very\nexpensive and require many GFLOPs. While the GFLOPs of a 3D CNN can be\ndecreased by reducing the temporal feature resolution within the network, there\nis no setting that is optimal for all input clips. In this work, we therefore\nintroduce a differentiable Similarity Guided Sampling (SGS) module, which can\nbe plugged into any existing 3D CNN architecture. SGS empowers 3D CNNs by\nlearning the similarity of temporal features and grouping similar features\ntogether. As a result, the temporal feature resolution is not anymore static\nbut it varies for each input video clip. By integrating SGS as an additional\nlayer within current 3D CNNs, we can convert them into much more efficient 3D\nCNNs with adaptive temporal feature resolutions (ATFR). Our evaluations show\nthat the proposed module improves the state-of-the-art by reducing the\ncomputational cost (GFLOPs) by half while preserving or even improving the\naccuracy. We evaluate our module by adding it to multiple state-of-the-art 3D\nCNNs on various datasets such as Kinetics-600, Kinetics-400, mini-Kinetics,\nSomething-Something V2, UCF101, and HMDB51.",

          "description": "Text-based image retrieval has seen considerable progress in recent years.\nHowever, the performance of existing methods suffers in real life since the\nuser is likely to provide an incomplete description of an image, which often\nleads to results filled with false positives that fit the incomplete\ndescription. In this work, we introduce the partial-query problem and\nextensively analyze its influence on text-based image retrieval. Previous\ninteractive methods tackle the problem by passively receiving users' feedback\nto supplement the incomplete query iteratively, which is time-consuming and\nrequires heavy user effort. Instead, we propose a novel retrieval framework\nthat conducts the interactive process in an Ask-and-Confirm fashion, where AI\nactively searches for discriminative details missing in the current query, and\nusers only need to confirm AI's proposal. Specifically, we propose an\nobject-based interaction to make the interactive retrieval more user-friendly\nand present a reinforcement-learning-based policy to search for discriminative\nobjects. Furthermore, since fully-supervised training is often infeasible due\nto the difficulty of obtaining human-machine dialog data, we present a\nweakly-supervised training strategy that needs no human-annotated dialogs other\nthan a text-image dataset.

          "description": "Successful continual learning of new knowledge would enable intelligent\nsystems to recognize more and more classes of objects. However, current\nintelligent systems often fail to correctly recognize previously learned\nclasses of objects when updated to learn new classes. It is widely believed\nthat such downgraded performance is solely due to the catastrophic forgetting\nof previously learned knowledge. In this study, we argue that the class\nconfusion phenomena may also play a role in downgrading the classification\nperformance during continual learning, i.e., the high similarity between new\nclasses and any previously learned classes would also cause the classifier to\nmake mistakes in recognizing these old classes, even if the knowledge of these\nold classes is not forgotten. To alleviate the class confusion issue, we\npropose a discriminative distillation strategy to help the classify well learn\nthe discriminative features between confusing classes during continual\nlearning. Experiments on multiple natural image classification tasks support\nthat the proposed distillation strategy, when combined with existing methods,\nis effective in further improving continual learning.",

          "description": "The class activation mapping, or CAM, has been the cornerstone of feature\nattribution methods for multiple vision tasks. Its simplicity and effectiveness\nhave led to wide applications in the explanation of visual predictions and\nweakly-supervised localization tasks. However, CAM has its own shortcomings.\nThe computation of attribution maps relies on ad-hoc calibration steps that are\nnot part of the training computational graph, making it difficult for us to\nunderstand the real meaning of the attribution values. In this paper, we\nimprove CAM by explicitly incorporating a latent variable encoding the location\nof the cue for recognition in the formulation, thereby subsuming the\nattribution map into the training computational graph. The resulting model,\nclass activation latent mapping, or CALM, is trained with the\nexpectation-maximization algorithm.

          "description": "Although using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as backbones achieves\ngreat successes in computer vision, this work investigates a simple backbone\nnetwork useful for many dense prediction tasks without convolutions. Unlike the\nrecently-proposed Transformer model (e.g., ViT) that is specially designed for\nimage classification, we propose Pyramid Vision Transformer~(PVT), which\novercomes the difficulties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction\ntasks. PVT has several merits compared to prior arts. (1) Different from ViT\nthat typically has low-resolution outputs and high computational and memory\ncost, PVT can be not only trained on dense partitions of the image to achieve\nhigh output resolution, which is important for dense predictions but also using\na progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce computations of large feature maps.\n(2) PVT inherits the advantages from both CNN and Transformer, making it a\nunified backbone in various vision tasks without convolutions by simply\nreplacing CNN backbones. (3) We validate PVT by conducting extensive\nexperiments, showing that it boosts the performance of many downstream tasks,\ne.g., object detection, semantic, and instance segmentation. For example, with\na comparable number of parameters, RetinaNet+PVT achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO\ndataset, surpassing RetinNet+ResNet50 (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute AP.

Due to the limited memory of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs),\nmost current 3D GAN models are trained on low-resolution medical images, these\nmodels either cannot scale to high-resolution or are prone to patchy artifacts.\nIn this work, we propose a novel end-to-end GAN architecture that can generate\nhigh-resolution 3D images. We achieve this goal by separating training and\ninference. During training, we adopt a hierarchical structure that\nsimultaneously generates a low-resolution version of the image and a randomly\nselected sub-volume of the high-resolution image. The hierarchical design has\ntwo advantages: First, the memory demand for training on high-resolution images\nis amortized among subvolumes. Furthermore, anchoring the high-resolution\nsubvolumes to a single low-resolution image ensures anatomical consistency\nbetween subvolumes. During inference, our model can directly generate full\nhigh-resolution images. We also incorporate an encoder with a similar\nhierarchical structure into the model to extract features from the images.\nExperiments on 3D thorax CT and brain MRI demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms state of the art in image generation.

          "description": "Deep networks for Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) have achieved promising\nperformance recently and it is of great importance to further understand the\ninterpretability of these networks. Existing methods attempt to provide posthoc\nexplanations by investigating visual cues, which may not explore the internal\nrepresentations learned by deep networks. In this paper, we find that some\nhidden units of the network are selective to certain ranges of depth, and thus\nsuch behavior can be served as a way to interpret the internal representations.\nBased on our observations, we quantify the interpretability of a deep MDE\nnetwork by the depth selectivity of its hidden units. Moreover, we then propose\na method to train interpretable MDE deep networks without changing their\noriginal architectures, by assigning a depth range for each unit to select.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method is able to enhance the\ninterpretability of deep MDE networks by largely improving the depth\nselectivity of their units, while not harming or even improving the depth\nestimation accuracy. We further provide a comprehensive analysis to show the\nreliability of selective units, the applicability of our method on different\nlayers, models, and datasets, and a demonstration on analysis of model error.\nSource code and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/youzunzhi/InterpretableMDE .",

          "description": "Tracking multiple objects individually differs from tracking groups of\nrelated objects. When an object is a part of the group, its trajectory depends\non the trajectories of the other group members. Most of the current\nstate-of-the-art trackers follow the approach of tracking each object\nindependently, with the mechanism to handle the overlapping trajectories where\nnecessary. Such an approach does not take inter-object relations into account,\nwhich may cause unreliable tracking for the members of the groups, especially\nin crowded scenarios, where individual cues become unreliable due to\nocclusions. To overcome these limitations and to extend such trackers to\ncrowded scenes, we propose a plug-in Relation Encoding Module (REM). REM\nencodes relations between tracked objects by running a message passing over a\ncorresponding spatio-temporal graph, computing relation embeddings for the\ntracked objects. Our experiments on MOT17 and MOT20 demonstrate that the\nbaseline tracker improves its results after a simple extension with REM. The\nproposed module allows for tracking severely or even fully occluded objects by\nutilizing relational cues.",

          "description": "Abstract reasoning, i.e., inferring complicated patterns from given\nobservations, is a central building block of artificial general intelligence.\nWhile humans find the answer by either eliminating wrong candidates or first\nconstructing the answer, prior deep neural network (DNN)-based methods focus on\nthe former discriminative approach. This paper aims to design a framework for\nthe latter approach and bridge the gap between artificial and human\nintelligence. To this end, we propose logic-guided generation (LoGe), a novel\ngenerative DNN framework that reduces abstract reasoning as an optimization\nproblem in propositional logic. LoGe is composed of three steps: extract\npropositional variables from images, reason the answer variables with a logic\nlayer, and reconstruct the answer image from the variables. We demonstrate that\nLoGe outperforms the black box DNN frameworks for generative abstract reasoning\nunder the RAVEN benchmark, i.e., reconstructing answers based on capturing\ncorrect rules of various attributes from observations.",

Although ReID is developing at a considerably rapid pace,\nthere is currently no processing method for the ReID task in multiple\nscenarios. However, such processing method is required in real life scenarios,\nsuch as those involving security. In the present study, a new ReID scenario was\nexplored, which differs in terms of perspective, background, and pose(walking\nor cycling). Obviously, ordinary ReID processing methods cannot effectively\nhandle such a scenario, with the introduction of image datasets being the\noptimal solution, in addition to being considerably expensive.\n\nTo solve the aforementioned problem, a simple and effective method to\ngenerate images in several new scenarios was proposed, which is names the Copy\nand Paste method based on Pose(CPP). The CPP method is based on key point\ndetection, using copy as paste, to composite a new semantic image dataset in\ntwo different semantic image datasets. As an example, pedestrains and bicycles\ncan be used to generate several images that show the same person riding on\ndifferent bicycles. The CPP method is suitable for ReID tasks in new scenarios\nand outperforms the traditional methods when applied to the original datasets\nin original ReID tasks. To be specific, the CPP method can also perform better\nin terms of generalization for third-party public dataset.

          "description": "To train accurate deep object detectors under the extreme\nforeground-background imbalance, heuristic sampling methods are always\nnecessary, which either re-sample a subset of all training samples (hard\nsampling methods, \\eg biased sampling, OHEM), or use all training samples but\nre-weight them discriminatively (soft sampling methods, \\eg Focal Loss, GHM).\nIn this paper, we challenge the necessity of such hard/soft sampling methods\nfor training accurate deep object detectors. While previous studies have shown\nthat training detectors without heuristic sampling methods would significantly\ndegrade accuracy, we reveal that this degradation comes from an unreasonable\nclassification gradient magnitude caused by the imbalance, rather than a lack\nof re-sampling/re-weighting. Motivated by our discovery, we propose a simple\nyet effective \\emph{Sampling-Free} mechanism to achieve a reasonable\nclassification gradient magnitude by initialization and loss scaling. Unlike\nheuristic sampling methods with multiple hyperparameters, our Sampling-Free\nmechanism is fully data diagnostic, without laborious hyperparameters\nsearching. We verify the effectiveness of our method in training anchor-based\nand anchor-free object detectors, where our method always achieves higher\ndetection accuracy than heuristic sampling methods on COCO and PASCAL VOC\ndatasets.

          "description": "In recent years, computer vision algorithms have become more and more\npowerful, which enabled technologies such as autonomous driving to evolve with\nrapid pace. However, current algorithms mainly share one limitation: They rely\non directly visible objects. This is a major drawback compared to human\nbehavior, where indirect visual cues caused by the actual object (e.g.,\nshadows) are already used intuitively to retrieve information or anticipate\noccurring objects. While driving at night, this performance deficit becomes\neven more obvious: Humans already process the light artifacts caused by\noncoming vehicles to assume their future appearance, whereas current object\ndetection systems rely on the oncoming vehicle's direct visibility. Based on\nprevious work in this subject, we present with this paper a complete system\ncapable of solving the task to providently detect oncoming vehicles at\nnighttime based on their caused light artifacts. For that, we outline the full\nalgorithm architecture ranging from the detection of light artifacts in the\nimage space, localizing the objects in the three-dimensional space, and\nverifying the objects over time. To demonstrate the applicability, we deploy\nthe system in a test vehicle and use the information of providently detected\nvehicles to control the glare-free high beam system proactively. Using this\nexperimental setting, we quantify the time benefit that the provident vehicle\ndetection system provides compared to an in-production computer vision system.\nAdditionally, the glare-free high beam use case provides a real-time and\nreal-world visualization interface of the detection results. With this\ncontribution, we want to put awareness on the unconventional sensing task of\nprovident object detection and further close the performance gap between human\nbehavior and computer vision algorithms in order to bring autonomous and\nautomated driving a step forward.",

          "description": "Existing blind image super-resolution (SR) methods mostly assume blur kernels\nare spatially invariant across the whole image. However, such an assumption is\nrarely applicable for real images whose blur kernels are usually spatially\nvariant due to factors such as object motion and out-of-focus. Hence, existing\nblind SR methods would inevitably give rise to poor performance in real\napplications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a mutual affine\nnetwork (MANet) for spatially variant kernel estimation. Specifically, MANet\nhas two distinctive features. First, it has a moderate receptive field so as to\nkeep the locality of degradation. Second, it involves a new mutual affine\nconvolution (MAConv) layer that enhances feature expressiveness without\nincreasing receptive field, model size and computation burden.

          "description": "Vision transformers have attracted much attention from computer vision\nresearchers as they are not restricted to the spatial inductive bias of\nConvNets. However, although Transformer-based backbones have achieved much\nprogress on ImageNet classification, it is still unclear whether the learned\nrepresentations are as transferable as or even more transferable than ConvNets'\nfeatures. To address this point, we systematically investigate the transfer\nlearning ability of ConvNets and vision transformers in 15 single-task and\nmulti-task performance evaluations. Given the strong correlation between the\nperformance of pre-trained models and transfer learning, we include 2 residual\nConvNets (i.e., R-101x3 and R-152x4) and 3 Transformer-based visual backbones\n(i.e., ViT-B, ViT-L and Swin-B), which have close error rates on ImageNet, that\nindicate similar transfer learning performance on downstream datasets.\n\nWe observe consistent advantages of Transformer-based backbones on 13\ndownstream tasks (out of 15), including but not limited to fine-grained\nclassification, scene recognition (classification, segmentation and depth\nestimation), open-domain classification, face recognition, etc. More\nspecifically, we find that two ViT models heavily rely on whole network\nfine-tuning to achieve performance gains while Swin Transformer does not have\nsuch a requirement. Moreover, vision transformers behave more robustly in\nmulti-task learning, i.e., bringing more improvements when managing mutually\nbeneficial tasks and reducing performance losses when tackling irrelevant\ntasks. We hope our discoveries can facilitate the exploration and exploitation\nof vision transformers in the future.",

          "description": "Given a textual phrase and an image, the visual grounding problem is defined\nas the task of locating the content of the image referenced by the sentence. It\nis a challenging task that has several real-world applications in\nhuman-computer interaction, image-text reference resolution, and video-text\nreference resolution. In the last years, several works have addressed this\nproblem with heavy and complex models that try to capture visual-textual\ndependencies better than before. These models are typically constituted by two\nmain components that focus on how to learn useful multi-modal features for\ngrounding and how to improve the predicted bounding box of the visual mention,\nrespectively. Finding the right learning balance between these two sub-tasks is\nnot easy, and the current models are not necessarily optimal with respect to\nthis issue. In this work, we propose a model that, although using a simple\nmulti-modal feature fusion component, is able to achieve a higher accuracy than\nstate-of-the-art models thanks to the adoption of a more effective loss\nfunction, based on the classes probabilities, that reach, in the considered\ndatasets, a better learning balance between the two sub-tasks mentioned above.",

          "description": "Normalizing flows have recently demonstrated promising results for low-level\nvision tasks. For image super-resolution (SR), it learns to predict diverse\nphoto-realistic high-resolution (HR) images from the low-resolution (LR) image\nrather than learning a deterministic mapping. For image rescaling, it achieves\nhigh accuracy by jointly modelling the downscaling and upscaling processes.\nWhile existing approaches employ specialized techniques for these two tasks, we\nset out to unify them in a single formulation. In this paper, we propose the\nhierarchical conditional flow (HCFlow) as a unified framework for image SR and\nimage rescaling. More specifically, HCFlow learns a bijective mapping between\nHR and LR image pairs by modelling the distribution of the LR image and the\nrest high-frequency component simultaneously. In particular, the high-frequency\ncomponent is conditional on the LR image in a hierarchical manner. To further\nenhance the performance, other losses such as perceptual loss and GAN loss are\ncombined with the commonly used negative log-likelihood loss in training.\nExtensive experiments on general image SR, face image SR and image rescaling\nhave demonstrated that the proposed HCFlow achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.",

          "description": "Medical images, especially volumetric images, are of high resolution and\noften exceed the capacity of standard desktop GPUs. As a result, most deep\nlearning-based medical image analysis tasks require the input images to be\ndownsampled, often substantially, before these can be fed to a neural network.\nHowever, downsampling can lead to a loss of image quality, which is undesirable\nespecially in reconstruction tasks, where the fine geometric details need to be\npreserved. In this paper, we propose that high-resolution images can be\nreconstructed in a coarse-to-fine fashion, where a deep learning algorithm is\nonly responsible for generating a coarse representation of the image, which\nconsumes moderate GPU memory. For producing the high-resolution outcome, we\npropose two novel methods: learned voxel rearrangement of the coarse output and\nhierarchical image synthesis. Compared to the coarse output, the\nhigh-resolution counterpart allows for smooth surface triangulation, which can\nbe 3D-printed in the highest possible quality. Experiments of this paper are\ncarried out on the dataset of AutoImplant 2021\n(https://autoimplant2021.grand-challenge.org/), a MICCAI challenge on cranial\nimplant design.

Our contributions are twofold: 1) We develop a physically valid fog\nsimulation method that is applicable to any LiDAR dataset.

These\npartially synthetic data can be used to improve the robustness of several\nperception methods, such as 3D object detection and tracking or simultaneous\nlocalization and mapping, on real foggy data. 2) Through extensive experiments\nwith several state-of-the-art detection approaches, we show that our fog\nsimulation can be leveraged to significantly improve the performance for 3D\nobject detection in the presence of fog.

Although some works propose to\nbuild cross-reference between support and query images, their extraction of\nquery information still depends on the support images. We here propose to\nextract the information from the query itself independently to benefit the\nfew-shot segmentation task. To this end, we first propose a prior extractor to\nlearn the query information from the unlabeled images with our proposed\nglobal-local contrastive learning. Then, we extract a set of predetermined\npriors via this prior extractor. With the obtained priors, we generate the\nprior region maps for query images, which locate the objects, as guidance to\nperform cross interaction with support features. In such a way, the extraction\nof query information is detached from the support branch, overcoming the\nlimitation by support, and could obtain more informative query clues to achieve\nbetter interaction.

By integrating 2D information efficiently\nand learning a mapping that lifts the 2D representation to 3D, we make the\nfirst attempt to reconstruct a 3D try-on mesh only taking the target clothing\nand a person image as inputs. The proposed M3D-VTON includes three modules: 1)\nThe Monocular Prediction Module (MPM) that estimates an initial full-body depth\nmap and accomplishes 2D clothes-person alignment through a novel two-stage\nwarping procedure; 2) The Depth Refinement Module (DRM) that refines the\ninitial body depth to produce more detailed pleat and face characteristics; 3)\nThe Texture Fusion Module (TFM) that fuses the warped clothing with the\nnon-target body part to refine the results. We also construct a high-quality\nsynthesized Monocular-to-3D virtual try-on dataset, in which each person image\nis associated with a front and a back depth map.

          "description": "Medical imaging technologies, including computed tomography (CT) or chest\nX-Ray (CXR), are largely employed to facilitate the diagnosis of the COVID-19.\nSince manual report writing is usually too time-consuming, a more intelligent\nauxiliary medical system that could generate medical reports automatically and\nimmediately is urgently needed. In this article, we propose to use the medical\nvisual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the\nCOVID-19 scans and generate the medical report automatically based on the\ndetected lesion regions. To produce more accurate medical reports and minimize\nthe visual-and-linguistic differences, this model adopts an alternate learning\nstrategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.\nTo be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the\nknowledge from medical texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize\nthe acquired knowledge for professional medical sentences generations through\nobservations of medical images. In practice, for automatic medical report\ngeneration on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical\nfindings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital\nof Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun\nYat-sen University, Zhuhai, China. Besides, to alleviate the insufficiency of\nthe COVID-19 training samples, our model was first trained on the large-scale\nChinese CX-CHR dataset and then transferred to the COVID-19 CT dataset for\nfurther fine-tuning. The experimental results showed that Medical-VLBERT\nachieved state-of-the-art performances on terminology prediction and report\ngeneration with the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset and the CX-CHR dataset.

          "description": "Background: Cervical cancer seriously affects the health of the female\nreproductive system. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) emerges as a\nnon-invasive, high-resolution imaging technology for cervical disease\ndetection. However, OCT image annotation is knowledge-intensive and\ntime-consuming, which impedes the training process of deep-learning-based\nclassification models. Objective: This study aims to develop a computer-aided\ndiagnosis (CADx) approach to classifying in-vivo cervical OCT images based on\nself-supervised learning. Methods: Besides high-level semantic features\nextracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed CADx approach\nleverages unlabeled cervical OCT images' texture features learned by\ncontrastive texture learning. We conducted ten-fold cross-validation on the OCT\nimage dataset from a multi-center clinical study on 733 patients from China.\nResults: In a binary classification task for detecting high-risk diseases,\nincluding high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and cervical\ncancer, our method achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.9798 Plus\nor Minus 0.0157 with a sensitivity of 91.17 Plus or Minus 4.99% and a\nspecificity of 93.96 Plus or Minus 4.72% for OCT image patches; also, it\noutperformed two out of four medical experts on the test set. Furthermore, our\nmethod achieved a 91.53% sensitivity and 97.37% specificity on an external\nvalidation dataset containing 287 3D OCT volumes from 118 Chinese patients in a\nnew hospital using a cross-shaped threshold voting strategy. Conclusion: The\nproposed contrastive-learning-based CADx method outperformed the end-to-end CNN\nmodels and provided better interpretability based on texture features, which\nholds great potential to be used in the clinical protocol of \"see-and-treat.\"",

          "description": "Many camera sensors use a dual-pixel (DP) design that operates as a\nrudimentary light field providing two sub-aperture views of a scene in a single\ncapture. The DP sensor was developed to improve how cameras perform autofocus.\nSince the DP sensor's introduction, researchers have found additional uses for\nthe DP data, such as depth estimation, reflection removal, and defocus\ndeblurring. We are interested in the latter task of defocus deblurring. In\nparticular, we propose a single-image deblurring network that incorporates the\ntwo sub-aperture views into a multi-task framework. Specifically, we show that\njointly learning to predict the two DP views from a single blurry input image\nimproves the network's ability to learn to deblur the image. Our experiments\nshow this multi-task strategy achieves +1dB PSNR improvement over\nstate-of-the-art defocus deblurring methods. In addition, our multi-task\nframework allows accurate DP-view synthesis (e.g., ~ 39dB PSNR) from the single\ninput image. These high-quality DP views can be used for other DP-based\napplications, such as reflection removal. As part of this effort, we have\ncaptured a new dataset of 7,059 high-quality images to support our training for\nthe DP-view synthesis task.

          "description": "Deep hashing has been widely applied to large-scale image retrieval by\nencoding high-dimensional data points into binary codes for efficient\nretrieval. Compared with pairwise/triplet similarity based hash learning,\ncentral similarity based hashing can more efficiently capture the global data\ndistribution. For multi-label image retrieval, however, previous methods only\nuse multiple hash centers with equal weights to generate one centroid as the\nlearning target, which ignores the relationship between the weights of hash\ncenters and the proportion of instance regions in the image. To address the\nabove issue, we propose a two-step alternative optimization approach,\nInstance-weighted Central Similarity (ICS), to automatically learn the center\nweight corresponding to a hash code. Firstly, we apply the maximum entropy\nregularizer to prevent one hash center from dominating the loss function, and\ncompute the center weights via projection gradient descent. Secondly, we update\nneural network parameters by standard back-propagation with fixed center\nweights. More importantly, the learned center weights can well reflect the\nproportion of foreground instances in the image. Our method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on the image retrieval benchmarks, and especially\nimproves the mAP by 1.6%-6.4% on the MS COCO dataset.",

          "description": "More than 90\\% of colorectal cancer is gradually transformed from colorectal\npolyps. In clinical practice, precise polyp segmentation provides important\ninformation in the early detection of colorectal cancer. Therefore, automatic\npolyp segmentation techniques are of great importance for both patients and\ndoctors. Most existing methods are based on U-shape structure and use\nelement-wise addition or concatenation to fuse different level features\nprogressively in decoder. However, both the two operations easily generate\nplenty of redundant information, which will weaken the complementarity between\ndifferent level features, resulting in inaccurate localization and blurred\nedges of polyps. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-scale\nsubtraction network (MSNet) to segment polyp from colonoscopy image.\nSpecifically, we first design a subtraction unit (SU) to produce the difference\nfeatures between adjacent levels in encoder. Then, we pyramidally equip the SUs\nat different levels with varying receptive fields, thereby obtaining rich\nmulti-scale difference information. In addition, we build a training-free\nnetwork \"LossNet\" to comprehensively supervise the polyp-aware features from\nbottom layer to top layer, which drives the MSNet to capture the detailed and\nstructural cues simultaneously. Extensive experiments on five benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our MSNet performs favorably against most\nstate-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics. Furthermore, MSNet\nruns at a real-time speed of $\\sim$70fps when processing a $352 \\times 352$\nimage.

Recently, a new problem of\ngenerating cloned or synthesized human voice of a person is emerging. AI-based\ndeep learning models can synthesize any person's voice requiring just a few\nseconds of audio. With the emerging threat of impersonation attacks using\ndeepfake videos and audios, new deepfake detectors are need that focuses on\nboth, video and audio. Detecting deepfakes is a challenging task and\nresearchers have made numerous attempts and proposed several deepfake detection\nmethods. To develop a good deepfake detector, a handsome amount of good quality\ndataset is needed that captures the real world scenarios. Many researchers have\ncontributed in this cause and provided several deepfake dataset, self generated\nand in-the-wild. However, almost all of these datasets either contains deepfake\nvideos or audio. Moreover, the recent deepfake datasets proposed by researchers\nhave racial bias issues. Hence, there is a crucial need of a good deepfake\nvideo and audio deepfake dataset. To fill this gap, we propose a novel\nAudio-Video Deepfake dataset (FakeAVCeleb) that not only contains deepfake\nvideos but respective synthesized cloned audios as well. We generated our\ndataset using recent most popular deepfake generation methods and the videos\nand audios are perfectly lip-synced with each other. To generate a more\nrealistic dataset, we selected real YouTube videos of celebrities having four\nracial backgrounds (Caucasian, Black, East Asian and South Asian) to counter\nthe racial bias issue. Lastly, we propose a novel multimodal detection method\nthat detects deepfake videos and audios based on our multimodal Audio-Video\ndeepfake dataset.",

Our\ncontribution is three-fold. First, we represent the class correlation by word\nembeddings to capture the fine-grained semantic and latent statistical\nconcurrency. Second, we equip the MLL with a graph convolutional network to\nexplore the inner and outer relationship among categories. Third, we propose a\nnovel cluster relabel-based contrastive learning algorithm to encourage the\ndivergence among ambiguous classes. Extensive validation was performed on our\nlarge in-house dataset. Our approach reports the highest accuracy as 90.25% for\nstandard planes labeling, 85.59% for planes and structures labeling and mAP as\n94.63%. The proposed MLL scheme provides a novel perspective for standard plane\nrecognition and can be easily extended to other medical image classification\ntasks.",

          "description": "Location and appearance are the key cues for video object segmentation. Many\nsources such as RGB, depth, optical flow and static saliency can provide useful\ninformation about the objects. However, existing approaches only utilize the\nRGB or RGB and optical flow. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-source\nfusion network for zero-shot video object segmentation. With the help of\ninteroceptive spatial attention module (ISAM), spatial importance of each\nsource is highlighted. Furthermore, we design a feature purification module\n(FPM) to filter the inter-source incompatible features. By the ISAM and FPM,\nthe multi-source features are effectively fused. In addition, we put forward an\nautomatic predictor selection network (APS) to select the better prediction of\neither the static saliency predictor or the moving object predictor in order to\nprevent over-reliance on the failed results caused by low-quality optical flow\nmaps.

          "description": "Existing efforts on Just noticeable difference (JND) estimation mainly\ndedicate to modeling the visibility masking effects of different factors in\nspatial and frequency domains, and then fusing them into an overall JND\nestimate. However, the overall visibility masking effect can be related with\nmore contributing factors beyond those have been considered in the literature\nand it is also insufficiently accurate to formulate the masking effect even for\nan individual factor. Moreover, the potential interactions among different\nmasking effects are also difficult to be characterized with a simple fusion\nmodel. In this work, we turn to a dramatically different way to address these\nproblems with a top-down design philosophy. Instead of formulating and fusing\nmultiple masking effects in a bottom-up way, the proposed JND estimation model\ndirectly generates a critical perceptual lossless (CPL) image from a top-down\nperspective and calculates the difference map between the original image and\nthe CPL image as the final JND map. Given an input image, an adaptively\ncritical point (perceptual lossless threshold), defined as the minimum number\nof spectral components in Karhunen-Lo\\'{e}ve Transform (KLT) used for\nperceptual lossless image reconstruction, is derived by exploiting the\nconvergence characteristics of KLT coefficient energy. Then, the CPL image can\nbe reconstructed via inverse KLT according to the derived critical point.\nFinally, the difference map between the original image and the CPL image is\ncalculated as the JND map. The performance of the proposed JND model is\nevaluated with two applications including JND-guided noise injection and\nJND-guided image compression. Experimental results have demonstrated that our\nproposed JND model can achieve better performance than several latest JND\nmodels.",

          "description": "Few-shot learning aims to recognize novel classes with few examples.\nPre-training based methods effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a\nfeature extractor and then fine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based\nmeta-learning. However, results show that the fine-tuning step makes marginal\nimprovements. In this paper, 1) we figure out the reason, i.e., in the\npre-trained feature space, the base classes already form compact clusters while\nnovel classes spread as groups with large variances, which implies that\nfine-tuning feature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning\nfeature extractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes.\nConsequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based meta-learning\nframework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge (i.e.,\nclass-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative features\nfor seen attributes as priors. Second, a part/attribute transfer network is\ndesigned to learn to infer the representative features for unseen attributes as\nsupplementary priors. Finally, a prototype completion network is devised to\nlearn to complete prototypes with these priors. Moreover, to avoid the\nprototype completion error, we further develop a Gaussian based prototype\nfusion strategy that fuses the mean-based and completed prototypes by\nexploiting the unlabeled samples. Extensive experiments show that our method:\n(i) obtains more accurate prototypes; (ii) achieves superior performance on\nboth inductive and transductive FSL settings.",

In particular, such attacks cause serious problems in medical\nimaging. Given that computer-based systems are generally operated under a\nblack-box condition in which only queries on inputs are allowed and outputs are\naccessible, the impact of UAPs seems to be limited because well-used algorithms\nfor generating UAPs are limited to a white-box condition in which adversaries\ncan access the model weights and loss gradients. Nevertheless, we demonstrate\nthat UAPs are easily generatable using a relatively small dataset under\nblack-box conditions.

Black-box UAPs can be used to conduct both non-targeted\nand targeted attacks. Overall, the black-box UAPs showed high attack success\nrates (40% to 90%), although some of them had relatively low success rates\nbecause the method only utilizes limited information to generate UAPs. The\nvulnerability of black-box UAPs was observed in several model architectures.\nThe results indicate that adversaries can also generate UAPs through a simple\nprocedure under the black-box condition to foil or control DNN-based medical\nimage diagnoses, and that UAPs are a more realistic security threat.",

          "description": "We tackle the problem of localizing temporal intervals of actions with only a\nsingle frame label for each action instance for training. Owing to label\nsparsity, existing work fails to learn action completeness, resulting in\nfragmentary action predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,\nwhere dense pseudo-labels are generated to provide completeness guidance for\nthe model. Concretely, we first select pseudo background points to supplement\npoint-level action labels. Then, by taking the points as seeds, we search for\nthe optimal sequence that is likely to contain complete action instances while\nagreeing with the seeds. To learn completeness from the obtained sequence, we\nintroduce two novel losses that contrast action instances with background ones\nin terms of action score and feature similarity, respectively. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our completeness guidance indeed helps the model to\nlocate complete action instances, leading to large performance gains especially\nunder high IoU thresholds. Moreover, we demonstrate the superiority of our\nmethod over existing state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks: THUMOS'14,\nGTEA, BEOID, and ActivityNet. Notably, our method even performs comparably to\nrecent fully-supervised methods, at the 6 times cheaper annotation cost. Our\ncode is available at https://github.com/Pilhyeon.",

          "description": "We propose a compact and effective framework to fuse multimodal features at\nmultiple layers in a single network. The framework consists of two innovative\nfusion schemes. Firstly, unlike existing multimodal methods that necessitate\nindividual encoders for different modalities, we verify that multimodal\nfeatures can be learnt within a shared single network by merely maintaining\nmodality-specific batch normalization layers in the encoder, which also enables\nimplicit fusion via joint feature representation learning. Secondly, we propose\na bidirectional multi-layer fusion scheme, where multimodal features can be\nexploited progressively. To take advantage of such scheme, we introduce two\nasymmetric fusion operations including channel shuffle and pixel shift, which\nlearn different fused features with respect to different fusion directions.\nThese two operations are parameter-free and strengthen the multimodal feature\ninteractions across channels as well as enhance the spatial feature\ndiscrimination within channels. We conduct extensive experiments on semantic\nsegmentation and image translation tasks, based on three publicly available\ndatasets covering diverse modalities. Results indicate that our proposed\nframework is general, compact and is superior to state-of-the-art fusion\nframeworks.",

To overcome the real-world limitations of data collection,\nsimulating tactile response in a virtual environment comes as a desirable\ndirection of robotic research. In this paper, we propose Elastic Interaction of\nParticles (EIP) for tactile simulation. Most existing works model the tactile\nsensor as a rigid multi-body, which is incapable of reflecting the elastic\nproperty of the tactile sensor as well as characterizing the fine-grained\nphysical interaction between the two objects. By contrast, EIP models the\ntactile sensor as a group of coordinated particles, and the elastic property is\napplied to regulate the deformation of particles during contact. With the\ntactile simulation by EIP, we further propose a tactile-visual perception\nnetwork that enables information fusion between tactile data and visual images.\nThe perception network is based on a global-to-local fusion mechanism where\nmulti-scale tactile features are aggregated to the corresponding local region\nof the visual modality with the guidance of tactile positions and directions.\nThe fusion method exhibits superiority regarding the 3D geometric\nreconstruction task.",

Several math symbols are very\nsimilar in the writing style, such as dot and comma or 0, O, and o, which is a\nchallenge for HME recognition systems to handle without using contextual\ninformation. To address this problem, this paper presents a Transformer-based\nMath Language Model (TMLM). Based on the self-attention mechanism, the\nhigh-level representation of an input token in a sequence of tokens is computed\nby how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long\ndependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical\nexpression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of\napproximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the\nperplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e.,\nthe N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we\ncombine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition\nsystem using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates. The\nexpression rates on the testing sets of CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 were\nimproved by 2.97 and 0.83 percentage points, respectively.",

          "description": "Face recognition (FR) has made extraordinary progress owing to the\nadvancement of deep convolutional neural networks. However, demographic bias\namong different racial cohorts still challenges the practical face recognition\nsystem. The race factor has been proven to be a dilemma for fair FR (FFR) as\nthe subject-related specific attributes induce the classification bias whilst\ncarrying some useful cues for FR. To mitigate racial bias and meantime preserve\nrobust FR, we abstract face identity-related representation as a signal\ndenoising problem and propose a progressive cross transformer (PCT) method for\nfair face recognition. Originating from the signal decomposition theory, we\nattempt to decouple face representation into i) identity-related components and\nii) noisy/identity-unrelated components induced by race. As an extension of\nsignal subspace decomposition, we formulate face decoupling as a generalized\nfunctional expression model to cross-predict face identity and race\ninformation. The face expression model is further concretized by designing dual\ncross-transformers to distill identity-related components and suppress racial\nnoises. In order to refine face representation, we take a progressive face\ndecoupling way to learn identity/race-specific transformations, so that\nidentity-unrelated components induced by race could be better disentangled. We\nevaluate the proposed PCT on the public fair face recognition benchmarks (BFW,\nRFW) and verify that PCT is capable of mitigating bias in face recognition\nwhile achieving state-of-the-art FR performance. Besides, visualization results\nalso show that the attention maps in PCT can well reveal the\nrace-related/biased facial regions.",

          "description": "Perceiving obstacles and avoiding collisions is fundamental to the safe\noperation of a robot system, particularly when the robot must operate in highly\ndynamic human environments. Proximity detection using on-robot sensors can be\nused to avoid or mitigate impending collisions.

In this paper, we introduce the\nphenomenon of the Leaky Surface Wave (LSW), a novel sensing modality, and\npresent AuraSense, a proximity detection system using the LSW. AuraSense is the\nfirst system to realize no-dead-spot proximity sensing for robot arms.

We further\nintroduce a set of signal processing techniques and a lightweight neural\nnetwork to address the unique challenges in using the LSW for proximity\nsensing. Finally, we demonstrate a prototype system consisting of a single\npiezoelectric element pair on a robot manipulator, which validates our design.\nWe conducted several micro benchmark experiments and performed more than 2000\non-robot proximity detection trials with various potential robot arm materials,\ncolliding objects, approach patterns, and robot movement patterns.

          "description": "Binaural audio gives the listener the feeling of being in the recording place\nand enhances the immersive experience if coupled with AR/VR. But the problem\nwith binaural audio recording is that it requires a specialized setup which is\nnot possible to fabricate within handheld devices as compared to traditional\nmono audio that can be recorded with a single microphone. In order to overcome\nthis drawback, prior works have tried to uplift the mono recorded audio to\nbinaural audio as a post processing step conditioning on the visual input. But\nall the prior approaches missed other most important information required for\nthe task, i.e. distance of different sound producing objects from the recording\nsetup. In this work, we argue that the depth map of the scene can act as a\nproxy for encoding distance information of objects in the scene and show that\nadding depth features along with image features improves the performance both\nqualitatively and quantitatively. We propose a novel encoder-decoder\narchitecture, where we use a hierarchical attention mechanism to encode the\nimage and depth feature extracted from individual transformer backbone, with\naudio features at each layer of the decoder.",

Recent advances in volumetric neural rendering, such as neural\nradiance fields (NeRF), has enabled the photorealistic novel view synthesis of\nstatic scenes with impressive results. However, modeling dynamic and\ncontrollable objects as part of a scene with such scene representations is\nstill challenging. In this work, we design a system that enables both novel\nview synthesis for portrait video, including the human subject and the scene\nbackground, and explicit control of the facial expressions through a\nlow-dimensional expression representation. We leverage the expression space of\na 3D morphable face model (3DMM) to represent the distribution of human facial\nexpressions, and use it to condition the NeRF volumetric function. Furthermore,\nwe impose a spatial prior brought by 3DMM fitting to guide the network to learn\ndisentangled control for scene appearance and facial actions.

However, studies have shown the potential of pruning as\na form of regularization, which reduces overfitting and improves\ngeneralization. We demonstrate that this family of strategies provides\nadditional benefits beyond computational performance and generalization. Our\nanalyses reveal that pruning structures (filters and/or layers) from\nconvolutional networks increase not only generalization but also robustness to\nadversarial images (natural images with content modified). Such achievements\nare possible since pruning reduces network capacity and provides\nregularization, which have been proven effective tools against adversarial\nimages. In contrast to promising defense mechanisms that require training with\nadversarial images and careful regularization, we show that pruning obtains\ncompetitive results considering only natural images (e.g., the standard and\nlow-cost training).

However, previous methods usually suffered from\ndiscrete nature of point cloud and unstructured prediction of points in local\nregions, which makes it hard to reveal fine local geometric details on the\ncomplete shape. To resolve this issue, we propose SnowflakeNet with Snowflake\nPoint Deconvolution (SPD) to generate the complete point clouds. The\nSnowflakeNet models the generation of complete point clouds as the\nsnowflake-like growth of points in 3D space, where the child points are\nprogressively generated by splitting their parent points after each SPD. Our\ninsight of revealing detailed geometry is to introduce skip-transformer in SPD\nto learn point splitting patterns which can fit local regions the best.\nSkip-transformer leverages attention mechanism to summarize the splitting\npatterns used in the previous SPD layer to produce the splitting in the current\nSPD layer. The locally compact and structured point cloud generated by SPD is\nable to precisely capture the structure characteristic of 3D shape in local\npatches, which enables the network to predict highly detailed geometries, such\nas smooth regions, sharp edges and corners.

          "description": "We introduce the problem of multi-camera trajectory forecasting (MCTF), which\ninvolves predicting the trajectory of a moving object across a network of\ncameras. While multi-camera setups are widespread for applications such as\nsurveillance and traffic monitoring, existing trajectory forecasting methods\ntypically focus on single-camera trajectory forecasting (SCTF), limiting their\nuse for such applications. Furthermore, using a single camera limits the\nfield-of-view available, making long-term trajectory forecasting impossible. We\naddress these shortcomings of SCTF by developing an MCTF framework that\nsimultaneously uses all estimated relative object locations from several\nviewpoints and predicts the object's future location in all possible\nviewpoints. Our framework follows a Which-When-Where approach that predicts in\nwhich camera(s) the objects appear and when and where within the camera views\nthey appear. To this end, we propose the concept of trajectory tensors: a new\ntechnique to encode trajectories across multiple camera views and the\nassociated uncertainties. We develop several encoder-decoder MCTF models for\ntrajectory tensors and present extensive experiments on our own database\n(comprising 600 hours of video data from 15 camera views) created particularly\nfor the MCTF task. Results show that our trajectory tensor models outperform\ncoordinate trajectory-based MCTF models and existing SCTF methods adapted for\nMCTF.

          "description": "Touchless computer interaction has become an important consideration during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic period. Despite progress in machine learning and computer\nvision that allows for advanced gesture recognition, an integrated collection\nof such open-source methods and a user-customisable approach to utilising them\nin a low-cost solution for touchless interaction in existing software is still\nmissing. In this paper, we introduce the MotionInput v2.0 application. This\napplication utilises published open-source libraries and additional gesture\ndefinitions developed to take the video stream from a standard RGB webcam as\ninput. It then maps human motion gestures to input operations for existing\napplications and games. The user can choose their own preferred way of\ninteracting from a series of motion types, including single and bi-modal hand\ngesturing, full-body repetitive or extremities-based exercises, head and facial\nmovements, eye tracking, and combinations of the above. We also introduce a\nseries of bespoke gesture recognition classifications as DirectInput triggers,\nincluding gestures for idle states, auto calibration, depth capture from a 2D\nRGB webcam stream and tracking of facial motions such as mouth motions,\nwinking, and head direction with rotation. Three use case areas assisted the\ndevelopment of the modules: creativity software, office and clinical software,\nand gaming software. A collection of open-source libraries has been integrated\nand provide a layer of modular gesture mapping on top of existing mouse and\nkeyboard controls in Windows via DirectX. With ease of access to webcams\nintegrated into most laptops and desktop computers, touchless computing becomes\nmore available with MotionInput v2.0, in a federated and locally processed\nmethod.",

          "description": "Classical close-set semantic segmentation networks have limited ability to\ndetect out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, which is important for\nsafety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Incrementally learning\nthese OOD objects with few annotations is an ideal way to enlarge the knowledge\nbase of the deep learning models. In this paper, we propose an open world\nsemantic segmentation system that includes two modules: (1) an open-set\nsemantic segmentation module to detect both in-distribution and OOD objects.\n(2) an incremental few-shot learning module to gradually incorporate those OOD\nobjects into its existing knowledge base. This open world semantic segmentation\nsystem behaves like a human being, which is able to identify OOD objects and\ngradually learn them with corresponding supervision. We adopt the Deep Metric\nLearning Network (DMLNet) with contrastive clustering to implement open-set\nsemantic segmentation. Compared to other open-set semantic segmentation\nmethods, our DMLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging\nopen-set semantic segmentation datasets without using additional data or\ngenerative models. On this basis, two incremental few-shot learning methods are\nfurther proposed to progressively improve the DMLNet with the annotations of\nOOD objects.",

          "description": "Current 3D single object tracking approaches track the target based on a\nfeature comparison between the target template and the search area. However,\ndue to the common occlusion in LiDAR scans, it is non-trivial to conduct\naccurate feature comparisons on severe sparse and incomplete shapes. In this\nwork, we exploit the ground truth bounding box given in the first frame as a\nstrong cue to enhance the feature description of the target object, enabling a\nmore accurate feature comparison in a simple yet effective way. In particular,\nwe first propose the BoxCloud, an informative and robust representation, to\ndepict an object using the point-to-box relation. We further design an\nefficient box-aware feature fusion module, which leverages the aforementioned\nBoxCloud for reliable feature matching and embedding. Integrating the proposed\ngeneral components into an existing model P2B, we construct a superior\nbox-aware tracker (BAT). Experiments confirm that our proposed BAT outperforms\nthe previous state-of-the-art by a large margin on both KITTI and NuScenes\nbenchmarks, achieving a 12.8% improvement in terms of precision while running\n~20% faster.",

          "description": "Background and Aim: Recently, deep learning using convolutional neural\nnetwork has been used successfully to classify the images of breast cells\naccurately. However, the accuracy of manual classification of those\nhistopathological images is comparatively low. This research aims to increase\nthe accuracy of the classification of breast cancer images by utilizing a\nPatch-Based Classifier (PBC) along with deep learning architecture.\nMethodology: The proposed system consists of a Deep Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (DCNN) that helps in enhancing and increasing the accuracy of the\nclassification process. This is done by the use of the Patch-based Classifier\n(PBC). CNN has completely different layers where images are first fed through\nconvolutional layers using hyperbolic tangent function together with the\nmax-pooling layer, drop out layers, and SoftMax function for classification.\nFurther, the output obtained is fed to a patch-based classifier that consists\nof patch-wise classification output followed by majority voting. Results: The\nresults are obtained throughout the classification stage for breast cancer\nimages that are collected from breast-histology datasets. The proposed solution\nimproves the accuracy of classification whether or not the images had normal,\nbenign, in-situ, or invasive carcinoma from 87% to 94% with a decrease in\nprocessing time from 0.45 s to 0.2s on average. Conclusion: The proposed\nsolution focused on increasing the accuracy of classifying cancer in the breast\nby enhancing the image contrast and reducing the vanishing gradient. Finally,\nthis solution for the implementation of the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram\nEqualization (CLAHE) technique and modified tangent function helps in\nincreasing the accuracy.",

Existing datasets that aim to examine video reasoning capability\nfocus on visual signals such as actions, objects, relations, or could be\nanswered utilizing text bias. Observing this, we propose a novel task, along\nwith a new dataset: Trope Understanding in Movies and Animations (TrUMAn),\nintending to evaluate and develop learning systems beyond visual signals.\nTropes are frequently used storytelling devices for creative works.

To tackle the challenging TrUMAn dataset, we\npresent a Trope Understanding and Storytelling (TrUSt) with a new Conceptual\nStoryteller module, which guides the video encoder by performing video\nstorytelling on a latent space. The generated story embedding is then fed into\nthe trope understanding model to provide further signals.

We regard a set of attributes as a\ncategory of people sharing the same traits. In a joint embedding space of the\ntwo modalities, our loss pulls images close to their person categories for\nmodality alignment.

          "description": "Machine learning has endless applications in the health care industry. White\nblood cell classification is one of the interesting and promising area of\nresearch. The classification of the white blood cells plays an important part\nin the medical diagnosis. In practise white blood cell classification is\nperformed by the haematologist by taking a small smear of blood and careful\nexamination under the microscope. The current procedures to identify the white\nblood cell subtype is more time taking and error-prone. The computer aided\ndetection and diagnosis of the white blood cells tend to avoid the human error\nand reduce the time taken to classify the white blood cells. In the recent\nyears several deep learning approaches have been developed in the context of\nclassification of the white blood cells that are able to identify but are\nunable to localize the positions of white blood cells in the blood cell image.\nFollowing this, the present research proposes to utilize YOLOv3 object\ndetection technique to localize and classify the white blood cells with\nbounding boxes. With exhaustive experimental analysis, the proposed work is\nfound to detect the white blood cell with 99.2% accuracy and classify with 90%\naccuracy.",

          "description": "Researchers often spend weeks sifting through decades of unlabeled satellite\nimagery(on NASA Worldview) in order to develop datasets on which they can start\nconducting research. We developed an interactive, scalable and fast image\nsimilarity search engine (which can take one or more images as the query image)\nthat automatically sifts through the unlabeled dataset reducing dataset\ngeneration time from weeks to minutes. In this work, we describe key components\nof the end to end pipeline. Our similarity search system was created to be able\nto identify similar images from a potentially petabyte scale database that are\nsimilar to an input image, and for this we had to break down each query image\ninto its features, which were generated by a classification layer stripped CNN\ntrained in a supervised manner. To store and search these features efficiently,\nwe had to make several scalability improvements. To improve the speed, reduce\nthe storage, and shrink memory requirements for embedding search, we add a\nfully connected layer to our CNN make all images into a 128 length vector\nbefore entering the classification layers. This helped us compress the size of\nour image features from 2048 (for ResNet, which was initially tried as our\nfeaturizer) to 128 for our new custom model. Additionally, we utilize existing\napproximate nearest neighbor search libraries to significantly speed up\nembedding search. Our system currently searches over our entire database of\nimages at 5 seconds per query on a single virtual machine in the cloud. In the\nfuture, we would like to incorporate a SimCLR based featurizing model which\ncould be trained without any labelling by a human (since the classification\naspect of the model is irrelevant to this use case).",

          "description": "Iterative self-consistent parallel imaging reconstruction (SPIRiT) is an\neffective self-calibrated reconstruction model for parallel magnetic resonance\nimaging (PMRI). The joint L1 norm of wavelet coefficients and joint total\nvariation (TV) regularization terms are incorporated into the SPIRiT model to\nimprove the reconstruction performance. The simultaneous two-directional\nlow-rankness (STDLR) in k-space data is incorporated into SPIRiT to realize\nimproved reconstruction. Recent methods have exploited the nonlocal\nself-similarity (NSS) of images by imposing nonlocal low-rankness of similar\npatches to achieve a superior performance. To fully utilize both the NSS in\nMagnetic resonance (MR) images and calibration consistency in the k-space\ndomain, we propose a nonlocal low-rank (NLR)-SPIRiT model by incorporating NLR\nregularization into the SPIRiT model. We apply the weighted nuclear norm (WNN)\nas a surrogate of the rank and employ the Nash equilibrium (NE) formulation and\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to efficiently solve the\nNLR-SPIRiT model.

          "description": "Deep learning models achieve strong performance for radiology image\nclassification, but their practical application is bottlenecked by the need for\nlarge labeled training datasets. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches\nleverage small labeled datasets alongside larger unlabeled datasets and offer\npotential for reducing labeling cost. In this work, we introduce NoTeacher, a\nnovel consistency-based SSL framework which incorporates probabilistic\ngraphical models. Unlike Mean Teacher which maintains a teacher network updated\nvia a temporal ensemble, NoTeacher employs two independent networks, thereby\neliminating the need for a teacher network. We demonstrate how NoTeacher can be\ncustomized to handle a range of challenges in radiology image classification.\nSpecifically, we describe adaptations for scenarios with 2D and 3D inputs, uni\nand multi-label classification, and class distribution mismatch between labeled\nand unlabeled portions of the training data. In realistic empirical evaluations\non three public benchmark datasets spanning the workhorse modalities of\nradiology (X-Ray, CT, MRI), we show that NoTeacher achieves over 90-95% of the\nfully supervised AUROC with less than 5-15% labeling budget. Further, NoTeacher\noutperforms established SSL methods with minimal hyperparameter tuning, and has\nimplications as a principled and practical option for semisupervised learning\nin radiology applications.",

          "description": "Food logo detection plays an important role in the multimedia for its wide\nreal-world applications, such as food recommendation of the self-service shop\nand infringement detection on e-commerce platforms. A large-scale food logo\ndataset is urgently needed for developing advanced food logo detection\nalgorithms. However, there are no available food logo datasets with food brand\ninformation. To support efforts towards food logo detection, we introduce the\ndataset FoodLogoDet-1500, a new large-scale publicly available food logo\ndataset, which has 1,500 categories, about 100,000 images and about 150,000\nmanually annotated food logo objects. We describe the collection and annotation\nprocess of FoodLogoDet-1500, analyze its scale and diversity, and compare it\nwith other logo datasets. To the best of our knowledge, FoodLogoDet-1500 is the\nfirst largest publicly available high-quality dataset for food logo detection.\nThe challenge of food logo detection lies in the large-scale categories and\nsimilarities between food logo categories. For that, we propose a novel food\nlogo detection method Multi-scale Feature Decoupling Network (MFDNet), which\ndecouples classification and regression into two branches and focuses on the\nclassification branch to solve the problem of distinguishing multiple food logo\ncategories. Specifically, we introduce the feature offset module, which\nutilizes the deformation-learning for optimal classification offset and can\neffectively obtain the most representative features of classification in\ndetection. In addition, we adopt a balanced feature pyramid in MFDNet, which\npays attention to global information, balances the multi-scale feature maps,\nand enhances feature extraction capability. Comprehensive experiments on\nFoodLogoDet-1500 and other two benchmark logo datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. The FoodLogoDet-1500 can be found at this\nhttps URL.",

          "description": "Development of deep learning systems for biomedical segmentation often\nrequires access to expert-driven, manually annotated datasets. If more than a\nsingle expert is involved in the annotation of the same images, then the\ninter-expert agreement is not necessarily perfect, and no single expert\nannotation can precisely capture the so-called ground truth of the regions of\ninterest on all images. Also, it is not trivial to generate a reference\nestimate using annotations from multiple experts. Here we present a deep neural\nnetwork, defined as U-Net-and-a-half, which can simultaneously learn from\nannotations performed by multiple experts on the same set of images.\nU-Net-and-a-half contains a convolutional encoder to generate features from the\ninput images, multiple decoders that allow simultaneous learning from image\nmasks obtained from annotations that were independently generated by multiple\nexperts, and a shared low-dimensional feature space. To demonstrate the\napplicability of our framework, we used two distinct datasets from digital\npathology and radiology, respectively. Specifically, we trained two separate\nmodels using pathologist-driven annotations of glomeruli on whole slide images\nof human kidney biopsies (10 patients), and radiologist-driven annotations of\nlumen cross-sections of human arteriovenous fistulae obtained from\nintravascular ultrasound images (10 patients), respectively. The models based\non U-Net-and-a-half exceeded the performance of the traditional U-Net models\ntrained on single expert annotations alone, thus expanding the scope of\nmultitask learning in the context of biomedical image segmentation.",

The proposed natural\nnumerical network is applied to open important environmental and nature\nconservation task, the automated identification of protected habitats by using\nsatellite images. In the natural numerical network, the forward diffusion\ncauses the movement of points in a feature space toward each other. The\nopposite effect, keeping the points away from each other, is caused by backward\ndiffusion. This yields the desired classification. The natural numerical\nnetwork contains a few parameters that are optimized in the learning phase of\nthe method. After learning parameters and optimizing the topology of the\nnetwork graph, classification necessary for habitat identification is\nperformed.

While most studies deploy\ncross-entropy as the loss function in such tasks, a growing number of\napproaches have turned to a family of contrastive learning-based losses. Even\nthough performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are\nregularly used for the evaluation of CNN classifiers, the features that these\nclassifiers actually learn are rarely identified and their effect on the\nclassification performance on out-of-distribution test samples is\ninsufficiently explored. In this paper, motivated by the real-world task of\nlung nodule classification, we investigate the features that a CNN learns when\ntrained and tested on different distributions of a synthetic dataset with\ncontrolled modes of variation. We show that different loss functions lead to\ndifferent features being learned and consequently affect the generalization\nability of the classifier on unseen data.

In this paper, we\npresent R4Dyn, a novel set of techniques to use cost-efficient radar data on\ntop of a self-supervised depth estimation framework. In particular, we show how\nradar can be used during training as weak supervision signal, as well as an\nextra input to enhance the estimation robustness at inference time. Since\nautomotive radars are readily available, this allows to collect training data\nfrom a variety of existing vehicles. Moreover, by filtering and expanding the\nsignal to make it compatible with learning-based approaches, we address radar\ninherent issues, such as noise and sparsity. With R4Dyn we are able to overcome\na major limitation of self-supervised depth estimation, i.e. the prediction of\ntraffic participants. We substantially improve the estimation on dynamic\nobjects, such as cars by 37% on the challenging nuScenes dataset, hence\ndemonstrating that radar is a valuable additional sensor for monocular depth\nestimation in autonomous vehicles.

To this end, we propose a\nnovel temporal sparse adversarial attack method. Different from previous\nadditive noise models which add perturbations on original samples, we employ a\ngenerative adversarial network based architecture to semantically generate\nadversarial high-quality gait silhouettes or video frames. Moreover, by\nsparsely substituting or inserting a few adversarial gait silhouettes, the\nproposed method ensures its imperceptibility and achieves a high attack success\nrate.

The unsupervised open domain\nadaption for generating realistic photos from a hand-drawn sketch is\nchallenging as there is no such sketch of that class for training data. The\nabsence of learning supervision and the huge domain gap between both the\nfreehand drawing and picture domains make it hard. We present an approach that\nlearns both sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation to synthesise the\nmissing freehand drawings from pictures. Due to the domain gap between\nsynthetic sketches and genuine ones, the generator trained on false drawings\nmay produce unsatisfactory results when dealing with drawings of lacking\nclasses. To address this problem, we offer a simple but effective open-domain\nsampling and optimization method that tricks the generator into considering\nfalse drawings as genuine.

          "description": "Automatically generating videos in which synthesized speech is synchronized\nwith lip movements in a talking head has great potential in many human-computer\ninteraction scenarios. In this paper, we present an automatic method to\ngenerate synchronized speech and talking-head videos on the basis of text and a\nsingle face image of an arbitrary person as input. In contrast to previous\ntext-driven talking head generation methods, which can only synthesize the\nvoice of a specific person, the proposed method is capable of synthesizing\nspeech for any person that is inaccessible in the training stage. Specifically,\nthe proposed method decomposes the generation of synchronized speech and\ntalking head videos into two stages, i.e., a text-to-speech (TTS) stage and a\nspeech-driven talking head generation stage. The proposed TTS module is a\nface-conditioned multi-speaker TTS model that gets the speaker identity\ninformation from face images instead of speech, which allows us to synthesize a\npersonalized voice on the basis of the input face image. To generate the\ntalking head videos from the face images, a facial landmark-based method that\ncan predict both lip movements and head rotations is proposed. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate\nsynchronized speech and talking head videos for arbitrary persons and\nnon-persons. Synthesized speech shows consistency with the given face regarding\nto the synthesized voice's timbre and one's appearance in the image, and the\nproposed landmark-based talking head method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nlandmark-based method on generating natural talking head videos.",

To this end, we\ndesigned a three-stage pipeline: (1) Localization of a region containing both\nOBs using FastSurferCNN, (2) Segmentation of OB tissue within the localized\nregion through four independent AttFastSurferCNN - a novel deep learning\narchitecture with a self-attention mechanism to improve modeling of contextual\ninformation, and (3) Ensemble of the predicted label maps. The OB pipeline\nexhibits high performance in terms of boundary delineation, OB localization,\nand volume estimation across a wide range of ages in 203 participants of the\nRhineland Study. Moreover, it also generalizes to scans of an independent\ndataset never encountered during training, the Human Connectome Project (HCP),\nwith different acquisition parameters and demographics, evaluated in 30 cases\nat the native 0.7mm HCP resolution, and the default 0.8mm pipeline resolution.\nWe extensively validated our pipeline not only with respect to segmentation\naccuracy but also to known OB volume effects, where it can sensitively\nreplicate age effects.",

          "description": "This paper presents a semantic planar SLAM system that improves pose\nestimation and mapping using cues from an instance planar segmentation network.\nWhile the mainstream approaches are using RGB-D sensors, employing a monocular\ncamera with such a system still faces challenges such as robust data\nassociation and precise geometric model fitting. In the majority of existing\nwork, geometric model estimation problems such as homography estimation and\npiece-wise planar reconstruction (PPR) are usually solved by standard (greedy)\nRANSAC separately and sequentially. However, setting the inlier-outlier\nthreshold is difficult in absence of information about the scene (i.e. the\nscale). In this work, we revisit these problems and argue that two mentioned\ngeometric models (homographies/3D planes) can be solved by minimizing an energy\nfunction that exploits the spatial coherence, i.e. with graph-cut optimization,\nwhich also tackles the practical issue when the output of a trained CNN is\ninaccurate. Moreover, we propose an adaptive parameter setting strategy based\non our experiments, and report a comprehensive evaluation on various\nopen-source datasets.",

          "description": "Separating and labeling each instance of a nucleus (instance-aware\nsegmentation) is the key challenge in segmenting single cell nuclei on\nfluorescence microscopy images. Deep Neural Networks can learn the implicit\ntransformation of a nuclear image into a probability map indicating the class\nmembership of each pixel (nucleus or background), but the use of\npost-processing steps to turn the probability map into a labeled object mask is\nerror-prone. This especially accounts for nuclear images of tissue sections and\nnuclear images across varying tissue preparations. In this work, we aim to\nevaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to\nsegment nuclei in fluorescence images of various tissue origins and sample\npreparation types without post-processing. We compare architectures that\noperate on pixel to pixel translation and an architecture that operates on\nobject detection and subsequent locally applied segmentation. In addition, we\npropose a novel strategy to create artificial images to extend the training\nset. We evaluate the influence of ground truth annotation quality, image scale\nand segmentation complexity on segmentation performance. Results show that\nthree out of four deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net with ResNet34\nbackbone, Mask R-CNN) can segment fluorescent nuclear images on most of the\nsample preparation types and tissue origins with satisfactory segmentation\nperformance. Mask R-CNN, an architecture designed to address instance aware\nsegmentation tasks, outperforms other architectures. Equal nuclear mean size,\nconsistent nuclear annotations and the use of artificially generated images\nresult in overall acceptable precision and recall across different tissues and\nsample preparation types.",

By using binary codes as direct bucket indices in a hash table, the\nsearch algorithm generates a sequence to probe the buckets based on the\nindependence characteristic of the weights for each bit. Furthermore, a fast\nsearch framework based on the proposed search algorithm is designed to solve\nthe problem of long binary codes. Specifically, long binary codes are split\ninto substrings and multiple hash tables are built on them. Then, the search\nalgorithm probes the buckets to obtain candidates according to the generated\nsubstring indices, and a merging algorithm is proposed to find the nearest\nbinary codes by merging the candidates.

However, as far as we know, all of the existing non-additive\nproposals are based on handcrafted policies, and can only be applied to a\nspecific image domain, which heavily prevent non-additive steganography from\nreleasing its full potentiality. In this paper, we propose an automatic\nnon-additive steganographic distortion learning framework called MCTSteg to\nremove the above restrictions. Guided by the reinforcement learning paradigm,\nwe combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and steganalyzer-based environmental\nmodel to build MCTSteg. MCTS makes sequential decisions to adjust distortion\ndistribution without human intervention. Our proposed environmental model is\nused to obtain feedbacks from each decision. Due to its self-learning\ncharacteristic and domain-independent reward function, MCTSteg has become the\nfirst reported universal non-additive steganographic framework which can work\nin both spatial and JPEG domains. Extensive experimental results show that\nMCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted\nfeature-based and deep-learning-based steganalyzers. In both spatial and JPEG\ndomains, the security performance of MCTSteg steadily outperforms the state of\nthe art by a clear margin under different scenarios.",

Although many image manipulation location\nalgorithms have been proposed, most of them only focus on the RGB images with\ndifferent color spaces, and the frequency information that contains the\npotential tampering clues is often ignored. In this work, a novel end-to-end\ntwo-stream boundary-aware network (abbreviated as TBNet) is proposed for\ngeneric image manipulation localization in which the RGB stream, the frequency\nstream, and the boundary artifact location are explored in a unified framework.\nSpecifically, we first design an adaptive frequency selection module (AFS) to\nadaptively select the appropriate frequency to mine inconsistent statistics and\neliminate the interference of redundant statistics. Then, an adaptive\ncross-attention fusion module (ACF) is proposed to adaptively fuse the RGB\nfeature and the frequency feature. Finally, the boundary artifact location\nnetwork (BAL) is designed to locate the boundary artifacts for which the\nparameters are jointly updated by the outputs of the ACF, and its results are\nfurther fed into the decoder. Thus, the parameters of the RGB stream, the\nfrequency stream, and the boundary artifact location network are jointly\noptimized, and their latent complementary relationships are fully mined. The\nresults of extensive experiments performed on four public benchmarks of the\nimage manipulation localization task, namely, CASIA1.0, COVER, Carvalho, and\nIn-The-Wild, demonstrate that the proposed TBNet can significantly outperform\nstate-of-the-art generic image manipulation localization methods in terms of\nboth MCC and F1.",

          "description": "Accurate detection of obstacles in 3D is an essential task for autonomous\ndriving and intelligent transportation. In this work, we propose a general\nmultimodal fusion framework FusionPainting to fuse the 2D RGB image and 3D\npoint clouds at a semantic level for boosting the 3D object detection task.\nEspecially, the FusionPainting framework consists of three main modules: a\nmulti-modal semantic segmentation module, an adaptive attention-based semantic\nfusion module, and a 3D object detector. First, semantic information is\nobtained for 2D images and 3D Lidar point clouds based on 2D and 3D\nsegmentation approaches. Then the segmentation results from different sensors\nare adaptively fused based on the proposed attention-based semantic fusion\nmodule. Finally, the point clouds painted with the fused semantic label are\nsent to the 3D detector for obtaining the 3D objection results. The\neffectiveness of the proposed framework has been verified on the large-scale\nnuScenes detection benchmark by comparing it with three different baselines.\nThe experimental results show that the fusion strategy can significantly\nimprove the detection performance compared to the methods using only point\nclouds, and the methods using point clouds only painted with 2D segmentation\ninformation. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes testing benchmark.",

          "description": "Recent vision-language (VL) studies have shown remarkable progress by\nlearning generic representations from massive image-text pairs with transformer\nmodels and then fine-tuning on downstream VL tasks. While existing research has\nbeen focused on achieving high accuracy with large pre-trained models, building\na lightweight model is of great value in practice but is less explored. In this\npaper, we propose a smaller and faster VL model, MiniVLM, which can be\nfinetuned with good performance on various downstream tasks like its larger\ncounterpart. MiniVLM consists of two modules, a vision feature extractor and a\ntransformer-based vision-language fusion module. We design a Two-stage\nEfficient feature Extractor (TEE), inspired by the one-stage EfficientDet\nnetwork, to significantly reduce the time cost of visual feature extraction by\n$95\\%$, compared to a baseline model. We adopt the MiniLM structure to reduce\nthe computation cost of the transformer module after comparing different\ncompact BERT models. In addition, we improve the MiniVLM pre-training by adding\n$7M$ Open Images data, which are pseudo-labeled by a state-of-the-art\ncaptioning model. We also pre-train with high-quality image tags obtained from\na strong tagging model to enhance cross-modality alignment. The large models\nare used offline without adding any overhead in fine-tuning and inference. With\nthe above design choices, our MiniVLM reduces the model size by $73\\%$ and the\ninference time cost by $94\\%$ while being able to retain $94-97\\%$ of the\naccuracy on multiple VL tasks. We hope that MiniVLM helps ease the use of the\nstate-of-the-art VL research for on-the-edge applications.",

          "description": "We present \"Cross-Camera Convolutional Color Constancy\" (C5), a\nlearning-based method, trained on images from multiple cameras, that accurately\nestimates a scene's illuminant color from raw images captured by a new camera\npreviously unseen during training. C5 is a hypernetwork-like extension of the\nconvolutional color constancy (CCC) approach: C5 learns to generate the weights\nof a CCC model that is then evaluated on the input image, with the CCC weights\ndynamically adapted to different input content. Unlike prior cross-camera color\nconstancy models, which are usually designed to be agnostic to the spectral\nproperties of test-set images from unobserved cameras, C5 approaches this\nproblem through the lens of transductive inference: additional unlabeled images\nare provided as input to the model at test time, which allows the model to\ncalibrate itself to the spectral properties of the test-set camera during\ninference. C5 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for cross-camera color\nconstancy on several datasets, is fast to evaluate (~7 and ~90 ms per image on\na GPU or CPU, respectively), and requires little memory (~2 MB), and, thus, is\na practical solution to the problem of calibration-free automatic white balance\nfor mobile photography.",

          "description": "Key for solving fine-grained image categorization is finding discriminate and\nlocal regions that correspond to subtle visual traits. Great strides have been\nmade, with complex networks designed specifically to learn part-level\ndiscriminate feature representations. In this paper, we show it is possible to\ncultivate subtle details without the need for overly complicated network\ndesigns or training mechanisms -- a single loss is all it takes. The main trick\nlies with how we delve into individual feature channels early on, as opposed to\nthe convention of starting from a consolidated feature map. The proposed loss\nfunction, termed as mutual-channel loss (MC-Loss), consists of two\nchannel-specific components: a discriminality component and a diversity\ncomponent. The discriminality component forces all feature channels belonging\nto the same class to be discriminative, through a novel channel-wise attention\nmechanism. The diversity component additionally constraints channels so that\nthey become mutually exclusive on spatial-wise. The end result is therefore a\nset of feature channels that each reflects different locally discriminative\nregions for a specific class. The MC-Loss can be trained end-to-end, without\nthe need for any bounding-box/part annotations, and yields highly\ndiscriminative regions during inference. Experimental results show our MC-Loss\nwhen implemented on top of common base networks can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on all four fine-grained categorization datasets (CUB-Birds,\nFGVC-Aircraft, Flowers-102, and Stanford-Cars). Ablative studies further\ndemonstrate the superiority of MC-Loss when compared with other recently\nproposed general-purpose losses for visual classification, on two different\nbase networks.

          "description": "Compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have witnessed exceptional\nimprovements in performance in recent years. However, they still fail to\nprovide the same predictive power as CNNs with a large number of parameters.\nThe diverse and even abundant features captured by the layers is an important\ncharacteristic of these successful CNNs. However, differences in this\ncharacteristic between large CNNs and their compact counterparts have rarely\nbeen investigated. In compact CNNs, due to the limited number of parameters,\nabundant features are unlikely to be obtained, and feature diversity becomes an\nessential characteristic. Diverse features present in the activation maps\nderived from a data point during model inference may indicate the presence of a\nset of unique descriptors necessary to distinguish between objects of different\nclasses. In contrast, data points with low feature diversity may not provide a\nsufficient amount of unique descriptors to make a valid prediction; we refer to\nthem as random predictions. Random predictions can negatively impact the\noptimization process and harm the final performance. This paper proposes\naddressing the problem raised by random predictions by reshaping the standard\ncross-entropy to make it biased toward data points with a limited number of\nunique descriptive features. Our novel Bias Loss focuses the training on a set\nof valuable data points and prevents the vast number of samples with poor\nlearning features from misleading the optimization process. Furthermore, to\nshow the importance of diversity, we present a family of SkipNet models whose\narchitectures are brought to boost the number of unique descriptors in the last\nlayers. Our Skipnet-M can achieve 1% higher classification accuracy than\nMobileNetV3 Large.",

Our intuition is that the more the features are shared, the\nmore common they will become, and SSM can encourage such structural\ncharacteristics in the split features. SSM can be easily integrated into any\narchitecture without bells and whistles. We have extensively validated the\nefficacy of SSM on ImageNet-1K classification task, andSSM has shown consistent\nand significant improvements over baseline architectures. In addition, we\nanalyze the effect of SSM using the Grad-CAM visualization.",

          "description": "Visual perception of a person is easily influenced by many factors such as\ncamera parameters, pose and viewpoint variations. These variations make person\nRe-Identification (ReID) a challenging problem. Nevertheless, human attributes\nusually stand as robust visual properties to such variations. In this paper, we\npropose a new method to leverage features from human attributes for person\nReID. Our model uses a tensor to non-linearly fuse identity and attribute\nfeatures, and then forces the parameters of the tensor in the loss function to\ngenerate discriminative fused features for ReID. Since tensor-based methods\nusually contain a large number of parameters, training all of these parameters\nbecomes very slow, and the chance of overfitting increases as well. To address\nthis issue, we propose two new techniques based on Structural Sparsity Learning\n(SSL) and Tensor Decomposition (TD) methods to create an accurate and stable\nlearning problem. We conducted experiments on several standard pedestrian\ndatasets, and experimental results indicate that our tensor-based approach\nsignificantly improves person ReID baselines and also outperforms state of the\nart methods.",

The scenes are replicas of\nreal-world homes, with distribution and the layout of objects aligned to those\nof the real world. iGibson 1.0 integrates several key features to facilitate\nthe study of interactive tasks: i) generation of high-quality virtual sensor\nsignals (RGB, depth, segmentation, LiDAR, flow and so on), ii) domain\nrandomization to change the materials of the objects (both visual and physical)\nand/or their shapes, iii) integrated sampling-based motion planners to generate\ncollision-free trajectories for robot bases and arms, and iv) intuitive\nhuman-iGibson interface that enables efficient collection of human\ndemonstrations. Through experiments, we show that the full interactivity of the\nscenes enables agents to learn useful visual representations that accelerate\nthe training of downstream manipulation tasks. We also show that iGibson 1.0\nfeatures enable the generalization of navigation agents, and that the\nhuman-iGibson interface and integrated motion planners facilitate efficient\nimitation learning of human demonstrated (mobile) manipulation behaviors.\niGibson 1.0 is open-source, equipped with comprehensive examples and\ndocumentation.

Facial image datasets\nare usually annotated by some commonly used attributes (e.g., gender), while\nlabels for the other attributes (e.g., big nose) are limited which causes their\nprediction challenging. To address this problem, we use a new Multi-Task\nLearning (MTL) paradigm in which a facial attribute predictor uses the\nknowledge of other related attributes to obtain a better generalization\nperformance. Here, we leverage MLT paradigm in two problem settings. First, it\nis assumed that the structure of the tasks (e.g., grouping pattern of facial\nattributes) is known as a prior knowledge, and parameters of the tasks (i.e.,\npredictors) within the same group are represented by a linear combination of a\nlimited number of underlying basis tasks. Here, a sparsity constraint on the\ncoefficients of this linear combination is also considered such that each task\nis represented in a more structured and simpler manner. Second, it is assumed\nthat the structure of the tasks is unknown, and then structure and parameters\nof the tasks are learned jointly by using a Laplacian regularization framework.\nOur MTL methods are compared with competing methods for facial attribute\nprediction to show its effectiveness.",

          "description": "Anatomical structures such as the hippocampus, liver, and bones can be\nanalyzed as orientable, closed surfaces. This permits the computation of\nvolume, surface area, mean curvature, Gaussian curvature, and the\nEuler-Poincar\\'e characteristic as well as comparison of these morphometrics\nbetween structures of different topology. The structures are commonly\nrepresented implicitly in curve evolution problems as the zero level set of an\nembedding. Practically, binary images of anatomical structures are embedded\nusing a signed distance transform. However, quantization prevents the accurate\ncomputation of curvatures, leading to considerable errors in morphometry. This\npaper presents a fast, simple embedding procedure for accurate local\nmorphometry as the zero crossing of the Gaussian blurred binary image. The\nproposed method was validated based on the femur and fourth lumbar vertebrae of\n50 clinical computed tomography datasets. The results show that the signed\ndistance transform leads to large quantization errors in the computed local\ncurvature. Global validation of morphometry using regression and Bland-Altman\nanalysis revealed that the coefficient of determination for the average mean\ncurvature is improved from 93.8% with the signed distance transform to 100%\nwith the proposed method. For the surface area, the proportional bias is\nimproved from -5.0% for the signed distance transform to +0.6% for the proposed\nmethod. The Euler-Poincar\\'e characteristic is improved from unusable in the\nsigned distance transform to 98% accuracy for the proposed method. The proposed\nmethod enables an improved local and global evaluation of curvature for\npurposes of morphometry on closed, implicit surfaces.",

Single task vision networks extract information only based\non some aspects of the scene. In multi-task learning (MTL), on the other hand,\nthese single tasks are jointly learned, thereby providing an opportunity for\ntasks to share information and obtain a more comprehensive understanding. To\nthis end, we develop UniNet, a unified scene understanding network that\naccurately and efficiently infers vital vision tasks including object\ndetection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, monocular depth\nestimation, and monocular instance depth prediction. As these tasks look at\ndifferent semantic and geometric information, they can either complement or\nconflict with each other. Therefore, understanding inter-task relationships can\nprovide useful cues to enable complementary information sharing. We evaluate\nthe task relationships in UniNet through the lens of adversarial attacks based\non the notion that they can exploit learned biases and task interactions in the\nneural network. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset, using\nuntargeted and targeted attacks reveal that semantic tasks strongly interact\namongst themselves, and the same holds for geometric tasks. Additionally, we\nshow that the relationship between semantic and geometric tasks is asymmetric\nand their interaction becomes weaker as we move towards higher-level\nrepresentations.",

          "description": "Multimodal IR, spanning text corpus, knowledge graph and images, called\noutside knowledge visual question answering (OKVQA), is of much recent\ninterest. However, the popular data set has serious limitations. A surprisingly\nlarge fraction of queries do not assess the ability to integrate cross-modal\ninformation. Instead, some are independent of the image, some depend on\nspeculation, some require OCR or are otherwise answerable from the image alone.\nTo add to the above limitations, frequency-based guessing is very effective\nbecause of (unintended) widespread answer overlaps between the train and test\nfolds. Overall, it is hard to determine when state-of-the-art systems exploit\nthese weaknesses rather than really infer the answers, because they are opaque\nand their 'reasoning' process is uninterpretable. An equally important\nlimitation is that the dataset is designed for the quantitative assessment only\nof the end-to-end answer retrieval task, with no provision for assessing the\ncorrect(semantic) interpretation of the input query. In response, we identify a\nkey structural idiom in OKVQA ,viz., S3 (select, substitute and search), and\nbuild a new data set and challenge around it. Specifically, the questioner\nidentifies an entity in the image and asks a question involving that entity\nwhich can be answered only by consulting a knowledge graph or corpus passage\nmentioning the entity. Our challenge consists of (i)OKVQAS3, a subset of OKVQA\nannotated based on the structural idiom and (ii)S3VQA, a new dataset built from\nscratch. We also present a neural but structurally transparent OKVQA system,\nS3, that explicitly addresses our challenge dataset, and outperforms recent\ncompetitive baselines.",

Usually,\nexisting methods either design multiple networks and train them independently,\nor construct depth-level/width-level dynamic neural networks which is hard to\nprove the accuracy of each sub-net. In this article, we propose an elegant\nDepth-Level Dynamic Neural Network (DDNN) integrated different-depth sub-nets\nof similar architectures. To improve the generalization of sub-nets, we design\nthe Embedded-Knowledge-Distillation (EKD) training mechanism for the DDNN to\nimplement knowledge transfer from the teacher (full-net) to multiple students\n(sub-nets). Specifically, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is introduced to\nconstrain the posterior class probability consistency between full-net and\nsub-nets, and self-attention distillation on the same resolution feature of\ndifferent depth is addressed to drive more abundant feature representations of\nsub-nets. Thus, we can obtain multiple high-accuracy sub-nets simultaneously in\na DDNN via the online knowledge distillation in each training iteration without\nextra computation cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet\ndatasets demonstrate that sub-nets in DDNN with EKD training achieve better\nperformance than individually training networks while preserving the original\nperformance of full-nets.",

However, unique challenges are proposed by\nUI-specific characteristics, such as how to effectively leverage multimodal UI\nfeatures that involve image, text, and structural metadata and how to achieve\ngood performance when high-quality labeled data is unavailable. To address such\nchallenges we introduce UIBert, a transformer-based joint image-text model\ntrained through novel pre-training tasks on large-scale unlabeled UI data to\nlearn generic feature representations for a UI and its components. Our key\nintuition is that the heterogeneous features in a UI are self-aligned, i.e.,\nthe image and text features of UI components, are predictive of each other. We\npropose five pretraining tasks utilizing this self-alignment among different\nfeatures of a UI component and across various components in the same UI. We\nevaluate our method on nine real-world downstream UI tasks where UIBert\noutperforms strong multimodal baselines by up to 9.26% accuracy.",

          "description": "Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging modality that can be conveniently used\nto classify suspicious breast nodules and potentially detect the onset of\nbreast cancer. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) techniques have\nshown promising results in classifying ultrasound images of the breast into\nbenign or malignant. However, CNN inference acts as a black-box model, and as\nsuch, its decision-making is not interpretable. Therefore, increasing effort\nhas been dedicated to explaining this process, most notably through GRAD-CAM\nand other techniques that provide visual explanations into inner workings of\nCNNs. In addition to interpretation, these methods provide clinically important\ninformation, such as identifying the location for biopsy or treatment. In this\nwork, we analyze how adversarial assaults that are practically undetectable may\nbe devised to alter these importance maps dramatically. Furthermore, we will\nshow that this change in the importance maps can come with or without altering\nthe classification result, rendering them even harder to detect. As such, care\nmust be taken when using these importance maps to shed light on the inner\nworkings of deep learning. Finally, we utilize Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and\npropose a new network based on ResNet-50 to improve the classification\naccuracies.

In this work, we\ninvestigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis via NeRF for mesh-free,\nRGB-only 6DoF pose estimation - given an image, find the translation and\nrotation of a camera relative to a 3D object or scene. Our method assumes that\nno object mesh models are available during either training or test time.\nStarting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the\nresidual between pixels rendered from a NeRF and pixels in an observed image.\nIn our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement\nfor iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes of\nrays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complex\nreal-world scenes from the LLFF dataset, iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating\nthe camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional training\ndata for NeRF.

          "description": "Motivated by the interaction between cells, the recently introduced concept\nof Neural Cellular Automata shows promising results in a variety of tasks. So\nfar, this concept was mostly used to generate images for a single scenario. As\neach scenario requires a new model, this type of generation seems contradictory\nto the adaptability of cells in nature. To address this contradiction, we\nintroduce a concept using different initial environments as input while using a\nsingle Neural Cellular Automata to produce several outputs. Additionally, we\nintroduce GANCA, a novel algorithm that combines Neural Cellular Automata with\nGenerative Adversarial Networks, allowing for more generalization through\nadversarial training. The experiments show that a single model is capable of\nlearning several images when presented with different inputs, and that the\nadversarially trained model improves drastically on out-of-distribution data\ncompared to a supervised trained model.",

          "description": "Predicting the movement trajectories of multiple classes of road users in\nreal-world scenarios is a challenging task due to the diverse trajectory\npatterns. While recent works of pedestrian trajectory prediction successfully\nmodelled the influence of surrounding neighbours based on the relative\ndistances, they are ineffective on multi-class trajectory prediction. This is\nbecause they ignore the impact of the implicit correlations between different\ntypes of road users on the trajectory to be predicted - for example, a nearby\npedestrian has a different level of influence from a nearby car. In this paper,\nwe propose to introduce class information into a graph convolutional neural\nnetwork to better predict the trajectory of an individual. We embed the class\nlabels of the surrounding objects into the label adjacency matrix (LAM), which\nis combined with the velocity-based adjacency matrix (VAM) comprised of the\nobjects' velocity, thereby generating a semantics-guided graph adjacency (SAM).\nSAM effectively models semantic information with trainable parameters to\nautomatically learn the embedded label features that will contribute to the\nfixed velocity-based trajectory. Such information of spatial and temporal\ndependencies is passed to a graph convolutional and temporal convolutional\nnetwork to estimate the predicted trajectory distributions. We further propose\nnew metrics, known as Average2 Displacement Error (aADE) and Average Final\nDisplacement Error (aFDE), that assess network accuracy more accurately. We\ncall our framework Semantics-STGCNN. It consistently shows superior performance\nto the state-of-the-arts in existing and the newly proposed metrics.",

          "description": "Person reidentification (ReID) is a very hot research topic in machine\nlearning and computer vision, and many person ReID approaches have been\nproposed; however, most of these methods assume that the same person has the\nsame clothes within a short time interval, and thus their visual appearance\nmust be similar. However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person\nhas a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they\nalso often take different personal belongings with them. When the existing\nperson ReID methods are applied in this type of case, almost all of them fail.\nTo date, only a few works have focused on the cloth-changing person ReID task,\nbut since it is very difficult to extract generalized and robust features for\nrepresenting people with different clothes, their performances need to be\nimproved. Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve\nthese issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding\nalgorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual\nsemantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and\nthe generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively\nsolve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a\nperson with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme\n(MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth\ndesensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of\nthe approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level\nhuman attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of\npose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially\nsemantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic\ninformation that is used to align the human attributes.",

          "description": "The defect detection task can be regarded as a realistic scenario of object\ndetection in the computer vision field and it is widely used in the industrial\nfield. Directly applying vanilla object detector to defect detection task can\nachieve promising results, while there still exists challenging issues that\nhave not been solved. The first issue is the texture shift which means a\ntrained defect detector model will be easily affected by unseen texture, and\nthe second issue is partial visual confusion which indicates that a partial\ndefect box is visually similar with a complete box. To tackle these two\nproblems, we propose a Reference-based Defect Detection Network (RDDN).\nSpecifically, we introduce template reference and context reference to against\nthose two problems, respectively. Template reference can reduce the texture\nshift from image, feature or region levels, and encourage the detectors to\nfocus more on the defective area as a result. We can use either well-aligned\ntemplate images or the outputs of a pseudo template generator as template\nreferences in this work, and they are jointly trained with detectors by the\nsupervision of normal samples. To solve the partial visual confusion issue, we\npropose to leverage the carried context information of context reference, which\nis the concentric bigger box of each region proposal, to perform more accurate\nregion classification and regression.

          "description": "The performance of many medical image analysis tasks are strongly associated\nwith image data quality. When developing modern deep learning algorithms,\nrather than relying on subjective (human-based) image quality assessment (IQA),\ntask amenability potentially provides an objective measure of task-specific\nimage quality. To predict task amenability, an IQA agent is trained using\nreinforcement learning (RL) with a simultaneously optimised task predictor,\nsuch as a classification or segmentation neural network. In this work, we\ndevelop transfer learning or adaptation strategies to increase the adaptability\nof both the IQA agent and the task predictor so that they are less dependent on\nhigh-quality, expert-labelled training data. The proposed transfer learning\nstrategy re-formulates the original RL problem for task amenability in a\nmeta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework. The resulting algorithm\nfacilitates efficient adaptation of the agent to different definitions of image\nquality, each with its own Markov decision process environment including\ndifferent images, labels and an adaptable task predictor. Our work demonstrates\nthat the IQA agents pre-trained on non-expert task labels can be adapted to\npredict task amenability as defined by expert task labels, using only a small\nset of expert labels. Using 6644 clinical ultrasound images from 249 prostate\ncancer patients, our results for image classification and segmentation tasks\nshow that the proposed IQA method can be adapted using data with as few as\nrespective 19.7% and 29.6% expert-reviewed consensus labels and still achieve\ncomparable IQA and task performance, which would otherwise require a training\ndataset with 100% expert labels.",

Existing universal style transfer methods successfully\ndeliver arbitrary styles to original images either in an artistic or a\nphoto-realistic way. However, the range of 'arbitrary style' defined by\nexisting works is bounded in the particular domain due to their structural\nlimitation. Specifically, the degrees of content preservation and stylization\nare established according to a predefined target domain. As a result, both\nphoto-realistic and artistic models have difficulty in performing the desired\nstyle transfer for the other domain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nunified architecture, Domain-aware Style Transfer Networks (DSTN) that transfer\nnot only the style but also the property of domain (i.e., domainness) from a\ngiven reference image. To this end, we design a novel domainness indicator that\ncaptures the domainness value from the texture and structural features of\nreference images. Moreover, we introduce a unified framework with domain-aware\nskip connection to adaptively transfer the stroke and palette to the input\ncontents guided by the domainness indicator.

          "description": "For the past ten years, CNN has reigned supreme in the world of computer\nvision, but recently, Transformer is on the rise. However, the quadratic\ncomputational cost of self-attention has become a severe problem of practice.\nThere has been much research on architectures without CNN and self-attention in\nthis context. In particular, MLP-Mixer is a simple idea designed using MLPs and\nhit an accuracy comparable to the Vision Transformer. However, the only\ninductive bias in this architecture is the embedding of tokens. Thus, there is\nstill a possibility to build a non-convolutional inductive bias into the\narchitecture itself, and we built in an inductive bias using two simple ideas.\nA way is to divide the token-mixing block vertically and horizontally. Another\nway is to make spatial correlations denser among some channels of token-mixing.\nWith this approach, we were able to improve the accuracy of the MLP-Mixer while\nreducing its parameters and computational complexity. Compared to other\nMLP-based models, the proposed model, named RaftMLP has a good balance of\ncomputational complexity, the number of parameters, and actual memory usage. In\naddition, our work indicates that MLP-based models have the potential to\nreplace CNNs by adopting inductive bias.

          "description": "Human observers engage in selective information uptake when classifying\nvisual patterns. The same is true of deep neural networks, which currently\nconstitute the best performing artificial vision systems. Our goal is to\nexamine the congruence, or lack thereof, in the information-gathering\nstrategies of the two systems. We have operationalized our investigation as a\ncharacter recognition task. We have used eye-tracking to assay the spatial\ndistribution of information hotspots for humans via fixation maps and an\nactivation mapping technique for obtaining analogous distributions for deep\nnetworks through visualization maps. Qualitative comparison between\nvisualization maps and fixation maps reveals an interesting correlate of\ncongruence. The deep learning model considered similar regions in character,\nwhich humans have fixated in the case of correctly classified characters. On\nthe other hand, when the focused regions are different for humans and deep\nnets, the characters are typically misclassified by the latter. Hence, we\npropose to use the visual fixation maps obtained from the eye-tracking\nexperiment as a supervisory input to align the model's focus on relevant\ncharacter regions. We find that such supervision improves the model's\nperformance significantly and does not require any additional parameters. This\napproach has the potential to find applications in diverse domains such as\nmedical analysis and surveillance in which explainability helps to determine\nsystem fidelity.",

In this paper, we\npropose a novel two-stage blind face inpainting method named Frequency-guided\nTransformer and Top-Down Refinement Network (FT-TDR) to tackle these\nchallenges. Specifically, we first use a transformer-based network to detect\nthe corrupted regions to be inpainted as masks by modeling the relation among\ndifferent patches. We also exploit the frequency modality as complementary\ninformation for improved detection results and capture the local contextual\nincoherence to enhance boundary consistency. Then a top-down refinement network\nis proposed to hierarchically restore features at different levels and generate\ncontents that are semantically consistent with the unmasked face regions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art blind and non-blind face inpainting methods qualitatively and\nquantitatively.",

          "description": "Differentiable Neural Architecture Search is one of the most popular Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS) methods for its search efficiency and simplicity,\naccomplished by jointly optimizing the model weight and architecture parameters\nin a weight-sharing supernet via gradient-based algorithms. At the end of the\nsearch phase, the operations with the largest architecture parameters will be\nselected to form the final architecture, with the implicit assumption that the\nvalues of architecture parameters reflect the operation strength. While much\nhas been discussed about the supernet's optimization, the architecture\nselection process has received little attention. We provide empirical and\ntheoretical analysis to show that the magnitude of architecture parameters does\nnot necessarily indicate how much the operation contributes to the supernet's\nperformance. We propose an alternative perturbation-based architecture\nselection that directly measures each operation's influence on the supernet. We\nre-evaluate several differentiable NAS methods with the proposed architecture\nselection and find that it is able to extract significantly improved\narchitectures from the underlying supernets consistently. Furthermore, we find\nthat several failure modes of DARTS can be greatly alleviated with the proposed\nselection method, indicating that much of the poor generalization observed in\nDARTS can be attributed to the failure of magnitude-based architecture\nselection rather than entirely the optimization of its supernet.",

          "description": "Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in Bangladesh, and as\na result, Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is widespread in the population. DR, an eye\nillness caused by diabetes, can lead to blindness if it is not identified and\ntreated in its early stages. Unfortunately, diagnosis of DR requires medically\ntrained professionals, but Bangladesh has limited specialists in comparison to\nits population. Moreover, the screening process is often expensive, prohibiting\nmany from receiving timely and proper diagnosis. To address the problem, we\nintroduce a deep learning algorithm which screens for different stages of DR.\nWe use a state-of-the-art CNN architecture to diagnose patients based on\nretinal fundus imagery. This paper is an experimental evaluation of the\nalgorithm we developed for DR diagnosis and screening specifically for\nBangladeshi patients. We perform this validation study using separate pools of\nretinal image data of real patients from a hospital and field studies in\nBangladesh. Our results show that the algorithm is effective at screening\nBangladeshi eyes even when trained on a public dataset which is out of domain,\nand can accurately determine the stage of DR as well, achieving an overall\naccuracy of 92.27\\% and 93.02\\% on two validation sets of Bangladeshi eyes. The\nresults confirm the ability of the algorithm to be used in real clinical\nsettings and applications due to its high accuracy and classwise metrics. Our\nalgorithm is implemented in the application Drishti, which is used to screen\nfor DR in patients living in rural areas in Bangladesh, where access to\nprofessional screening is limited.",

In order to diagnose MS, multiple screening\nmethods have been proposed so far; among them, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nhas received considerable attention among physicians. MRI modalities provide\nphysicians with fundamental information about the structure and function of the\nbrain, which is crucial for the rapid diagnosis of MS lesions.

Hence,\ncomputer aided diagnosis systems (CADS) based on artificial intelligence (AI)\nmethods have been proposed in recent years for accurate diagnosis of MS using\nMRI neuroimaging modalities. In the AI field, automated MS diagnosis is being\nconducted using (i) conventional machine learning and (ii) deep learning (DL)\ntechniques. The conventional machine learning approach is based on feature\nextraction and selection by trial and error. In DL, these steps are performed\nby the DL model itself. In this paper, a complete review of automated MS\ndiagnosis methods performed using DL techniques with MRI neuroimaging\nmodalities are discussed.

          "description": "Text-to-image person re-identification (ReID) aims to search for images\ncontaining a person of interest using textual descriptions. However, due to the\nsignificant modality gap and the large intra-class variance in textual\ndescriptions, text-to-image ReID remains a challenging problem. Accordingly, in\nthis paper, we propose a Semantically Self-Aligned Network (SSAN) to handle the\nabove problems. First, we propose a novel method that automatically extracts\nsemantically aligned part-level features from the two modalities. Second, we\ndesign a multi-view non-local network that captures the relationships between\nbody parts, thereby establishing better correspondences between body parts and\nnoun phrases. Third, we introduce a Compound Ranking (CR) loss that makes use\nof textual descriptions for other images of the same identity to provide extra\nsupervision, thereby effectively reducing the intra-class variance in textual\nfeatures. Finally, to expedite future research in text-to-image ReID, we build\na new database named ICFG-PEDES. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSAN\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins.

We address this\nchallenge by enriching both the local and global contexts in the popular\ntwo-stage temporal localization framework, where action proposals are first\ngenerated followed by action classification and temporal boundary regression.\nOur proposed model, dubbed ContextLoc, can be divided into three sub-networks:\nL-Net, G-Net and P-Net. L-Net enriches the local context via fine-grained\nmodeling of snippet-level features, which is formulated as a\nquery-and-retrieval process. G-Net enriches the global context via higher-level\nmodeling of the video-level representation. In addition, we introduce a novel\ncontext adaptation module to adapt the global context to different proposals.\nP-Net further models the context-aware inter-proposal relations. We explore two\nexisting models to be the P-Net in our experiments.

Previous\nmethods are either subject to single-modal input or perform supervised\nimage-level product retrieval, thus fail to accommodate real-life scenarios\nwhere enormous weakly annotated multi-modal data are present. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a more realistic setting that aims to perform weakly-supervised\nmulti-modal instance-level product retrieval among fine-grained product\ncategories. To promote the study of this challenging task, we contribute\nProduct1M, one of the largest multi-modal cosmetic datasets for real-world\ninstance-level retrieval. Notably, Product1M contains over 1 million\nimage-caption pairs and consists of two sample types, i.e., single-product and\nmulti-product samples, which encompass a wide variety of cosmetics brands. In\naddition to the great diversity, Product1M enjoys several appealing\ncharacteristics including fine-grained categories, complex combinations, and\nfuzzy correspondence that well mimic the real-world scenes. Moreover, we\npropose a novel model named Cross-modal contrAstive Product Transformer for\ninstance-level prodUct REtrieval (CAPTURE), that excels in capturing the\npotential synergy between multi-modal inputs via a hybrid-stream transformer in\na self-supervised manner.CAPTURE generates discriminative instance features via\nmasked multi-modal learning as well as cross-modal contrastive pretraining and\nit outperforms several SOTA cross-modal baselines.

          "description": "Localizing individuals in crowds is more in accordance with the practical\ndemands of subsequent high-level crowd analysis tasks than simply counting.\nHowever, existing localization based methods relying on intermediate\nrepresentations (\\textit{i.e.}, density maps or pseudo boxes) serving as\nlearning targets are counter-intuitive and error-prone. In this paper, we\npropose a purely point-based framework for joint crowd counting and individual\nlocalization. For this framework, instead of merely reporting the absolute\ncounting error at image level, we propose a new metric, called density\nNormalized Average Precision (nAP), to provide more comprehensive and more\nprecise performance evaluation. Moreover, we design an intuitive solution under\nthis framework, which is called Point to Point Network (P2PNet). P2PNet\ndiscards superfluous steps and directly predicts a set of point proposals to\nrepresent heads in an image, being consistent with the human annotation\nresults. By thorough analysis, we reveal the key step towards implementing such\na novel idea is to assign optimal learning targets for these proposals.\nTherefore, we propose to conduct this crucial association in an one-to-one\nmatching manner using the Hungarian algorithm.

          "description": "The early diagnosis and screening of glaucoma are important for patients to\nreceive treatment in time and maintain eyesight. Nowadays, deep learning (DL)\nbased models have been successfully used for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of\nglaucoma from retina fundus images. However, a DL model pre-trained using a\ndataset from one hospital center may have poor performance on a dataset from\nanother new hospital center and therefore its applications in the real scene\nare limited. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive transfer learning (SATL)\nstrategy to fill the domain gap between multicenter datasets. Specifically, the\nencoder of a DL model that is pre-trained on the source domain is used to\ninitialize the encoder of a reconstruction model. Then, the reconstruction\nmodel is trained using only unlabeled image data from the target domain, which\nmakes the encoder in the model adapt itself to extract useful high-level\nfeatures both for target domain images encoding and glaucoma classification,\nsimultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SATL\nstrategy is effective in the domain adaptation task between one private and two\npublic glaucoma diagnosis datasets, i.e. pri-RFG, REFUGE, and LAG. Moreover,\nthe proposed strategy is completely independent of the source domain data,\nwhich meets the real scene application and the privacy protection policy.",

          "description": "Transfer learning (TL) utilizes data or knowledge from one or more source\ndomains to facilitate the learning in a target domain. It is particularly\nuseful when the target domain has very few or no labeled data, due to\nannotation expense, privacy concerns, etc. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of\nTL is not always guaranteed. Negative transfer (NT), i.e., leveraging source\ndomain data/knowledge undesirably reduces the learning performance in the\ntarget domain, has been a long-standing and challenging problem in TL. Various\napproaches have been proposed in the literature to handle it. However, there\ndoes not exist a systematic survey on the formulation of NT, the factors\nleading to NT, and the algorithms that mitigate NT. This paper fills this gap,\nby first introducing the definition of NT and its factors, then reviewing about\nfifty representative approaches for overcoming NT, according to four\ncategories: secure transfer, domain similarity estimation, distant transfer,\nand NT mitigation.

          "description": "With the continuous improvement of the performance of object detectors via\nadvanced model architectures, imbalance problems in the training process have\nreceived more attention. It is a common paradigm in object detection frameworks\nto perform multi-scale detection. However, each scale is treated equally during\ntraining. In this paper, we carefully study the objective imbalance of\nmulti-scale detector training. We argue that the loss in each scale level is\nneither equally important nor independent. Different from the existing\nsolutions of setting multi-task weights, we dynamically optimize the loss\nweight of each scale level in the training process. Specifically, we propose an\nAdaptive Variance Weighting (AVW) to balance multi-scale loss according to the\nstatistical variance. Then we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning\nOptimization (RLO) to decide the weighting scheme probabilistically during\ntraining. The proposed dynamic methods make better utilization of multi-scale\ntraining loss without extra computational complexity and learnable parameters\nfor backpropagation.

On the\nother hand, stroke optimization methods search for a set of stroke parameters\niteratively in a large search space; such low efficiency significantly limits\ntheir prevalence and practicality. Different from previous methods, in this\npaper, we formulate the task as a set prediction problem and propose a novel\nTransformer-based framework, dubbed Paint Transformer, to predict the\nparameters of a stroke set with a feed forward network. This way, our model can\ngenerate a set of strokes in parallel and obtain the final painting of size 512\n* 512 in near real time. More importantly, since there is no dataset available\nfor training the Paint Transformer, we devise a self-training pipeline such\nthat it can be trained without any off-the-shelf dataset while still achieving\nexcellent generalization capability.

FIFA is an anytime\ninference algorithm that provides a better speed vs. accuracy trade-off\ncompared to exact inference.

          "description": "This paper presents a three-tier modality alignment approach to learning\ntext-image joint embedding, coined as JEMA, for cross-modal retrieval of\ncooking recipes and food images. The first tier improves recipe text embedding\nby optimizing the LSTM networks with term extraction and ranking enhanced\nsequence patterns, and optimizes the image embedding by combining the\nResNeXt-101 image encoder with the category embedding using wideResNet-50 with\nword2vec. The second tier modality alignment optimizes the textual-visual joint\nembedding loss function using a double batch-hard triplet loss with soft-margin\noptimization. The third modality alignment incorporates two types of\ncross-modality alignments as the auxiliary loss regularizations to further\nreduce the alignment errors in the joint learning of the two modality-specific\nembedding functions. The category-based cross-modal alignment aims to align the\nimage category with the recipe category as a loss regularization to the joint\nembedding. The cross-modal discriminator-based alignment aims to add the\nvisual-textual embedding distribution alignment to further regularize the joint\nembedding loss. Extensive experiments with the one-million recipes benchmark\ndataset Recipe1M demonstrate that the proposed JEMA approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art cross-modal embedding methods for both image-to-recipe and\nrecipe-to-image retrievals.",

Recently, self-supervised methods draw much attention, due to their free\nof depth annotations and impressive performance on several daytime benchmarks,\nsuch as KITTI and Cityscapes. However, they produce weird outputs in more\nchallenging nighttime scenarios because of low visibility and varying\nilluminations, which bring weak textures and break brightness-consistency\nassumption, respectively. To address these problems, in this paper we propose a\nnovel framework with several improvements: (1) we introduce Priors-Based\nRegularization to learn distribution knowledge from unpaired depth maps and\nprevent model from being incorrectly trained; (2) we leverage\nMapping-Consistent Image Enhancement module to enhance image visibility and\ncontrast while maintaining brightness consistency; and (3) we present\nStatistics-Based Mask strategy to tune the number of removed pixels within\ntextureless regions, using dynamic statistics.

Deep\nlearning-based region of interest segmentation is among the most exciting use\ncases. However, this paradigm is restricted in real-world clinical applications\ndue to poor robustness and generalization. The issue is more sinister with a\nlack of training data. In this paper, we address the challenge from the\nrepresentation learning point of view. We investigate that the collapsed\nrepresentations, as one of the main reasons which caused poor robustness and\ngeneralization, could be avoided through transfer learning. Therefore, we\npropose a novel two-stage framework for robust generalized segmentation. In\nparticular, an unsupervised Tile-wise AutoEncoder (T-AE) pretraining\narchitecture is coined to learn meaningful representation for improving the\ngeneralization and robustness of the downstream tasks. Furthermore, the learned\nknowledge is transferred to the segmentation benchmark. Coupled with an image\nreconstruction network, the representation keeps to be decoded, encouraging the\nmodel to capture more semantic features. Experiments of lung segmentation on\nmulti chest X-ray datasets are conducted. Empirically, the related experimental\nresults demonstrate the superior generalization capability of the proposed\nframework on unseen domains in terms of high performance and robustness to\ncorruption, especially under the scenario of the limited training data.",

          "description": "Unsupervised learning of global features for 3D shape analysis is an\nimportant research challenge because it avoids manual effort for supervised\ninformation collection. In this paper, we propose a view-based deep learning\nmodel called Hierarchical View Predictor (HVP) to learn 3D shape features from\nunordered views in an unsupervised manner. To mine highly discriminative\ninformation from unordered views, HVP performs a novel hierarchical view\nprediction over a view pair, and aggregates the knowledge learned from the\npredictions in all view pairs into a global feature. In a view pair, we pose\nhierarchical view prediction as the task of hierarchically predicting a set of\nimage patches in a current view from its complementary set of patches, and in\naddition, completing the current view and its opposite from any one of the two\nsets of patches. Hierarchical prediction, in patches to patches, patches to\nview and view to view, facilitates HVP to effectively learn the structure of 3D\nshapes from the correlation between patches in the same view and the\ncorrelation between a pair of complementary views. In addition, the employed\nimplicit aggregation over all view pairs enables HVP to learn global features\nfrom unordered views. Our results show that HVP can outperform state-of-the-art\nmethods under large-scale 3D shape benchmarks in shape classification and\nretrieval.",

Given\nan arbitrary textual search query, Open-vocabulary Visual Instance Search\n(OVIS) aims to return a ranked list of visual instances, i.e., image patches,\nthat satisfies the search intent from an image database. The term \"open\nvocabulary\" means that there are neither restrictions to the visual instance to\nbe searched nor restrictions to the word that can be used to compose the\ntextual search query. We propose to address such a search challenge via\nvisual-semantic aligned representation learning (ViSA). ViSA leverages massive\nimage-caption pairs as weak image-level (not instance-level) supervision to\nlearn a rich cross-modal semantic space where the representations of visual\ninstances (not images) and those of textual queries are aligned, thus allowing\nus to measure the similarities between any visual instance and an arbitrary\ntextual query. To evaluate the performance of ViSA, we build two datasets named\nOVIS40 and OVIS1600 and also introduce a pipeline for error analysis. Through\nextensive experiments on the two datasets, we demonstrate ViSA's ability to\nsearch for visual instances in images not available during training given a\nwide range of textual queries including those composed of uncommon words.\nExperimental results show that ViSA achieves an mAP@50 of 21.9% on OVIS40 under\nthe most challenging setting and achieves an mAP@6 of 14.9% on OVIS1600\ndataset.",

          "description": "We introduce the first Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to find a\nbetter transformer architecture for image recognition. Recently, transformers\nwithout CNN-based backbones are found to achieve impressive performance for\nimage recognition. However, the transformer is designed for NLP tasks and thus\ncould be sub-optimal when directly used for image recognition. In order to\nimprove the visual representation ability for transformers, we propose a new\nsearch space and searching algorithm. Specifically, we introduce a locality\nmodule that models the local correlations in images explicitly with fewer\ncomputational cost. With the locality module, our search space is defined to\nlet the search algorithm freely trade off between global and local information\nas well as optimizing the low-level design choice in each module. To tackle the\nproblem caused by huge search space, a hierarchical neural architecture search\nmethod is proposed to search the optimal vision transformer from two levels\nseparately with the evolutionary algorithm. Extensive experiments on the\nImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method can find more discriminative and\nefficient transformer variants than the ResNet family (e.g., ResNet101) and the\nbaseline ViT for image classification.",

          "description": "Visual understanding requires comprehending complex visual relations between\nobjects within a scene. Here, we seek to characterize the computational demands\nfor abstract visual reasoning. We do this by systematically assessing the\nability of modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn to solve\nthe Synthetic Visual Reasoning Test (SVRT) challenge, a collection of\ntwenty-three visual reasoning problems. Our analysis leads to a novel taxonomy\nof visual reasoning tasks, which can be primarily explained by both the type of\nrelations (same-different vs. spatial-relation judgments) and the number of\nrelations used to compose the underlying rules. Prior cognitive neuroscience\nwork suggests that attention plays a key role in human's visual reasoning\nability. To test this, we extended the CNNs with spatial and feature-based\nattention mechanisms. In a second series of experiments, we evaluated the\nability of these attention networks to learn to solve the SVRT challenge and\nfound the resulting architectures to be much more efficient at solving the\nhardest of these visual reasoning tasks. Most importantly, the corresponding\nimprovements on individual tasks partially explained the taxonomy.

          "description": "Fast arbitrary neural style transfer has attracted widespread attention from\nacademic, industrial and art communities due to its flexibility in enabling\nvarious applications. Existing solutions either attentively fuse deep style\nfeature into deep content feature without considering feature distributions, or\nadaptively normalize deep content feature according to the style such that\ntheir global statistics are matched. Although effective, leaving shallow\nfeature unexplored and without locally considering feature statistics, they are\nprone to unnatural output with unpleasing local distortions. To alleviate this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a novel attention and normalization module,\nnamed Adaptive Attention Normalization (AdaAttN), to adaptively perform\nattentive normalization on per-point basis. Specifically, spatial attention\nscore is learnt from both shallow and deep features of content and style\nimages. Then per-point weighted statistics are calculated by regarding a style\nfeature point as a distribution of attention-weighted output of all style\nfeature points. Finally, the content feature is normalized so that they\ndemonstrate the same local feature statistics as the calculated per-point\nweighted style feature statistics. Besides, a novel local feature loss is\nderived based on AdaAttN to enhance local visual quality. We also extend\nAdaAttN to be ready for video style transfer with slight modifications.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art arbitrary\nimage/video style transfer.

          "description": "We propose the ViNet architecture for audio-visual saliency prediction. ViNet\nis a fully convolutional encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder uses visual\nfeatures from a network trained for action recognition, and the decoder infers\na saliency map via trilinear interpolation and 3D convolutions, combining\nfeatures from multiple hierarchies. The overall architecture of ViNet is\nconceptually simple; it is causal and runs in real-time (60 fps). ViNet does\nnot use audio as input and still outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-visual\nsaliency prediction models on nine different datasets (three visual-only and\nsix audio-visual datasets). ViNet also surpasses human performance on the CC,\nSIM and AUC metrics for the AVE dataset, and to our knowledge, it is the first\nnetwork to do so. We also explore a variation of ViNet architecture by\naugmenting audio features into the decoder. To our surprise, upon sufficient\ntraining, the network becomes agnostic to the input audio and provides the same\noutput irrespective of the input. Interestingly, we also observe similar\nbehaviour in the previous state-of-the-art models \\cite{tsiami2020stavis} for\naudio-visual saliency prediction. Our findings contrast with previous works on\ndeep learning-based audio-visual saliency prediction, suggesting a clear avenue\nfor future explorations incorporating audio in a more effective manner.

However,\nit remains challenging to acquire novel classes in an online fashion for the\nsegmentation task, mainly due to its continuously-evolving semantic label\nspace, partial pixelwise ground-truth annotations, and constrained data\navailability. To ad- dress this, we propose an incremental learning strategy\nthat can fast adapt deep segmentation models without catastrophic forgetting,\nusing a streaming input data with pixel annotations on the novel classes only.\nTo this end, we develop a uni ed learning strategy based on the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) framework, which integrates an iterative\nrelabeling strategy that lls in the missing labels and a rehearsal-based\nincremental learning step that balances the stability-plasticity of the model.\nMoreover, our EM algorithm adopts an adaptive sampling method to select\ninformative train- ing data and a class-balancing training strategy in the\nincremental model updates, both improving the e cacy of model learning.

          "description": "Automated and accurate segmentation of the infected regions in computed\ntomography (CT) images is critical for the prediction of the pathological stage\nand treatment response of COVID-19. Several deep convolutional neural networks\n(DCNNs) have been designed for this task, whose performance, however, tends to\nbe suppressed by their limited local receptive fields and insufficient global\nreasoning ability. In this paper, we propose a pixel-wise sparse graph\nreasoning (PSGR) module and insert it into a segmentation network to enhance\nthe modeling of long-range dependencies for COVID-19 infected region\nsegmentation in CT images. In the PSGR module, a graph is first constructed by\nprojecting each pixel on a node based on the features produced by the\nsegmentation backbone, and then converted into a sparsely-connected graph by\nkeeping only K strongest connections to each uncertain pixel. The long-range\ninformation reasoning is performed on the sparsely-connected graph to generate\nenhanced features. The advantages of this module are two-fold: (1) the\npixel-wise mapping strategy not only avoids imprecise pixel-to-node projections\nbut also preserves the inherent information of each pixel for global reasoning;\nand (2) the sparsely-connected graph construction results in effective\ninformation retrieval and reduction of the noise propagation. The proposed\nsolution has been evaluated against four widely-used segmentation models on\nthree public datasets.

          "description": "Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws\nincreasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem\nby trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead\nof the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting\nmight make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely\nimbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a\nnovel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP),\nwhich always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all\nintervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably\nintroduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose\nanother criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects\nthe best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during\ninference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly\nnegligible.

In light of this, we propose to further\nleverage 2D data for 3D domain adaptation by intra and inter domain cross modal\nlearning. As for intra-domain cross modal learning, most existing works sample\nthe dense 2D pixel-wise features into the same size with sparse 3D point-wise\nfeatures, resulting in the abandon of numerous useful 2D features. To address\nthis problem, we propose Dynamic sparse-to-dense Cross Modal Learning (DsCML)\nto increase the sufficiency of multi-modality information interaction for\ndomain adaptation. For inter-domain cross modal learning, we further advance\nCross Modal Adversarial Learning (CMAL) on 2D and 3D data which contains\ndifferent semantic content aiming to promote high-level modal complementarity.\nWe evaluate our model under various multi-modality domain adaptation settings\nincluding day-to-night, country-to-country and dataset-to-dataset, brings large\nimprovements over both uni-modal and multi-modal domain adaptation methods on\nall settings.",

In this paper, we present an unsupervised GAN-based model\nconsisting of multiple weight-sharing generators to estimate a 3D human pose\nfrom a single image without 3D annotations. In our model, we introduce\nsingle-view-multi-angle consistency (SVMAC) to significantly improve the\nestimation performance. With 2D joint locations as input, our model estimates a\n3D pose and a camera simultaneously. During training, the estimated 3D pose is\nrotated by random angles and the estimated camera projects the rotated 3D poses\nback to 2D. The 2D reprojections will be fed into weight-sharing generators to\nestimate the corresponding 3D poses and cameras, which are then mixed to impose\nSVMAC constraints to self-supervise the training process.

In this paper, a novel method called MPI is proposed for\nsalient object detection. Firstly, a multi-receptive enhancement module (MRE)\nis designed to effectively expand the receptive fields of features from\ndifferent layers and generate features with different receptive fields. MRE can\nenhance the semantic representation and improve the model's perception of the\nimage context, which enables the model to locate the salient object accurately.\nSecondly, in order to reduce the reuse of redundant information in the complex\ntop-down fusion method and weaken the differences between semantic features, a\nrelatively simple but effective parallel fusion strategy (PFS) is proposed. It\nallows multi-scale features to better interact with each other, thus improving\nthe overall performance of the model.

The second relies on web-crawled data to retrieve images\ncontaining examples of old classes from online databases.

Intraoperative diagnosis\ncan be challenging due to tumor diversity and lack of intraoperative pathology\nresources.\n\nObjective: To develop an independent and parallel intraoperative pathology\nworkflow that can provide rapid and accurate skull base tumor diagnoses using\nlabel-free optical imaging and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMethod: We used a fiber laser-based, label-free, non-consumptive,\nhigh-resolution microscopy method ($<$ 60 sec per 1 $\\times$ 1 mm$^\\text{2}$),\ncalled stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a consecutive, multicenter\ncohort of skull base tumor patients. SRH images were then used to train a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) model using three representation learning\nstrategies: cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised\ncontrastive learning. Our trained CNN models were tested on a held-out,\nmulticenter SRH dataset.\n\nResults: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of both benign and\nmalignant skull base tumors. Of the three representation learning strategies,\nsupervised contrastive learning most effectively learned the distinctive and\ndiagnostic SRH image features for each of the skull base tumor types. In our\nmulticenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy\nof 91.5%, self-supervised contrastive learning 83.9%, and supervised\ncontrastive learning 96.6%.

          "description": "We study the problem of deconvolution for light-sheet microscopy, where the\ndata is corrupted by spatially varying blur and a combination of Poisson and\nGaussian noise. The spatial variation of the point spread function (PSF) of a\nlight-sheet microscope is determined by the interaction between the excitation\nsheet and the detection objective PSF. First, we introduce a model of the image\nformation process that incorporates this interaction, therefore capturing the\nmain characteristics of this imaging modality. Then, we formulate a variational\nmodel that accounts for the combination of Poisson and Gaussian noise through a\ndata fidelity term consisting of the infimal convolution of the single noise\nfidelities, first introduced in L. Calatroni et al. \"Infimal convolution of\ndata discrepancies for mixed noise removal\", SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences\n10.3 (2017), 1196-1233. We establish convergence rates in a Bregman distance\nunder a source condition for the infimal convolution fidelity and a discrepancy\nprinciple for choosing the value of the regularisation parameter. The inverse\nproblem is solved by applying the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm\nin a novel way. Finally, numerical experiments performed on both simulated and\nreal data show superior reconstruction results in comparison with other\nmethods.",

          "description": "Most existing trackers based on deep learning perform tracking in a holistic\nstrategy, which aims to learn deep representations of the whole target for\nlocalizing the target. It is arduous for such methods to track targets with\nvarious appearance variations. To address this limitation, another type of\nmethods adopts a part-based tracking strategy which divides the target into\nequal patches and tracks all these patches in parallel. The target state is\ninferred by summarizing the tracking results of these patches. A potential\nlimitation of such trackers is that not all patches are equally informative for\ntracking. Some patches that are not discriminative may have adverse effects. In\nthis paper, we propose to track the salient local parts of the target that are\ndiscriminative for tracking. In particular, we propose a fine-grained saliency\nmining module to capture the local saliencies. Further, we design a\nsaliency-association modeling module to associate the captured saliencies\ntogether to learn effective correlation representations between the exemplar\nand the search image for state estimation.

However, action detection requires not\nonly categorizing actions, but also localizing them in untrimmed videos.\nTherefore, transferring knowledge pertaining to temporal relations is critical\nfor this task which is missing in the previous cross-modal KD frameworks. To\nthis end, we aim at learning an augmented RGB representation for action\ndetection, taking advantage of additional modalities at training time through\nKD. We propose a KD framework consisting of two levels of distillation. On one\nhand, atomic-level distillation encourages the RGB student to learn the\nsub-representation of the actions from the teacher in a contrastive manner. On\nthe other hand, sequence-level distillation encourages the student to learn the\ntemporal knowledge from the teacher, which consists of transferring the Global\nContextual Relations and the Action Boundary Saliency. The result is an\nAugmented-RGB stream that can achieve competitive performance as the two-stream\nnetwork while using only RGB at inference time.

          "description": "Learning to generate 3D point clouds without 3D supervision is an important\nbut challenging problem. Current solutions leverage various differentiable\nrenderers to project the generated 3D point clouds onto a 2D image plane, and\ntrain deep neural networks using the per-pixel difference with 2D ground truth\nimages. However, these solutions are still struggling to fully recover fine\nstructures of 3D shapes, such as thin tubes or planes. To resolve this issue,\nwe propose an unsupervised approach for 3D point cloud generation with fine\nstructures. Specifically, we cast 3D point cloud learning as a 2D projection\nmatching problem. Rather than using entire 2D silhouette images as a regular\npixel supervision, we introduce structure adaptive sampling to randomly sample\n2D points within the silhouettes as an irregular point supervision, which\nalleviates the consistency issue of sampling from different view angles. Our\nmethod pushes the neural network to generate a 3D point cloud whose 2D\nprojections match the irregular point supervision from different view angles.\nOur 2D projection matching approach enables the neural network to learn more\naccurate structure information than using the per-pixel difference, especially\nfor fine and thin 3D structures. Our method can recover fine 3D structures from\n2D silhouette images at different resolutions, and is robust to different\nsampling methods and point number in irregular point supervision.

However, these\napproaches neglect that the appearance of rain is often accompanied by low\nlight conditions, which will further degrade the image quality. Therefore, it\nis very indispensable to jointly remove the rain and enhance the light for\nreal-world rain image restoration. In this paper, we aim to address this\nproblem from two aspects. First, we proposed a novel entangled network, namely\nEMNet, which can remove the rain and enhance illumination in one go.\nSpecifically, two encoder-decoder networks interact complementary information\nthrough entanglement structure, and parallel rain removal and illumination\nenhancement. Considering that the encoder-decoder structure is unreliable in\npreserving spatial details, we employ a detail recovery network to restore the\ndesired fine texture. Second, we present a new synthetic dataset, namely\nDarkRain, to boost the development of rain image restoration algorithms in\npractical scenarios. DarkRain not only contains different degrees of rain, but\nalso considers different lighting conditions, and more realistically simulates\nthe rainfall in the real world. EMNet is extensively evaluated on the proposed\nbenchmark and achieves state-of-the-art results.

          "description": "Multi-View Stereo (MVS) is a core task in 3D computer vision. With the surge\nof novel deep learning methods, learned MVS has surpassed the accuracy of\nclassical approaches, but still relies on building a memory intensive dense\ncost volume. Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is a parallel line of research and has\nrecently seen an increase in popularity with Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)\nmodels, which optimize a per scene radiance field. However, NeRF methods do not\ngeneralize to novel scenes and are slow to train and test. We propose to bridge\nthe gap between these two methodologies with a novel network that can recover\n3D scene geometry as a distance function, together with high-resolution color\nimages. Our method uses only a sparse set of images as input and can generalize\nwell to novel scenes. Additionally, we propose a coarse-to-fine sphere tracing\napproach in order to significantly increase speed. We show on various datasets\nthat our method reaches comparable accuracy to per-scene optimized methods\nwhile being able to generalize and running significantly faster.",

Specifically,\ngiven an untrimmed video, WSSTAD aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube (i.e.,\na sequence of bounding boxes at consecutive times) that encloses the abnormal\nevent, with only coarse video-level annotations as supervision during training.\nTo address this challenging task, we propose a dual-branch network which takes\nas input the proposals with multi-granularities in both spatial-temporal\ndomains. Each branch employs a relationship reasoning module to capture the\ncorrelation between tubes/videolets, which can provide rich contextual\ninformation and complex entity relationships for the concept learning of\nabnormal behaviors. Mutually-guided Progressive Refinement framework is set up\nto employ dual-path mutual guidance in a recurrent manner, iteratively sharing\nauxiliary supervision information across branches. It impels the learned\nconcepts of each branch to serve as a guide for its counterpart, which\nprogressively refines the corresponding branch and the whole framework.\nFurthermore, we contribute two datasets, i.e., ST-UCF-Crime and STRA,\nconsisting of videos containing spatio-temporal abnormal annotations to serve\nas the benchmarks for WSSTAD.

The most popular protocol pathologists use for\ndiagnosing breast cancer is the Nottingham grading system which grades the\nproliferation of tumors based on 3 major criteria, the most important of them\nbeing mitotic cell count. The way in which pathologists evaluate mitotic cell\ncount is to subjectively and qualitatively analyze cells present in stained\nslides of tissue and make a decision on its mitotic state i.e. is it mitotic or\nnot?This process is extremely inefficient and tiring for pathologists and so an\nefficient, accurate, and fully automated tool to aid with the diagnosis is\nextremely desirable. Fortunately, creating such a tool is made significantly\neasier with the AutoML tool available from Microsoft Azure, however to the best\nof our knowledge the AutoML tool has never been formally evaluated for use in\nmitotic cell detection in histopathology images.

          "description": "Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) has become an important technique in exploiting\nhyperspectral data since it decomposes a mixed pixel into a collection of\nendmembers weighted by fractional abundances. The endmembers of a hyperspectral\nimage (HSI) are more likely to be generated by independent sources and be mixed\nin a macroscopic degree before arriving at the sensor element of the imaging\nspectrometer as mixed spectra. Over the past few decades, many attempts have\nfocused on imposing auxiliary constraints on the conventional nonnegative\nmatrix factorization (NMF) framework in order to effectively unmix these mixed\nspectra. As a promising step toward finding an optimum constraint to extract\nendmembers, this paper presents a novel blind HU algorithm, referred to as\nKurtosis-based Smooth Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (KbSNMF) which\nincorporates a novel constraint based on the statistical independence of the\nprobability density functions of endmember spectra. Imposing this constraint on\nthe conventional NMF framework promotes the extraction of independent\nendmembers while further enhancing the parts-based representation of data.\nExperiments conducted on diverse synthetic HSI datasets (with numerous numbers\nof endmembers, spectral bands, pixels, and noise levels) and three standard\nreal HSI datasets demonstrate the validity of the proposed KbSNMF algorithm\ncompared to several state-of-the-art NMF-based HU baselines. The proposed\nalgorithm exhibits superior performance especially in terms of extracting\nendmember spectra from hyperspectral data; therefore, it could uplift the\nperformance of recent deep learning HU methods which utilize the endmember\nspectra as supervisory input data for abundance extraction.",

Pedestrians often exhibit complex behaviors influenced by\nvarious contextual elements. To address this problem, we propose BiPed, a\nmultitask learning framework that simultaneously predicts trajectories and\nactions of pedestrians by relying on multimodal data. Our method benefits from\n1) a bifold encoding approach where different data modalities are processed\nindependently allowing them to develop their own representations, and jointly\nto produce a representation for all modalities using shared parameters; 2) a\nnovel interaction modeling technique that relies on categorical semantic\nparsing of the scenes to capture interactions between target pedestrians and\ntheir surroundings; and 3) a bifold prediction mechanism that uses both\nindependent and shared decoding of multimodal representations. Using public\npedestrian behavior benchmark datasets for driving, PIE and JAAD, we highlight\nthe benefits of the proposed method for behavior prediction and show that our\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves trajectory and action\nprediction by up to 22% and 9% respectively.

In the framework of the FA-GAN,\nthe local fusion feature block, consisting of different three-pass networks by\nusing different convolution kernels, is proposed to extract image features at\ndifferent scales. And the global feature fusion module, including the channel\nattention module, the self-attention module, and the fusion operation, is\ndesigned to enhance the important features of the MR image. Moreover, the\nspectral normalization process is introduced to make the discriminator network\nstable. 40 sets of 3D magnetic resonance images (each set of images contains\n256 slices) are used to train the network, and 10 sets of images are used to\ntest the proposed method. The experimental results show that the PSNR and SSIM\nvalues of the super-resolution magnetic resonance image generated by the\nproposed FA-GAN method are higher than the state-of-the-art reconstruction\nmethods.",

          "description": "A key factor for assessing the state of the heart after myocardial infarction\n(MI) is to measure whether the myocardium segment is viable after reperfusion\nor revascularization therapy. Delayed enhancement-MRI or DE-MRI, which is\nperformed several minutes after injection of the contrast agent, provides high\ncontrast between viable and nonviable myocardium and is therefore a method of\nchoice to evaluate the extent of MI. To automatically assess myocardial status,\nthe results of the EMIDEC challenge that focused on this task are presented in\nthis paper. The challenge's main objectives were twofold. First, to evaluate if\ndeep learning methods can distinguish between normal and pathological cases.\nSecond, to automatically calculate the extent of myocardial infarction. The\npublicly available database consists of 150 exams divided into 50 cases with\nnormal MRI after injection of a contrast agent and 100 cases with myocardial\ninfarction (and then with a hyperenhanced area on DE-MRI), whatever their\ninclusion in the cardiac emergency department. Along with MRI, clinical\ncharacteristics are also provided. The obtained results issued from several\nworks show that the automatic classification of an exam is a reachable task\n(the best method providing an accuracy of 0.92), and the automatic segmentation\nof the myocardium is possible. However, the segmentation of the diseased area\nneeds to be improved, mainly due to the small size of these areas and the lack\nof contrast with the surrounding structures.",

          "description": "COVID-19 has caused many deaths worldwide. The automation of the diagnosis of\nthis virus is highly desired. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown\noutstanding classification performance on image datasets. To date, it appears\nthat COVID computer-aided diagnosis systems based on CNNs and clinical\ninformation have not yet been analysed or explored. We propose a novel method,\nnamed the CNN-AE, to predict the survival chance of COVID-19 patients using a\nCNN trained with clinical information. Notably, the required resources to\nprepare CT images are expensive and limited compared to those required to\ncollect clinical data, such as blood pressure, liver disease, etc. We evaluated\nour method using a publicly available clinical dataset that we collected. The\ndataset properties were carefully analysed to extract important features and\ncompute the correlations of features. A data augmentation procedure based on\nautoencoders (AEs) was proposed to balance the dataset. The experimental\nresults revealed that the average accuracy of the CNN-AE (96.05%) was higher\nthan that of the CNN (92.49%). To demonstrate the generality of our\naugmentation method, we trained some existing mortality risk prediction methods\non our dataset (with and without data augmentation) and compared their\nperformances. We also evaluated our method using another dataset for further\ngenerality verification. To show that clinical data can be used for COVID-19\nsurvival chance prediction, the CNN-AE was compared with multiple pre-trained\ndeep models that were tuned based on CT images.",

Compared to the task of scene graph generation from images, it is more\nchallenging because of the dynamic relationships between objects and the\ntemporal dependencies between frames allowing for a richer semantic\ninterpretation. In this paper, we propose Spatial-temporal Transformer\n(STTran), a neural network that consists of two core modules: (1) a spatial\nencoder that takes an input frame to extract spatial context and reason about\nthe visual relationships within a frame, and (2) a temporal decoder which takes\nthe output of the spatial encoder as input in order to capture the temporal\ndependencies between frames and infer the dynamic relationships. Furthermore,\nSTTran is flexible to take varying lengths of videos as input without clipping,\nwhich is especially important for long videos. Our method is validated on the\nbenchmark dataset Action Genome (AG). The experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of our method in terms of dynamic scene graphs.

To better exploit the value of both pre-trained weights and unlabeled\ntarget examples, we introduce adaptive consistency regularization that consists\nof two complementary components: Adaptive Knowledge Consistency (AKC) on the\nexamples between the source and target model, and Adaptive Representation\nConsistency (ARC) on the target model between labeled and unlabeled examples.\nExamples involved in the consistency regularization are adaptively selected\naccording to their potential contributions to the target task. We conduct\nextensive experiments on popular benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and\nMURA, by fine-tuning the ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-50 model. Results show\nthat our proposed adaptive consistency regularization outperforms\nstate-of-the-art semi-supervised learning techniques such as Pseudo Label, Mean\nTeacher, and FixMatch.

          "description": "Ill-posed linear inverse problems appear in many scientific setups, and are\ntypically addressed by solving optimization problems, which are composed of\ndata fidelity and prior terms. Recently, several works have considered a\nback-projection (BP) based fidelity term as an alternative to the common least\nsquares (LS), and demonstrated excellent results for popular inverse problems.\nThese works have also empirically shown that using the BP term, rather than the\nLS term, requires fewer iterations of optimization algorithms. In this paper,\nwe examine the convergence rate of the projected gradient descent (PGD)\nalgorithm for the BP objective. Our analysis allows to identify an inherent\nsource for its faster convergence compared to using the LS objective, while\nmaking only mild assumptions. We also analyze the more general proximal\ngradient method under a relaxed contraction condition on the proximal mapping\nof the prior. This analysis further highlights the advantage of BP when the\nlinear measurement operator is badly conditioned. Numerical experiments with\nboth $\\ell_1$-norm and GAN-based priors corroborate our theoretical results.",

          "description": "With the success of deep neural networks, knowledge distillation which guides\nthe learning of a small student network from a large teacher network is being\nactively studied for model compression and transfer learning. However, few\nstudies have been performed to resolve the poor learning issue of the student\nnetwork when the student and teacher model sizes significantly differ. In this\npaper, we propose a densely guided knowledge distillation using multiple\nteacher assistants that gradually decreases the model size to efficiently\nbridge the large gap between the teacher and student networks. To stimulate\nmore efficient learning of the student network, we guide each teacher assistant\nto every other smaller teacher assistants iteratively. Specifically, when\nteaching a smaller teacher assistant at the next step, the existing larger\nteacher assistants from the previous step are used as well as the teacher\nnetwork. Moreover, we design stochastic teaching where, for each mini-batch, a\nteacher or teacher assistants are randomly dropped. This acts as a regularizer\nto improve the efficiency of teaching of the student network. Thus, the student\ncan always learn salient distilled knowledge from the multiple sources. We\nverified the effectiveness of the proposed method for a classification task\nusing CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. We also achieved significant\nperformance improvements with various backbone architectures such as ResNet,\nWideResNet, and VGG.",

Remarkably, the most\ncritical scenarios aremuch less frequent and more complex than the\nuncriticalones. Therefore, uncritical cases dominate the prediction. In this\npaper, we address specifically the challenging scenarios at the long tail of\nthe dataset distribution. Our analysis shows that the common losses tend to\nplace challenging cases suboptimally in the embedding space. As a consequence,\nwe propose to supplement the usual loss with aloss that places challenging\ncases closer to each other. This triggers sharing information among challenging\ncases andlearning specific predictive features. We show on four public datasets\nthat this leads to improved performance on the challenging scenarios while the\noverall performance stays stable.

To overcome the problem mentioned above,\nwe propose a deep learning pipeline for the temporal analysis of the visual\nchanges induced in the plant due to stress and apply it for the specific case\nof water stress identification in Chickpea plant shoot images. For this, we\nhave considered an image dataset of two chickpea varieties JG-62 and Pusa-372,\nunder three water stress conditions; control, young seedling, and before\nflowering, captured over five months. We have employed a variant of the\nLong-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) to learn spatio-temporal\npatterns from the chickpea plant dataset and use them for water stress\nclassification. Our model has achieved ceiling level classification performance\nof 98.52% on JG-62 and 97.78% on Pusa-372 chickpea plant data and has\noutperformed the state-of-the-art time-invariant technique by at least 14% for\nboth JG-62 and Pusa-372 species, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, our\nLRCN model has demonstrated robustness to noisy input, with a less than 2.5%\ndip in average model accuracy and a small standard deviation about the mean for\nboth species. Lastly, we have performed an ablation study to analyze the\nperformance of the LRCN model by decreasing the number of temporal session data\nused for training.",

In\naddition, the selected pose sequence is often misaligned with the music beat.\nTo solve this problem, we further develop a temporal alignment algorithm to\nalign the rhythm of music and dance. Finally, the processed pose sequence is\nused to synthesize realistic dancing videos in the imagination module.

          "description": "Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) based on image-level labels\nhas been greatly advanced by exploiting the outputs of Class Activation Map\n(CAM) to generate the pseudo labels for semantic segmentation. However, CAM\nmerely discovers seeds from a small number of regions, which may be\ninsufficient to serve as pseudo masks for semantic segmentation. In this paper,\nwe formulate the expansion of object regions in CAM as an increase in\ninformation. From the perspective of information theory, we propose a novel\nComplementary Patch (CP) Representation and prove that the information of the\nsum of the CAMs by a pair of input images with complementary hidden (patched)\nparts, namely CP Pair, is greater than or equal to the information of the\nbaseline CAM. Therefore, a CAM with more information related to object seeds\ncan be obtained by narrowing down the gap between the sum of CAMs generated by\nthe CP Pair and the original CAM. We propose a CP Network (CPN) implemented by\na triplet network and three regularization functions. To further improve the\nquality of the CAMs, we propose a Pixel-Region Correlation Module (PRCM) to\naugment the contextual information by using object-region relations between the\nfeature maps and the CAMs. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nshow that our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art in WSSS,\nvalidating the effectiveness of our CP Representation and CPN.",

          "description": "Open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) considers that the target domain contains\nsamples from novel categories unobserved in external source domain.\nUnfortunately, existing OSDA methods always ignore the demand for the\ninformation of unseen categories and simply recognize them as \"unknown\" set\nwithout further explanation. This motivates us to understand the unknown\ncategories more specifically by exploring the underlying structures and\nrecovering their interpretable semantic attributes. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework to accurately identify the seen categories in target domain,\nand effectively recover the semantic attributes for unseen categories.\nSpecifically, structure preserving partial alignment is developed to recognize\nthe seen categories through domain-invariant feature learning. Attribute\npropagation over visual graph is designed to smoothly transit attributes from\nseen to unseen categories via visual-semantic mapping. Moreover, two new\ncross-main benchmarks are constructed to evaluate the proposed framework in the\nnovel and practical challenge.

In the literature, this problem is\noften tackled using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Despite the powerful\ncapabilities of RNNs in capturing the temporal dependency in the pedestrians'\nmotion trajectories, they were argued to be challenged when dealing with longer\nsequential data. Thus, in this work, we are introducing a framework based on\nthe transformer networks that were shown recently to be more efficient and\noutperformed RNNs in many sequential-based tasks. We relied on a fusion of the\npast positional information, agent interactions information and scene physical\nsemantics information as an input to our framework in order to provide a robust\ntrajectory prediction of pedestrians.

In this paper, we formulate a new adversarial attack against\ndeep ranking systems, i.e., the Order Attack, which covertly alters the\nrelative order among a selected set of candidates according to an\nattacker-specified permutation, with limited interference to other unrelated\ncandidates. Specifically, it is formulated as a triplet-style loss imposing an\ninequality chain reflecting the specified permutation. However, direct\noptimization of such white-box objective is infeasible in a real-world attack\nscenario due to various black-box limitations. To cope with them, we propose a\nShort-range Ranking Correlation metric as a surrogate objective for black-box\nOrder Attack to approximate the white-box method. The Order Attack is evaluated\non the Fashion-MNIST and Stanford-Online-Products datasets under both white-box\nand black-box threat models.

          "description": "A point cloud serves as a representation of the surface of a\nthree-dimensional (3D) shape. Deep generative models have been adapted to model\ntheir variations typically using a map from a ball-like set of latent\nvariables. However, previous approaches did not pay much attention to the\ntopological structure of a point cloud, despite that a continuous map cannot\nexpress the varying numbers of holes and intersections. Moreover, a point cloud\nis often composed of multiple subparts, and it is also difficult to express. In\nthis study, we propose ChartPointFlow, a flow-based generative model with\nmultiple latent labels for 3D point clouds. Each label is assigned to points in\nan unsupervised manner. Then, a map conditioned on a label is assigned to a\ncontinuous subset of a point cloud, similar to a chart of a manifold. This\nenables our proposed model to preserve the topological structure with clear\nboundaries, whereas previous approaches tend to generate blurry point clouds\nand fail to generate holes. The experimental results demonstrate that\nChartPointFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of generation and\nreconstruction compared with other point cloud generators.

Moreover, the\nhandwriting of calligraphy masters has a more irregular stroke and is difficult\nto obtain in real-world scenarios. Recently, several GAN-based methods have\nbeen proposed for font synthesis, but some of them require numerous reference\ndata and the other part of them have cumbersome preprocessing steps to divide\nthe character into different parts to be learned and transferred separately. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple but powerful end-to-end Chinese calligraphy\nfont generation framework ZiGAN, which does not require any manual operation or\nredundant preprocessing to generate fine-grained target-style characters with\nfew-shot references. To be specific, a few paired samples from different\ncharacter styles are leveraged to attain a fine-grained correlation between\nstructures underlying different glyphs. To capture valuable style knowledge in\ntarget and strengthen the coarse-grained understanding of character content, we\nutilize multiple unpaired samples to align the feature distributions belonging\nto different character styles. By doing so, only a few target Chinese\ncalligraphy characters are needed to generated expected style transferred\ncharacters. Experiments demonstrate that our method has a state-of-the-art\ngeneralization ability in few-shot Chinese character style transfer.",

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to adapt a model of the labeled\nsource domain to an unlabeled target domain. Although the domain shifts may\nexist in various dimensions such as appearance, textures, etc, the contextual\ndependency, which is generally shared across different domains, is neglected by\nrecent methods. In this paper, we utilize this important clue as explicit prior\nknowledge and propose end-to-end Context-Aware Mixup (CAMix) for domain\nadaptive semantic segmentation. Firstly, we design a contextual mask generation\nstrategy by leveraging accumulated spatial distributions and contextual\nrelationships. The generated contextual mask is critical in this work and will\nguide the domain mixup. In addition, we define the significance mask to\nindicate where the pixels are credible. To alleviate the over-alignment (e.g.,\nearly performance degradation), the source and target significance masks are\nmixed based on the contextual mask into the mixed significance mask, and we\nintroduce a significance-reweighted consistency loss on it. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\nby a large margin on two widely-used domain adaptation benchmarks, i.e., GTAV\n$\\rightarrow $ Cityscapes and SYNTHIA $\\rightarrow $ Cityscapes.",

In this work, we propose a general model-agnostic technique for improving\nthe image quality and the distribution fidelity of generated images, obtained\nby any generative model.

Recent studies on 2D\nobject detection show that the anchor-free methods also are of great potential.\nHowever, the unordered and sparse properties of point clouds prevent us from\ndirectly leveraging the advanced 2D methods on 3D point clouds. We overcome\nthis by converting the voxel-based sparse 3D feature volumes into the sparse 2D\nfeature maps. We propose an attentive module to fit the sparse feature maps to\ndense mostly on the object regions through the deformable convolution tower and\nthe supervised mask-guided attention. By directly regressing the 3D bounding\nbox from the enhanced and dense feature maps, we construct a novel single-stage\n3D detector for point clouds in an anchor-free manner.

          "description": "The capsule network is a distinct and promising segment of the neural network\nfamily that drew attention due to its unique ability to maintain the\nequivariance property by preserving the spatial relationship amongst the\nfeatures. The capsule network has attained unprecedented success over image\nclassification tasks with datasets such as MNIST and affNIST by encoding the\ncharacteristic features into the capsules and building the parse-tree\nstructure. However, on the datasets involving complex foreground and background\nregions such as CIFAR-10, the performance of the capsule network is sub-optimal\ndue to its naive data routing policy and incompetence towards extracting\ncomplex features. This paper proposes a new design strategy for capsule network\narchitecture for efficiently dealing with complex images.

A wide bottleneck residual module facilitates extracting\ncomplex features followed by the squeeze and excitation attention block to\nenable channel-wise attention by suppressing the trivial features. This setup\nallows channel inter-dependencies at almost no computational cost, thereby\nenhancing the representation ability of capsules on complex images.

          "description": "Semi-supervised video object segmentation is a task of segmenting the target\nobject in a video sequence given only a mask annotation in the first frame. The\nlimited information available makes it an extremely challenging task. Most\nprevious best-performing methods adopt matching-based transductive reasoning or\nonline inductive learning. Nevertheless, they are either less discriminative\nfor similar instances or insufficient in the utilization of spatio-temporal\ninformation. In this work, we propose to integrate transductive and inductive\nlearning into a unified framework to exploit the complementarity between them\nfor accurate and robust video object segmentation. The proposed approach\nconsists of two functional branches. The transduction branch adopts a\nlightweight transformer architecture to aggregate rich spatio-temporal cues\nwhile the induction branch performs online inductive learning to obtain\ndiscriminative target information. To bridge these two diverse branches, a\ntwo-head label encoder is introduced to learn the suitable target prior for\neach of them. The generated mask encodings are further forced to be\ndisentangled to better retain their complementarity. Extensive experiments on\nseveral prevalent benchmarks show that, without the need of synthetic training\ndata, the proposed approach sets a series of new state-of-the-art records.

Utilizing precise superpixels and\nsuperpixel pooling on deep features, we refine initial coarse proposals in an\nend-to-end learned system. Furthermore, we propose a novel DeepFH segmentation,\nwhich enriches the classic Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher (FH) segmentation with\ndeep features leading to improved segmentation results and better object\nproposal refinements. On the COCO dataset with LVIS annotations, we show that\nour refinement based on DeepFH superpixels outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nand leads to more precise object proposals.",

          "description": "In this work, we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for\nperson re-ID where annotations are available for the source domain but not for\ntarget. Previous methods typically follow a two-stage optimization pipeline,\nwhere the network is first pre-trained on source and then fine-tuned on target\nwith pseudo labels created by feature clustering. Such methods sustain two main\nlimitations. (1) The label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative\nfeatures for recognizing target classes. (2) The domain gap may hinder\nknowledge transferring from source to target. We propose three types of\ntechnical schemes to alleviate these issues. First, we propose a cluster-wise\ncontrastive learning algorithm (CCL) by iterative optimization of feature\nlearning and cluster refinery to learn noise-tolerant representations in the\nunsupervised manner. Second, we adopt a progressive domain adaptation (PDA)\nstrategy to gradually mitigate the domain gap between source and target data.\nThird, we propose Fourier augmentation (FA) for further maximizing the class\nseparability of re-ID models by imposing extra constraints in the Fourier\nspace. We observe that these proposed schemes are capable of facilitating the\nlearning of discriminative feature representations. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our method consistently achieves notable improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods on multiple benchmarks, e.g.,\nsurpassing MMT largely by 8.1\\%, 9.9\\%, 11.4\\% and 11.1\\% mAP on the\nMarket-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT and Duke-to-MSMT tasks,\nrespectively.",

          "description": "The selective visual attention mechanism in the human visual system (HVS)\nrestricts the amount of information to reach visual awareness for perceiving\nnatural scenes, allowing near real-time information processing with limited\ncomputational capacity [Koch and Ullman, 1987]. This kind of selectivity acts\nas an 'Information Bottleneck (IB)', which seeks a trade-off between\ninformation compression and predictive accuracy. However, such information\nconstraints are rarely explored in the attention mechanism for deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an IB-inspired spatial attention\nmodule for DNN structures built for visual recognition. The module takes as\ninput an intermediate representation of the input image, and outputs a\nvariational 2D attention map that minimizes the mutual information (MI) between\nthe attention-modulated representation and the input, while maximizing the MI\nbetween the attention-modulated representation and the task label. To further\nrestrict the information bypassed by the attention map, we quantize the\ncontinuous attention scores to a set of learnable anchor values during\ntraining. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IB-inspired spatial\nattention mechanism can yield attention maps that neatly highlight the regions\nof interest while suppressing backgrounds, and bootstrap standard DNN\nstructures for visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification,\nfine-grained recognition, cross-domain classification). The attention maps are\ninterpretable for the decision making of the DNNs as verified in the\nexperiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/ashleylqx/AIB.git.",

          "description": "Aiming at discovering and locating most distinctive objects from visual\nscenes, salient object detection (SOD) plays an essential role in various\ncomputer vision systems. Coming to the era of high resolution, SOD methods are\nfacing new challenges. The major limitation of previous methods is that they\ntry to identify the salient regions and estimate the accurate objects\nboundaries simultaneously with a single regression task at low-resolution. This\npractice ignores the inherent difference between the two difficult problems,\nresulting in poor detection quality. In this paper, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework for high-resolution SOD task, which disentangles the task\ninto a low-resolution saliency classification network (LRSCN) and a\nhigh-resolution refinement network (HRRN). As a pixel-wise classification task,\nLRSCN is designed to capture sufficient semantics at low-resolution to identify\nthe definite salient, background and uncertain image regions. HRRN is a\nregression task, which aims at accurately refining the saliency value of pixels\nin the uncertain region to preserve a clear object boundary at high-resolution\nwith limited GPU memory. It is worth noting that by introducing uncertainty\ninto the training process, our HRRN can well address the high-resolution\nrefinement task without using any high-resolution training data.

Moreover, in cloud computing or GPU clusters where the tasks\narrive sequentially in a stream, faster online fine-tuning is a more desired\nand realistic strategy for saving money, energy consumption, and CO2 emission.\nIn this paper, we propose a joint Neural Architecture Search and Online\nAdaption framework named NASOA towards a faster task-oriented fine-tuning upon\nthe request of users.

          "description": "Existing vision systems for autonomous driving or robots are sensitive to\nwaterdrops adhered to windows or camera lenses. Most recent waterdrop removal\napproaches take a single image as input and often fail to recover the missing\ncontent behind waterdrops faithfully. Thus, we propose a learning-based model\nfor waterdrop removal with stereo images. To better detect and remove\nwaterdrops from stereo images, we propose a novel row-wise dilated attention\nmodule to enlarge attention's receptive field for effective information\npropagation between the two stereo images. In addition, we propose an attention\nconsistency loss between the ground-truth disparity map and attention scores to\nenhance the left-right consistency in stereo images. Because of related\ndatasets' unavailability, we collect a real-world dataset that contains stereo\nimages with and without waterdrops. Extensive experiments on our dataset\nsuggest that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively\nand qualitatively.

In this work, we present the LeafMask\nneural network, a new end-to-end model to delineate each leaf region and count\nthe number of leaves, with two main components: 1) the mask assembly module\nmerging position-sensitive bases of each predicted box after non-maximum\nsuppression (NMS) and corresponding coefficients to generate original masks; 2)\nthe mask refining module elaborating leaf boundaries from the mask assembly\nmodule by the point selection strategy and predictor. In addition, we also\ndesign a novel and flexible multi-scale attention module for the dual\nattention-guided mask (DAG-Mask) branch to effectively enhance information\nexpression and produce more accurate bases.

          "description": "Domain adaptation aims to bridge the domain shifts between the source and\ntarget domains. These shifts may span different dimensions such as fog,\nrainfall, etc. However, recent methods typically do not consider explicit prior\nknowledge on a specific dimension, thus leading to less desired adaptation\nperformance. In this paper, we study a practical setting called Specific Domain\nAdaptation (SDA) that aligns the source and target domains in a\ndemanded-specific dimension. Within this setting, we observe the intra-domain\ngap induced by different domainness (i.e., numerical magnitudes of this\ndimension) is crucial when adapting to a specific domain. To address the\nproblem, we propose a novel Self-Adversarial Disentangling (SAD) framework. In\nparticular, given a specific dimension, we first enrich the source domain by\nintroducing a domainness creator with providing additional supervisory signals.\nGuided by the created domainness, we design a self-adversarial regularizer and\ntwo loss functions to jointly disentangle the latent representations into\ndomainness-specific and domainness-invariant features, thus mitigating the\nintra-domain gap. Our method can be easily taken as a plug-and-play framework\nand does not introduce any extra costs in the inference time.

Furthermore, existing real-world benchmarks and datasets do not\ncategorize image data based on the types and appearances of reflection (e.g.,\nsmoothness, intensity), making it hard to analyze reflection removal methods.\nHence, we construct a new reflection removal dataset that is categorized,\ndiverse, and real-world (CDR).

          "description": "Faces manifest large variations in many aspects, such as identity,\nexpression, pose, and face styling. Therefore, it is a great challenge to\ndisentangle and extract these characteristics from facial images, especially in\nan unsupervised manner. In this work, we introduce cycle-consistency in facial\ncharacteristics as free supervisory signal to learn facial representations from\nunlabeled facial images. The learning is realized by superimposing the facial\nmotion cycle-consistency and identity cycle-consistency constraints. The main\nidea of the facial motion cycle-consistency is that, given a face with\nexpression, we can perform de-expression to a neutral face via the removal of\nfacial motion and further perform re-expression to reconstruct back to the\noriginal face. The main idea of the identity cycle-consistency is to exploit\nboth de-identity into mean face by depriving the given neutral face of its\nidentity via feature re-normalization and re-identity into neutral face by\nadding the personal attributes to the mean face. At training time, our model\nlearns to disentangle two distinct facial representations to be useful for\nperforming cycle-consistent face reconstruction. At test time, we use the\nlinear protocol scheme for evaluating facial representations on various tasks,\nincluding facial expression recognition and head pose regression. We also can\ndirectly apply the learnt facial representations to person recognition,\nfrontalization and image-to-image translation. Our experiments show that the\nresults of our approach is competitive with those of existing methods,\ndemonstrating the rich and unique information embedded in the disentangled\nrepresentations.

Although\nsome prior methods have partially addressed this task, there still remain some\nlimitations. Firstly, a direct association of Audio and Visual features may\nlimit the correlations to be extracted due to different modalities. Secondly,\nthe relationship across temporal segments helping to maintain the consistency\nof localization, separation, and conversation contexts is not effectively\nexploited.

          "description": "This paper strives for action recognition and detection in video modalities\nlike RGB, depth maps or 3D-skeleton sequences when only limited\nmodality-specific labeled examples are available. For the RGB, and derived\noptical-flow, modality many large-scale labeled datasets have been made\navailable. They have become the de facto pre-training choice when recognizing\nor detecting new actions from RGB datasets that have limited amounts of labeled\nexamples available. Unfortunately, large-scale labeled action datasets for\nother modalities are unavailable for pre-training. In this paper, our goal is\nto recognize actions from limited examples in non-RGB video modalities, by\nlearning from large-scale labeled RGB data. To this end, we propose a two-step\ntraining process: (i) we extract action representation knowledge from an\nRGB-trained teacher network and adapt it to a non-RGB student network. (ii) we\nthen fine-tune the transfer model with available labeled examples of the target\nmodality. For the knowledge transfer we introduce feature-supervision\nstrategies, which rely on unlabeled pairs of two modalities (the RGB and the\ntarget modality) to transfer feature level representations from the teacher to\nthe student network. Ablations and generalizations with two RGB source datasets\nand two non-RGB target datasets demonstrate that an optical-flow teacher\nprovides better action transfer features than RGB for both depth maps and\n3D-skeletons, even when evaluated on a different target domain, or for a\ndifferent task. Compared to alternative cross-modal action transfer methods we\nshow a good improvement in performance especially when labeled non-RGB examples\nto learn from are scarce",

But due to its complexity, researchers have not reached great\nresults compared to the action recognition task. The complexity is related to\npredicting precise start and end times for different actions in any video. In\nthis paper, we propose a new network based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and\ntwo novel post-processing ideas for TAL task. Specifically, we propose a new\ndesign for the output layer of the GRU resulting in the so-called GRU-Splitted\nmodel. Moreover, linear interpolation is used to generate the action proposals\nwith precise start and end times.

          "description": "Recent research in embodied AI has been boosted by the use of simulation\nenvironments to develop and train robot learning approaches. However, the use\nof simulation has skewed the attention to tasks that only require what robotics\nsimulators can simulate: motion and physical contact. We present iGibson 2.0,\nan open-source simulation environment that supports the simulation of a more\ndiverse set of household tasks through three key innovations. First, iGibson\n2.0 supports object states, including temperature, wetness level, cleanliness\nlevel, and toggled and sliced states, necessary to cover a wider range of\ntasks. Second, iGibson 2.0 implements a set of predicate logic functions that\nmap the simulator states to logic states like Cooked or Soaked. Additionally,\ngiven a logic state, iGibson 2.0 can sample valid physical states that satisfy\nit. This functionality can generate potentially infinite instances of tasks\nwith minimal effort from the users. The sampling mechanism allows our scenes to\nbe more densely populated with small objects in semantically meaningful\nlocations. Third, iGibson 2.0 includes a virtual reality (VR) interface to\nimmerse humans in its scenes to collect demonstrations. As a result, we can\ncollect demonstrations from humans on these new types of tasks, and use them\nfor imitation learning. We evaluate the new capabilities of iGibson 2.0 to\nenable robot learning of novel tasks, in the hope of demonstrating the\npotential of this new simulator to support new research in embodied AI. iGibson\n2.0 and its new dataset will be publicly available at\nthis http URL",

However, acquiring and\nmanually labeling a large medical image set is resource-intensive, expensive,\nand sometimes impractical due to data sharing and privacy issues. To address\nthis challenge, we propose an adversarial data augmentation approach to improve\nthe efficiency in utilizing training data and to enlarge the dataset via\nsimulated but realistic transformations. Specifically, we present a generic\ntask-driven learning framework, which jointly optimizes a data augmentation\nmodel and a segmentation network during training, generating informative\nexamples to enhance network generalizability for the downstream task. The data\naugmentation model utilizes a set of photometric and geometric image\ntransformations and chains them to simulate realistic complex imaging\nvariations that could exist in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The proposed\nadversarial data augmentation does not rely on generative networks and can be\nused as a plug-in module in general segmentation networks. It is\ncomputationally efficient and applicable for both supervised and\nsemi-supervised learning. We analyze and evaluate the method on two MR image\nsegmentation tasks: cardiac segmentation and prostate segmentation. Results\nshow that the proposed approach can alleviate the need for labeled data while\nimproving model generalization ability, indicating its practical value in\nmedical imaging applications.",

          "description": "The development of high quality medical image segmentation algorithms depends\non the availability of large datasets with pixel-level labels. The challenges\nof collecting such datasets, especially in case of 3D volumes, motivate to\ndevelop approaches that can learn from other types of labels that are cheap to\nobtain, e.g. bounding boxes. We focus on 3D medical images with their\ncorresponding 3D bounding boxes which are considered as series of per-slice\nnon-tight 2D bounding boxes. While current weakly-supervised approaches that\nuse 2D bounding boxes as weak labels can be applied to medical image\nsegmentation, we show that their success is limited in cases when the\nassumption about the tightness of the bounding boxes breaks. We propose a new\nbounding box correction framework which is trained on a small set of\npixel-level annotations to improve the tightness of a larger set of non-tight\nbounding box annotations. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated by\nevaluating a known weakly-supervised segmentation approach with and without the\nproposed bounding box correction algorithm.

First, fixing the number of tokens\nthrough the whole network produces redundant features at the spatial level.\nSecond, the attention maps among different transformer layers are redundant.\nBased on the observations above, we propose a PSViT: a ViT with token Pooling\nand attention Sharing to reduce the redundancy, effectively enhancing the\nfeature representation ability, and achieving a better speed-accuracy\ntrade-off. Specifically, in our PSViT, token pooling can be defined as the\noperation that decreases the number of tokens at the spatial level.

          "description": "In the last years, AI systems, in particular neural networks, have seen a\ntremendous increase in performance, and they are now used in a broad range of\napplications. Unlike classical symbolic AI systems, neural networks are trained\nusing large data sets and their inner structure containing possibly billions of\nparameters does not lend itself to human interpretation. As a consequence, it\nis so far not feasible to provide broad guarantees for the correct behaviour of\nneural networks during operation if they process input data that significantly\ndiffer from those seen during training. However, many applications of AI\nsystems are security- or safety-critical, and hence require obtaining\nstatements on the robustness of the systems when facing unexpected events,\nwhether they occur naturally or are induced by an attacker in a targeted way.\nAs a step towards developing robust AI systems for such applications, this\npaper presents how the robustness of AI systems can be practically examined and\nwhich methods and metrics can be used to do so. The robustness testing\nmethodology is described and analysed for the example use case of traffic sign\nrecognition in autonomous driving.",

          "description": "Computer-aided design (CAD) programs are essential to engineering as they\nallow for better designs through low-cost iterations. While CAD programs are\ntypically taught to undergraduate students as a job skill, such software can\nalso help students learn engineering concepts. A current limitation of CAD\nprograms (even those that are specifically designed for educational purposes)\nis that they are not capable of providing automated real-time help to students.\nTo encourage CAD programs to build in assistance to students, we used data\ngenerated from students using a free, open source CAD software called Aladdin\nto demonstrate how student data combined with machine learning techniques can\npredict how well a particular student will perform in a design task. We\nchallenged students to design a house that consumed zero net energy as part of\nan introductory engineering technology undergraduate course. Using data from\n128 students, along with the scikit-learn Python machine learning library, we\ntested our models using both total counts of design actions and sequences of\ndesign actions as inputs. We found that our models using early design sequence\nactions are particularly valuable for prediction. Our logistic regression model\nachieved a >60% chance of predicting if a student would succeed in designing a\nzero net energy house. Our results suggest that it would be feasible for\nAladdin to provide useful feedback to students when they are approximately\nhalfway through their design.

          "description": "Accumulated clinical studies show that microbes living in humans interact\nclosely with human hosts, and get involved in modulating drug efficacy and drug\ntoxicity. Microbes have become novel targets for the development of\nantibacterial agents. Therefore, screening of microbe-drug associations can\nbenefit greatly drug research and development. With the increase of microbial\ngenomic and pharmacological datasets, we are greatly motivated to develop an\neffective computational method to identify new microbe-drug associations. In\nthis paper, we proposed a novel method, Graph2MDA, to predict microbe-drug\nassociations by using variational graph autoencoder (VGAE). We constructed\nmulti-modal attributed graphs based on multiple features of microbes and drugs,\nsuch as molecular structures, microbe genetic sequences, and function\nannotations. Taking as input the multi-modal attribute graphs, VGAE was trained\nto learn the informative and interpretable latent representations of each node\nand the whole graph, and then a deep neural network classifier was used to\npredict microbe-drug associations. The hyperparameter analysis and model\nablation studies showed the sensitivity and robustness of our model. We\nevaluated our method on three independent datasets and the experimental results\nshowed that our proposed method outperformed six existing state-of-the-art\nmethods. We also explored the meaningness of the learned latent representations\nof drugs and found that the drugs show obvious clustering patterns that are\nsignificantly consistent with drug ATC classification. Moreover, we conducted\ncase studies on two microbes and two drugs and found 75\\%-95\\% predicted\nassociations have been reported in PubMed literature. Our extensive performance\nevaluations validated the effectiveness of our proposed method.\\",

          "description": "Various iterative reconstruction algorithms for inverse problems can be\nunfolded as neural networks. Empirically, this approach has often led to\nimproved results, but theoretical guarantees are still scarce. While some\nprogress on generalization properties of neural networks have been made, great\nchallenges remain. In this chapter, we discuss and combine these topics to\npresent a generalization error analysis for a class of neural networks suitable\nfor sparse reconstruction from few linear measurements. The hypothesis class\nconsidered is inspired by the classical iterative soft-thresholding algorithm\n(ISTA). The neural networks in this class are obtained by unfolding iterations\nof ISTA and learning some of the weights. Based on training samples, we aim at\nlearning the optimal network parameters via empirical risk minimization and\nthereby the optimal network that reconstructs signals from their compressive\nlinear measurements. In particular, we may learn a sparsity basis that is\nshared by all of the iterations/layers and thereby obtain a new approach for\ndictionary learning. For this class of networks, we present a generalization\nbound, which is based on bounding the Rademacher complexity of hypothesis\nclasses consisting of such deep networks via Dudley's integral. Remarkably,\nunder realistic conditions, the generalization error scales only\nlogarithmically in the number of layers, and at most linear in number of\nmeasurements.",

          "description": "Radiomics is an active area of research in medical image analysis, the low\nreproducibility of radiomics has limited its applicability to clinical\npractice. This issue is especially prominent when radiomic features are\ncalculated from noisy images, such as low dose computed tomography (CT) scans.\nIn this article, we investigate the possibility of improving the\nreproducibility of radiomic features calculated on noisy CTs by using\ngenerative models for denoising.One traditional denoising method - non-local\nmeans - and two generative models - encoder-decoder networks (EDN) and\nconditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) - were selected as the test\nmodels. We added noise to the sinograms of full dose CTs to mimic low dose CTs\nwith two different levels of noise: low-noise CT and high-noise CT. Models were\ntrained on high-noise CTs and used to denoise low-noise CTs without\nre-training. We also test the performance of our model in real data, using\ndataset of same-day repeat low dose CTs to assess the reproducibility of\nradiomic features in denoised images. The EDN and the CGAN improved the\nconcordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of radiomic features for low-noise\nimages from 0.87 to 0.92 and for high-noise images from 0.68 to 0.92\nrespectively. Moreover, the EDN and the CGAN improved the test-retest\nreliability of radiomic features (mean CCC increased from 0.89 to 0.94) based\non real low dose CTs. The results show that denoising using EDN and CGANs can\nimprove the reproducibility of radiomic features calculated on noisy CTs.\nMoreover, images with different noise levels can be denoised to improve the\nreproducibility using these models without re-training, as long as the noise\nintensity is equal or lower than that in high-noise CTs. To the authors'\nknowledge, this is the first effort to improve the reproducibility of radiomic\nfeatures calculated on low dose CT scans.",

          "description": "The goals of this research were to search for Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) architectures, suitable for an on-device processor with limited computing\nresources, performing at substantially lower Network Architecture Search (NAS)\ncosts. A new algorithm entitled an Early Exit Population Initialisation (EE-PI)\nfor Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) was developed to achieve both goals. The EE-PI\nreduces the total number of parameters in the search process by filtering the\nmodels with fewer parameters than the maximum threshold. It will look for a new\nmodel to replace those models with parameters more than the threshold. Thereby,\nreducing the number of parameters, memory usage for model storage and\nprocessing time while maintaining the same performance or accuracy. The search\ntime was reduced to 0.52 GPU day. This is a huge and significant achievement\ncompared to the NAS of 4 GPU days achieved using NSGA-Net, 3,150 GPU days by\nthe AmoebaNet model, and the 2,000 GPU days by the NASNet model. As well, Early\nExit Evolutionary Algorithm networks (EEEA-Nets) yield network architectures\nwith minimal error and computational cost suitable for a given dataset as a\nclass of network algorithms. Using EEEA-Net on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImageNet datasets, our experiments showed that EEEA-Net achieved the lowest\nerror rate among state-of-the-art NAS models, with 2.46% for CIFAR-10, 15.02%\nfor CIFAR-100, and 23.8% for ImageNet dataset.

We also establish the relationship between these two perspectives. In\nalgorithmic aspect, we get rid of the traditional top-down and bottom-up\nframeworks, and propose a new one to stratify the \\emph{sparsest} level of a\ncluster tree recursively in guide with our objective function. For practical\nuse, our resulting cluster tree is not binary.

          "description": "Future communication systems are faced with increased demand for high\ncapacity, dynamic bandwidth, reliability and heterogeneous traffic. To meet\nthese requirements, networks have become more complex and thus require new\ndesign methods and monitoring techniques, as they evolve towards becoming\nautonomous. Machine learning has come to the forefront in recent years as a\npromising technology to aid in this evolution. Optical fiber communications can\nalready provide the high capacity required for most applications, however,\nthere is a need for increased scalability and adaptability to changing user\ndemands and link conditions. Accurate performance monitoring is an integral\npart of this transformation. In this paper we review optical performance\nmonitoring techniques where machine learning algorithms have been applied.\nMoreover, since alot of OPM depends on knowledge of the signal type, we also\nreview work for modulation format recognition and bitrate identification.

          "description": "How to discriminatively vectorize graphs is a fundamental challenge that\nattracts increasing attentions in recent years. Inspired by the recent success\nof unsupervised contrastive learning, we aim to learn graph-level\nrepresentation in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we propose a novel\nunsupervised graph learning paradigm called Iterative Graph Self-Distillation\n(IGSD) which iteratively performs the teacher-student distillation with graph\naugmentations. Different from conventional knowledge distillation, IGSD\nconstructs the teacher with an exponential moving average of the student model\nand distills the knowledge of itself. The intuition behind IGSD is to predict\nthe teacher network representation of the graph pairs under different augmented\nviews. As a natural extension, we also apply IGSD to semi-supervised scenarios\nby jointly regularizing the network with both supervised and unsupervised\ncontrastive loss. Finally, we show that finetuning the IGSD-trained models with\nself-training can further improve the graph representation power. Empirically,\nwe achieve significant and consistent performance gain on various graph\ndatasets in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, which well\nvalidates the superiority of IGSD.",

In contrast to existing MLM-based speech pre-training frameworks such\nas HuBERT, which relies on an iterative re-clustering and re-training process,\nor vq-wav2vec, which concatenates two separately trained modules, w2v-BERT can\nbe optimized in an end-to-end fashion by solving the two self-supervised\ntasks~(the contrastive task and MLM) simultaneously.

This trend leads to great concerns, including but not\nlimited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the\nexclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this\npaper, we dispel the myth that transformers are \"data hungry\" and therefore can\nonly be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the\nright size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with\nstate-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets, often with better accuracy and fewer\nparameters. Our model eliminates the requirement for class token and positional\nembeddings through a novel sequence pooling strategy and the use of\nconvolution/s. It is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as little as\n0.28M parameters while achieving good results. Our model can reach 98.00%\naccuracy when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is a significant\nimprovement over previous Transformer based models. It also outperforms many\nmodern CNN based approaches, such as ResNet, and even some recent NAS-based\napproaches, such as Proxyless-NAS. Our simple and compact design democratizes\ntransformers by making them accessible to those with limited computing\nresources and/or dealing with small datasets.

          "description": "Following the great success of Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs), in many research domains in 2010s, several ML-based approaches\nwere proposed for detection in large inverse linear problems, e.g., massive\nMIMO systems. The main motivation behind is that the complexity of Maximum\nA-Posteriori (MAP) detection grows exponentially with system dimensions.\nInstead of using DNNs, essentially being a black-box, we take a slightly\ndifferent approach and introduce a probabilistic Continuous relaxation of\ndisCrete variables to MAP detection. Enabling close approximation and\ncontinuous optimization, we derive an iterative detection algorithm: Concrete\nMAP Detection (CMD). Furthermore, extending CMD by the idea of deep unfolding\ninto CMDNet, we allow for (online) optimization of a small number of parameters\nto different working points while limiting complexity. In contrast to recent\nDNN-based approaches, we select the optimization criterion and output of CMDNet\nbased on information theory and are thus able to learn approximate\nprobabilities of the individual optimal detector. This is crucial for soft\ndecoding in today's communication systems. Numerical simulation results in MIMO\nsystems reveal CMDNet to feature a promising accuracy complexity trade-off\ncompared to State of the Art. Notably, we demonstrate CMDNet's soft outputs to\nbe reliable for decoders.",

          "description": "Fine-grained population distribution data is of great importance for many\napplications, e.g., urban planning, traffic scheduling, epidemic modeling, and\nrisk control. However, due to the limitations of data collection, including\ninfrastructure density, user privacy, and business security, such fine-grained\ndata is hard to collect and usually, only coarse-grained data is available.\nThus, obtaining fine-grained population distribution from coarse-grained\ndistribution becomes an important problem. To complete this task, existing\nmethods mainly rely on sufficient fine-grained ground truth for training, which\nis not often available. This limits the applications of these methods and\nbrings the necessity to transfer knowledge from data-sufficient cities to\ndata-scarce cities.\n\nIn knowledge transfer scenario, we employ single reference fine-grained\nground truth in the target city as the ground truth to inform the large-scale\nurban structure and support the knowledge transfer in the target city. By this\napproach, we transform the fine-grained population mapping problem into a\none-shot transfer learning problem for population mapping task.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a one-shot transfer learning framework, PSRNet, to\ntransfer spatial-temporal knowledge across cities in fine-grained population\nmapping task from the view of network structure, data, and optimization.\nExperiments on real-life datasets of 4 cities demonstrate that PSRNet has\nsignificant advantages over 8 baselines by reducing RMSE and MAE for more than\n25%.

          "description": "Many machine learning systems are vulnerable to small perturbations made to\ninputs either at test time or at training time. This has received much recent\ninterest on the empirical front due to applications where reliability and\nsecurity are critical. However, theoretical understanding of algorithms that\nare robust to adversarial perturbations is limited.\n\nIn this work we focus on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a ubiquitous\nalgorithmic primitive in machine learning. We formulate a natural robust\nvariant of PCA where the goal is to find a low dimensional subspace to\nrepresent the given data with minimum projection error, that is in addition\nrobust to small perturbations measured in $\\ell_q$ norm (say $q=\\infty$).\nUnlike PCA which is solvable in polynomial time, our formulation is\ncomputationally intractable to optimize as it captures a variant of the\nwell-studied sparse PCA objective as a special case. We show the following\nresults:\n\n-Polynomial time algorithm that is constant factor competitive in the\nworst-case with respect to the best subspace, in terms of the projection error\nand the robustness criterion.\n\n-We show that our algorithmic techniques can also be made robust to\nadversarial training-time perturbations, in addition to yielding\nrepresentations that are robust to adversarial perturbations at test time.\nSpecifically, we design algorithms for a strong notion of training-time\nperturbations, where every point is adversarially perturbed up to a specified\namount.\n\n-We illustrate the broad applicability of our algorithmic techniques in\naddressing robustness to adversarial perturbations, both at training time and\ntest time. In particular, our adversarially robust PCA primitive leads to\ncomputationally efficient and robust algorithms for both unsupervised and\nsupervised learning problems such as clustering and learning adversarially\nrobust classifiers.",

An important problem in the theory of\ndeep neural networks is expressivity; that is, we want to understand the\nfunctions that are computable by a given network. We study real infinitely\ndifferentiable (smooth) hierarchical functions implemented by feedforward\nneural networks via composing simpler functions in two cases:\n\n1) each constituent function of the composition has fewer inputs than the\nresulting function;\n\n2) constituent functions are in the more specific yet prevalent form of a\nnon-linear univariate function (e.g. tanh) applied to a linear multivariate\nfunction.\n\nWe establish that in each of these regimes there exist non-trivial algebraic\npartial differential equations (PDEs), which are satisfied by the computed\nfunctions. These PDEs are purely in terms of the partial derivatives and are\ndependent only on the topology of the network. For compositions of polynomial\nfunctions, the algebraic PDEs yield non-trivial equations (of degrees dependent\nonly on the architecture) in the ambient polynomial space that are satisfied on\nthe associated functional varieties. Conversely, we conjecture that such PDE\nconstraints, once accompanied by appropriate non-singularity conditions and\nperhaps certain inequalities involving partial derivatives, guarantee that the\nsmooth function under consideration can be represented by the network. The\nconjecture is verified in numerous examples including the case of tree\narchitectures which are of neuroscientific interest.

In\ncontrast, under high levels of label noise, the label complexity bounds\nachieved by computationally efficient algorithms are much worse: the best known\nresult of [Awasthi et al., 2016] provides a computationally efficient algorithm\nwith label complexity $\\tilde{O}\\big((\\frac{s \\ln\nd}{\\epsilon})^{2^{\\mathrm{poly}(1/(1-2\\eta))}} \\big)$, which is label-efficient\nonly when the noise rate $\\eta$ is a fixed constant. In this work, we\nsubstantially improve on it by designing a polynomial time algorithm for active\nlearning of $s$-sparse halfspaces, with a label complexity of\n$\\tilde{O}\\big(\\frac{s}{(1-2\\eta)^4} \\mathrm{polylog} (d, \\frac 1 \\epsilon)\n\\big)$. This is the first efficient algorithm with label complexity polynomial\nin $\\frac{1}{1-2\\eta}$ in this setting, which is label-efficient even for\n$\\eta$ arbitrarily close to $\\frac12$. Our active learning algorithm and its\ntheoretical guarantees also immediately translate to new state-of-the-art label\nand sample complexity results for full-dimensional active and passive halfspace\nlearning under arbitrary bounded noise. The key insight of our algorithm and\nanalysis is a new interpretation of online learning regret inequalities, which\nmay be of independent interest.",

          "description": "Over the past decade, the advent of cybercrime has accelarated the research\non cybersecurity. However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls\nshort. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation\ndatasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them.\nThis is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to\nclassify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can\nlearn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large\nsets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially\nselected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of\ninterest. These approaches choose speci?fic unlabeled instances by a query\nfunction that are expected to improve overall classi?cation performance. The\nresulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the\nlabeled set.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it\ndetermines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it\nis to enhance classi?cation. These properties are the uncertainty score and\nanomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the\nmodel to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly\nselected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query\nstrategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL\nmethods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions.\nWe show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently\nobtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only\nanomalies or a ?fixed combination of the two.",

          "description": "Tree-based algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosted trees\ncontinue to be among the most popular and powerful machine learning models used\nacross multiple disciplines. The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact\nof a feature in tree based models is to measure the \\textit{node-wise reduction\nof a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii)\nis known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)\nprovide \\textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following\nthe decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model\nto each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a\npotential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.\nThe by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)\nvalues appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more\nexpensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations\ncomputed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification\nproblems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current\nresearchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and\ncorrelations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to\nvery similar rankings and interpretations. Analogous conclusions hold for the\nfidelity of using global feature importance scores as a proxy for the\npredictive power associated with each feature.",

          "description": "Intelligent recommendation and reminder systems are the need of the\nfast-pacing life. Current intelligent systems such as Siri, Google Assistant,\nMicrosoft Cortona, etc., have limited capability. For example, if you want to\nwake up at 6 am because you have an upcoming trip, you have to set the alarm\nmanually. Besides, these systems do not recommend or remind what else to carry,\nsuch as carrying an umbrella during a likely rain. The present work proposes a\nsystem that takes an email as input and returns a recommendation-cumreminder\nlist. As a first step, we parse the emails, recognize the entities using named\nentity recognition (NER). In the second step, information retrieval over the\nweb is done to identify nearby places, climatic conditions, etc. Imperative\nsentences from the reviews of all places are extracted and passed to the object\nextraction module. The main challenge lies in extracting the objects (items) of\ninterest from the review. To solve it, a modified Machine Reading\nComprehension-NER (MRC-NER) model is trained to tag objects of interest by\nformulating annotation rules as a query. The objects so found are recommended\nto the user one day in advance. The final reminder list of objects is pruned by\nour proposed model for tracking objects kept during the \"packing activity.\"\nEventually, when the user leaves for the event/trip, an alert is sent\ncontaining the reminding list items. Our approach achieves superior performance\ncompared to several baselines by as much as 30% on recall and 10% on precision.",

          "description": "Real world traffic sign recognition is an important step towards building\nautonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to\nadversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and\ngenerate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based\nattack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of\nthese algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)\niteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast\nmoving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally\nwithout considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,\nthis paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world\nroad sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)\nwe leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip\nthose zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural\nperturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a\nsingle perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance\nof the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function\nthat can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real\nworld data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the\nattack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a\nquarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also\nprovides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.\nWe provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility:\nhttps://github.com/AdvAttack/RoadSignAttack.",

          "description": "Robots in our daily surroundings are increasing day by day. Their usability\nand acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction\ncapability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the\nmost sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no\nspecific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it\nlargely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we\ninvestigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of\npeople is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as\nhuman beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we\ndo position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group\nactivity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality,\nfirst, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine\na position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation\ncan be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very\ndiverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we\nprovide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and\ngroup detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also\nput forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible\nconcerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on\nmethods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation\napproaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and\nlimitations in current literature along with possible future research\ndirections based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing\nmethods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and\nprovide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.",

          "description": "Pathology is practiced by visual inspection of histochemically stained\nslides. Most commonly, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is used in the\ndiagnostic workflow and it is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis. However,\nin many cases, especially for non-neoplastic diseases, additional \"special\nstains\" are used to provide different levels of contrast and color to tissue\ncomponents and allow pathologists to get a clearer diagnostic picture. In this\nstudy, we demonstrate the utility of supervised learning-based computational\nstain transformation from H&E to different special stains (Masson's Trichrome,\nperiodic acid-Schiff and Jones silver stain) using tissue sections from kidney\nneedle core biopsies. Based on evaluation by three renal pathologists, followed\nby adjudication by a fourth renal pathologist, we show that the generation of\nvirtual special stains from existing H&E images improves the diagnosis in\nseveral non-neoplastic kidney diseases sampled from 58 unique subjects. A\nsecond study performed by three pathologists found that the quality of the\nspecial stains generated by the stain transformation network was statistically\nequivalent to those generated through standard histochemical staining. As the\ntransformation of H&E images into special stains can be achieved within 1 min\nor less per patient core specimen slide, this stain-to-stain transformation\nframework can improve the quality of the preliminary diagnosis when additional\nspecial stains are needed, along with significant savings in time and cost,\nreducing the burden on healthcare system and patients.",

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables a learning machine to adapt from\na labeled source domain to an unlabeled domain under the distribution shift.\nThanks to the strong representation ability of deep neural networks, recent\nremarkable achievements in UDA resort to learning domain-invariant features.\nIntuitively, the hope is that a good feature representation, together with the\nhypothesis learned from the source domain, can generalize well to the target\ndomain. However, the learning processes of domain-invariant features and source\nhypothesis inevitably involve domain-specific information that would degrade\nthe generalizability of UDA models on the target domain. In this paper,\nmotivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis that only partial parameters are\nessential for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are\nessential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in\nUDA. Such parameters are termed transferable parameters. In contrast, the other\nparameters tend to fit domain-specific details and often fail to generalize,\nwhich we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose\nTransferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect brought by\ndomain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the\nmemorization of domain-invariant information. Specifically, according to the\ndistribution discrepancy degree, we divide all parameters into transferable and\nuntransferable ones in each training iteration. We then perform separate\nupdates rules for the two types of parameters. Extensive experiments on image\nclassification and regression tasks (keypoint detection) show that TransPar\noutperforms prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments\ndemonstrate that TransPar can be integrated into the most popular deep UDA\nnetworks and be easily extended to handle any data distribution shift\nscenarios.",

Many state-of-the-art solutions are based on image\nclassification frameworks and, as such, a 2D representation of the audio signal\nis considered for training these networks. Finding the most suitable audio\nrepresentation is still a research area of interest. In this paper, different\nlog-Mel representations and combinations are analyzed. Experiments show that\nthe best results are obtained using the harmonic and percussive components plus\nthe difference between left and right stereo channels, (L-R). On the other\nhand, it is a common strategy to ensemble different models in order to increase\nthe final accuracy. Even though averaging different model predictions is a\ncommon choice, an exhaustive analysis of different ensemble techniques has not\nbeen presented in ASC problems. In this paper, geometric and arithmetic mean\nplus the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator are studied as aggregation\noperators for the output of the different models of the ensemble. Finally, the\nwork carried out in this paper is highly oriented towards real-time\nimplementations.

          "description": "Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that\nrequires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing\nlearning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated\nmedical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust\nmedical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised\napproaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,\nand also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic\ninformation, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we\npresent SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly\nadvances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe\nan unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and\npredicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive\nobjective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach\nworks surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully\nsupervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can\nbe viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust\nto representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation\nby distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular\ndatasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT\ndataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of\nlabeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of\n90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to\nprevious best results.

          "description": "A key challenge in scaling Gaussian Process (GP) regression to massive\ndatasets is that exact inference requires computation with a dense n x n kernel\nmatrix, where n is the number of data points. Significant work focuses on\napproximating the kernel matrix via interpolation using a smaller set of m\ninducing points. Structured kernel interpolation (SKI) is among the most\nscalable methods: by placing inducing points on a dense grid and using\nstructured matrix algebra, SKI achieves per-iteration time of O(n + m log m)\nfor approximate inference. This linear scaling in n enables inference for very\nlarge data sets; however the cost is per-iteration, which remains a limitation\nfor extremely large n. We show that the SKI per-iteration time can be reduced\nto O(m log m) after a single O(n) time precomputation step by reframing SKI as\nsolving a natural Bayesian linear regression problem with a fixed set of m\ncompact basis functions.

Network embedding\nalgorithms have been proposed in multiple disciplines, often with\ndomain-specific notations and details. In addition, different measures and\ntools have been adopted to evaluate and compare the methods proposed under\ndifferent settings, often dependent of the downstream tasks. As a result, it is\nchallenging to study these algorithms in the literature systematically.\nMotivated by the recently proposed Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework, we\npropose a framework for network embedding algorithms and discuss how the\nprinciples of predictability, computability and stability apply in this\ncontext.

Although multiple\nworks have been proposed to improve their robustness against such structural\nadversarial attacks, the reasons for the success of the attacks remain unclear.\nIn this work, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that structural\nadversarial examples can be attributed to the non-robust aggregation scheme\n(i.e., the weighted mean) of GCNs. Specifically, our analysis takes advantage\nof the breakdown point which can quantitatively measure the robustness of\naggregation schemes. The key insight is that weighted mean, as the basic design\nof GCNs, has a low breakdown point and its output can be dramatically changed\nby injecting a single edge. We show that adopting the aggregation scheme with a\nhigh breakdown point (e.g., median or trimmed mean) could significantly enhance\nthe robustness of GCNs against structural attacks. Extensive experiments on\nfour real-world datasets demonstrate that such a simple but effective method\nachieves the best robustness performance compared to state-of-the-art models.",

Despite their\nrecent success, mostly with natural images, such methods can face important\nchallenges when the foreground and background regions have similar visual cues,\nyielding high false-positive rates in segmentations, as is the case in\nchallenging histology images. WSL training is commonly driven by standard\nclassification losses, which implicitly maximize model confidence, and locate\nthe discriminative regions linked to classification decisions. Therefore, they\nlack mechanisms for modeling explicitly non-discriminative regions and reducing\nfalse-positive rates. We propose novel regularization terms, which enable the\nmodel to seek both non-discriminative and discriminative regions, while\ndiscouraging unbalanced segmentations. We introduce high uncertainty as a\ncriterion to localize non-discriminative regions that do not affect classifier\ndecision, and describe it with original Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence losses\nevaluating the deviation of posterior predictions from the uniform\ndistribution. Our KL terms encourage high uncertainty of the model when the\nlatter inputs the latent non-discriminative regions. Our loss integrates: (i) a\ncross-entropy seeking a foreground, where model confidence about class\nprediction is high; (ii) a KL regularizer seeking a background, where model\nuncertainty is high; and (iii) log-barrier terms discouraging unbalanced\nsegmentations. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies over the public\nGlaS colon cancer data and a Camelyon16 patch-based benchmark for breast cancer\nshow substantial improvements over state-of-the-art WSL methods, and confirm\nthe effect of our new regularizers.",

A very popular notion in subgraph analysis\nis core decomposition. Recently, Esfahani et al. presented a probabilistic core\ndecomposition algorithm based on graph peeling and Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\nthat is capable of handling very large graphs. Their proposed peeling algorithm\n(PA) starts from the lowest degree vertices and recursively deletes these\nvertices, assigning core numbers, and updating the degree of neighbour vertices\nuntil it reached the maximum core. However, in many applications, particularly\nin biology, more valuable information can be obtained from dense\nsub-communities and we are not interested in small cores where vertices do not\ninteract much with others. To make the previous PA focus more on dense\nsubgraphs, we propose a multi-stage graph peeling algorithm (M-PA) that has a\ntwo-stage data screening procedure added before the previous PA. After removing\nvertices from the graph based on the user-defined thresholds, we can reduce the\ngraph complexity largely and without affecting the vertices in subgraphs that\nwe are interested in. We show that M-PA is more efficient than the previous PA\nand with the properly set filtering threshold, can produce very similar if not\nidentical dense subgraphs to the previous PA (in terms of graph density and\nclustering coefficient).",

Second, we show that training this model first on out-of-domain data,\nsuch as the CNN-Dailymail dataset, followed by a fine-tuning stage on the AMI\nmeeting dataset is able to improve the performance of the model significantly.\nWe test our model on a testing set from the AMI dataset and report the ROUGE-2\nscore of the generated summary to compare with previous literature. We also\nreport the Factual score of our summaries since it is a better benchmark for\nabstractive summaries since the ROUGE-2 score is limited to measuring\nword-overlaps. We show that our improved model is able to improve on previous\nmodels by at least 5 ROUGE-2 scores, which is a substantial improvement. Also,\na qualitative analysis of the summaries generated by our model shows that these\nsummaries and human-readable and indeed capture most of the important\ninformation from the transcripts.",

          "description": "The delayed feedback problem is one of the imperative challenges in online\nadvertising, which is caused by the highly diversified feedback delay of a\nconversion varying from a few minutes to several days. It is hard to design an\nappropriate online learning system under these non-identical delay for\ndifferent types of ads and users. In this paper, we propose to tackle the\ndelayed feedback problem in online advertising by \"Following the Prophet\" (FTP\nfor short). The key insight is that, if the feedback came instantly for all the\nlogged samples, we could get a model without delayed feedback, namely the\n\"prophet\". Although the prophet cannot be obtained during online learning, we\nshow that we could predict the prophet's predictions by an aggregation policy\non top of a set of multi-task predictions, where each task captures the\nfeedback patterns of different periods. We propose the objective and\noptimization approach for the policy, and use the logged data to imitate the\nprophet.

          "description": "Ocean current, fluid mechanics, and many other spatio-temporal physical\ndynamical systems are essential components of the universe. One key\ncharacteristic of such systems is that certain physics laws -- represented as\nordinary/partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs) -- largely dominate the\nwhole process, irrespective of time or location. Physics-informed learning has\nrecently emerged to learn physics for accurate prediction, but they often lack\na mechanism to leverage localized spatial and temporal correlation or rely on\nhard-coded physics parameters. In this paper, we advocate a physics-coupled\nneural network model to learn parameters governing the physics of the system,\nand further couple the learned physics to assist the learning of recurring\ndynamics. A spatio-temporal physics-coupled neural network (ST-PCNN) model is\nproposed to achieve three goals: (1) learning the underlying physics\nparameters, (2) transition of local information between spatio-temporal\nregions, and (3) forecasting future values for the dynamical system. The\nphysics-coupled learning ensures that the proposed model can be tremendously\nimproved by using learned physics parameters, and can achieve good long-range\nforecasting (e.g., more than 30-steps). Experiments, using simulated and\nfield-collected ocean current data, validate that ST-PCNN outperforms existing\nphysics-informed models.",

While remaining as\none of the most popular optimization methods, its capability is hindered by the\nsize of data, the dimensionality of the considered problem, and the nature of\nsequential optimization. These scalability issues are intertwined with each\nother and must be tackled simultaneously. In this work, we propose the\nScalable$^3$-BO framework, which employs sparse GP as the underlying surrogate\nmodel to scope with Big Data and is equipped with a random embedding to\nefficiently optimize high-dimensional problems with low effective\ndimensionality. The Scalable$^3$-BO framework is further leveraged with\nasynchronous parallelization feature, which fully exploits the computational\nresource on HPC within a computational budget. As a result, the proposed\nScalable$^3$-BO framework is scalable in three independent perspectives: with\nrespect to data size, dimensionality, and computational resource on HPC. The\ngoal of this work is to push the frontiers of BO beyond its well-known\nscalability issues and minimize the wall-clock waiting time for optimizing\nhigh-dimensional computationally expensive applications.

          "description": "Recent works have demonstrated great success in training high-capacity\nautoregressive language models (GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3) on a huge amount of\nunlabeled text corpus for text generation. Despite showing great results, this\ngenerates two training efficiency challenges. First, training large corpora can\nbe extremely timing consuming, and how to present training samples to the model\nto improve the token-wise convergence speed remains a challenging and open\nquestion. Second, many of these large models have to be trained with hundreds\nor even thousands of processors using data-parallelism with a very large batch\nsize. Despite of its better compute efficiency, it has been observed that\nlarge-batch training often runs into training instability issue or converges to\nsolutions with bad generalization performance. To overcome these two\nchallenges, we present a study of a curriculum learning based approach, which\nhelps improves the pre-training convergence speed of autoregressive models.\nMore importantly, we find that curriculum learning, as a regularization method,\nexerts a gradient variance reduction effect and enables to train autoregressive\nmodels with much larger batch sizes and learning rates without training\ninstability, further improving the training speed. Our evaluations demonstrate\nthat curriculum learning enables training GPT-2 models (with up to 1.5B\nparameters) with 8x larger batch size and 4x larger learning rate, whereas the\nbaseline approach struggles with training divergence. To achieve the same\nvalidation perplexity targets during pre-training, curriculum learning reduces\nthe required number of tokens and wall clock time by up to 59% and 54%,\nrespectively. To achieve the same or better zero-shot WikiText-103/LAMBADA\nevaluation results at the end of pre-training, curriculum learning reduces the\nrequired number of tokens and wall clock time by up to 13% and 61%,\nrespectively.",

In this work, we extend them based\non neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), because the linear GCN\nconcept can be interpreted as a differential equation, and present the method\nof Learnable-Time ODE-based Collaborative Filtering (LT-OCF). The main novelty\nin our method is that after redesigning linear GCNs on top of the NODE regime,\ni) we learn the optimal architecture rather than relying on manually designed\nones, ii) we learn smooth ODE solutions that are considered suitable for CF,\nand iii) we test with various ODE solvers that internally build a diverse set\nof neural network connections.

          "description": "This paper aims at addressing the problem of substantial performance\ndegradation at extremely low computational cost (e.g. 5M FLOPs on ImageNet\nclassification). We found that two factors, sparse connectivity and dynamic\nactivation function, are effective to improve the accuracy. The former avoids\nthe significant reduction of network width, while the latter mitigates the\ndetriment of reduction in network depth. Technically, we propose\nmicro-factorized convolution, which factorizes a convolution matrix into low\nrank matrices, to integrate sparse connectivity into convolution. We also\npresent a new dynamic activation function, named Dynamic Shift Max, to improve\nthe non-linearity via maxing out multiple dynamic fusions between an input\nfeature map and its circular channel shift. Building upon these two new\noperators, we arrive at a family of networks, named MicroNet, that achieves\nsignificant performance gains over the state of the art in the low FLOP regime.\nFor instance, under the constraint of 12M FLOPs, MicroNet achieves 59.4\\% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet classification, outperforming MobileNetV3 by 9.6\\%.

          "description": "Multiplex networks have become increasingly more prevalent in many fields,\nand have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling the complexity of real\nnetworks. There is a critical need for developing inference models for\nmultiplex networks that can take into account potential dependencies across\ndifferent layers, particularly when the aim is community detection. We add to a\nlimited literature by proposing a novel and efficient Bayesian model for\ncommunity detection in multiplex networks. A key feature of our approach is the\nability to model varying communities at different network layers. In contrast,\nmany existing models assume the same communities for all layers. Moreover, our\nmodel automatically picks up the necessary number of communities at each layer\n(as validated by real data examples). This is appealing, since deciding the\nnumber of communities is a challenging aspect of community detection, and\nespecially so in the multiplex setting, if one allows the communities to change\nacross layers. Borrowing ideas from hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we use a\nhierarchical Dirichlet prior to model community labels across layers, allowing\ndependency in their structure. Given the community labels, a stochastic block\nmodel (SBM) is assumed for each layer. We develop an efficient slice sampler\nfor sampling the posterior distribution of the community labels as well as the\nlink probabilities between communities. In doing so, we address some unique\nchallenges posed by coupling the complex likelihood of SBM with the\nhierarchical nature of the prior on the labels. An extensive empirical\nvalidation is performed on simulated and real data, demonstrating the superior\nperformance of the model over single-layer alternatives, as well as the ability\nto uncover interesting structures in real networks.",

In this paper, we first empirically establish the perhaps expected,\nbut unreported result, that combining pretrained features with simple anomaly\ndetection and segmentation methods convincingly outperforms, much more complex,\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n\nIn order to obtain further performance gains in anomaly detection, we adapt\npretrained features to the target distribution. Although transfer learning\nmethods are well established in multi-class classification problems, the\none-class classification (OCC) setting is not as well explored. It turns out\nthat naive adaptation methods, which typically work well in supervised\nlearning, often result in catastrophic collapse (feature deterioration) and\nreduce performance in OCC settings. A popular OCC method, DeepSVDD, advocates\nusing specialized architectures, but this limits the adaptation performance\ngain.

Our core contributions include a novel\nrepresentation for distributions over rigid body transformations and\narticulation model parameters based on screw theory, von Mises-Fisher\ndistributions, and Stiefel manifolds. Combining these concepts allows for an\nefficient, mathematically sound representation that implicitly satisfies the\nconstraints that rigid body transformations and articulations must adhere to.\nLeveraging this representation, we introduce a novel deep learning based\napproach, DUST-net, that performs category-independent articulation model\nestimation while also providing model uncertainties.

          "description": "Federated Learning (FL) solves many of this decade's concerns regarding data\nprivacy and computation challenges. FL ensures no data leaves its source as the\nmodel is trained at where the data resides. However, FL comes with its own set\nof challenges. The communication of model weight updates in this distributed\nenvironment comes with significant network bandwidth costs. In this context, we\npropose a mechanism of compressing the weight updates using Autoencoders (AE),\nwhich learn the data features of the weight updates and subsequently perform\ncompression. The encoder is set up on each of the nodes where the training is\nperformed while the decoder is set up on the node where the weights are\naggregated. This setup achieves compression through the encoder and recreates\nthe weights at the end of every communication round using the decoder. This\npaper shows that the dynamic and orthogonal AE based weight compression\ntechnique could serve as an advantageous alternative (or an add-on) in a large\nscale FL, as it not only achieves compression ratios ranging from 500x to 1720x\nand beyond, but can also be modified based on the accuracy requirements,\ncomputational capacity, and other requirements of the given FL setup.",

Although exploration is indispensable for long success of a\nrecommender system, the exploration has been considered as the risk to decrease\nuser satisfaction. The reason for the risk is that items chosen for exploration\nfrequently mismatch with the user's interests. To mitigate this risk,\nrecommender systems have mixed items chosen for exploration into a\nrecommendation list, disguising the items as recommendations to elicit feedback\non the items to discover the user's additional tastes. This mix-in approach has\nbeen widely used in many recommenders, but there is rare research, evaluating\nthe effectiveness of the mix-in approach or proposing a new approach for\neliciting user feedback without deceiving users. In this work, we aim to\npropose a new approach for feedback elicitation without any deception and\ncompare our approach to the conventional mix-in approach for evaluation. To\nthis end, we designed a recommender interface that reveals which items are for\nexploration and conducted a within-subject study with 94 MTurk workers. Our\nresults indicated that users left significantly more feedback on items chosen\nfor exploration with our interface. Besides, users evaluated that our new\ninterface is better than the conventional mix-in interface in terms of novelty,\ndiversity, transparency, trust, and satisfaction. Finally, path analysis show\nthat, in only our new interface, exploration caused to increase user-centric\nevaluation metrics. Our work paves the way for how to design an interface,\nwhich utilizes learning algorithm based on users' feedback signals, giving\nbetter user experience and gathering more feedback data.",

          "description": "Motion sensors embedded in wearable and mobile devices allow for dynamic\nselection of sensor streams and sampling rates, enabling several applications,\nsuch as power management and data-sharing control. While deep neural networks\n(DNNs) achieve competitive accuracy in sensor data classification, DNNs\ngenerally process incoming data from a fixed set of sensors with a fixed\nsampling rate, and changes in the dimensions of their inputs cause considerable\naccuracy loss, unnecessary computations, or failure in operation. We introduce\na dimension-adaptive pooling (DAP) layer that makes DNNs flexible and more\nrobust to changes in sensor availability and in sampling rate. DAP operates on\nconvolutional filter maps of variable dimensions and produces an input of fixed\ndimensions suitable for feedforward and recurrent layers. We also propose a\ndimension-adaptive training (DAT) procedure for enabling DNNs that use DAP to\nbetter generalize over the set of feasible data dimensions at inference time.\nDAT comprises the random selection of dimensions during the forward passes and\noptimization with accumulated gradients of several backward passes. Combining\nDAP and DAT, we show how to transform non-adaptive DNNs into a\nDimension-Adaptive Neural Architecture (DANA), while keeping the same number of\nparameters. Compared to existing approaches, our solution provides better\nclassification accuracy over the range of possible data dimensions at inference\ntime and does not require up-sampling or imputation, thus reducing unnecessary\ncomputations. Experiments on seven datasets (four benchmark real-world datasets\nfor human activity recognition and three synthetic datasets) show that DANA\nprevents significant losses in classification accuracy of the state-of-the-art\nDNNs and, compared to baselines, it better captures correlated patterns in\nsensor data under dynamic sensor availability and varying sampling rates.",

It exploits acoustic transceivers such\nas microphones and speakers beyond their primary functions, namely recording\nand playing, to enable novel applications and new user experiences. In this\npaper, we present the first systematic survey of recent advances in active\nacoustic sensing using commodity hardware with a frequency range below\n24~\\!kHz. We propose a general framework that categorizes main building blocks\nof acoustic sensing systems. This framework encompasses three layers, i.e.,\nphysical layer, core technique layer, and application layer. The physical layer\nincludes basic hardware components, acoustic platforms as well as the air-borne\nand structure-borne channel characteristics. The core technique layer\nencompasses key mechanisms to generate acoustic signals (waveforms) and to\nextract useful temporal, spatial and spectral information from received\nsignals. The application layer builds upon the functions offered by the core\ntechniques to realize different acoustic sensing applications. We highlight\nunique challenges due to the limitations of physical devices and acoustic\nchannels and how they are mitigated or overcame by core processing techniques\nand application-specific solutions. Finally, research opportunities and future\ndirections are discussed to spawn further in-depth investigation on acoustic\nsensing.",

          "description": "Recent advances in multi-fingered robotic grasping have enabled fast\n6-Degrees-Of-Freedom (DOF) single object grasping. Multi-finger grasping in\ncluttered scenes, on the other hand, remains mostly unexplored due to the added\ndifficulty of reasoning over obstacles which greatly increases the\ncomputational time to generate high-quality collision-free grasps. In this work\nwe address such limitations by introducing DDGC, a fast generative multi-finger\ngrasp sampling method that can generate high quality grasps in cluttered scenes\nfrom a single RGB-D image. DDGC is built as a network that encodes scene\ninformation to produce coarse-to-fine collision-free grasp poses and\nconfigurations. We experimentally benchmark DDGC against the\nsimulated-annealing planner in GraspIt! on 1200 simulated cluttered scenes and\n7 real world scenes. The results show that DDGC outperforms the baseline on\nsynthesizing high-quality grasps and removing clutter while being 5 times\nfaster. This, in turn, opens up the door for using multi-finger grasps in\npractical applications which has so far been limited due to the excessive\ncomputation time needed by other methods.",

          "description": "The physical and clinical constraints surrounding diffusion-weighted imaging\n(DWI) often limit the spatial resolution of the produced images to voxels up to\n8 times larger than those of T1w images. Thus, the detailed information\ncontained in T1w imagescould help in the synthesis of diffusion images in\nhigher resolution. However, the non-Euclidean nature of diffusion imaging\nhinders current deep generative models from synthesizing physically plausible\nimages. In this work, we propose the first Riemannian network architecture for\nthe direct generation of diffusion tensors (DT) and diffusion orientation\ndistribution functions (dODFs) from high-resolution T1w images. Our integration\nof the Log-Euclidean Metric into a learning objective guarantees, unlike\nstandard Euclidean networks, the mathematically-valid synthesis of diffusion.\nFurthermore, our approach improves the fractional anisotropy mean squared error\n(FA MSE) between the synthesized diffusion and the ground-truth by more than\n23% and the cosine similarity between principal directions by almost 5% when\ncompared to our baselines. We validate our generated diffusion by comparing the\nresulting tractograms to our expected real data. We observe similar fiber\nbundles with streamlines having less than 3% difference in length, less than 1%\ndifference in volume, and a visually close shape. While our method is able to\ngenerate high-resolution diffusion images from structural inputs in less than\n15 seconds, we acknowledge and discuss the limits of diffusion inference solely\nrelying on T1w images. Our results nonetheless suggest a relationship between\nthe high-level geometry of the brain and the overall white matter architecture.",

In this regime, the parameters of the model vary only\nslightly during the learning process, a feature that has recently been observed\nin the training of neural networks, where the scaling we study arises\nnaturally, implicit in the initialization of their parameters. Both in the\nunder- and over-parametrized frameworks, we prove exponential convergence to\nlocal, respectively global minimizers of the above algorithm in the lazy\ntraining regime. We then compare this scaling of the parameters to the\nmean-field regime, where the approximately linear behavior of the model is\nlost.

We show that LDP requires a very large privacy budget and that\nRAPPOR does not work in this application.

          "description": "Volumetric deep learning approach towards stereo matching aggregates a cost\nvolume computed from input left and right images using 3D convolutions. Recent\nworks showed that utilization of extracted image features and a spatially\nvarying cost volume aggregation complements 3D convolutions. However, existing\nmethods with spatially varying operations are complex, cost considerable\ncomputation time, and cause memory consumption to increase. In this work, we\nconstruct Guided Cost volume Excitation (GCE) and show that simple channel\nexcitation of cost volume guided by image can improve performance considerably.\nMoreover, we propose a novel method of using top-k selection prior to\nsoft-argmin disparity regression for computing the final disparity estimate.\nCombining our novel contributions, we present an end-to-end network that we\ncall Correlate-and-Excite (CoEx). Extensive experiments of our model on the\nSceneFlow, KITTI 2012, and KITTI 2015 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of our model and show that our model outperforms other\nspeed-based algorithms while also being competitive to other state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.

          "description": "We train embodied neural networks to plan and navigate unseen complex 3D\nenvironments, emphasising real-world deployment. Rather than requiring prior\nknowledge of the agent or environment, the planner learns to model the state\ntransitions and rewards. To avoid the potentially hazardous trial-and-error of\nreinforcement learning, we focus on differentiable planners such as Value\nIteration Networks (VIN), which are trained offline from safe expert\ndemonstrations. Although they work well in small simulations, we address two\nmajor limitations that hinder their deployment. First, we observed that current\ndifferentiable planners struggle to plan long-term in environments with a high\nbranching complexity. While they should ideally learn to assign low rewards to\nobstacles to avoid collisions, we posit that the constraints imposed on the\nnetwork are not strong enough to guarantee the network to learn sufficiently\nlarge penalties for every possible collision. We thus impose a structural\nconstraint on the value iteration, which explicitly learns to model any\nimpossible actions. Secondly, we extend the model to work with a limited\nperspective camera under translation and rotation, which is crucial for real\nrobot deployment. Many VIN-like planners assume a 360 degrees or overhead view\nwithout rotation. In contrast, our method uses a memory-efficient lattice map\nto aggregate CNN embeddings of partial observations, and models the rotational\ndynamics explicitly using a 3D state-space grid (translation and rotation). Our\nproposals significantly improve semantic navigation and exploration on several\n2D and 3D environments, succeeding in settings that are otherwise challenging\nfor this class of methods. As far as we know, we are the first to successfully\nperform differentiable planning on the difficult Active Vision Dataset,\nconsisting of real images captured from a robot.",

          "description": "In the fields of statistics and unsupervised machine learning a fundamental\nand well-studied problem is anomaly detection. Although anomalies are difficult\nto define, many algorithms have been proposed. Underlying the approaches is the\nnebulous understanding that anomalies are rare, unusual or inconsistent with\nthe majority of data. The present work gives a philosophical approach to\nclearly define anomalies and to develop an algorithm for their efficient\ndetection with minimal user intervention. Inspired by the Gestalt School of\nPsychology and the Helmholtz principle of human perception, the idea is to\nassume anomalies are observations that are unexpected to occur with respect to\ncertain groupings made by the majority of the data. Thus, under appropriate\nrandom variable modelling anomalies are directly found in a set of data under a\nuniform and independent random assumption of the distribution of constituent\nelements of the observations; anomalies correspond to those observations where\nthe expectation of occurrence of the elements in a given view is $<1$. Starting\nfrom fundamental principles of human perception an unsupervised anomaly\ndetection algorithm is developed that is simple, real-time and parameter-free.\nExperiments suggest it as the prime choice for univariate data and it shows\npromising performance on the detection of global anomalies in multivariate\ndata.",

A\nquantitative measurement of UI is absent, despite the variations of UI can be\nrecognized by prior knowledge. The communication bandwidth of feature maps\ndecreases after downscaling operations, but UI flows smoothly after training\ndue to lower Nyquist frequency.

The computation of an SROP is extended from a 1-D signal to a 2-D\nimage by the required rotation invariance in image classification tasks. SROP\nstatistics across feature maps are implemented as layer-wise useful information\nestimates. We design sanity checks to explore SROP variations when UI\nvariations are produced by variations in model input, model architecture and\ntraining stages. The variations of SROP is synchronizes with UI variations in\nvarious randomized and sufficiently trained model structures.

          "description": "A central challenge in the computational modeling of neural dynamics is the\ntrade-off between accuracy and simplicity. At the level of individual neurons,\nnonlinear dynamics are both experimentally established and essential for\nneuronal functioning. An implicit assumption has thus formed that an accurate\ncomputational model of whole-brain dynamics must also be highly nonlinear,\nwhereas linear models may provide a first-order approximation. Here, we provide\na rigorous and data-driven investigation of this hypothesis at the level of\nwhole-brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and macroscopic field potential\ndynamics by leveraging the theory of system identification. Using functional\nMRI (fMRI) and intracranial EEG (iEEG), we model the resting state activity of\n700 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 122 subjects from the\nRestoring Active Memory (RAM) project using state-of-the-art linear and\nnonlinear model families. We assess relative model fit using predictive power,\ncomputational complexity, and the extent of residual dynamics unexplained by\nthe model. Contrary to our expectations, linear auto-regressive models achieve\nthe best measures across all three metrics, eliminating the trade-off between\naccuracy and simplicity. To understand and explain this linearity, we highlight\nfour properties of macroscopic neurodynamics which can counteract or mask\nmicroscopic nonlinear dynamics: averaging over space, averaging over time,\nobservation noise, and limited data samples. Whereas the latter two are\ntechnological limitations and can improve in the future, the former two are\ninherent to aggregated macroscopic brain activity. Our results, together with\nthe unparalleled interpretability of linear models, can greatly facilitate our\nunderstanding of macroscopic neural dynamics and the principled design of\nmodel-based interventions for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

To further reach its full\npotential, we additionally infuse contextual reasoning into SNC such that the\nspeaker locally and iteratively self-communicates with a virtual agent built on\nthe physical listener's unique way of coding its semantics, i.e., communication\ncontext. The resultant System 2 SNC allows the speaker to extract the most\neffective semantics for its listener. Leveraging the proposed stochastic model,\nwe show that the reliability of System 2 SNC increases with the number of\nmeaningful concepts, and derive the expected semantic representation (SR) bit\nlength which quantifies the extracted effective semantics. It is also shown\nthat System 2 SNC significantly reduces the SR length without compromising\ncommunication reliability.",

          "description": "The flexibility of decision boundaries in neural networks that are unguided\nby training data is a well-known problem typically resolved with generalization\nmethods. A surprising result from recent knowledge distillation (KD) literature\nis that random, untrained, and equally structured teacher networks can also\nvastly improve generalization performance. It raises the possibility of\nexistence of undiscovered assumptions useful for generalization on an uncertain\nregion. In this paper, we shed light on the assumptions by analyzing decision\nboundaries and confidence distributions of both simple and KD-based\ngeneralization methods. Assuming that a decision boundary exists to represent\nthe most general tendency of distinction on an input sample space (i.e., the\nsimplest hypothesis), we show the various limitations of methods when using the\nhypothesis. To resolve these limitations, we propose matured dumb teacher based\nKD, conservatively transferring the hypothesis for generalization of the\nstudent without massive destruction of trained information. In practical\nexperiments on feed-forward and convolution neural networks for image\nclassification tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, the proposed\nmethod shows stable improvement to the best test performance in the grid search\nof hyperparameters.

          "description": "Machine learning (ML) solutions are prevalent. However, many challenges exist\nin making these solutions business-grade. One major challenge is to ensure that\nthe ML solution provides its expected business value. In order to do that, one\nhas to bridge the gap between the way ML model performance is measured and the\nsolution requirements. In previous work (Barash et al, \"Bridging the gap...\")\nwe demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing feature models in bridging this\ngap. Whereas ML performance metrics, such as the accuracy or F1-score of a\nclassifier, typically measure the average ML performance, feature models shed\nlight on explainable data slices that are too far from that average, and\ntherefore might indicate unsatisfied requirements. For example, the overall\naccuracy of a bank text terms classifier may be very high, say $98\\% \\pm 2\\%$,\nyet it might perform poorly for terms that include short descriptions and\noriginate from commercial accounts. A business requirement, which may be\nimplicit in the training data, may be to perform well regardless of the type of\naccount and length of the description. Therefore, the under-performing data\nslice that includes short descriptions and commercial accounts suggests\npoorly-met requirements. In this paper we show the feasibility of automatically\nextracting feature models that result in explainable data slices over which the\nML solution under-performs. Our novel technique, IBM FreaAI aka FreaAI,\nextracts such slices from structured ML test data or any other labeled data. We\ndemonstrate that FreaAI can automatically produce explainable and\nstatistically-significant data slices over seven open datasets.",

          "description": "One of the difficulties of conversion rate (CVR) prediction is that the\nconversions can delay and take place long after the clicks. The delayed\nfeedback poses a challenge: fresh data are beneficial to continuous training\nbut may not have complete label information at the time they are ingested into\nthe training pipeline. To balance model freshness and label certainty, previous\nmethods set a short waiting window or even do not wait for the conversion\nsignal. If conversion happens outside the waiting window, this sample will be\nduplicated and ingested into the training pipeline with a positive label.\nHowever, these methods have some issues. First, they assume the observed\nfeature distribution remains the same as the actual distribution. But this\nassumption does not hold due to the ingestion of duplicated samples. Second,\nthe certainty of the conversion action only comes from the positives. But the\npositives are scarce as conversions are sparse in commercial systems. These\nissues induce bias during the modeling of delayed feedback. In this paper, we\npropose DElayed FEedback modeling with Real negatives (DEFER) method to address\nthese issues. The proposed method ingests real negative samples into the\ntraining pipeline. The ingestion of real negatives ensures the observed feature\ndistribution is equivalent to the actual distribution, thus reducing the bias.\nThe ingestion of real negatives also brings more certainty information of the\nconversion. To correct the distribution shift, DEFER employs importance\nsampling to weigh the loss function. Experimental results on industrial\ndatasets validate the superiority of DEFER. DEFER have been deployed in the\ndisplay advertising system of Alibaba, obtaining over 6.0% improvement on CVR\nin several scenarios.

          "description": "The pre-trained model (PTM) is revolutionizing Artificial intelligence (AI)\ntechnology. It learns a model with general language features on the vast text\nand then fine-tunes the model using a task-specific dataset. Unfortunately, PTM\ntraining requires prohibitively expensive computing devices, especially\nfine-tuning, which is still a game for a small proportion of people in the AI\ncommunity. Enabling PTMs training on low-quality devices, PatrickStar now makes\nPTM accessible to everyone.\n\nPatrickStar reduces memory requirements of computing platforms by using the\nCPU-GPU heterogeneous memory space to store model data, consisting of\nparameters, gradients, and optimizer states. We observe that the GPU memory\navailable for model data changes regularly, in a tide-like pattern, decreasing\nand increasing iteratively. However, the existing heterogeneous training works\ndo not take advantage of this pattern. Instead, they statically partition the\nmodel data among CPU and GPU, leading to both memory waste and memory abuse. In\ncontrast, PatrickStar manages model data in chunks, which are dynamically\ndistributed in heterogeneous memory spaces. Chunks consist of stateful tensors\nwhich run as finite state machines during training. Guided by the runtime\nmemory statistics collected in a warm-up iteration, chunks are orchestrated\nefficiently in heterogeneous memory and generate lower CPU-GPU data\ntransmission volume. Symbiosis with the Zero Redundancy Optimizer, PatrickStar\nscales to multiple GPUs using data parallelism, with the lowest communication\nbandwidth requirements and more efficient bandwidth utilization. Experimental\nresults show PatrickStar trains a 12 billion parameters GPT model, 2x larger\nthan the STOA work, on an 8-V100 and 240GB CPU memory node, and is also more\nefficient on the same model size.",

          "description": "With the increasing popularity of deep learning on edge devices, compressing\nlarge neural networks to meet the hardware requirements of resource-constrained\ndevices became a significant research direction. Numerous compression\nmethodologies are currently being used to reduce the memory sizes and energy\nconsumption of neural networks. Knowledge distillation (KD) is among such\nmethodologies and it functions by using data samples to transfer the knowledge\ncaptured by a large model (teacher) to a smaller one(student). However, due to\nvarious reasons, the original training data might not be accessible at the\ncompression stage. Therefore, data-free model compression is an ongoing\nresearch problem that has been addressed by various works. In this paper, we\npoint out that catastrophic forgetting is a problem that can potentially be\nobserved in existing data-free distillation methods. Moreover, the sample\ngeneration strategies in some of these methods could result in a mismatch\nbetween the synthetic and real data distributions. To prevent such problems, we\npropose a data-free KD framework that maintains a dynamic collection of\ngenerated samples over time. Additionally, we add the constraint of matching\nthe real data distribution in sample generation strategies that target maximum\ninformation gain. Our experiments demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy\nof the student models obtained via KD when compared with state-of-the-art\napproaches on the SVHN, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.",

          "description": "Recently, several Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) approaches have been\ndevised to represent entities and relations in dense vector space and employed\nin downstream tasks such as link prediction. A few KGE techniques address\ninterpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations\n(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric\ninterpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in\nhigher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the\nability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,\nmodeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of\ninterpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to\nachieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional\nspace. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view\nthe relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding\nvector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in\nwhich we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE\nconsiders the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing\nexpressivity and interpretability. Our empirical results on four well-known\nbenchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance for the KG completion task.",

In this paper, we propose a new speech\nanti-spoofing model named ResWavegram-Resnet (RW-Resnet). The model contains\ntwo parts, Conv1D Resblocks and backbone Resnet34. The Conv1D Resblock is based\non the Conv1D block with a residual connection. For the first part, we use the\nraw waveform as input and feed it to the stacked Conv1D Resblocks to get the\nResWavegram. Compared with traditional methods, ResWavegram keeps all the\ninformation from the audio signal and has a stronger ability in extracting\nfeatures. For the second part, the extracted features are fed to the backbone\nResnet34 for the spoofed or bonafide decision. The ASVspoof2019 logical access\n(LA) corpus is used to evaluate our proposed RW-Resnet.

          "description": "How do the neural networks distinguish two images? It is of critical\nimportance to understand the matching mechanism of deep models for developing\nreliable intelligent systems for many risky visual applications such as\nsurveillance and access control. However, most existing deep metric learning\nmethods match the images by comparing feature vectors, which ignores the\nspatial structure of images and thus lacks interpretability. In this paper, we\npresent a deep interpretable metric learning (DIML) method for more transparent\nembedding learning. Unlike conventional metric learning methods based on\nfeature vector comparison, we propose a structural matching strategy that\nexplicitly aligns the spatial embeddings by computing an optimal matching flow\nbetween feature maps of the two images. Our method enables deep models to learn\nmetrics in a more human-friendly way, where the similarity of two images can be\ndecomposed to several part-wise similarities and their contributions to the\noverall similarity. Our method is model-agnostic, which can be applied to\noff-the-shelf backbone networks and metric learning methods. We evaluate our\nmethod on three major benchmarks of deep metric learning including CUB200-2011,\nCars196, and Stanford Online Products, and achieve substantial improvements\nover popular metric learning methods with better interpretability.

We consider the case of a popular visual discovery\nproduct, where these representations are trained with multi-task learning, from\nuse-case specific visual understanding (e.g. skin tone classification) to\ngeneral representation learning for all visual content (e.g. embeddings for\nretrieval). In this work, we describe how we (1) generate a dataset with over a\nbillion images via large weakly-supervised pretraining to improve the\nperformance of these visual representations, and (2) leverage Transformers to\nreplace the traditional convolutional backbone, with insights into both system\nand performance improvements, especially at 1B+ image scale. To support this\nbackbone model, we detail a systematic approach to deriving weakly-supervised\nimage annotations from heterogenous text signals, demonstrating the benefits of\nclustering techniques to handle the long-tail distribution of image labels.\nThrough a comprehensive study of offline and online evaluation, we show that\nlarge-scale Transformer-based pretraining provides significant benefits to\nindustry computer vision applications. The model is deployed in a production\nvisual shopping system, with 36% improvement in top-1 relevance and 23%\nimprovement in click-through volume.

However,\nthis property is achieved at a price of reduction in precision. In the case of\nconformal classification, the systems can output multiple class labels instead\nof one. It is also known from the literature, that the choice of nonconformity\nfunction has a major impact on the efficiency of conformal classifiers.\nRecently, it was shown that different model-agnostic nonconformity functions\nresult in conformal classifiers with different characteristics. For a Neural\nNetwork-based conformal classifier, the inverse probability (or hinge loss)\nallows minimizing the average number of predicted labels, and margin results in\na larger fraction of singleton predictions. In this work, we aim to further\nextend this study. We perform an experimental evaluation using 8 different\nclassification algorithms and discuss when the previously observed relationship\nholds or not.

          "description": "Spatio-temporal forecasting is of great importance in a wide range of\ndynamical systems applications from atmospheric science, to recent COVID-19\nspread modeling. These applications rely on accurate predictions of\nspatio-temporal structured data reflecting real-world phenomena. A stunning\ncharacteristic is that the dynamical system is not only driven by some physics\nlaws but also impacted by the localized factor in spatial and temporal regions.\nOne of the major challenges is to infer the underlying causes, which generate\nthe perceived data stream and propagate the involved causal dynamics through\nthe distributed observing units. Another challenge is that the success of\nmachine learning based predictive models requires massive annotated data for\nmodel training. However, the acquisition of high-quality annotated data is\nobjectively manual and tedious as it needs a considerable amount of human\nintervention, making it infeasible in fields that require high levels of\nexpertise. To tackle these challenges, we advocate a spatio-temporal\nphysics-coupled neural networks (ST-PCNN) model to learn the underlying physics\nof the dynamical system and further couple the learned physics to assist the\nlearning of the recurring dynamics. To deal with data-acquisition constraints,\nan active learning mechanism with Kriging for actively acquiring the most\ninformative data is proposed for ST-PCNN training in a partially observable\nenvironment.

          "description": "Over-parameterized deep networks trained using gradient-based optimizers are\na popular choice for solving classification and ranking problems. Without\nappropriately tuned $\\ell_2$ regularization or weight decay, such networks have\nthe tendency to make output scores (logits) and network weights large, causing\ntraining loss to become too small and the network to lose its adaptivity\n(ability to move around) in the parameter space. Although regularization is\ntypically understood from an overfitting perspective, we highlight its role in\nmaking the network more adaptive and enabling it to escape more easily from\nweights that generalize poorly. To provide such a capability, we propose a\nmethod called Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization (LAWN), that can be\nstacked onto any gradient-based optimizer. LAWN controls the logits by\nconstraining the weight norms of layers in the final homogeneous sub-network.\nEmpirically, we show that the resulting LAWN variant of the optimizer makes a\ndeep network more adaptive to finding minimas with superior generalization\nperformance on large-scale image classification and recommender systems.

For simple policy parameterizations, the FMA-PG framework ensures that\nthe optimal policy is a fixed point of the updates. It also allows us to handle\ncomplex policy parameterizations (e.g., neural networks) while guaranteeing\npolicy improvement. Our framework unifies several PG methods and opens the way\nfor designing sample-efficient variants of existing methods. Moreover, it\nrecovers important implementation heuristics (e.g., using forward vs reverse KL\ndivergence) in a principled way.

The goal\nis to produce a clustering that minimizes the weight of \"disagreements\": the\nsum of the weights of \"similar\" edges across clusters and \"dissimilar\" edges\nwithin clusters. We study the correlation clustering problem under the\nfollowing assumption: Every \"similar\" edge $e$ has weight\n$\\mathbf{w}_e\\in[\\alpha \\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{w}]$ and every \"dissimilar\" edge\n$e$ has weight $\\mathbf{w}_e\\geq \\alpha \\mathbf{w}$ (where $\\alpha\\leq 1$ and\n$\\mathbf{w}>0$ is a scaling parameter). We give a $(3 + 2 \\log_e (1/\\alpha))$\napproximation algorithm for this problem. This assumption captures well the\nscenario when classification errors are asymmetric.

Many\ndatasets are already publicly available, nevertheless forcing application\npossibilities of machine learning to the domains of those public datasets. The\never-growing penetration of machine learning algorithms in new application\nareas requires solutions for the need for data in those new domains. This\nthesis works on active learning as one possible solution to reduce the amount\nof data that needs to be processed by hand, by processing only those datapoints\nthat specifically benefit the training of a strong model for the task. A newly\nproposed framework for framing the active learning workflow as a reinforcement\nlearning problem is adapted for image classification and a series of three\nexperiments is conducted. Each experiment is evaluated and potential issues\nwith the approach are outlined. Each following experiment then proposes\nimprovements to the framework and evaluates their impact. After the last\nexperiment, a final conclusion is drawn, unfortunately rejecting this work's\nhypothesis and outlining that the proposed framework at the moment is not\ncapable of improving active learning for image classification with a trained\nreinforcement learning agent.",

          "description": "The indexing algorithms for the high-dimensional nearest neighbor search\n(NNS) with the best worst-case guarantees are based on the randomized Locality\nSensitive Hashing (LSH), and its derivatives. In practice, many heuristic\napproaches exist to \"learn\" the best indexing method in order to speed-up NNS,\ncrucially adapting to the structure of the given dataset.\n\nOftentimes, these heuristics outperform the LSH-based algorithms on real\ndatasets, but, almost always, come at the cost of losing the guarantees of\neither correctness or robust performance on adversarial queries, or apply to\ndatasets with an assumed extra structure/model. In this paper, we design an NNS\nalgorithm for the Hamming space that has worst-case guarantees essentially\nmatching that of theoretical algorithms, while optimizing the hashing to the\nstructure of the dataset (think instance-optimal algorithms) for performance on\nthe minimum-performing query. We evaluate the algorithm's ability to optimize\nfor a given dataset both theoretically and practically. On the theoretical\nside, we exhibit a natural setting (dataset model) where our algorithm is much\nbetter than the standard theoretical one. On the practical side, we run\nexperiments that show that our algorithm has a 1.8x and 2.1x better recall on\nthe worst-performing queries to the MNIST and ImageNet datasets.",

          "description": "The top search results matching a user query that are displayed on the first\npage are critical to the effectiveness and perception of a search system. A\nsearch ranking system typically orders the results by independent\nquery-document scores to produce a slate of search results. However, such\nunilateral scoring methods may fail to capture inter-document dependencies that\nusers are sensitive to, thus producing a sub-optimal slate. Further, in\npractice, many real-world applications such as e-commerce search require\nenforcing certain distributional criteria at the slate-level, due to business\nobjectives or long term user retention goals. Unilateral scoring of results\ndoes not explicitly support optimizing for such objectives with respect to a\nslate. Hence, solutions to the slate optimization problem must consider the\noptimal selection and order of the documents, along with adherence to\nslate-level distributional criteria. To that end, we propose a hybrid framework\nextended from traditional slate optimization to solve the conditional slate\noptimization problem. We introduce conditional sequential slate optimization\n(CSSO), which jointly learns to optimize for traditional ranking metrics as\nwell as prescribed distribution criteria of documents within the slate. The\nproposed method can be applied to practical real world problems such as\nenforcing diversity in e-commerce search results, mitigating bias in top\nresults and personalization of results. Experiments on public datasets and\nreal-world data from e-commerce datasets show that CSSO outperforms popular\ncomparable ranking methods in terms of adherence to distributional criteria\nwhile producing comparable or better relevance metrics.",

Outcomes published in this direction are\nfrequently claiming highly accurate detection under deep transfer learning.\nThis is leading medical technologists to believe that deep transfer learning is\nthe mainstream solution for the problem. However, our critical analysis of the\nliterature reveals an alarming performance disparity between different\npublished results.

Exploring 14 state-of-the-art visual models with over 200 model\ntraining sessions, we conclusively establish that the published literature is\nfrequently overestimating transfer learning performance for the problem, even\nin the prestigious scientific sources. The roots of overestimation trace back\nto inappropriate data curation. We also provide case studies that consider more\nrealistic scenarios, and establish transparent baselines for the problem.

The main benefit of DARTS is the effectiveness achieved through\nthe weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture\nsearch. In this work, we investigate DARTS in a systematic case study of\ninverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a\ncontrolled manner. Although we demonstrate that the success of DARTS can be\nextended from image classification to reconstruction, our experiments yield\nthree fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DARTS-based methods: First,\nthe results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final\nperformance is highly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer.

Thus, we\nconclude the necessity to 1) report the results of any DARTS-based methods from\nseveral runs along with its underlying performance statistics, 2) show the\ncorrelation of the training and final architecture performance, and 3)\ncarefully consider if the computational efficiency of DARTS outweighs the costs\nof hyperparameter optimization and multiple runs.",

          "description": "Deep learning algorithms mine knowledge from the training data and thus would\nlikely inherit the dataset's bias information. As a result, the obtained model\nwould generalize poorly and even mislead the decision process in real-life\napplications. We propose to remove the bias information misused by the target\ntask with a cross-sample adversarial debiasing (CSAD) method. CSAD explicitly\nextracts target and bias features disentangled from the latent representation\ngenerated by a feature extractor and then learns to discover and remove the\ncorrelation between the target and bias features. The correlation measurement\nplays a critical role in adversarial debiasing and is conducted by a\ncross-sample neural mutual information estimator. Moreover, we propose joint\ncontent and local structural representation learning to boost mutual\ninformation estimation for better performance. We conduct thorough experiments\non publicly available datasets to validate the advantages of the proposed\nmethod over state-of-the-art approaches.",

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) serves as a data privacy-preserved machine learning\nparadigm, and realizes the collaborative model trained by distributed clients.\nTo accomplish an FL task, the task publisher needs to pay financial incentives\nto the FL server and FL server offloads the task to the contributing FL\nclients. It is challenging to design proper incentives for the FL clients due\nto the fact that the task is privately trained by the clients. This paper aims\nto propose a contract theory based FL task training model towards minimizing\nincentive budget subject to clients being individually rational (IR) and\nincentive compatible (IC) in each FL training round. We design a\ntwo-dimensional contract model by formally defining two private types of\nclients, namely data quality and computation effort. To effectively aggregate\nthe trained models, a contract-based aggregator is proposed. We analyze the\nfeasible and optimal contract solutions to the proposed contract model.\n%Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework and contract\nmodel can effective improve the generation accuracy of FL tasks. Experimental\nresults show that the generalization accuracy of the FL tasks can be improved\nby the proposed incentive mechanism where contract-based aggregation is\napplied.",

This is exaspirated by the fact that new\nsimulations must be performed when the velocity structure or source location is\nperturbed. Here, we explore a prototype framework for learning general\nsolutions using a recently developed machine learning paradigm called Neural\nOperator. A trained Neural Operator can compute a solution in negligible time\nfor any velocity structure or source location. We develop a scheme to train\nNeural Operators on an ensemble of simulations performed with random velocity\nmodels and source locations. As Neural Operators are grid-free, it is possible\nto evaluate solutions on higher resolution velocity models than trained on,\nproviding additional computational efficiency. We illustrate the method with\nthe 2D acoustic wave equation and demonstrate the method's applicability to\nseismic tomography, using reverse mode automatic differentiation to compute\ngradients of the wavefield with respect to the velocity structure. The\ndeveloped procedure is nearly an order of magnitude faster than using\nconventional numerical methods for full waveform inversion.",

          "description": "For the problem of task-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL), an agent first\ncollects samples from an unknown environment without the supervision of reward\nsignals, then is revealed with a reward and is asked to compute a corresponding\nnear-optimal policy. Existing approaches mainly concern the worst-case\nscenarios, in which no structural information of the reward/transition-dynamics\nis utilized. Therefore the best sample upper bound is\n$\\propto\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\epsilon^2)$, where $\\epsilon>0$ is the\ntarget accuracy of the obtained policy, and can be overly pessimistic. To\ntackle this issue, we provide an efficient algorithm that utilizes a gap\nparameter, $\\rho>0$, to reduce the amount of exploration. In particular, for an\nunknown finite-horizon Markov decision process, the algorithm takes only\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} (1/\\epsilon \\cdot (H^3SA / \\rho + H^4 S^2 A) )$\nepisodes of exploration, and is able to obtain an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy for\na post-revealed reward with sub-optimality gap at least $\\rho$, where $S$ is\nthe number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $H$ is the length of\nthe horizon, obtaining a nearly \\emph{quadratic saving} in terms of $\\epsilon$.\nWe show that, information-theoretically, this bound is nearly tight for $\\rho <\n\\Theta(1/(HS))$ and $H>1$. We further show that\n$\\propto\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1)$ sample bound is possible for $H=1$ (i.e.,\nmulti-armed bandit) or with a sampling simulator, establishing a stark\nseparation between those settings and the RL setting.",

To handle the MRVD problem, we propose a queueing-based\nvehicle dispatching framework, which first uses existing machine learning\nalgorithms to predict the future vehicle demand of each region, then estimates\nthe idle time periods of drivers through a queueing model for each region. With\nthe information of the predicted vehicle demands and estimated idle time\nperiods of drivers, we propose two batch-based vehicle dispatching algorithms\nto efficiently assign suitable drivers to riders such that the expected overall\nrevenue of the platform is maximized during each batch processing.

          "description": "Understanding the structure of loss landscape of deep neural networks\n(DNNs)is obviously important. In this work, we prove an embedding principle\nthat the loss landscape of a DNN \"contains\" all the critical points of all the\nnarrower DNNs. More precisely, we propose a critical embedding such that any\ncritical point, e.g., local or global minima, of a narrower DNN can be embedded\nto a critical point/hyperplane of the target DNN with higher degeneracy and\npreserving the DNN output function. The embedding structure of critical points\nis independent of loss function and training data, showing a stark difference\nfrom other nonconvex problems such as protein-folding. Empirically, we find\nthat a wide DNN is often attracted by highly-degenerate critical points that\nare embedded from narrow DNNs. The embedding principle provides an explanation\nfor the general easy optimization of wide DNNs and unravels a potential\nimplicit low-complexity regularization during the training. Overall, our work\nprovides a skeleton for the study of loss landscape of DNNs and its\nimplication, by which a more exact and comprehensive understanding can be\nanticipated in the near",

          "description": "Abstract reasoning, i.e., inferring complicated patterns from given\nobservations, is a central building block of artificial general intelligence.\nWhile humans find the answer by either eliminating wrong candidates or first\nconstructing the answer, prior deep neural network (DNN)-based methods focus on\nthe former discriminative approach. This paper aims to design a framework for\nthe latter approach and bridge the gap between artificial and human\nintelligence. To this end, we propose logic-guided generation (LoGe), a novel\ngenerative DNN framework that reduces abstract reasoning as an optimization\nproblem in propositional logic. LoGe is composed of three steps: extract\npropositional variables from images, reason the answer variables with a logic\nlayer, and reconstruct the answer image from the variables. We demonstrate that\nLoGe outperforms the black box DNN frameworks for generative abstract reasoning\nunder the RAVEN benchmark, i.e., reconstructing answers based on capturing\ncorrect rules of various attributes from observations.",

Traditional anti-spam gateway commonly requires to maintain a\ngreylist to filter out unexpected emails based on suspicious vocabularies\nexisted in the mail subject and content. However, the signature-based approach\ncannot effectively discover novel and unknown suspicious emails that utilize\nvarious hot topics at present, such as COVID-19 and US election. To address the\nproblem, in this paper, we present Holmes, an efficient and lightweight\nsemantic based engine for anomalous email detection. Holmes can convert each\nevent log of email to a sentence through word embedding then extract\ninteresting items among them by novelty detection. Based on our observations,\nwe claim that, in an enterprise environment, there is a stable relation between\nsenders and receivers, but suspicious emails are commonly from unusual sources,\nwhich can be detected through the rareness selection. We evaluate the\nperformance of Holmes in a real-world enterprise environment, in which it sends\nand receives around 5,000 emails each day. As a result, Holmes can achieve a\nhigh detection rate (output around 200 suspicious emails per day) and maintain\na low false alarm rate for anomaly detection.",

          "description": "In the past decade, contextual bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms\nhave been successfully used in various interactive learning systems such as\nonline advertising, recommender systems, and dynamic pricing. However, they\nhave yet to be widely adopted in high-stakes application domains, such as\nhealthcare. One reason may be that existing approaches assume that the\nunderlying mechanisms are static in the sense that they do not change over\ndifferent environments. In many real world systems, however, the mechanisms are\nsubject to shifts across environments which may invalidate the static\nenvironment assumption. In this paper, we tackle the problem of environmental\nshifts under the framework of offline contextual bandits. We view the\nenvironmental shift problem through the lens of causality and propose\nmulti-environment contextual bandits that allow for changes in the underlying\nmechanisms. We adopt the concept of invariance from the causality literature\nand introduce the notion of policy invariance. We argue that policy invariance\nis only relevant if unobserved confounders are present and show that, in that\ncase, an optimal invariant policy is guaranteed to generalize across\nenvironments under suitable assumptions. Our results may be a first step\ntowards solving the environmental shift problem. They also establish concrete\nconnections among causality, invariance and contextual bandits.",

          "description": "Persistence diagrams have been widely used to quantify the underlying\nfeatures of filtered topological spaces in data visualization. In many\napplications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however,\ncomputing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost.\nIn this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a\nbinary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast\ncomputation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning\nprocess. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into\nbinary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training\nof this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from\nsynthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is\ndirectly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the\nmodel. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better\nmaintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other\nvectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to\nthe problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of\nour approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of\nour approach on a dataset with 10k persistence diagrams, which is not possible\nwith current techniques.

This paper investigates\nvariance reduction with coordinate-wise and layer-wise control variates\nconstructed from vector-valued baselines for neural net policies. We present\nexperimental evidence suggesting that lower variance can be obtained with such\nbaselines than with the conventional scalar-valued baseline.

As a result, most deep\nlearning-based medical image analysis tasks require the input images to be\ndownsampled, often substantially, before these can be fed to a neural network.\nHowever, downsampling can lead to a loss of image quality, which is undesirable\nespecially in reconstruction tasks, where the fine geometric details need to be\npreserved. In this paper, we propose that high-resolution images can be\nreconstructed in a coarse-to-fine fashion, where a deep learning algorithm is\nonly responsible for generating a coarse representation of the image, which\nconsumes moderate GPU memory. For producing the high-resolution outcome, we\npropose two novel methods: learned voxel rearrangement of the coarse output and\nhierarchical image synthesis.

We call this\npractice of enriching the code with natural language intent to facilitate its\ncompletion natural language-guided programming.\n\nTo show that this idea is feasible we design, implement and benchmark a tool\nthat solves this problem in the context of a specific domain (data science) and\na specific programming language (Python). Central to the tool is the use of\nlanguage models trained on a large corpus of documented code. Our initial\nexperiments confirm the feasibility of the idea but also make it clear that we\nhave only scratched the surface of what may become possible in the future. We\nend the paper with a comprehensive research agenda to stimulate additional\nresearch in the budding area of natural language-guided programming.",

          "description": "Being light-weight and cost-effective, IR-based approaches for bug\nlocalization have shown promise in finding software bugs. However, the accuracy\nof these approaches heavily depends on their used bug reports. A significant\nnumber of bug reports contain only plain natural language texts. According to\nexisting studies, IR-based approaches cannot perform well when they use these\nbug reports as search queries. On the other hand, there is a piece of recent\nevidence that suggests that even these natural language-only reports contain\nenough good keywords that could help localize the bugs successfully. On one\nhand, these findings suggest that natural language-only bug reports might be a\nsufficient source for good query keywords. On the other hand, they cast serious\ndoubt on the query selection practices in the IR-based bug localization. In\nthis article, we attempted to clear the sky on this aspect by conducting an\nin-depth empirical study that critically examines the state-of-the-art query\nselection practices in IR-based bug localization. In particular, we use a\ndataset of 2,320 bug reports, employ ten existing approaches from the\nliterature, exploit the Genetic Algorithm-based approach to construct optimal,\nnear-optimal search queries from these bug reports, and then answer three\nresearch questions. We confirmed that the state-of-the-art query construction\napproaches are indeed not sufficient for constructing appropriate queries (for\nbug localization) from certain natural language-only bug reports although they\ncontain such queries. We also demonstrate that optimal queries and non-optimal\nqueries chosen from bug report texts are significantly different in terms of\nseveral keyword characteristics, which has led us to actionable insights.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate 27%--34% improvement in the performance of\nnon-optimal queries through the application of our actionable insights to them.",

For\nexample, companies belong to industries, which in turn belong to ever coarser\ndivisions such as sectors; microbes are commonly arranged in a taxonomic\nhierarchy from species to kingdoms; street blocks belong to neighborhoods,\nwhich in turn belong to larger-scale regions. The problem of tree-based\naggregation that we consider in this paper asks which of these tree-defined\nsubgroups of leaves should really be treated as a single entity and which of\nthese entities should be distinguished from each other.\n\nWe introduce the \"false split rate\", an error measure that describes the\ndegree to which subgroups have been split when they should not have been. We\nthen propose a multiple hypothesis testing algorithm for tree-based\naggregation, which we prove controls this error measure.

Although some explorations have been made towards developing fair GNNs,\nexisting approaches are tailored for a specific GNN model.

          "description": "Cardinality estimation is a fundamental but long unresolved problem in query\noptimization. Recently, multiple papers from different research groups\nconsistently report that learned models have the potential to replace existing\ncardinality estimators. In this paper, we ask a forward-thinking question: Are\nwe ready to deploy these learned cardinality models in production? Our study\nconsists of three main parts. Firstly, we focus on the static environment\n(i.e., no data updates) and compare five new learned methods with eight\ntraditional methods on four real-world datasets under a unified workload\nsetting. The results show that learned models are indeed more accurate than\ntraditional methods, but they often suffer from high training and inference\ncosts. Secondly, we explore whether these learned models are ready for dynamic\nenvironments (i.e., frequent data updates). We find that they cannot catch up\nwith fast data up-dates and return large errors for different reasons. For less\nfrequent updates, they can perform better but there is no clear winner among\nthemselves. Thirdly, we take a deeper look into learned models and explore when\nthey may go wrong. Our results show that the performance of learned methods can\nbe greatly affected by the changes in correlation, skewness, or domain size.\nMore importantly, their behaviors are much harder to interpret and often\nunpredictable. Based on these findings, we identify two promising research\ndirections (control the cost of learned models and make learned models\ntrustworthy) and suggest a number of research opportunities. We hope that our\nstudy can guide researchers and practitioners to work together to eventually\npush learned cardinality estimators into real database systems.",

As a result,\nthere are numerous bespoke interpretations of these definitions. Instead, we\nprovide a generalized set of group fairness definitions that unambiguously\nextend to all machine learning environments while still retaining their\noriginal fairness notions. We derive two fairness principles that enable such a\ngeneralized framework. First, our framework measures outcomes in terms of\nutilities, rather than predictions, and does so for both the decision-algorithm\nand the individual. Second, our framework considers counterfactual outcomes,\nrather than just observed outcomes, thus preventing loopholes where fairness\ncriteria are satisfied through self-fulfilling prophecies. We provide concrete\nexamples of how our counterfactual utility fairness framework resolves known\nfairness issues in classification, clustering, and reinforcement learning\nproblems. We also show that many of the bespoke interpretations of Demographic\nParity and Equal Opportunity fit nicely as special cases of our framework.",

The main challenge\nof this task is the large modality gap between attributes and images. To reduce\nthe gap, we present a new loss for learning cross-modal embeddings in the\ncontext of attribute-based person search. We regard a set of attributes as a\ncategory of people sharing the same traits. In a joint embedding space of the\ntwo modalities, our loss pulls images close to their person categories for\nmodality alignment. More importantly, it pushes apart a pair of person\ncategories by a margin determined adaptively by their semantic distance, where\nthe distance metric is learned end-to-end so that the loss considers importance\nof each attribute when relating person categories. Our loss guided by the\nadaptive semantic margin leads to more discriminative and semantically\nwell-arranged distributions of person images.

However, it is often the case that actual labels are\ndifficult and expensive to get, for example, because they require expert\njudgment.

So far the existing research has been\nmostly focusing on the development of quantitative metrics to measure algorithm\ndisparities across different protected groups, and approaches for adjusting the\nalgorithm output to reduce such disparities. In this paper, we propose to study\nthe problem of identification of the source of model disparities. Unlike\nexisting interpretation methods which typically learn feature importance, we\nconsider the causal relationships among feature variables and propose a novel\nframework to decompose the disparity into the sum of contributions from\nfairness-aware causal paths, which are paths linking the sensitive attribute\nand the final predictions, on the graph. We also consider the scenario when the\ndirections on certain edges within those paths cannot be determined. Our\nframework is also model agnostic and applicable to a variety of quantitative\ndisparity measures.

In the last years, several works have addressed this\nproblem with heavy and complex models that try to capture visual-textual\ndependencies better than before.

To do so, we\nperform an extensive, standardized benchmark of fifteen particularly popular\ndeep learning optimizers while giving a concise overview of the wide range of\npossible choices. Analyzing more than $50,000$ individual runs, we contribute\nthe following three points: (i) Optimizer performance varies greatly across\ntasks.

(iii) While we cannot discern an optimization method\nclearly dominating across all tested tasks, we identify a significantly reduced\nsubset of specific optimizers and parameter choices that generally lead to\ncompetitive results in our experiments: Adam remains a strong contender, with\nnewer methods failing to significantly and consistently outperform it.

First, the motivation for emphatic TD methods\nproposed by Sutton et al. (2016) does not align with the convergence analysis\nof Yu (2015). Namely, a quantity used by Sutton et al.

Second, followon traces typically\nsuffer from large variance, making them hard to use in practice. Third, despite\nthe seminal work of Yu (2015) confirming the asymptotic convergence of some\nemphatic TD methods for prediction problems, there is still no finite sample\nanalysis for any emphatic TD method for prediction, much less control. In this\npaper, we address those three open problems simultaneously via using truncated\nfollowon traces in emphatic TD methods.

However, in large commercial platforms,\nit is often the case that the recommenders need to make click-through rate\n(CTR) predictions for multiple business domains.

Since the\nspecific user groups have disparity and the user behaviors may change in\nvarious business domains, there also have distinctions. The distinctions result\nin domain-specific data distributions, making it hard for a single shared model\nto work well on all domains. To learn an effective and efficient CTR model to\nhandle multiple domains simultaneously, we present Star Topology Adaptive\nRecommender (STAR). Concretely, STAR has the star topology, which consists of\nthe shared centered parameters and domain-specific parameters.

          "description": "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have not been broadly adopted in\nBayesian neural networks (BNNs). This paper initially reviews the main\nchallenges in sampling from the parameter posterior of a neural network via\nMCMC. Such challenges culminate to lack of convergence to the parameter\nposterior. Nevertheless, this paper shows that a non-converged Markov chain,\ngenerated via MCMC sampling from the parameter space of a neural network, can\nyield via Bayesian marginalization a valuable posterior predictive distribution\nof the output of the neural network. Classification examples based on\nmultilayer perceptrons showcase highly accurate posterior predictive\ndistributions. The postulate of limited scope for MCMC developments in BNNs is\npartially valid; an asymptotically exact parameter posterior seems less\nplausible, yet an accurate posterior predictive distribution is a tenable\nresearch avenue.",

However, many ParVI approaches do not allow\narbitrary sampling from the posterior, and the few that do allow such sampling\nsuffer from suboptimality. This work proposes a new method for learning to\napproximately sample from the posterior distribution. We construct a neural\nsampler that is trained with the functional gradient of the KL-divergence\nbetween the empirical sampling distribution and the target distribution,\nassuming the gradient resides within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our\ngenerative ParVI (GPVI) approach maintains the asymptotic performance of ParVI\nmethods while offering the flexibility of a generative sampler. Through\ncarefully constructed experiments, we show that GPVI outperforms previous\ngenerative ParVI methods such as amortized SVGD, and is competitive with ParVI\nas well as gold-standard approaches like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for fitting\nboth exactly known and intractable target distributions.",

          "description": "Neural network (NN) models are increasingly used in scientific simulations,\nAI, and other high performance computing (HPC) fields to extract knowledge from\ndatasets. Each dataset requires tailored NN model architecture, but designing\nstructures by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Neural\narchitecture search (NAS) automates the design of NN architectures. NAS\nattempts to find well-performing NN models for specialized datsets, where\nperformance is measured by key metrics that capture the NN capabilities (e.g.,\naccuracy of classification of samples in a dataset). Existing NAS methods are\nresource intensive, especially when searching for highly accurate models for\nlarger and larger datasets.\n\nTo address this problem, we propose a performance estimation strategy that\nreduces the resources for training NNs and increases NAS throughput without\njeopardizing accuracy. We implement our strategy via an engine called PEng4NN\nthat plugs into existing NAS methods; in doing so, PEng4NN predicts the final\naccuracy of NNs early in the training process, informs the NAS of NN\nperformance, and thus enables the NAS to terminate training NNs early. We\nassess our engine on three diverse datasets (i.e., CIFAR-100, Fashion MNIST,\nand SVHN). By reducing the training epochs needed, our engine achieves\nsubstantial throughput gain; on average, our engine saves 61% to 82% of\ntraining epochs, increasing throughput by a factor of 2.5 to 5 compared to a\nstate-of-the-art NAS method. We achieve this gain without compromising\naccuracy, as we demonstrate with two key outcomes. First, across all our tests,\nbetween 74% and 97% of the ground truth best models lie in our set of predicted\nbest models. Second, the accuracy distributions of the ground truth best models\nand our predicted best models are comparable, with the mean accuracy values\ndiffering by at most .7 percentage points across all tests.",

          "description": "The large and still increasing popularity of deep learning clashes with a\nmajor limit of neural network architectures, that consists in their lack of\ncapability in providing human-understandable motivations of their decisions. In\nsituations in which the machine is expected to support the decision of human\nexperts, providing a comprehensible explanation is a feature of crucial\nimportance. The language used to communicate the explanations must be formal\nenough to be implementable in a machine and friendly enough to be\nunderstandable by a wide audience. In this paper, we propose a general approach\nto Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the case of neural architectures,\nshowing how a mindful design of the networks leads to a family of interpretable\ndeep learning models called Logic Explained Networks (LENs). LENs only require\ntheir inputs to be human-understandable predicates, and they provide\nexplanations in terms of simple First-Order Logic (FOL) formulas involving such\npredicates. LENs are general enough to cover a large number of scenarios.\nAmongst them, we consider the case in which LENs are directly used as special\nclassifiers with the capability of being explainable, or when they act as\nadditional networks with the role of creating the conditions for making a\nblack-box classifier explainable by FOL formulas. Despite supervised learning\nproblems are mostly emphasized, we also show that LENs can learn and provide\nexplanations in unsupervised learning settings. Experimental results on several\ndatasets and tasks show that LENs may yield better classifications than\nestablished white-box models, such as decision trees and Bayesian rule lists,\nwhile providing more compact and meaningful explanations.",

          "description": "There is increasing attention to evaluating the fairness of search system\nranking decisions. These metrics often consider the membership of items to\nparticular groups, often identified using protected attributes such as gender\nor ethnicity. To date, these metrics typically assume the availability and\ncompleteness of protected attribute labels of items. However, the protected\nattributes of individuals are rarely present, limiting the application of fair\nranking metrics in large scale systems. In order to address this problem, we\npropose a sampling strategy and estimation technique for four fair ranking\nmetrics. We formulate a robust and unbiased estimator which can operate even\nwith very limited number of labeled items. We evaluate our approach using both\nsimulated and real world data.

However, this progress could not\nshow any promises for fine-grained tasks such as Head Pose estimation. In this\narticle, we have tried to answer a question: How SSL can be used for Head Pose\nestimation? In general, there are two main approaches to use SSL: 1. Using\npre-trained weights which can be done via weights pre-training on ImageNet or\nvia SSL tasks. 2. Leveraging SSL as an auxiliary co-training task besides of\nSupervised Learning (SL) tasks at the same time. In this study, modified\nversions of jigsaw puzzling and rotation as SSL pre-text tasks are used and the\nbest architecture for our proposed Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL) is found.\nFinally, the HopeNet method as a baseline is selected and the impact of SSL\npre-training and ImageNet pre-training on both HMTL and SL are compared. The\nerror rate reduced by the HTML method up to 11% compare to the SL. Moreover,\nHMTL method showed that it was good with all kinds of initial weights: random,\nImageNet and SSL pre-training weights. Also, it was observed, when puzzled\nimages are used for SL alone, the average error rate placed between SL and HMTL\nwhich showed the importance of local spatial features compare to global spatial\nfeatures.",

          "description": "In the era of intelligent transportation, driver behavior profiling has\nbecome a beneficial technology as it provides knowledge regarding the driver's\naggressiveness. Previous approaches achieved promising driver behavior\nprofiling performance through establishing statistical heuristics rules or\nsupervised learning-based models. Still, there exist limits that the\npractitioner should prepare a labeled dataset, and prior approaches could not\nclassify aggressive behaviors which are not known a priori. In pursuit of\nimproving the aforementioned drawbacks, we propose a novel approach to driver\nbehavior profiling leveraging an unsupervised learning paradigm. First, we cast\nthe driver behavior profiling problem as anomaly detection. Second, we\nestablished recurrent neural networks that predict the next feature vector\ngiven a sequence of feature vectors. We trained the model with normal driver\ndata only. As a result, our model yields high regression error given a sequence\nof aggressive driver behavior and low error given at a sequence of normal\ndriver behavior. We figured this difference of error between normal and\naggressive driver behavior can be an adequate flag for driver behavior\nprofiling and accomplished a precise performance in experiments. Lastly, we\nfurther analyzed the optimal level of sequence length for identifying each\naggressive driver behavior. We expect the proposed approach to be a useful\nbaseline for unsupervised driver behavior profiling and contribute to the\nefficient, intelligent transportation ecosystem.",

          "description": "Adversarial patch attack against image classification deep neural networks\n(DNNs), in which the attacker can inject arbitrary distortions within a bounded\nregion of an image, is able to generate adversarial perturbations that are\nrobust (i.e., remain adversarial in physical world) and universal (i.e., remain\nadversarial on any input). It is thus important to detect and mitigate such\nattack to ensure the security of DNNs.\n\nThis work proposes Jujutsu, a technique to detect and mitigate robust and\nuniversal adversarial patch attack. Jujutsu leverages the universal property of\nthe patch attack for detection. It uses explainable AI technique to identify\nsuspicious features that are potentially malicious, and verify their\nmaliciousness by transplanting the suspicious features to new images. An\nadversarial patch continues to exhibit the malicious behavior on the new images\nand thus can be detected based on prediction consistency. Jujutsu leverages the\nlocalized nature of the patch attack for mitigation, by randomly masking the\nsuspicious features to \"remove\" adversarial perturbations. However, the network\nmight fail to classify the images as some of the contents are removed (masked).\nTherefore, Jujutsu uses image inpainting for synthesizing alternative contents\nfrom the pixels that are masked, which can reconstruct the \"clean\" image for\ncorrect prediction. We evaluate Jujutsu on five DNNs on two datasets, and show\nthat Jujutsu achieves superior performance and significantly outperforms\nexisting techniques. Jujutsu can further defend against various variants of the\nbasic attack, including 1) physical-world attack; 2) attacks that target\ndiverse classes; 3) attacks that use patches in different shapes and 4)\nadaptive attacks.",

          "description": "Learning to rank systems has become an important aspect of our daily life.\nHowever, the implicit user feedback that is used to train many learning to rank\nmodels is usually noisy and suffered from user bias (i.e., position bias).\nThus, obtaining an unbiased model using biased feedback has become an important\nresearch field for IR. Existing studies on unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) can\nbe generalized into two families-algorithms that attain unbiasedness with\nlogged data, offline learning, and algorithms that achieve unbiasedness by\nestimating unbiased parameters with real-time user interactions, namely online\nlearning. While there exist many algorithms from both families, there lacks a\nunified way to compare and benchmark them. As a result, it can be challenging\nfor researchers to choose the right technique for their problems or for people\nwho are new to the field to learn and understand existing algorithms. To solve\nthis problem, we introduced ULTRA, which is a flexible, extensible, and easily\nconfigure ULTR toolbox. Its key features include support for multiple ULTR\nalgorithms with configurable hyperparameters, a variety of built-in click\nmodels that can be used separately to simulate clicks, different ranking model\narchitecture and evaluation metrics, and simple learning to rank pipeline\ncreation. In this paper, we discuss the general framework of ULTR, briefly\ndescribe the algorithms in ULTRA, detailed the structure, and pipeline of the\ntoolbox. We experimented on all the algorithms supported by ultra and showed\nthat the toolbox performance is reasonable. Our toolbox is an important\nresource for researchers to conduct experiments on ULTR algorithms with\ndifferent configurations as well as testing their own algorithms with the\nsupported features.",

          "description": "In the recent decade companies started collecting of large amount of data.\nWithout a proper analyse, the data are usually useless. The field of analysing\nthe data is called data mining. Unfortunately, the amount of data is quite\nlarge: the data do not fit into main memory and the processing time can become\nquite huge. Therefore, we need parallel data mining algorithms. One of the\npopular and important data mining algorithm is the algorithm for generation of\nso called frequent itemsets. The problem of mining of frequent itemsets can be\nexplained on the following example: customers goes in a store put into theirs\nbaskets some goods; the owner of the store collects the baskets and wants to\nknow the set of goods that are bought together in at least p% of the baskets.\nCurrently, the sequential algorithms for mining of frequent itemsets are quite\ngood in the means of performance. However, the parallel algorithms for mining\nof frequent itemsets still do not achieve good speedup. In this thesis, we\ndevelop a parallel method for mining of frequent itemsets that can be used for\nan arbitrary depth first search sequential algorithms on a distributed memory\nparallel computer. Our method achieves speedup of ~ 6 on 10 processors. The\nmethod is based on an approximate estimation of processor load from a database\nsample - however it always computes the set of frequent itemsets from the whole\ndatabase. In this thesis, we show a theory underlying our method and show the\nperformance of the estimation process.",

          "description": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) watermarking is a method for provenance\nverification of DNN models. Watermarking should be robust against watermark\nremoval attacks that derive a surrogate model that evades provenance\nverification. Many watermarking schemes that claim robustness have been\nproposed, but their robustness is only validated in isolation against a\nrelatively small set of attacks. There is no systematic, empirical evaluation\nof these claims against a common, comprehensive set of removal attacks. This\nuncertainty about a watermarking scheme's robustness causes difficulty to trust\ntheir deployment in practice. In this paper, we evaluate whether recently\nproposed watermarking schemes that claim robustness are robust against a large\nset of removal attacks. We survey methods from the literature that (i) are\nknown removal attacks, (ii) derive surrogate models but have not been evaluated\nas removal attacks, and (iii) novel removal attacks. Weight shifting and smooth\nretraining are novel removal attacks adapted to the DNN watermarking schemes\nsurveyed in this paper. We propose taxonomies for watermarking schemes and\nremoval attacks. Our empirical evaluation includes an ablation study over sets\nof parameters for each attack and watermarking scheme on the CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet datasets. Surprisingly, none of the surveyed watermarking schemes is\nrobust in practice. We find that schemes fail to withstand adaptive attacks and\nknown methods for deriving surrogate models that have not been evaluated as\nremoval attacks. This points to intrinsic flaws in how robustness is currently\nevaluated. We show that watermarking schemes need to be evaluated against a\nmore extensive set of removal attacks with a more realistic adversary model.\nOur source code and a complete dataset of evaluation results are publicly\navailable, which allows to independently verify our conclusions.",

          "description": "Universal adversarial attacks, which hinder most deep neural network (DNN)\ntasks using only a small single perturbation called a universal adversarial\nperturbation (UAP), is a realistic security threat to the practical application\nof a DNN. In particular, such attacks cause serious problems in medical\nimaging. Given that computer-based systems are generally operated under a\nblack-box condition in which only queries on inputs are allowed and outputs are\naccessible, the impact of UAPs seems to be limited because well-used algorithms\nfor generating UAPs are limited to a white-box condition in which adversaries\ncan access the model weights and loss gradients. Nevertheless, we demonstrate\nthat UAPs are easily generatable using a relatively small dataset under\nblack-box conditions. In particular, we propose a method for generating UAPs\nusing a simple hill-climbing search based only on DNN outputs and demonstrate\nthe validity of the proposed method using representative DNN-based medical\nimage classifications. Black-box UAPs can be used to conduct both non-targeted\nand targeted attacks. Overall, the black-box UAPs showed high attack success\nrates (40% to 90%), although some of them had relatively low success rates\nbecause the method only utilizes limited information to generate UAPs. The\nvulnerability of black-box UAPs was observed in several model architectures.\nThe results indicate that adversaries can also generate UAPs through a simple\nprocedure under the black-box condition to foil or control DNN-based medical\nimage diagnoses, and that UAPs are a more realistic security threat.",

The strong discrimination ability on the source dataset does\nnot necessarily translate to high classification accuracy on the target\ndataset. In this work, we address this cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL)\nproblem by boosting the generalization capability of the model. Specifically,\nwe teach the model to capture broader variations of the feature distributions\nwith a novel noise-enhanced supervised autoencoder (NSAE). NSAE trains the\nmodel by jointly reconstructing inputs and predicting the labels of inputs as\nwell as their reconstructed pairs. Theoretical analysis based on intra-class\ncorrelation (ICC) shows that the feature embeddings learned from NSAE have\nstronger discrimination and generalization abilities in the target domain. We\nalso take advantage of NSAE structure and propose a two-step fine-tuning\nprocedure that achieves better adaption and improves classification performance\nin the target domain.

Besides the quadratic computational and memory complexity\nw.r.t the sequence length, the self-attention mechanism only processes\ninformation at the same scale, i.e., all attention heads are in the same\nresolution, resulting in the limited power of the Transformer. To remedy this,\nwe propose a novel and efficient structure named Adaptive Multi-Resolution\nAttention (AdaMRA for short), which scales linearly to sequence length in terms\nof time and space. Specifically, we leverage a multi-resolution multi-head\nattention mechanism, enabling attention heads to capture long-range contextual\ninformation in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, to capture the potential\nrelations between query representation and clues of different attention\ngranularities, we leave the decision of which resolution of attention to use to\nquery, which further improves the model's capacity compared to vanilla\nTransformer. In an effort to reduce complexity, we adopt kernel attention\nwithout degrading the performance.

Another significant contribution is to reduce the realization of the\nshortest path problem. The distance between each pair of nodes expresses an\nassociated mutual information value, and the path with the minimum sum (KL\ndivergence) is sought. Although $p!$ mutual information values should be\ncompared, this paper dramatically reduces the computation when no confounding\nis present. The proposed algorithm finds the globally optimal solution, while\nthe existing locally greedily seek the order based on hypothesis testing. We\nuse the best estimator in the sense of Bayes/MDL that correctly detects\nindependence for mutual information estimation. Experiments using artificial\nand actual data show that the proposed version of LiNGAM achieves significantly\nbetter performance, particularly when confounding is present.",

          "description": "Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDoH) have important roles in\nshaping people's health. In clinical research studies, especially comparative\neffectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially\ncause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical\nanalyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies\nto examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured\nSBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much\nof the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language\nprocessing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from\nunstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system\nfocusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH\nconcepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract\nSBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the\ndifference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured\nEHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the\nInternational Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show\nthat the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of\n0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH\ninformation and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864\npatients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more\ndetailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only\ncaptured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical\nnarratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of\npatients' SBDoH factors.",

Given the fact that the generative distribution may be\ncomplex and intractable, deep latent variable models use probabilistic\nframeworks to learn more expressive joint probability distributions over the\ndata and their low-dimensional hidden variables. Learning complex probability\ndistributions over sequential data without any supervision is a difficult task\nfor deep generative models. Ordinary Differential Equation Variational\nAuto-Encoder (ODE2VAE) is a deep latent variable model that aims to learn\ncomplex distributions over high-dimensional sequential data and their\nlow-dimensional representations. ODE2VAE infers continuous latent dynamics of\nthe high-dimensional input in a low-dimensional hierarchical latent space. The\nhierarchical organization of the continuous latent space embeds a\nphysics-guided inductive bias in the model. In this paper, we analyze the\nlatent representations inferred by the ODE2VAE model over three different\nphysical motion datasets: bouncing balls, projectile motion, and simple\npendulum. Through our experiments, we explore the effects of the physics-guided\ninductive bias of the ODE2VAE model over the learned dynamical latent\nrepresentations.

          "description": "Nonlocal models, including peridynamics, often use integral operators that\nembed lengthscales in their definition. However, the integrands in these\noperators are difficult to define from the data that are typically available\nfor a given physical system, such as laboratory mechanical property tests. In\ncontrast, molecular dynamics (MD) does not require these integrands, but it\nsuffers from computational limitations in the length and time scales it can\naddress. To combine the strengths of both methods and to obtain a\ncoarse-grained, homogenized continuum model that efficiently and accurately\ncaptures materials' behavior, we propose a learning framework to extract, from\nMD data, an optimal Linear Peridynamic Solid (LPS) model as a surrogate for MD\ndisplacements. To maximize the accuracy of the learnt model we allow the\nperidynamic influence function to be partially negative, while preserving the\nwell-posedness of the resulting model. To achieve this, we provide sufficient\nwell-posedness conditions for discretized LPS models with sign-changing\ninfluence functions and develop a constrained optimization algorithm that\nminimizes the equation residual while enforcing such solvability conditions.\nThis framework guarantees that the resulting model is mathematically\nwell-posed, physically consistent, and that it generalizes well to settings\nthat are different from the ones used during training. We illustrate the\nefficacy of the proposed approach with several numerical tests for single layer\ngraphene. Our two-dimensional tests show the robustness of the proposed\nalgorithm on validation data sets that include thermal noise, different domain\nshapes and external loadings, and discretizations substantially different from\nthe ones used for training.",

Data scarcity is one of the major challenges in building reliable\nmachine learning models. Data scarcity combined with the use of pre-calculated\nhand-crafted input features has led to problems of overfitting and data\nleakage.\n\nWe overcome the limitations of existing works by proposing a novel\nmulti-tasking convolution-based approach, which we refer to as MuCoMiD. MuCoMiD\nallows automatic feature extraction while incorporating knowledge from 4\nheterogeneous biological information sources (interactions between\nmiRNA/diseases and protein-coding genes (PCG), miRNA family information, and\ndisease ontology) in a multi-task setting which is a novel perspective and has\nnot been studied before. The use of multi-channel convolutions allows us to\nextract expressive representations while keeping the model linear and,\ntherefore, simple. To effectively test the generalization capability of our\nmodel, we construct large-scale experiments on standard benchmark datasets as\nwell as our proposed larger independent test sets and case studies. MuCoMiD\nshows an improvement of at least 5% in 5-fold CV evaluation on HMDDv2.0 and\nHMDDv3.0 datasets and at least 49% on larger independent test sets with unseen\nmiRNA and diseases over state-of-the-art approaches.

          "description": "Perceiving obstacles and avoiding collisions is fundamental to the safe\noperation of a robot system, particularly when the robot must operate in highly\ndynamic human environments. Proximity detection using on-robot sensors can be\nused to avoid or mitigate impending collisions.

In this paper, we introduce the\nphenomenon of the Leaky Surface Wave (LSW), a novel sensing modality, and\npresent AuraSense, a proximity detection system using the LSW. AuraSense is the\nfirst system to realize no-dead-spot proximity sensing for robot arms.

We further\nintroduce a set of signal processing techniques and a lightweight neural\nnetwork to address the unique challenges in using the LSW for proximity\nsensing. Finally, we demonstrate a prototype system consisting of a single\npiezoelectric element pair on a robot manipulator, which validates our design.\nWe conducted several micro benchmark experiments and performed more than 2000\non-robot proximity detection trials with various potential robot arm materials,\ncolliding objects, approach patterns, and robot movement patterns.

          "description": "Attempting to fully exploit the rich information of topological structure and\nnode features for attributed graph, we introduce self-supervised learning\nmechanism to graph representation learning and propose a novel Self-supervised\nConsensus Representation Learning (SCRL) framework. In contrast to most\nexisting works that only explore one graph, our proposed SCRL method treats\ngraph from two perspectives: topology graph and feature graph. We argue that\ntheir embeddings should share some common information, which could serve as a\nsupervisory signal. Specifically, we construct the feature graph of node\nfeatures via k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Then graph convolutional network\n(GCN) encoders extract features from two graphs respectively. Self-supervised\nloss is designed to maximize the agreement of the embeddings of the same node\nin the topology graph and the feature graph. Extensive experiments on real\ncitation networks and social networks demonstrate the superiority of our\nproposed SCRL over the state-of-the-art methods on semi-supervised node\nclassification task. Meanwhile, compared with its main competitors, SCRL is\nrather efficient.",

With recent developments in neural networks, a growing\nconcern is whether it is responsible to use these models. Concerns such as\nsafety and ethics can be partially addressed by providing explanations.\nFurthermore, when models do fail, providing explanations is paramount for\naccountability purposes. To this end, interpretability serves to provide these\nexplanations in terms that are understandable to humans. Central to what is\nunderstandable is how explanations are communicated. Therefore, this survey\nprovides a categorization of how recent interpretability methods communicate\nexplanations and discusses the methods in depth. Furthermore, the survey\nfocuses on post-hoc methods, which provide explanations after a model is\nlearned and generally model-agnostic. A common concern for this class of\nmethods is whether they accurately reflect the model. Hence, how these post-hoc\nmethods are evaluated is discussed throughout the paper.",

          "description": "Ensemble models in E-commerce combine predictions from multiple sub-models\nfor ranking and revenue improvement. Industrial ensemble models are typically\ndeep neural networks, following the supervised learning paradigm to infer\nconversion rate given inputs from sub-models. However, this process has the\nfollowing two problems. Firstly, the point-wise scoring approach disregards the\nrelationships between items and leads to homogeneous displayed results, while\ndiversified display benefits user experience and revenue. Secondly, the\nlearning paradigm focuses on the ranking metrics and does not directly optimize\nthe revenue. In our work, we propose a new Learning-To-Ensemble (LTE) framework\nRAEGO, which replaces the ensemble model with a contextual Rank Aggregator (RA)\nand explores the best weights of sub-models by the Evaluator-Generator\nOptimization (EGO). To achieve the best online performance, we propose a new\nrank aggregation algorithm TournamentGreedy as a refinement of classic rank\naggregators, which also produces the best average weighted Kendall Tau Distance\n(KTD) amongst all the considered algorithms with quadratic time complexity.\nUnder the assumption that the best output list should be Pareto Optimal on the\nKTD metric for sub-models, we show that our RA algorithm has higher efficiency\nand coverage in exploring the optimal weights. Combined with the idea of\nBayesian Optimization and gradient descent, we solve the online contextual\nBlack-Box Optimization task that finds the optimal weights for sub-models given\na chosen RA model. RA-EGO has been deployed in our online system and has\nimproved the revenue significantly.",

This paper proposes to present to the power systems\nforecasting practitioners a recent deep learning technique, the normalizing\nflows, to produce accurate scenario-based probabilistic forecasts that are\ncrucial to face the new challenges in power systems applications. The strength\nof this technique is to directly learn the stochastic multivariate distribution\nof the underlying process by maximizing the likelihood. Through comprehensive\nempirical evaluations using the open data of the Global Energy Forecasting\nCompetition 2014, we demonstrate that this methodology is competitive with\nother state-of-the-art deep learning generative models: generative adversarial\nnetworks and variational autoencoders. The models producing weather-based wind,\nsolar power, and load scenarios are properly compared both in terms of forecast\nvalue, by considering the case study of an energy retailer, and quality using\nseveral complementary metrics. The numerical experiments are simple and easily\nreproducible. Thus, we hope it will encourage other forecasting practitioners\nto test and use normalizing flows in power system applications such as bidding\non electricity markets, scheduling of power systems with high renewable energy\nsources penetration, energy management of virtual power plan or microgrids, and\nunit commitment.",

Current efforts to\nimprove the robustness of neural networks against adversarial examples are\nfocused on developing robust training methods, which update the weights of a\nneural network in a more robust direction. In this work, we take a step beyond\ntraining of the weight parameters and consider the problem of designing an\nadversarially robust neural architecture with high intrinsic robustness. We\npropose AdvRush, a novel adversarial robustness-aware neural architecture\nsearch algorithm, based upon a finding that independent of the training method,\nthe intrinsic robustness of a neural network can be represented with the\nsmoothness of its input loss landscape. Through a regularizer that favors a\ncandidate architecture with a smoother input loss landscape, AdvRush\nsuccessfully discovers an adversarially robust neural architecture. Along with\na comprehensive theoretical motivation for AdvRush, we conduct an extensive\namount of experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of AdvRush on various\nbenchmark datasets. Notably, on CIFAR-10, AdvRush achieves 55.91% robust\naccuracy under FGSM attack after standard training and 50.04% robust accuracy\nunder AutoAttack after 7-step PGD adversarial training.",

          "description": "Separating and labeling each instance of a nucleus (instance-aware\nsegmentation) is the key challenge in segmenting single cell nuclei on\nfluorescence microscopy images. Deep Neural Networks can learn the implicit\ntransformation of a nuclear image into a probability map indicating the class\nmembership of each pixel (nucleus or background), but the use of\npost-processing steps to turn the probability map into a labeled object mask is\nerror-prone. This especially accounts for nuclear images of tissue sections and\nnuclear images across varying tissue preparations. In this work, we aim to\nevaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to\nsegment nuclei in fluorescence images of various tissue origins and sample\npreparation types without post-processing. We compare architectures that\noperate on pixel to pixel translation and an architecture that operates on\nobject detection and subsequent locally applied segmentation. In addition, we\npropose a novel strategy to create artificial images to extend the training\nset. We evaluate the influence of ground truth annotation quality, image scale\nand segmentation complexity on segmentation performance. Results show that\nthree out of four deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net with ResNet34\nbackbone, Mask R-CNN) can segment fluorescent nuclear images on most of the\nsample preparation types and tissue origins with satisfactory segmentation\nperformance. Mask R-CNN, an architecture designed to address instance aware\nsegmentation tasks, outperforms other architectures. Equal nuclear mean size,\nconsistent nuclear annotations and the use of artificially generated images\nresult in overall acceptable precision and recall across different tissues and\nsample preparation types.",

This horizontal collaboration opens another attack\nsurface to the CNN-based application, like inserting the hardware Trojans (HT)\ninto the embedded accelerators designed for the CNN. Therefore, there is a dire\nneed to explore this attack surface for designing secure embedded hardware\naccelerators for CNNs.

          "description": "Studying the implicit regularization effect of the nonlinear training\ndynamics of neural networks (NNs) is important for understanding why\nover-parameterized neural networks often generalize well on real dataset.\nEmpirically, for two-layer NN, existing works have shown that input weights of\nhidden neurons (the input weight of a hidden neuron consists of the weight from\nits input layer to the hidden neuron and its bias term) condense on isolated\norientations with a small initialization. The condensation dynamics implies\nthat NNs can learn features from the training data with a network configuration\neffectively equivalent to a much smaller network during the training. In this\nwork, we show that the multiple roots of activation function at origin\n(referred as ``multiplicity'') is a key factor for understanding the\ncondensation at the initial stage of training. Our experiments of multilayer\nnetworks suggest that the maximal number of condensed orientations is twice the\nmultiplicity of the activation function used. Our theoretical analysis of\ntwo-layer networks confirms experiments for two cases, one is for the\nactivation function of multiplicity one, which contains many common activation\nfunctions, and the other is for the one-dimensional input. This work makes a\nstep towards understanding how small initialization implicitly leads NNs to\ncondensation at initial training stage, which lays a foundation for the future\nstudy of the nonlinear dynamics of NNs and its implicit regularization effect\nat a later stage of training.",

          "description": "In real applications, different computation-resource devices need\ndifferent-depth networks (e.g., ResNet-18/34/50) with high-accuracy. Usually,\nexisting methods either design multiple networks and train them independently,\nor construct depth-level/width-level dynamic neural networks which is hard to\nprove the accuracy of each sub-net. In this article, we propose an elegant\nDepth-Level Dynamic Neural Network (DDNN) integrated different-depth sub-nets\nof similar architectures. To improve the generalization of sub-nets, we design\nthe Embedded-Knowledge-Distillation (EKD) training mechanism for the DDNN to\nimplement knowledge transfer from the teacher (full-net) to multiple students\n(sub-nets). Specifically, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is introduced to\nconstrain the posterior class probability consistency between full-net and\nsub-nets, and self-attention distillation on the same resolution feature of\ndifferent depth is addressed to drive more abundant feature representations of\nsub-nets. Thus, we can obtain multiple high-accuracy sub-nets simultaneously in\na DDNN via the online knowledge distillation in each training iteration without\nextra computation cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet\ndatasets demonstrate that sub-nets in DDNN with EKD training achieve better\nperformance than individually training networks while preserving the original\nperformance of full-nets.",

          "description": "Given the increasing promise of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in real-world\napplications, several methods have been developed for explaining their\npredictions. So far, these methods have primarily focused on generating\nsubgraphs that are especially relevant for a particular prediction. However,\nsuch methods do not provide a clear opportunity for recourse: given a\nprediction, we want to understand how the prediction can be changed in order to\nachieve a more desirable outcome. In this work, we propose a method for\ngenerating counterfactual (CF) explanations for GNNs: the minimal perturbation\nto the input (graph) data such that the prediction changes. Using only edge\ndeletions, we find that our method, CF-GNNExplainer can generate CF\nexplanations for the majority of instances across three widely used datasets\nfor GNN explanations, while removing less than 3 edges on average, with at\nleast 94\\% accuracy. This indicates that CF-GNNExplainer primarily removes\nedges that are crucial for the original predictions, resulting in minimal CF\nexplanations.",

          "description": "In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous\ndriving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may\ncompromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have\ndemonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in\ndetection precision of deep learning-based 3D object detection models. Although\ndriving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no\ncomprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning\nmodels and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial\nattacks, perturbation attacks and patch attacks, on the driving safety of\nvision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep\nlearning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in\nvision-based 3D object detection, Stereo R-CNN and DSGN. To evaluate driving\nsafety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving\nsafety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive\nevaluation experiments, we find that (1) the attack's impact on the driving\nsafety of autonomous vehicles and the attack's impact on the precision of 3D\nobject detectors are decoupled, and (2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger\nrobustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we\nfurther investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study.\nThe findings of this paper provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial\nattacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.",

          "description": "Recent research has shown that non-additive image steganographic frameworks\neffectively improve security performance through adjusting distortion\ndistribution. However, as far as we know, all of the existing non-additive\nproposals are based on handcrafted policies, and can only be applied to a\nspecific image domain, which heavily prevent non-additive steganography from\nreleasing its full potentiality. In this paper, we propose an automatic\nnon-additive steganographic distortion learning framework called MCTSteg to\nremove the above restrictions. Guided by the reinforcement learning paradigm,\nwe combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and steganalyzer-based environmental\nmodel to build MCTSteg. MCTS makes sequential decisions to adjust distortion\ndistribution without human intervention. Our proposed environmental model is\nused to obtain feedbacks from each decision. Due to its self-learning\ncharacteristic and domain-independent reward function, MCTSteg has become the\nfirst reported universal non-additive steganographic framework which can work\nin both spatial and JPEG domains. Extensive experimental results show that\nMCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted\nfeature-based and deep-learning-based steganalyzers. In both spatial and JPEG\ndomains, the security performance of MCTSteg steadily outperforms the state of\nthe art by a clear margin under different scenarios.",

In this paper, we propose a novel regularization\nframework for estimating average treatment effects that exploits\nunconfoundedness. To this end, we formalize unconfoundedness as an\northogonality constraint, which ensures that the outcomes are orthogonal to the\ntreatment assignment.

This way, the semantics of the\nactivities referenced by the events in a trace are neglected, potentially\nleading to transformations in which events of unrelated activities are merged.\nTo avoid this and incorporate the semantics of activities during anonymization,\nwe propose to instead incorporate a distance measure based on feature learning.\nSpecifically, we show how embeddings of events enable the definition of a\ndistance measure for traces to guide event log anonymization.

Our approach assumes\nthat the state space is partitioned, and the subtasks consist in moving between\nthe partitions. We represent value functions on several levels of abstraction,\nand use the compositionality of subtasks to estimate the optimal values of the\nstates in each partition. The policy is implicitly defined on these optimal\nvalue estimates, rather than being decomposed among the subtasks. As a\nconsequence, our approach can learn the globally optimal policy, and does not\nsuffer from the non-stationarity of high-level decisions. If several partitions\nhave equivalent dynamics, the subtasks of those partitions can be shared. If\nthe set of boundary states is smaller than the entire state space, our approach\ncan have significantly smaller sample complexity than that of a flat learner,\nand we validate this empirically in several experiments.",

          "description": "Compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have witnessed exceptional\nimprovements in performance in recent years. However, they still fail to\nprovide the same predictive power as CNNs with a large number of parameters.\nThe diverse and even abundant features captured by the layers is an important\ncharacteristic of these successful CNNs. However, differences in this\ncharacteristic between large CNNs and their compact counterparts have rarely\nbeen investigated. In compact CNNs, due to the limited number of parameters,\nabundant features are unlikely to be obtained, and feature diversity becomes an\nessential characteristic. Diverse features present in the activation maps\nderived from a data point during model inference may indicate the presence of a\nset of unique descriptors necessary to distinguish between objects of different\nclasses. In contrast, data points with low feature diversity may not provide a\nsufficient amount of unique descriptors to make a valid prediction; we refer to\nthem as random predictions. Random predictions can negatively impact the\noptimization process and harm the final performance. This paper proposes\naddressing the problem raised by random predictions by reshaping the standard\ncross-entropy to make it biased toward data points with a limited number of\nunique descriptive features. Our novel Bias Loss focuses the training on a set\nof valuable data points and prevents the vast number of samples with poor\nlearning features from misleading the optimization process. Furthermore, to\nshow the importance of diversity, we present a family of SkipNet models whose\narchitectures are brought to boost the number of unique descriptors in the last\nlayers. Our Skipnet-M can achieve 1% higher classification accuracy than\nMobileNetV3 Large.",

          "description": "Multimodal IR, spanning text corpus, knowledge graph and images, called\noutside knowledge visual question answering (OKVQA), is of much recent\ninterest. However, the popular data set has serious limitations. A surprisingly\nlarge fraction of queries do not assess the ability to integrate cross-modal\ninformation. Instead, some are independent of the image, some depend on\nspeculation, some require OCR or are otherwise answerable from the image alone.\nTo add to the above limitations, frequency-based guessing is very effective\nbecause of (unintended) widespread answer overlaps between the train and test\nfolds. Overall, it is hard to determine when state-of-the-art systems exploit\nthese weaknesses rather than really infer the answers, because they are opaque\nand their 'reasoning' process is uninterpretable. An equally important\nlimitation is that the dataset is designed for the quantitative assessment only\nof the end-to-end answer retrieval task, with no provision for assessing the\ncorrect(semantic) interpretation of the input query. In response, we identify a\nkey structural idiom in OKVQA ,viz., S3 (select, substitute and search), and\nbuild a new data set and challenge around it. Specifically, the questioner\nidentifies an entity in the image and asks a question involving that entity\nwhich can be answered only by consulting a knowledge graph or corpus passage\nmentioning the entity. Our challenge consists of (i)OKVQAS3, a subset of OKVQA\nannotated based on the structural idiom and (ii)S3VQA, a new dataset built from\nscratch. We also present a neural but structurally transparent OKVQA system,\nS3, that explicitly addresses our challenge dataset, and outperforms recent\ncompetitive baselines.",

          "description": "One intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their inherent\nvulnerability to backdoor attacks -- a trojan model responds to\ntrigger-embedded inputs in a highly predictable manner while functioning\nnormally otherwise. Despite the plethora of prior work on DNNs for continuous\ndata (e.g., images), the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) for\ndiscrete-structured data (e.g., graphs) is largely unexplored, which is highly\nconcerning given their increasing use in security-sensitive domains. To bridge\nthis gap, we present GTA, the first backdoor attack on GNNs. Compared with\nprior work, GTA departs in significant ways: graph-oriented -- it defines\ntriggers as specific subgraphs, including both topological structures and\ndescriptive features, entailing a large design spectrum for the adversary;\ninput-tailored -- it dynamically adapts triggers to individual graphs, thereby\noptimizing both attack effectiveness and evasiveness; downstream model-agnostic\n-- it can be readily launched without knowledge regarding downstream models or\nfine-tuning strategies; and attack-extensible -- it can be instantiated for\nboth transductive (e.g., node classification) and inductive (e.g., graph\nclassification) tasks, constituting severe threats for a range of\nsecurity-critical applications. Through extensive evaluation using benchmark\ndatasets and state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GTA.\nWe further provide analytical justification for its effectiveness and discuss\npotential countermeasures, pointing to several promising research directions.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have gained momentum based on their accuracy, but their\ninterpretability is often criticised. As a result, they are labelled as black\nboxes. In response, several methods have been proposed in the literature to\nexplain their predictions. Among the explanatory methods, Shapley values is a\nfeature attribution method favoured for its robust theoretical foundation.\nHowever, the analysis of feature attributions using Shapley values requires\nchoosing a baseline that represents the concept of missingness. An arbitrary\nchoice of baseline could negatively impact the explanatory power of the method\nand possibly lead to incorrect interpretations. In this paper, we present a\nmethod for choosing a baseline according to a neutrality value: as a parameter\nselected by decision-makers, the point at which their choices are determined by\nthe model predictions being either above or below it. Hence, the proposed\nbaseline is set based on a parameter that depends on the actual use of the\nmodel. This procedure stands in contrast to how other baselines are set, i.e.\nwithout accounting for how the model is used. We empirically validate our\nchoice of baseline in the context of binary classification tasks, using two\ndatasets: a synthetic dataset and a dataset derived from the financial domain.",

          "description": "Development of deep learning systems for biomedical segmentation often\nrequires access to expert-driven, manually annotated datasets. If more than a\nsingle expert is involved in the annotation of the same images, then the\ninter-expert agreement is not necessarily perfect, and no single expert\nannotation can precisely capture the so-called ground truth of the regions of\ninterest on all images. Also, it is not trivial to generate a reference\nestimate using annotations from multiple experts. Here we present a deep neural\nnetwork, defined as U-Net-and-a-half, which can simultaneously learn from\nannotations performed by multiple experts on the same set of images.\nU-Net-and-a-half contains a convolutional encoder to generate features from the\ninput images, multiple decoders that allow simultaneous learning from image\nmasks obtained from annotations that were independently generated by multiple\nexperts, and a shared low-dimensional feature space. To demonstrate the\napplicability of our framework, we used two distinct datasets from digital\npathology and radiology, respectively. Specifically, we trained two separate\nmodels using pathologist-driven annotations of glomeruli on whole slide images\nof human kidney biopsies (10 patients), and radiologist-driven annotations of\nlumen cross-sections of human arteriovenous fistulae obtained from\nintravascular ultrasound images (10 patients), respectively. The models based\non U-Net-and-a-half exceeded the performance of the traditional U-Net models\ntrained on single expert annotations alone, thus expanding the scope of\nmultitask learning in the context of biomedical image segmentation.",

          "description": "With the increasing demands of personalized learning, knowledge tracing has\nbecome important which traces students' knowledge states based on their\nhistorical practices. Factor analysis methods mainly use two kinds of factors\nwhich are separately related to students and questions to model students'\nknowledge states. These methods use the total number of attempts of students to\nmodel students' learning progress and hardly highlight the impact of the most\nrecent relevant practices. Besides, current factor analysis methods ignore rich\ninformation contained in questions. In this paper, we propose Multi-Factors\nAware Dual-Attentional model (MF-DAKT) which enriches question representations\nand utilizes multiple factors to model students' learning progress based on a\ndual-attentional mechanism. More specifically, we propose a novel\nstudent-related factor which records the most recent attempts on relevant\nconcepts of students to highlight the impact of recent exercises. To enrich\nquestions representations, we use a pre-training method to incorporate two\nkinds of question information including questions' relation and difficulty\nlevel. We also add a regularization term about questions' difficulty level to\nrestrict pre-trained question representations to fine-tuning during the process\nof predicting students' performance. Moreover, we apply a dual-attentional\nmechanism to differentiate contributions of factors and factor interactions to\nfinal prediction in different practice records. At last, we conduct experiments\non several real-world datasets and results show that MF-DAKT can outperform\nexisting knowledge tracing methods. We also conduct several studies to validate\nthe effects of each component of MF-DAKT.",

We\npropose a new federated learning algorithm, FedPAGE, able to further reduce the\ncommunication complexity by utilizing the recent optimal PAGE method (Li et\nal., 2021) instead of plain SGD in FedAvg. We show that FedPAGE uses much fewer\ncommunication rounds than previous local methods for both federated convex and\nnonconvex optimization. Concretely, 1) in the convex setting, the number of\ncommunication rounds of FedPAGE is $O(\\frac{N^{3/4}}{S\\epsilon})$, improving\nthe best-known result $O(\\frac{N}{S\\epsilon})$ of SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et\nal.,2020) by a factor of $N^{1/4}$, where $N$ is the total number of clients\n(usually is very large in federated learning), $S$ is the sampled subset of\nclients in each communication round, and $\\epsilon$ is the target error; 2) in\nthe nonconvex setting, the number of communication rounds of FedPAGE is\n$O(\\frac{\\sqrt{N}+S}{S\\epsilon^2})$, improving the best-known result\n$O(\\frac{N^{2/3}}{S^{2/3}\\epsilon^2})$ of SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al.,2020) by\na factor of $N^{1/6}S^{1/3}$, if the sampled clients $S\\leq \\sqrt{N}$. Note\nthat in both settings, the communication cost for each round is the same for\nboth FedPAGE and SCAFFOLD.

We show how Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) are able to learn about the context and patterns of signal and noise,\nleading to improvements in the performance of classification methods. We\nconstruct a model whereby two classes of objects follow an underlying Gaussian\ndistribution, and where the features (the input data) have varying, but known,\nlevels of noise. This model mimics the nature of scientific data sets, where\nthe noises arise as realizations of some random processes whose underlying\ndistributions are known. The classification of these objects can then be\nperformed using standard statistical techniques (e.g., least-squares\nminimization or Markov-Chain Monte Carlo), as well as ML techniques. This\nallows us to take advantage of a maximum likelihood approach to object\nclassification, and to measure the amount by which the ML methods are\nincorporating the information in the input data uncertainties. We show that,\nwhen each data point is subject to different levels of noise (i.e., noises with\ndifferent distribution functions), that information can be learned by the CNNs,\nraising the ML performance to at least the same level of the least-squares\nmethod -- and sometimes even surpassing it. Furthermore, we show that, with\nvarying noise levels, the confidence of the ML classifiers serves as a proxy\nfor the underlying cumulative distribution function, but only if the\ninformation about specific input data uncertainties is provided to the CNNs.",

          "description": "Recently, deep neural networks have expanded the state-of-art in various\nscientific fields and provided solutions to long standing problems across\nmultiple application domains. Nevertheless, they also suffer from weaknesses\nsince their optimal performance depends on massive amounts of training data and\nthe tuning of an extended number of parameters. As a countermeasure, some\ndeep-forest methods have been recently proposed, as efficient and low-scale\nsolutions. Despite that, these approaches simply employ label classification\nprobabilities as induced features and primarily focus on traditional\nclassification and regression tasks, leaving multi-output prediction\nunder-explored. Moreover, recent work has demonstrated that tree-embeddings are\nhighly representative, especially in structured output prediction.

          "description": "In supervised learning, training and test datasets are often sampled from\ndistinct distributions. Domain adaptation techniques are thus required.\nCovariate shift adaptation yields good generalization performance when domains\ndiffer only by the marginal distribution of features. Covariate shift\nadaptation is usually implemented using importance weighting, which may fail,\naccording to common wisdom, due to small effective sample sizes (ESS). Previous\nresearch argues this scenario is more common in high-dimensional settings.\nHowever, how effective sample size, dimensionality, and model\nperformance/generalization are formally related in supervised learning,\nconsidering the context of covariate shift adaptation, is still somewhat\nobscure in the literature. Thus, a main challenge is presenting a unified\ntheory connecting those points. Hence, in this paper, we focus on building a\nunified view connecting the ESS, data dimensionality, and generalization in the\ncontext of covariate shift adaptation. Moreover, we also demonstrate how\ndimensionality reduction or feature selection can increase the ESS, and argue\nthat our results support dimensionality reduction before covariate shift\nadaptation as a good practice.",

          "description": "Channel attention mechanisms have been commonly applied in many visual tasks\nfor effective performance improvement. It is able to reinforce the informative\nchannels as well as to suppress the useless channels. Recently, different\nchannel attention modules have been proposed and implemented in various ways.\nGenerally speaking, they are mainly based on convolution and pooling\noperations. In this paper, we propose Gaussian process embedded channel\nattention (GPCA) module and further interpret the channel attention schemes in\na probabilistic way. The GPCA module intends to model the correlations among\nthe channels, which are assumed to be captured by beta distributed variables.\nAs the beta distribution cannot be integrated into the end-to-end training of\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a mathematically tractable solution,\nwe utilize an approximation of the beta distribution to solve this problem. To\nspecify, we adapt a Sigmoid-Gaussian approximation, in which the Gaussian\ndistributed variables are transferred into the interval [0,1]. The Gaussian\nprocess is then utilized to model the correlations among different channels. In\nthis case, a mathematically tractable solution is derived. The GPCA module can\nbe efficiently implemented and integrated into the end-to-end training of the\nCNNs. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the\nproposed GPCA module.

          "description": "Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) recently emerged as a powerful paradigm\nfor recommendation based on implicit feedback collaborative filtering. However,\nstandard CML methods learn fixed user and item representations, which fails to\ncapture the complex interests of users. Existing extensions of CML also either\nignore the heterogeneity of user-item relations, i.e. that a user can\nsimultaneously like very different items, or the latent item-item relations,\ni.e. that a user's preference for an item depends, not only on its intrinsic\ncharacteristics, but also on items they previously interacted with. In this\npaper, we present a hierarchical CML model that jointly captures latent\nuser-item and item-item relations from implicit data. Our approach is inspired\nby translation mechanisms from knowledge graph embedding and leverages\nmemory-based attention networks. We empirically show the relevance of this\njoint relational modeling, by outperforming existing CML models on\nrecommendation tasks on several real-world datasets. Our experiments also\nemphasize the limits of current CML relational models on very sparse datasets.",

          "description": "Class imbalance is a substantial challenge in classifying many real-world\ncases. Synthetic over-sampling methods have been effective to improve the\nperformance of classifiers for imbalance problems. However, most synthetic\nover-sampling methods generate non-diverse synthetic instances within the\nconvex hull formed by the existing minority instances as they only concentrate\non the minority class and ignore the vast information provided by the majority\nclass. They also often do not perform well for extremely imbalanced data as the\nfewer the minority instances, the less information to generate synthetic\ninstances. Moreover, existing methods that generate synthetic instances using\nthe majority class distributional information cannot perform effectively when\nthe majority class has a multi-modal distribution. We propose a new method to\ngenerate diverse and adaptable synthetic instances using Synthetic\nOver-sampling with Minority and Majority classes (SOMM). SOMM generates\nsynthetic instances diversely within the minority data space. It updates the\ngenerated instances adaptively to the neighbourhood including both classes.\nThus, SOMM performs well for both binary and multiclass imbalance problems. We\nexamine the performance of SOMM for binary and multiclass problems using\nbenchmark data sets for different imbalance levels.

          "description": "The traditional Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) minimizes the\ntotal distance of the routes under the capacity constraints of the vehicles.\nBut more often, the objective involves multiple criteria including not only the\ntotal distance of the tour but also other factors such as travel costs, travel\ntime, and fuel consumption.Moreover, in reality, there are numerous implicit\npreferences ingrained in the minds of the route planners and the drivers.\nDrivers, for instance, have familiarity with certain neighborhoods and\nknowledge of the state of roads, and often consider the best places for rest\nand lunch breaks. This knowledge is difficult to formulate and balance when\noperational routing decisions have to be made. This motivates us to learn the\nimplicit preferences from past solutions and to incorporate these learned\npreferences in the optimization process. These preferences are in the form of\narc probabilities, i.e., the more preferred a route is, the higher is the joint\nprobability. The novelty of this work is the use of a neural network model to\nestimate the arc probabilities, which allows for additional features and\nautomatic parameter estimation. This first requires identifying suitable\nfeatures, neural architectures and loss functions, taking into account that\nthere is typically few data available.

          "description": "Machine learning for procedural content generation has recently become an\nactive area of research. Levels vary in both form and function and are mostly\nunrelated to each other across games. This has made it difficult to assemble\nsuitably large datasets to bring machine learning to level design in the same\nway as it's been used for image generation. Here we propose Generative Playing\nNetworks which design levels for itself to play. The algorithm is built in two\nparts; an agent that learns to play game levels, and a generator that learns\nthe distribution of playable levels. As the agent learns and improves its\nability, the space of playable levels, as defined by the agent, grows. The\ngenerator targets the agent's playability estimates to then update its\nunderstanding of what constitutes a playable level. We call this process of\nlearning the distribution of data found through self-discovery with an\nenvironment, self-supervised inductive learning. Unlike previous approaches to\nprocedural content generation, Generative Playing Networks are end-to-end\ndifferentiable and do not require human-designed examples or domain knowledge.\nWe demonstrate the capability of this framework by training an agent and level\ngenerator for a 2D dungeon crawler game.",

The overwhelming majority of the literature focuses on small graph\nproblems, while several real-world problems are devoted to large graphs. Here,\nwe focus on two such problems that are related: influence estimation, a\n\\#P-hard counting problem, and influence maximization, an NP-hard problem. We\ndevelop GLIE, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that inherently parameterizes an\nupper bound of influence estimation and train it on small simulated graphs.\nExperiments show that GLIE can provide accurate predictions faster than the\nalternatives for graphs 10 times larger than the train set. More importantly,\nit can be used on arbitrary large graphs for influence maximization, as the\npredictions can rank effectively seed sets even when the accuracy deteriorates.\nTo showcase this, we propose a version of a standard Influence Maximization\n(IM) algorithm where we substitute traditional influence estimation with the\npredictions of GLIE.We also transfer GLIE into a reinforcement learning model\nthat learns how to choose seeds to maximize influence sequentially using GLIE's\nhidden representations and predictions.

          "description": "While self-supervised monocular depth estimation in driving scenarios has\nachieved comparable performance to supervised approaches, violations of the\nstatic world assumption can still lead to erroneous depth predictions of\ntraffic participants, posing a potential safety issue. In this paper, we\npresent R4Dyn, a novel set of techniques to use cost-efficient radar data on\ntop of a self-supervised depth estimation framework. In particular, we show how\nradar can be used during training as weak supervision signal, as well as an\nextra input to enhance the estimation robustness at inference time. Since\nautomotive radars are readily available, this allows to collect training data\nfrom a variety of existing vehicles. Moreover, by filtering and expanding the\nsignal to make it compatible with learning-based approaches, we address radar\ninherent issues, such as noise and sparsity. With R4Dyn we are able to overcome\na major limitation of self-supervised depth estimation, i.e. the prediction of\ntraffic participants. We substantially improve the estimation on dynamic\nobjects, such as cars by 37% on the challenging nuScenes dataset, hence\ndemonstrating that radar is a valuable additional sensor for monocular depth\nestimation in autonomous vehicles. Additionally, we plan on making the code\npublicly available.",

          "description": "Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous systems which intend to operate\nin the real world. Single task vision networks extract information only based\non some aspects of the scene. In multi-task learning (MTL), on the other hand,\nthese single tasks are jointly learned, thereby providing an opportunity for\ntasks to share information and obtain a more comprehensive understanding. To\nthis end, we develop UniNet, a unified scene understanding network that\naccurately and efficiently infers vital vision tasks including object\ndetection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, monocular depth\nestimation, and monocular instance depth prediction. As these tasks look at\ndifferent semantic and geometric information, they can either complement or\nconflict with each other. Therefore, understanding inter-task relationships can\nprovide useful cues to enable complementary information sharing. We evaluate\nthe task relationships in UniNet through the lens of adversarial attacks based\non the notion that they can exploit learned biases and task interactions in the\nneural network. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset, using\nuntargeted and targeted attacks reveal that semantic tasks strongly interact\namongst themselves, and the same holds for geometric tasks. Additionally, we\nshow that the relationship between semantic and geometric tasks is asymmetric\nand their interaction becomes weaker as we move towards higher-level\nrepresentations.",

          "description": "The Oxford English Dictionary defines precision medicine as \"medical care\ndesigned to optimize efficiency or therapeutic benefit for particular groups of\npatients, especially by using genetic or molecular profiling.\" It is not an\nentirely new idea: physicians from ancient times have recognized that medical\ntreatment needs to consider individual variations in patient characteristics.\nHowever, the modern precision medicine movement has been enabled by a\nconfluence of events: scientific advances in fields such as genetics and\npharmacology, technological advances in mobile devices and wearable sensors,\nand methodological advances in computing and data sciences.\n\nThis chapter is about bandit algorithms: an area of data science of special\nrelevance to precision medicine. With their roots in the seminal work of\nBellman, Robbins, Lai and others, bandit algorithms have come to occupy a\ncentral place in modern data science ( Lattimore and Szepesvari, 2020). Bandit\nalgorithms can be used in any situation where treatment decisions need to be\nmade to optimize some health outcome. Since precision medicine focuses on the\nuse of patient characteristics to guide treatment, contextual bandit algorithms\nare especially useful since they are designed to take such information into\naccount. The role of bandit algorithms in areas of precision medicine such as\nmobile health and digital phenotyping has been reviewed before (Tewari and\nMurphy, 2017; Rabbi et al., 2019). Since these reviews were published, bandit\nalgorithms have continued to find uses in mobile health and several new topics\nhave emerged in the research on bandit algorithms. This chapter is written for\nquantitative researchers in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and\noperations research who might be interested in knowing more about the\nalgorithmic and mathematical details of bandit algorithms that have been used\nin mobile health.",

          "description": "Collaborative training of neural networks leverages distributed data by\nexchanging gradient information between different clients. Although training\ndata entirely resides with the clients, recent work shows that training data\ncan be reconstructed from such exchanged gradient information. To enhance\nprivacy, gradient perturbation techniques have been proposed. However, they\ncome at the cost of reduced model performance, increased convergence time, or\nincreased data demand. In this paper, we introduce PRECODE, a PRivacy EnhanCing\nmODulE that can be used as generic extension for arbitrary model architectures.\nWe propose a simple yet effective realization of PRECODE using variational\nmodeling. The stochastic sampling induced by variational modeling effectively\nprevents privacy leakage from gradients and in turn preserves privacy of data\nowners. We evaluate PRECODE using state of the art gradient inversion attacks\non two different model architectures trained on three datasets. In contrast to\ncommonly used defense mechanisms, we find that our proposed modification\nconsistently reduces the attack success rate to 0% while having almost no\nnegative impact on model training and final performance. As a result, PRECODE\nreveals a promising path towards privacy enhancing model extensions.",

For a broad class of least squares problem instances (that\nare natural in high-dimensional settings), we show: (1) for every problem\ninstance and for every ridge parameter, (unregularized) SGD, when provided with\nlogarithmically more samples than that provided to the ridge algorithm,\ngeneralizes no worse than the ridge solution (provided SGD uses a tuned\nconstant stepsize); (2) conversely, there exist instances (in this wide problem\nclass) where optimally-tuned ridge regression requires quadratically more\nsamples than SGD in order to have the same generalization performance. Taken\ntogether, our results show that, up to the logarithmic factors, the\ngeneralization performance of SGD is always no worse than that of ridge\nregression in a wide range of overparameterized problems, and, in fact, could\nbe much better for some problem instances.

          "description": "Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning framework designed for\ndata privacy preservation i.e., local data remain private throughout the entire\ntraining and testing procedure. Federated Learning is gaining popularity\nbecause it allows one to use machine learning techniques while preserving\nprivacy. However, it inherits the vulnerabilities and susceptibilities raised\nin deep learning techniques. For instance, Federated Learning is particularly\nvulnerable to data poisoning attacks that may deteriorate its performance and\nintegrity due to its distributed nature and inaccessibility to the raw data. In\naddition, it is extremely difficult to correctly identify malicious clients due\nto the non-Independently and/or Identically Distributed (non-IID) data. The\nreal-world data can be complex and diverse, making them hardly distinguishable\nfrom the malicious data without direct access to the raw data. Prior research\nhas focused on detecting malicious clients while treating only the clients\nhaving IID data as benign. In this study, we propose a method that detects and\nclassifies anomalous clients from benign clients when benign ones have non-IID\ndata. Our proposed method leverages feature dimension reduction, dynamic\nclustering, and cosine similarity-based clipping. The experimental results\nvalidates that our proposed method not only classifies the malicious clients\nbut also alleviates their negative influences from the entire procedure.

          "description": "Big Data are rapidly produced from various heterogeneous data sources. They\nare of different types (text, image, video or audio) and have different levels\nof reliability and completeness. One of the most interesting architectures that\ndeal with the large amount of emerging data at high velocity is called the\nlambda architecture. In fact, it combines two different processing layers\nnamely batch and speed layers, each providing specific views of data while\nensuring robustness, fast and scalable data processing. However, most papers\ndealing with the lambda architecture are focusing one single type of data\ngenerally produced by a single data source. Besides, the layers of the\narchitecture are implemented independently, or, at best, are combined to\nperform basic processing without assessing either the data reliability or\ncompleteness. Therefore, inspired by the lambda architecture, we propose in\nthis paper a generic multimodal architecture that combines both batch and\nstreaming processing in order to build a complete, global and accurate insight\nin near-real-time based on the knowledge extracted from multiple heterogeneous\nBig Data sources. Our architecture uses batch processing to analyze the data\nstructures and contents, build the learning models and calculate the\nreliability index of the involved sources, while the streaming processing uses\nthe built-in models of the batch layer to immediately process incoming data and\nrapidly provide results. We validate our architecture in the context of urban\ntraffic management systems in order to detect congestions.",

          "description": "Recent technology development brings the booming of numerous new\nDemand-Driven Services (DDS) into urban lives, including ridesharing, on-demand\ndelivery, express systems and warehousing. In DDS, a service loop is an\nelemental structure, including its service worker, the service providers and\ncorresponding service targets. The service workers should transport either\nhumans or parcels from the providers to the target locations. Various planning\ntasks within DDS can thus be classified into two individual stages: 1)\nDispatching, which is to form service loops from demand/supply distributions,\nand 2)Routing, which is to decide specific serving orders within the\nconstructed loops. Generating high-quality strategies in both stages is\nimportant to develop DDS but faces several challenging. Meanwhile, deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) has been developed rapidly in recent years. It is\na powerful tool to solve these problems since DRL can learn a parametric model\nwithout relying on too many problem-based assumptions and optimize long-term\neffect by learning sequential decisions. In this survey, we first define DDS,\nthen highlight common applications and important decision/control problems\nwithin. For each problem, we comprehensively introduce the existing DRL\nsolutions, and further summarize them in\n\\textit{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/DDS\\_Survey}. We also introduce\nopen simulation environments for development and evaluation of DDS\napplications. Finally, we analyze remaining challenges and discuss further\nresearch opportunities in DRL solutions for DDS.",

          "description": "Differentiable Neural Architecture Search is one of the most popular Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS) methods for its search efficiency and simplicity,\naccomplished by jointly optimizing the model weight and architecture parameters\nin a weight-sharing supernet via gradient-based algorithms. At the end of the\nsearch phase, the operations with the largest architecture parameters will be\nselected to form the final architecture, with the implicit assumption that the\nvalues of architecture parameters reflect the operation strength. While much\nhas been discussed about the supernet's optimization, the architecture\nselection process has received little attention. We provide empirical and\ntheoretical analysis to show that the magnitude of architecture parameters does\nnot necessarily indicate how much the operation contributes to the supernet's\nperformance. We propose an alternative perturbation-based architecture\nselection that directly measures each operation's influence on the supernet. We\nre-evaluate several differentiable NAS methods with the proposed architecture\nselection and find that it is able to extract significantly improved\narchitectures from the underlying supernets consistently. Furthermore, we find\nthat several failure modes of DARTS can be greatly alleviated with the proposed\nselection method, indicating that much of the poor generalization observed in\nDARTS can be attributed to the failure of magnitude-based architecture\nselection rather than entirely the optimization of its supernet.",

          "description": "Several decades ago the Proximal Point Algorithm (PPA) started to gain much\nattraction for both abstract operator theory and the numerical optimization\ncommunities. Even in modern applications, researchers still use proximal\nminimization theory to design scalable algorithms that overcome nonsmoothness\nin high dimensional models. Several remarkable references as\n\\cite{Fer:91,Ber:82constrained,Ber:89parallel,Tom:11} analyzed the tight local\nrelations between the convergence rate of PPA and the regularity of the\nobjective function. However, without taking into account the concrete\ncomputational effort paid for computing each PPA iteration, any iteration\ncomplexity remains abstract and purely informative. In this manuscript we aim\nto evaluate the computational complexity of practical PPA in terms of\n(proximal) gradient/subgradient iterations, which might allow a fair\npositioning of the famous PPA numerical performance in the class of first order\nmethods. First, we derive nonasymptotic iteration complexity estimates of exact\nand inexact PPA to minimize convex functions under $\\gamma-$Holderian growth:\n$\\BigO{\\log(1/\\epsilon)}$ (for $\\gamma \\in [1,2]$) and\n$\\BigO{1/\\epsilon^{\\gamma - 2}}$ (for $\\gamma > 2$). In particular, we recover\nwell-known results on exact PPA: finite convergence for sharp minima and linear\nconvergence for quadratic growth, even under presence of inexactness. Second,\nassuming that an usual (proximal) gradient/subgradient method subroutine is\nemployed to compute inexact PPA iteration, we show novel computational\ncomplexity bounds on a restarted variant of the inexact PPA, available when no\ninformation on the growth of the objective function is known. In the numerical\nexperiments we confirm the practical performance and implementability of our\nschemes.",

          "description": "Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging modality that can be conveniently used\nto classify suspicious breast nodules and potentially detect the onset of\nbreast cancer. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) techniques have\nshown promising results in classifying ultrasound images of the breast into\nbenign or malignant. However, CNN inference acts as a black-box model, and as\nsuch, its decision-making is not interpretable. Therefore, increasing effort\nhas been dedicated to explaining this process, most notably through GRAD-CAM\nand other techniques that provide visual explanations into inner workings of\nCNNs. In addition to interpretation, these methods provide clinically important\ninformation, such as identifying the location for biopsy or treatment. In this\nwork, we analyze how adversarial assaults that are practically undetectable may\nbe devised to alter these importance maps dramatically. Furthermore, we will\nshow that this change in the importance maps can come with or without altering\nthe classification result, rendering them even harder to detect. As such, care\nmust be taken when using these importance maps to shed light on the inner\nworkings of deep learning.

          "description": "We study the problem of knowledge tracing (KT) where the goal is to trace the\nstudents' knowledge mastery over time so as to make predictions on their future\nperformance. Owing to the good representation capacity of deep neural networks\n(DNNs), recent advances on KT have increasingly concentrated on exploring DNNs\nto improve the performance of KT. However, we empirically reveal that the DNNs\nbased KT models may run the risk of overfitting, especially on small datasets,\nleading to limited generalization. In this paper, by leveraging the current\nadvances in adversarial training (AT), we propose an efficient AT based KT\nmethod (ATKT) to enhance KT model's generalization and thus push the limit of\nKT. Specifically, we first construct adversarial perturbations and add them on\nthe original interaction embeddings as adversarial examples. The original and\nadversarial examples are further used to jointly train the KT model, forcing it\nis not only to be robust to the adversarial examples, but also to enhance the\ngeneralization over the original ones. To better implement AT, we then present\nan efficient attentive-LSTM model as KT backbone, where the key is a proposed\nknowledge hidden state attention module that adaptively aggregates information\nfrom previous knowledge hidden states while simultaneously highlighting the\nimportance of current knowledge hidden state to make a more accurate\nprediction. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our ATKT achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

          "description": "Radio-frequency fingerprints~(RFFs) are promising solutions for realizing\nlow-cost physical layer authentication. Machine learning-based methods have\nbeen proposed for RFF extraction and discrimination. However, most existing\nmethods are designed for the closed-set scenario where the set of devices is\nremains unchanged. These methods can not be generalized to the RFF\ndiscrimination of unknown devices. To enable the discrimination of RFF from\nboth known and unknown devices, we propose a new end-to-end deep learning\nframework for extracting RFFs from raw received signals. The proposed framework\ncomprises a novel preprocessing module, called neural synchronization~(NS),\nwhich incorporates the data-driven learning with signal processing priors as an\ninductive bias from communication-model based processing. Compared to\ntraditional carrier synchronization techniques, which are static, this module\nestimates offsets by two learnable deep neural networks jointly trained by the\nRFF extractor. Additionally, a hypersphere representation is proposed to\nfurther improve the discrimination of RFF. Theoretical analysis shows that such\na data-and-model framework can better optimize the mutual information between\ndevice identity and the RFF, which naturally leads to better performance.\nExperimental results verify that the proposed RFF significantly outperforms\npurely data-driven DNN-design and existing handcrafted RFF methods in terms of\nboth discrimination and network generalizability.",

The unsupervised open domain\nadaption for generating realistic photos from a hand-drawn sketch is\nchallenging as there is no such sketch of that class for training data. The\nabsence of learning supervision and the huge domain gap between both the\nfreehand drawing and picture domains make it hard. We present an approach that\nlearns both sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation to synthesise the\nmissing freehand drawings from pictures.

To address this problem, we offer a simple but effective open-domain\nsampling and optimization method that tricks the generator into considering\nfalse drawings as genuine.

          "description": "Explanation of AI, as well as fairness of algorithms' decisions and the\ntransparency of the decision model, are becoming more and more important. And\nit is crucial to design effective and human-friendly techniques when opening\nthe black-box model. Counterfactual conforms to the human way of thinking and\nprovides a human-friendly explanation, and its corresponding explanation\nalgorithm refers to a strategic alternation of a given data point so that its\nmodel output is \"counter-facted\", i.e. the prediction is reverted. In this\npaper, we adapt counterfactual explanation over fine-grained image\nclassification problem. We demonstrated an adaptive method that could give a\ncounterfactual explanation by showing the composed counterfactual feature map\nusing top-down layer searching algorithm (TDLS). We have proved that our TDLS\nalgorithm could provide more flexible counterfactual visual explanation in an\nefficient way using VGG-16 model on Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset. At the end,\nwe discussed several applicable scenarios of counterfactual visual\nexplanations.",

          "description": "Koopman operator theory shows how nonlinear dynamical systems can be\nrepresented as an infinite-dimensional, linear operator acting on a Hilbert\nspace of observables of the system. However, determining the relevant modes and\neigenvalues of this infinite-dimensional operator can be difficult. The\nextended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is one such method for generating\napproximations to Koopman spectra and modes, but the EDMD method faces its own\nset of challenges due to the need of user defined observables. To address this\nissue, we explore the use of convolutional autoencoder networks to\nsimultaneously find optimal families of observables which also generate both\naccurate embeddings of the flow into a space of observables and immersions of\nthe observables back into flow coordinates. This network results in a global\ntransformation of the flow and affords future state prediction via EDMD and the\ndecoder network.

Since its statistical properties change over time, its\ndistribution also changes temporally, which will cause severe distribution\nshift problem to existing methods. However, it remains unexplored to model the\ntime series in the distribution perspective. In this paper, we term this as\nTemporal Covariate Shift (TCS). This paper proposes Adaptive RNNs (AdaRNN) to\ntackle the TCS problem by building an adaptive model that generalizes well on\nthe unseen test data. AdaRNN is sequentially composed of two novel algorithms.\nFirst, we propose Temporal Distribution Characterization to better characterize\nthe distribution information in the TS. Second, we propose Temporal\nDistribution Matching to reduce the distribution mismatch in TS to learn the\nadaptive TS model. AdaRNN is a general framework with flexible distribution\ndistances integrated. Experiments on human activity recognition, air quality\nprediction, and financial analysis show that AdaRNN outperforms the latest\nmethods by a classification accuracy of 2.6% and significantly reduces the RMSE\nby 9.0%.

To address the\naforementioned problems, we propose a novel multi-granular spatio-temporal\ngraph network for skeleton-based action classification that jointly models the\ncoarse- and fine-grained skeleton motion patterns. To this end, we develop a\ndual-head graph network consisting of two interleaved branches, which enables\nus to extract features at two spatio-temporal resolutions in an effective and\nefficient manner.

          "description": "The CP decomposition for high dimensional non-orthogonal spike tensors is an\nimportant problem with broad applications across many disciplines. However,\nprevious works with theoretical guarantee typically assume restrictive\nincoherence conditions on the basis vectors for the CP components. In this\npaper, we propose new computationally efficient composite PCA and concurrent\northogonalization algorithms for tensor CP decomposition with theoretical\nguarantees under mild incoherence conditions. The composite PCA applies the\nprincipal component or singular value decompositions twice, first to a matrix\nunfolding of the tensor data to obtain singular vectors and then to the matrix\nfolding of the singular vectors obtained in the first step. It can be used as\nan initialization for any iterative optimization schemes for the tensor CP\ndecomposition. The concurrent orthogonalization algorithm iteratively estimates\nthe basis vector in each mode of the tensor by simultaneously applying\nprojections to the orthogonal complements of the spaces generated by others CP\ncomponents in other modes. It is designed to improve the alternating least\nsquares estimator and other forms of the high order orthogonal iteration for\ntensors with low or moderately high CP ranks. Our theoretical investigation\nprovides estimation accuracy and statistical convergence rates for the two\nproposed algorithms.

Usually, a well-performing ML model, especially, emerging\ndeep neural network model, relies on a large volume of training data and\nhigh-powered computational resources. The need for a vast volume of available\ndata raises serious privacy concerns because of the risk of leakage of highly\nprivacy-sensitive information and the evolving regulatory environments that\nincreasingly restrict access to and use of privacy-sensitive data. Furthermore,\na trained ML model may also be vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as\nmembership/property inference attacks and model inversion attacks. Hence,\nwell-designed privacy-preserving ML (PPML) solutions are crucial and have\nattracted increasing research interest from academia and industry. More and\nmore efforts of PPML are proposed via integrating privacy-preserving techniques\ninto ML algorithms, fusing privacy-preserving approaches into ML pipeline, or\ndesigning various privacy-preserving architectures for existing ML systems. In\nparticular, existing PPML arts cross-cut ML, system, security, and privacy;\nhence, there is a critical need to understand state-of-art studies, related\nchallenges, and a roadmap for future research. This paper systematically\nreviews and summarizes existing privacy-preserving approaches and proposes a\nPGU model to guide evaluation for various PPML solutions through elaborately\ndecomposing their privacy-preserving functionalities.

          "description": "The performance of many medical image analysis tasks are strongly associated\nwith image data quality. When developing modern deep learning algorithms,\nrather than relying on subjective (human-based) image quality assessment (IQA),\ntask amenability potentially provides an objective measure of task-specific\nimage quality. To predict task amenability, an IQA agent is trained using\nreinforcement learning (RL) with a simultaneously optimised task predictor,\nsuch as a classification or segmentation neural network. In this work, we\ndevelop transfer learning or adaptation strategies to increase the adaptability\nof both the IQA agent and the task predictor so that they are less dependent on\nhigh-quality, expert-labelled training data. The proposed transfer learning\nstrategy re-formulates the original RL problem for task amenability in a\nmeta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework. The resulting algorithm\nfacilitates efficient adaptation of the agent to different definitions of image\nquality, each with its own Markov decision process environment including\ndifferent images, labels and an adaptable task predictor. Our work demonstrates\nthat the IQA agents pre-trained on non-expert task labels can be adapted to\npredict task amenability as defined by expert task labels, using only a small\nset of expert labels. Using 6644 clinical ultrasound images from 249 prostate\ncancer patients, our results for image classification and segmentation tasks\nshow that the proposed IQA method can be adapted using data with as few as\nrespective 19.7% and 29.6% expert-reviewed consensus labels and still achieve\ncomparable IQA and task performance, which would otherwise require a training\ndataset with 100% expert labels.",

          "description": "For the past ten years, CNN has reigned supreme in the world of computer\nvision, but recently, Transformer is on the rise. However, the quadratic\ncomputational cost of self-attention has become a severe problem of practice.\nThere has been much research on architectures without CNN and self-attention in\nthis context. In particular, MLP-Mixer is a simple idea designed using MLPs and\nhit an accuracy comparable to the Vision Transformer. However, the only\ninductive bias in this architecture is the embedding of tokens. Thus, there is\nstill a possibility to build a non-convolutional inductive bias into the\narchitecture itself, and we built in an inductive bias using two simple ideas.\nA way is to divide the token-mixing block vertically and horizontally. Another\nway is to make spatial correlations denser among some channels of token-mixing.\nWith this approach, we were able to improve the accuracy of the MLP-Mixer while\nreducing its parameters and computational complexity. Compared to other\nMLP-based models, the proposed model, named RaftMLP has a good balance of\ncomputational complexity, the number of parameters, and actual memory usage. In\naddition, our work indicates that MLP-based models have the potential to\nreplace CNNs by adopting inductive bias.

However, the big volume and diversity of\ncandidate web APIs put additional burden on the app developers' web APIs\nselection decision-makings, since it is often a challenging task to\nsimultaneously guarantee the diversity and compatibility of the finally\nselected a set of web APIs. Considering this challenge, a Diversity-aware and\nCompatibility-driven web APIs Recommendation approach, namely DivCAR, is put\nforward in this paper. First, to achieve diversity, DivCAR employs random walk\nsampling technique on a pre-built correlation graph to generate diverse\ncorrelation subgraphs.

The proposed natural\nnumerical network is applied to open important environmental and nature\nconservation task, the automated identification of protected habitats by using\nsatellite images. In the natural numerical network, the forward diffusion\ncauses the movement of points in a feature space toward each other. The\nopposite effect, keeping the points away from each other, is caused by backward\ndiffusion. This yields the desired classification. The natural numerical\nnetwork contains a few parameters that are optimized in the learning phase of\nthe method. After learning parameters and optimizing the topology of the\nnetwork graph, classification necessary for habitat identification is\nperformed. A relevancy map for each habitat is introduced as a tool for\nvalidating the classification and finding new Natura 2000 habitat appearances.",

Despite progress in machine learning and computer\nvision that allows for advanced gesture recognition, an integrated collection\nof such open-source methods and a user-customisable approach to utilising them\nin a low-cost solution for touchless interaction in existing software is still\nmissing. In this paper, we introduce the MotionInput v2.0 application. This\napplication utilises published open-source libraries and additional gesture\ndefinitions developed to take the video stream from a standard RGB webcam as\ninput. It then maps human motion gestures to input operations for existing\napplications and games. The user can choose their own preferred way of\ninteracting from a series of motion types, including single and bi-modal hand\ngesturing, full-body repetitive or extremities-based exercises, head and facial\nmovements, eye tracking, and combinations of the above. We also introduce a\nseries of bespoke gesture recognition classifications as DirectInput triggers,\nincluding gestures for idle states, auto calibration, depth capture from a 2D\nRGB webcam stream and tracking of facial motions such as mouth motions,\nwinking, and head direction with rotation. Three use case areas assisted the\ndevelopment of the modules: creativity software, office and clinical software,\nand gaming software. A collection of open-source libraries has been integrated\nand provide a layer of modular gesture mapping on top of existing mouse and\nkeyboard controls in Windows via DirectX.

          "description": "The neuroimage analysis community has neglected the automated segmentation of\nthe olfactory bulb (OB) despite its crucial role in olfactory function. The\nlack of an automatic processing method for the OB can be explained by its\nchallenging properties. Nonetheless, recent advances in MRI acquisition\ntechniques and resolution have allowed raters to generate more reliable manual\nannotations. Furthermore, the high accuracy of deep learning methods for\nsolving semantic segmentation problems provides us with an option to reliably\nassess even small structures. In this work, we introduce a novel, fast, and\nfully automated deep learning pipeline to accurately segment OB tissue on\nsub-millimeter T2-weighted (T2w) whole-brain MR images. To this end, we\ndesigned a three-stage pipeline: (1) Localization of a region containing both\nOBs using FastSurferCNN, (2) Segmentation of OB tissue within the localized\nregion through four independent AttFastSurferCNN - a novel deep learning\narchitecture with a self-attention mechanism to improve modeling of contextual\ninformation, and (3) Ensemble of the predicted label maps. The OB pipeline\nexhibits high performance in terms of boundary delineation, OB localization,\nand volume estimation across a wide range of ages in 203 participants of the\nRhineland Study. Moreover, it also generalizes to scans of an independent\ndataset never encountered during training, the Human Connectome Project (HCP),\nwith different acquisition parameters and demographics, evaluated in 30 cases\nat the native 0.7mm HCP resolution, and the default 0.8mm pipeline resolution.\nWe extensively validated our pipeline not only with respect to segmentation\naccuracy but also to known OB volume effects, where it can sensitively\nreplicate age effects.",

          "description": "Analysing correlations between streams of events is an important problem. It\narises for example in Neurosciences, when the connectivity of neurons should be\ninferred from spike trains that record neurons' individual spiking activity.\nWhile recently some approaches for inferring delayed synaptic connections have\nbeen proposed, they are limited in the types of connectivities and delays they\nare able to handle, or require computation-intensive procedures. This paper\nproposes a faster and more flexible approach for analysing such delayed\ncorrelated activity: a statistical approach for the Analysis of Connectivity in\nspiking Events (ACE), based on the idea of hypothesis testing. It first\ncomputes for any pair of a source and a target neuron the inter-spike delays\nbetween subsequent source- and target-spikes. Then, it derives a null model for\nthe distribution of inter-spike delays for \\emph{uncorrelated}~neurons.\nFinally, it compares the observed distribution of inter-spike delays to this\nnull model and infers pairwise connectivity based on the Pearson's Chi-squared\ntest statistic. Thus, ACE is capable to detect connections with a priori\nunknown, non-discrete (and potentially large) inter-spike delays, which might\nvary between pairs of neurons. Since ACE works incrementally, it has potential\nfor being used in online processing. In our experiments, we visualise the\nadvantages of ACE in varying experimental scenarios (except for one special\ncase) and in a state-of-the-art dataset which has been generated for\nneuro-scientific research under most realistic conditions.",

          "description": "The Influenza virus can be considered as one of the most severe viruses that\ncan infect multiple species with often fatal consequences to the hosts. The\nHemagglutinin (HA) gene of the virus can be a target for antiviral drug\ndevelopment realised through accurate identification of its sub-types and\npossible the targeted hosts. This paper focuses on accurately predicting if an\nInfluenza type A virus can infect specific hosts, and more specifically, Human,\nAvian and Swine hosts, using only the protein sequence of the HA gene. In more\ndetail, we propose encoding the protein sequences into numerical signals using\nthe Hydrophobicity Index and subsequently utilising a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork-based predictive model. The Influenza HA protein sequences used in the\nproposed work are obtained from the Influenza Research Database (IRD).\nSpecifically, complete and unique HA protein sequences were used for avian,\nhuman and swine hosts. The data obtained for this work was 17999 human-host\nproteins, 17667 avian-host proteins and 9278 swine-host proteins. Given this\nset of collected proteins, the proposed method yields as much as 10% higher\naccuracy for an individual class (namely, Avian) and 5% higher overall accuracy\nthan in an earlier study. It is also observed that the accuracy for each class\nin this work is more balanced than what was presented in this earlier study. As\nthe results show, the proposed model can distinguish HA protein sequences with\nhigh accuracy whenever the virus under investigation can infect Human, Avian or\nSwine hosts.",

Over the last decade, many efforts have been\nengaged for cross-domain recommendation. Recently, with the development of deep\nlearning and neural networks, a large number of methods have emerged. However,\nthere is a limited number of systematic surveys on CDR, especially regarding\nthe latest proposed methods as well as the recommendation scenarios and\nrecommendation tasks they address.

Unfortunately, DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks\nthat affect virtually all state-of-the-art models. These attacks make small\nimperceptible modifications to inputs that are sufficient to induce the DNNs to\nproduce the wrong classification.\n\nIn this paper we propose a novel, lightweight adversarial correction and/or\ndetection mechanism for image classifiers that relies on undervolting (running\na chip at a voltage that is slightly below its safe margin). We propose using\ncontrolled undervolting of the chip running the inference process in order to\nintroduce a limited number of compute errors. We show that these errors disrupt\nthe adversarial input in a way that can be used either to correct the\nclassification or detect the input as adversarial. We evaluate the proposed\nsolution in an FPGA design and through software simulation. We evaluate 10\nattacks and show average detection rates of 77% and 90% on two popular DNNs.",

Musical rhythm comprises complex hierarchical relationships\nacross time, rendering its analysis intrinsically challenging and at times\nsubjective. Furthermore, systems which attempt to estimate rhythmic information\nin real-time must be causal and must produce estimates quickly and efficiently.\nIn this work, we introduce an online system for joint beat, downbeat, and meter\ntracking, which utilizes causal convolutional and recurrent layers, followed by\na pair of sequential Monte Carlo particle filters applied during inference. The\nproposed system does not need to be primed with a time signature in order to\nperform downbeat tracking, and is instead able to estimate meter and adjust the\npredictions over time. Additionally, we propose an information gate strategy to\nsignificantly decrease the computational cost of particle filtering during the\ninference step, making the system much faster than previous sampling-based\nmethods.

To answer these\nquestions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a\nnew English-French dataset comprising supporting context words for 14K\ntranslations that professional translators found useful for pronoun\ndisambiguation. Using SCAT, we perform an in-depth analysis of the context used\nto disambiguate, examining positional and lexical characteristics of the\nsupporting words.

This methodological problem is conceptually difficult\nbecause, in many situations, there is only enough signal to detect a subset of\nthe $k$ population dimensions/eigenvectors. In this situation, one could argue\nthat the correct choice of $k$ is the number of detectable dimensions. We\nalleviate these problems with cross-validated eigenvalues. Under a large class\nof random graph models, without any parametric assumptions, we provide a\np-value for each sample eigenvector. It tests the null hypothesis that this\nsample eigenvector is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the true latent\ndimensions. This approach naturally adapts to problems where some dimensions\nare not statistically detectable. In scenarios where all $k$ dimensions can be\nestimated, we prove that our procedure consistently estimates $k$.

Moreover, a point cloud\nis often composed of multiple subparts, and it is also difficult to express. In\nthis study, we propose ChartPointFlow, a flow-based generative model with\nmultiple latent labels for 3D point clouds. Each label is assigned to points in\nan unsupervised manner. Then, a map conditioned on a label is assigned to a\ncontinuous subset of a point cloud, similar to a chart of a manifold. This\nenables our proposed model to preserve the topological structure with clear\nboundaries, whereas previous approaches tend to generate blurry point clouds\nand fail to generate holes. The experimental results demonstrate that\nChartPointFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of generation and\nreconstruction compared with other point cloud generators.

          "description": "Recent research in embodied AI has been boosted by the use of simulation\nenvironments to develop and train robot learning approaches. However, the use\nof simulation has skewed the attention to tasks that only require what robotics\nsimulators can simulate: motion and physical contact. We present iGibson 2.0,\nan open-source simulation environment that supports the simulation of a more\ndiverse set of household tasks through three key innovations. First, iGibson\n2.0 supports object states, including temperature, wetness level, cleanliness\nlevel, and toggled and sliced states, necessary to cover a wider range of\ntasks. Second, iGibson 2.0 implements a set of predicate logic functions that\nmap the simulator states to logic states like Cooked or Soaked. Additionally,\ngiven a logic state, iGibson 2.0 can sample valid physical states that satisfy\nit. This functionality can generate potentially infinite instances of tasks\nwith minimal effort from the users. The sampling mechanism allows our scenes to\nbe more densely populated with small objects in semantically meaningful\nlocations. Third, iGibson 2.0 includes a virtual reality (VR) interface to\nimmerse humans in its scenes to collect demonstrations. As a result, we can\ncollect demonstrations from humans on these new types of tasks, and use them\nfor imitation learning. We evaluate the new capabilities of iGibson 2.0 to\nenable robot learning of novel tasks, in the hope of demonstrating the\npotential of this new simulator to support new research in embodied AI. iGibson\n2.0 and its new dataset will be publicly available at\nthis http URL",

          "description": "Traumatic brain injury can be caused by various types of head impacts.\nHowever, due to different kinematic characteristics, many brain injury risk\nestimation models are not generalizable across the variety of impacts that\nhumans may sustain. The current definitions of head impact subtypes are based\non impact sources (e.g., football, traffic accident), which may not reflect the\nintrinsic kinematic similarities of impacts across the impact sources. To\ninvestigate the potential new definitions of impact subtypes based on\nkinematics, 3,161 head impacts from various sources including simulation,\ncollege football, mixed martial arts, and car racing were collected. We applied\nthe K-means clustering to cluster the impacts on 16 standardized temporal\nfeatures from head rotation kinematics. Then, we developed subtype-specific\nridge regression models for cumulative strain damage (using the threshold of\n15%), which significantly improved the estimation accuracy compared with the\nbaseline method which mixed impacts from different sources and developed one\nmodel (R^2 from 0.7 to 0.9). To investigate the effect of kinematic features,\nwe presented the top three critical features (maximum resultant angular\nacceleration, maximum angular acceleration along the z-axis, maximum linear\nacceleration along the y-axis) based on regression accuracy and used logistic\nregression to find the critical points for each feature that partitioned the\nsubtypes. This study enables researchers to define head impact subtypes in a\ndata-driven manner, which leads to more generalizable brain injury risk\nestimation.",

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) enables distributed computation of machine learning\nmodels over various disparate, remote data sources, without requiring to\ntransfer any individual data to a centralized location. This results in an\nimproved generalizability of models and efficient scaling of computation as\nmore sources and larger datasets are added to the federation. Nevertheless,\nrecent membership attacks show that private or sensitive personal data can\nsometimes be leaked or inferred when model parameters or summary statistics are\nshared with a central site, requiring improved security solutions. In this\nwork, we propose a framework for secure FL using fully-homomorphic encryption\n(FHE). Specifically, we use the CKKS construction, an approximate, floating\npoint compatible scheme that benefits from ciphertext packing and rescaling. In\nour evaluation on large-scale brain MRI datasets, we use our proposed secure FL\nframework to train a deep learning model to predict a person's age from\ndistributed MRI scans, a common benchmarking task, and demonstrate that there\nis no degradation in the learning performance between the encrypted and\nnon-encrypted federated models.",

          "description": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable communication between humans and\nmachines by translating brain activity into control commands.\nElectroencephalography (EEG) signals are one of the most used brain signals in\nnon-invasive BCI applications but are often contaminated with noise. Therefore,\nit is possible that meaningful patterns for classifying EEG signals are deeply\nhidden. State-of-the-art deep-learning algorithms are successful in learning\nhidden, meaningful patterns. However, the quality and the quantity of the\npresented inputs is pivotal. Here, we propose a novel feature extraction method\ncalled anchored Short Time Fourier Transform (anchored-STFT), which is an\nadvanced version of STFT, as it minimizes the trade-off between temporal and\nspectral resolution presented by STFT. In addition, we propose a novel\naugmentation method, called gradient norm adversarial augmentation (GNAA). GNAA\nis not only an augmentation method but is also used to harness adversarial\ninputs in EEG data, which not only improves the classification accuracy but\nalso enhances the robustness of the classifier. In addition, we also propose a\nnew CNN architecture, namely Skip-Net, for the classification of EEG signals.\nThe proposed pipeline outperforms all state-of-the-art methods and yields an\naverage classification accuracy of 90.7 % and 89.54 % on BCI competition II\ndataset III and BCI competition IV dataset 2b, respectively.",

While recent advances have been made in\nimitation learning and batch (offline) reinforcement learning, a lack of\nopen-source human datasets and reproducible learning methods make assessing the\nstate of the field difficult. In this paper, we conduct an extensive study of\nsix offline learning algorithms for robot manipulation on five simulated and\nthree real-world multi-stage manipulation tasks of varying complexity, and with\ndatasets of varying quality. Our study analyzes the most critical challenges\nwhen learning from offline human data for manipulation. Based on the study, we\nderive a series of lessons including the sensitivity to different algorithmic\ndesign choices, the dependence on the quality of the demonstrations, and the\nvariability based on the stopping criteria due to the different objectives in\ntraining and evaluation. We also highlight opportunities for learning from\nhuman datasets, such as the ability to learn proficient policies on\nchallenging, multi-stage tasks beyond the scope of current reinforcement\nlearning methods, and the ability to easily scale to natural, real-world\nmanipulation scenarios where only raw sensory signals are available.

          "description": "This paper tackles the data-driven approximation of unknown dynamical systems\nusing Koopman-operator methods. Given a dictionary of functions, these methods\napproximate the projection of the action of the operator on the\nfinite-dimensional subspace spanned by the dictionary. We propose the Tunable\nSymmetric Subspace Decomposition algorithm to refine the dictionary, balancing\nits expressiveness and accuracy. Expressiveness corresponds to the ability of\nthe dictionary to describe the evolution of as many observables as possible and\naccuracy corresponds to the ability to correctly predict their evolution. Based\non the observation that Koopman-invariant subspaces give rise to exact\npredictions, we reason that prediction accuracy is a function of the degree of\ninvariance of the subspace generated by the dictionary and provide a\ndata-driven measure to measure invariance proximity. The proposed algorithm\niteratively prunes the initial functional space to identify a refined\ndictionary of functions that satisfies the desired level of accuracy while\nretaining as much of the original expressiveness as possible. We provide a full\ncharacterization of the algorithm properties and show that it generalizes both\nExtended Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Symmetric Subspace Decomposition.\nSimulations on planar systems show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in\nproducing Koopman approximations of tunable accuracy that capture relevant\ninformation about the dynamical system.",

          "description": "An efficient method for obtaining low-density hyperplane separators in the\nunsupervised context is proposed. Low density separators can be used to obtain\na partition of a set of data based on their allocations to the different sides\nof the separators. The proposed method is based on applying stochastic gradient\ndescent to the integrated density on the hyperplane with respect to a\nconvolution of the underlying distribution and a smoothing kernel. In the case\nwhere the bandwidth of the smoothing kernel is decreased towards zero, the bias\nof these updates with respect to the true underlying density tends to zero, and\nconvergence to a minimiser of the density on the hyperplane can be obtained. A\npost-processing of the partition induced by a collection of low-density\nhyperplanes yields an efficient and accurate clustering method which is capable\nof automatically selecting an appropriate number of clusters.

          "description": "Few-shot learning (FSL) is a central problem in meta-learning, where learners\nmust quickly adapt to new tasks given limited training data. Surprisingly,\nrecent works have outperformed meta-learning methods tailored to FSL by casting\nit as standard supervised learning to jointly classify all classes shared\nacross tasks. However, this approach violates the standard FSL setting by\nrequiring global labels shared across tasks, which are often unavailable in\npractice. In this paper, we show why solving FSL via standard classification is\ntheoretically advantageous. This motivates us to propose Meta Label Learning\n(MeLa), a novel algorithm that infers global labels and obtains robust few-shot\nmodels via standard classification. Empirically, we demonstrate that MeLa\noutperforms meta-learning competitors and is comparable to the oracle setting\nwhere ground truth labels are given.

          "description": "This paper presents a novel lightweight COVID-19 diagnosis framework using CT\nscans. Our system utilises a novel two-stage approach to generate robust and\nefficient diagnoses across heterogeneous patient level inputs. We use a\npowerful backbone network as a feature extractor to capture discriminative\nslice-level features. These features are aggregated by a lightweight network to\nobtain a patient level diagnosis. The aggregation network is carefully designed\nto have a small number of trainable parameters while also possessing sufficient\ncapacity to generalise to diverse variations within different CT volumes and to\nadapt to noise introduced during the data acquisition. We achieve a significant\nperformance increase over the baselines when benchmarked on the SPGC COVID-19\nRadiomics Dataset, despite having only 2.5 million trainable parameters and\nrequiring only 0.623 seconds on average to process a single patient's CT volume\nusing an Nvidia-GeForce RTX 2080 GPU.",

          "description": "Asynchronous Q-learning aims to learn the optimal action-value function (or\nQ-function) of a Markov decision process (MDP), based on a single trajectory of\nMarkovian samples induced by a behavior policy. Focusing on a\n$\\gamma$-discounted MDP with state space $\\mathcal{S}$ and action space\n$\\mathcal{A}$, we demonstrate that the $\\ell_{\\infty}$-based sample complexity\nof classical asynchronous Q-learning --- namely, the number of samples needed\nto yield an entrywise $\\varepsilon$-accurate estimate of the Q-function --- is\nat most on the order of $\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\min}(1-\\gamma)^5\\varepsilon^2}+\n\\frac{t_{mix}}{\\mu_{\\min}(1-\\gamma)}$ up to some logarithmic factor, provided\nthat a proper constant learning rate is adopted. Here, $t_{mix}$ and\n$\\mu_{\\min}$ denote respectively the mixing time and the minimum state-action\noccupancy probability of the sample trajectory. The first term of this bound\nmatches the sample complexity in the synchronous case with independent samples\ndrawn from the stationary distribution of the trajectory. The second term\nreflects the cost taken for the empirical distribution of the Markovian\ntrajectory to reach a steady state, which is incurred at the very beginning and\nbecomes amortized as the algorithm runs. Encouragingly, the above bound\nimproves upon the state-of-the-art result \\cite{qu2020finite} by a factor of at\nleast $|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|$ for all scenarios, and by a factor of at\nleast $t_{mix}|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|$ for any sufficiently small accuracy\nlevel $\\varepsilon$. Further, we demonstrate that the scaling on the effective\nhorizon $\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$ can be improved by means of variance reduction.",

Specifically, we first present an\noverview for the I-health systems challenges, architecture, and how RL can\nbenefit these systems. We then review the background and mathematical modeling\nof different RL, Deep RL (DRL), and multi-agent RL models. After that, we\nprovide a deep literature review for the applications of RL in I-health\nsystems. In particular, three main areas have been tackled, i.e., edge\nintelligence, smart core network, and dynamic treatment regimes.

          "description": "While recent studies on semi-supervised learning have shown remarkable\nprogress in leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, most of them presume a\nbasic setting of the model is randomly initialized. In this work, we consider\nsemi-supervised learning and transfer learning jointly, leading to a more\npractical and competitive paradigm that can utilize both powerful pre-trained\nmodels from source domain as well as labeled/unlabeled data in the target\ndomain. To better exploit the value of both pre-trained weights and unlabeled\ntarget examples, we introduce adaptive consistency regularization that consists\nof two complementary components: Adaptive Knowledge Consistency (AKC) on the\nexamples between the source and target model, and Adaptive Representation\nConsistency (ARC) on the target model between labeled and unlabeled examples.\nExamples involved in the consistency regularization are adaptively selected\naccording to their potential contributions to the target task. We conduct\nextensive experiments on popular benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and\nMURA, by fine-tuning the ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-50 model. Results show\nthat our proposed adaptive consistency regularization outperforms\nstate-of-the-art semi-supervised learning techniques such as Pseudo Label, Mean\nTeacher, and FixMatch. Moreover, our algorithm is orthogonal to existing\nmethods and thus able to gain additional improvements on top of MixMatch and\nFixMatch.

However,\nthe transmission line parameters are dynamic and cannot be accurately known\nduring operation and thus the involved modeling errors should not be neglected.\nIn this paper, an illustrative case has revealed that modeling errors in\ntransmission lines significantly weaken the detection effectiveness of\nconventional FDIA approaches. To tackle this issue, we propose an FDIA\ndetection mechanism from the perspective of transfer learning. Specifically,\nthe simulated power system is treated as a source domain, which provides\nabundant simulated normal and attack data. The real world's running system\nwhose transmission line parameters are unknown is taken as a target domain\nwhere sufficient real normal data are collected for tracking the latest system\nstates online. The designed transfer strategy that aims at making full use of\ndata in hand is divided into two optimization stages. In the first stage, a\ndeep neural network (DNN) is built by simultaneously optimizing several\nwell-designed objective terms with both simulated data and real data, and then\nit is fine-tuned via real data in the second stage.

By performing experiments in their environment, they are able to\ndiscern the causal factors of variation and infer how they affect the world's\ndynamics. Inspired by this, we attempt to equip reinforcement learning agents\nwith the ability to perform experiments that facilitate a categorization of the\nrolled-out trajectories, and to subsequently infer the causal factors of the\nenvironment in a hierarchical manner. We introduce {\\em causal curiosity}, a\nnovel intrinsic reward, and show that it allows our agents to learn optimal\nsequences of actions and discover causal factors in the dynamics of the\nenvironment. The learned behavior allows the agents to infer a binary quantized\nrepresentation for the ground-truth causal factors in every environment.\nAdditionally, we find that these experimental behaviors are semantically\nmeaningful (e.g., our agents learn to lift blocks to categorize them by\nweight), and are learnt in a self-supervised manner with approximately 2.5\ntimes less data than conventional supervised planners. We show that these\nbehaviors can be re-purposed and fine-tuned (e.g., from lifting to pushing or\nother downstream tasks).

The purpose of this study is to predict new\ncases and deaths rate one, three and seven-day ahead during the next 100 days.\nThe motivation for predicting every n days (instead of just every day) is the\ninvestigation of the possibility of computational cost reduction and still\nachieving reasonable performance. Such a scenario may be encountered real-time\nforecasting of time series. Six different deep learning methods are examined on\nthe data adopted from the WHO website. Three methods are LSTM, Convolutional\nLSTM, and GRU. The bidirectional extension is then considered for each method\nto forecast the rate of new cases and new deaths in Australia and Iran\ncountries.",

          "description": "GNNs have been proven to perform highly effective in various node-level,\nedge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks in several domains. Existing\napproaches mainly focus on static graphs. However, many graphs change over time\nwith their edge may disappear, or node or edge attribute may alter from one\ntime to the other. It is essential to consider such evolution in representation\nlearning of nodes in time varying graphs. In this paper, we propose a Temporal\nMultilayered Position-aware Graph Neural Network (TMP-GNN), a node embedding\napproach for dynamic graph that incorporates the interdependence of temporal\nrelations into embedding computation. We evaluate the performance of TMP-GNN on\ntwo different representations of temporal multilayered graphs. The performance\nis assessed against the most popular GNNs on node-level prediction tasks. Then,\nwe incorporate TMP-GNN into a deep learning framework to estimate missing data\nand compare the performance with their corresponding competent GNNs from our\nformer experiment, and a baseline method. Experimental results on four\nreal-world datasets yield up to 58% of lower ROC AUC for pairwise node\nclassification task, and 96% of lower MAE in missing feature estimation,\nparticularly for graphs with a relatively high number of nodes and lower mean\ndegree of connectivity.",

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have boosted the performance for many\ngraph-related tasks. Despite the great success, recent studies have shown that\nGNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where adversaries can\nmislead the GNNs' prediction by modifying graphs. On the other hand, the\nexplanation of GNNs (GNNExplainer) provides a better understanding of a trained\nGNN model by generating a small subgraph and features that are most influential\nfor its prediction. In this paper, we first perform empirical studies to\nvalidate that GNNExplainer can act as an inspection tool and have the potential\nto detect the adversarial perturbations for graphs. This finding motivates us\nto further initiate a new problem investigation: Whether a graph neural network\nand its explanations can be jointly attacked by modifying graphs with malicious\ndesires? It is challenging to answer this question since the goals of\nadversarial attacks and bypassing the GNNExplainer essentially contradict each\nother. In this work, we give a confirmative answer to this question by\nproposing a novel attack framework (GEAttack), which can attack both a GNN\nmodel and its explanations by simultaneously exploiting their vulnerabilities.\nExtensive experiments on two explainers (GNNExplainer and PGExplainer) under\nvarious real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.",

          "description": "While the celebrated graph neural networks yield effective representations\nfor individual nodes of a graph, there has been relatively less success in\nextending to the task of graph similarity learning. Recent work on graph\nsimilarity learning has considered either global-level graph-graph interactions\nor low-level node-node interactions, however ignoring the rich cross-level\ninteractions (e.g., between each node of one graph and the other whole graph).\nIn this paper, we propose a multi-level graph matching network (MGMN) framework\nfor computing the graph similarity between any pair of graph-structured objects\nin an end-to-end fashion. In particular, the proposed MGMN consists of a\nnode-graph matching network for effectively learning cross-level interactions\nbetween each node of one graph and the other whole graph, and a siamese graph\nneural network to learn global-level interactions between two input graphs.\nFurthermore, to compensate for the lack of standard benchmark datasets, we have\ncreated and collected a set of datasets for both the graph-graph classification\nand graph-graph regression tasks with different sizes in order to evaluate the\neffectiveness and robustness of our models. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MGMN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models\non both the graph-graph classification and graph-graph regression tasks.\nCompared with previous work, MGMN also exhibits stronger robustness as the\nsizes of the two input graphs increase.",

          "description": "Time-series data are one of the fundamental types of raw data representation\nused in data-driven techniques. In machine condition monitoring, time-series\nvibration data are overly used in data mining for deep neural networks.\nTypically, vibration data is converted into images for classification using\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs), and scalograms are the most effective form of\nimage representation. However, the DNN classifiers require huge labeled\ntraining samples to reach their optimum performance. So, many forms of data\naugmentation techniques are applied to the classifiers to compensate for the\nlack of training samples. However, the scalograms are graphical representations\nwhere the existing augmentation techniques suffer because they either change\nthe graphical meaning or have too much noise in the samples that change the\nphysical meaning. In this study, a data augmentation technique named ensemble\naugmentation is proposed to overcome this limitation. This augmentation method\nuses the power of white noise added in ensembles to the original samples to\ngenerate real-like samples. After averaging the signal with ensembles, a new\nsignal is obtained that contains the characteristics of the original signal.\nThe parameters for the ensemble augmentation are validated using a simulated\nsignal. The proposed method is evaluated using 10 class bearing vibration data\nusing three state-of-the-art Transfer Learning (TL) models, namely,\nInception-V3, MobileNet-V2, and ResNet50. Augmented samples are generated in\ntwo increments: the first increment generates the same number of fake samples\nas the training samples, and in the second increment, the number of samples is\nincreased gradually.

The\ngoal for the agents is to compute a linear mathematical model that optimally\nfits the collective data points held by all the agents, without sharing their\nindividual local data points. This goal can be achieved, in principle, using\nthe server-agent variant of the traditional iterative gradient-descent method.\nThe gradient-descent method converges linearly to a solution, and its rate of\nconvergence is lower bounded by the conditioning of the agents' collective data\npoints. If the data points are ill-conditioned, the gradient-descent method may\nrequire a large number of iterations to converge.\n\nWe propose an iterative pre-conditioning technique that mitigates the\ndeleterious effect of the conditioning of data points on the rate of\nconvergence of the gradient-descent method. We rigorously show that the\nresulting pre-conditioned gradient-descent method, with the proposed iterative\npre-conditioning, achieves superlinear convergence when the least-squares\nproblem has a unique solution.

          "description": "Deep neural network (DNN) models have achieved phenomenal success for\napplications in many domains, ranging from academic research in science and\nengineering to industry and business. The modeling power of DNN is believed to\nhave come from the complexity and over-parameterization of the model, which on\nthe other hand has been criticized for the lack of interpretation. Although\ncertainly not true for every application, in some applications, especially in\neconomics, social science, healthcare industry, and administrative decision\nmaking, scientists or practitioners are resistant to use predictions made by a\nblack-box system for multiple reasons. One reason is that a major purpose of a\nstudy can be to make discoveries based upon the prediction function, e.g., to\nreveal the relationships between measurements. Another reason can be that the\ntraining dataset is not large enough to make researchers feel completely sure\nabout a purely data-driven result. Being able to examine and interpret the\nprediction function will enable researchers to connect the result with existing\nknowledge or gain insights about new directions to explore. Although classic\nstatistical models are much more explainable, their accuracy often falls\nconsiderably below DNN. In this paper, we propose an approach to fill the gap\nbetween relatively simple explainable models and DNN such that we can more\nflexibly tune the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. Our main\nidea is a mixture of discriminative models that is trained with the guidance\nfrom a DNN. Although mixtures of discriminative models have been studied\nbefore, our way of generating the mixture is quite different.",

          "description": "With the growing use of ML in highly consequential domains, quantifying\ndisparity with respect to protected attributes, e.g., gender, race, etc., is\nimportant. While quantifying disparity is essential, sometimes the needs of an\noccupation may require the use of certain features that are critical in a way\nthat any disparity that can be explained by them might need to be exempted.\nE.g., in hiring a software engineer for a safety-critical application,\ncoding-skills may be weighed strongly, whereas name, zip code, or reference\nletters may be used only to the extent that they do not add disparity. In this\nwork, we propose an information-theoretic decomposition of the total disparity\n(a quantification inspired from counterfactual fairness) into two components: a\nnon-exempt component which quantifies the part that cannot be accounted for by\nthe critical features, and an exempt component that quantifies the remaining\ndisparity. This decomposition allows one to check if the disparity arose purely\ndue to the critical features (inspired from the business necessity defense of\ndisparate impact law) and also enables selective removal of the non-exempt\ncomponent if desired. We arrive at this decomposition through canonical\nexamples that lead to a set of desirable properties (axioms) that a measure of\nnon-exempt disparity should satisfy. Our proposed measure satisfies all of\nthem. Our quantification bridges ideas of causality, Simpson's paradox, and a\nbody of work from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition.\nWe also obtain an impossibility result showing that no observational measure\ncan satisfy all the desirable properties, leading us to relax our goals and\nexamine observational measures that satisfy only some of them. We perform case\nstudies to show how one can audit/train models while reducing non-exempt\ndisparity.",

The\nlearner and the adversary then play in this game. The learner's goal is to play\nso as to minimize the maximum coordinate of the cumulative vector-valued loss.\nThe resulting one-shot game is not convex-concave, and so the minimax theorem\ndoes not apply. Nevertheless, we give a simple algorithm that can compete with\nthe setting in which the adversary must announce their action first, with\noptimally diminishing regret.\n\nWe demonstrate the power of our simple framework by using it to derive\noptimal bounds and algorithms across a variety of domains. This includes no\nregret learning: we can recover optimal algorithms and bounds for minimizing\nexternal regret, internal regret, adaptive regret, multigroup regret,\nsubsequence regret, and a notion of regret in the sleeping experts setting.\nNext, we use it to derive a variant of Blackwell's Approachability Theorem,\nwhich we term \"Fast Polytope Approachability\".

Numerous works have been proposed\nto utilize textual data for social and anti-social behaviour analysis, by\npredicting the contexts mostly for highly-resourced languages like English.\nHowever, some languages are under-resourced, e.g., South Asian languages like\nBengali, that lack computational resources for accurate natural language\nprocessing (NLP). In this paper, we propose an explainable approach for hate\nspeech detection from the under-resourced Bengali language, which we called\nDeepHateExplainer. Bengali texts are first comprehensively preprocessed, before\nclassifying them into political, personal, geopolitical, and religious hates\nusing a neural ensemble method of transformer-based neural architectures (i.e.,\nmonolingual Bangla BERT-base, multilingual BERT-cased/uncased, and\nXLM-RoBERTa). Important(most and least) terms are then identified using\nsensitivity analysis and layer-wise relevance propagation(LRP), before\nproviding human-interpretable explanations. Finally, we compute\ncomprehensiveness and sufficiency scores to measure the quality of explanations\nw.r.t faithfulness. Evaluations against machine learning~(linear and tree-based\nmodels) and neural networks (i.e., CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM with word\nembeddings) baselines yield F1-scores of 78%, 91%, 89%, and 84%, for political,\npersonal, geopolitical, and religious hates, respectively, outperforming both\nML and DNN baselines.",

New technologies, like network\nfunction virtualization and software-defined networking, have been incorporated\nin the 5G core network (5GCN) architecture to enable this transition. This has\nresulted in significant improvements in efficiency, performance, and robustness\nof the networks. However, this has also made the core network more vulnerable,\nas software systems are generally easier to compromise than hardware systems.\nIn this article, we present a comprehensive security analysis framework for the\n5GCN. The novelty of this approach lies in the creation and analysis of attack\ngraphs of the software-defined and virtualized 5GCN through machine learning.\nThis analysis points to 119 novel possible exploits in the 5GCN. We demonstrate\nthat these possible exploits of 5GCN vulnerabilities generate five novel\nattacks on the 5G Authentication and Key Agreement protocol. We combine the\nattacks at the network, protocol, and the application layers to generate\ncomplex attack vectors.

The latter often\nconsists on short and noisy trajectories, which are hard to characterize with\nusual statistical approaches. In recent years, we have witnessed an impressive\neffort to bridge theory and experiments by means of supervised machine learning\ntechniques, with astonishing results.

We use such method to discriminate between anomalous diffusion models\nand extract their physical parameters. Moreover, we explore the feasibility of\nfinding novel types of diffusion, in this case represented by compositions of\nexisting diffusion models.

          "description": "Transformer neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results for\nunstructured data such as text and images but their adoption for\ngraph-structured data has been limited. This is partly due to the difficulty in\nincorporating complex structural information in the basic transformer\nframework. We propose a simple yet powerful extension to the transformer -\nresidual edge channels. The resultant framework, which we call Edge-augmented\nGraph Transformer (EGT), can directly accept, process and output structural\ninformation as well as node information. This simple addition allows us to use\nglobal self-attention, the key element of transformers, directly for graphs and\ncomes with the benefit of long-range interaction among nodes. Moreover, the\nedge channels allow the structural information to evolve from layer to layer,\nand prediction tasks on edges can be derived directly from these channels. In\naddition to that, we introduce positional encodings based on Singular Value\nDecomposition which can improve the performance of EGT. Our framework, which\nrelies on global node feature aggregation, achieves better performance compared\nto Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), which rely on local feature aggregation\nwithin a neighborhood. We verify the performance of EGT in a supervised\nlearning setting on a wide range of experiments on benchmark datasets. Our\nfindings indicate that convolutional aggregation is not an essential inductive\nbias for graphs and global self-attention can serve as a flexible and adaptive\nalternative to graph convolution.",

This\ndimensionality issue affects the efficiency and convergence properties of\ngeneric RL algorithms.

In addition, we propose an\nequivalent state aggregation that can guarantee to attain the same optimal\npolicy.

They used a neural network that tried to learn addition using two\ngroups of examples as two different tasks. In their case, learning the second\ntask rapidly deteriorated the acquired knowledge about the previous one. This\ncould be a symptom of a fundamental problem: addition is an algorithmic task\nthat should not be learned through pattern recognition. We propose to use a\nneural network with a different architecture that can be trained to recover the\ncorrect algorithm for the addition of binary numbers. We test it in the setting\nproposed by McCloskey and Cohen and training on random examples one by one. The\nneural network not only does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting but it\nimproves its predictive power on unseen pairs of numbers as training\nprogresses.

We\nestablish strong convergence guarantees for the proposed DFL algorithm without\nthe assumption of convex objective function. The balance of communication and\ncomputation rounds is essential to optimize decentralized federated learning\nunder constrained communication and computation resources. For further\nimproving communication-efficiency of DFL, compressed communication is applied\nto DFL, named DFL with compressed communication (C-DFL).

          "description": "Recent studies unveil the vulnerabilities of deep ranking models, where an\nimperceptible perturbation can trigger dramatic changes in the ranking result.\nWhile previous attempts focus on manipulating absolute ranks of certain\ncandidates, the possibility of adjusting their relative order remains\nunder-explored. In this paper, we formulate a new adversarial attack against\ndeep ranking systems, i.e., the Order Attack, which covertly alters the\nrelative order among a selected set of candidates according to an\nattacker-specified permutation, with limited interference to other unrelated\ncandidates. Specifically, it is formulated as a triplet-style loss imposing an\ninequality chain reflecting the specified permutation. However, direct\noptimization of such white-box objective is infeasible in a real-world attack\nscenario due to various black-box limitations. To cope with them, we propose a\nShort-range Ranking Correlation metric as a surrogate objective for black-box\nOrder Attack to approximate the white-box method. The Order Attack is evaluated\non the Fashion-MNIST and Stanford-Online-Products datasets under both white-box\nand black-box threat models. The black-box attack is also successfully\nimplemented on a major e-commerce platform.

          "description": "User response prediction, which aims to predict the probability that a user\nwill provide a predefined positive response in a given context such as clicking\non an ad or purchasing an item, is crucial to many industrial applications such\nas online advertising, recommender systems, and search ranking. However, due to\nthe high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these\ntasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies\nin predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing\nfeature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order\ncross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing\nmethods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model\narchitecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with\nequal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel\narchitecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross\nnetwork's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at\nthe vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of\ndifferent cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head\nattention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to\nperform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed\nmodel can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets.

We describe the individual tones via a parametric model,\ntraining a dictionary to capture the relative amplitudes of the harmonics. The\nmodel parameters are predicted via a U-Net, which is a type of deep neural\nnetwork. The network is trained without ground truth information, based on the\ndifference between the model prediction and the individual time frames of the\nshort-time Fourier transform. Since some of the model parameters do not yield a\nuseful backpropagation gradient, we model them stochastically and employ the\npolicy gradient instead. To provide phase information and account for\ninaccuracies in the dictionary-based representation, we also let the network\noutput a direct prediction, which we then use to resynthesize the audio signals\nfor the individual instruments. Due to the flexibility of the neural network,\ninharmonicity can be incorporated seamlessly and no preprocessing of the input\nspectra is required. Our algorithm yields high-quality separation results with\nparticularly low interference on a variety of different audio samples, both\nacoustic and synthetic, provided that the sample contains enough data for the\ntraining and that the spectral characteristics of the musical instruments are\nsufficiently stable to be approximated by the dictionary.",

Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring\nquality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this\nwork, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe\nthat load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,\ncontrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely\nactivated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can\nsignificantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step\nforward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits\nexperts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This\nstrategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,\nand our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is\nmore effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$\ntrillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in\ncomparison with the recent SOTAs on $2048$ TPU cores.

          "description": "Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws\nincreasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem\nby trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead\nof the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting\nmight make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely\nimbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a\nnovel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP),\nwhich always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all\nintervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably\nintroduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose\nanother criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects\nthe best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during\ninference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly\nnegligible. As far as we are aware, this work is the first to delve into such a\nclassification task and ends up with a promising solution for count interval\npartition.

Our analysis is based on the use of a hyperparameters-dependent\nstochastic differential equation (hp-dependent SDE) that serves as a continuous\nsurrogate for SGD with momentum. Similarly, we establish the linear convergence\nfor the continuous-time formulation of SGD with momentum and obtain an explicit\nexpression for the optimal linear rate by analyzing the spectrum of the\nKramers-Fokker-Planck operator. By comparison, we demonstrate how the optimal\nlinear rate of convergence and the final gap for SGD only about the learning\nrate varies with the momentum coefficient increasing from zero to one when the\nmomentum is introduced. Then, we propose a mathematical interpretation why the\nSGD with momentum converges faster and more robust about the learning rate than\nthe standard SGD in practice. Finally, we show the Nesterov momentum under the\nexistence of noise has no essential difference with the standard momentum.",

          "description": "The ability to plan into the future while utilizing only raw high-dimensional\nobservations, such as images, can provide autonomous agents with broad\ncapabilities. Visual model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that plan\nfuture actions directly have shown impressive results on tasks that require\nonly short-horizon reasoning, however, these methods struggle on temporally\nextended tasks. We argue that it is easier to solve long-horizon tasks by\nplanning sequences of states rather than just actions, as the effects of\nactions greatly compound over time and are harder to optimize. To achieve this,\nwe draw on the idea of collocation, which has shown good results on\nlong-horizon tasks in optimal control literature, and adapt it to the\nimage-based setting by utilizing learned latent state space models. The\nresulting latent collocation method (LatCo) optimizes trajectories of latent\nstates, which improves over previously proposed shooting methods for visual\nmodel-based RL on tasks with sparse rewards and long-term goals.

One of the most immediate needs of people affected by a\ndisaster is finding shelter. While the proliferation of data on disasters is\nalready helping to save lives, identifying damages in buildings, assessing\nshelter needs, and finding appropriate places to establish emergency shelters\nor settlements require a wide range of data to be combined rapidly. To address\nthis gap and make a headway in comprehensive assessments, this paper proposes a\nmachine learning workflow that aims to fuse and rapidly analyse multimodal\ndata. This workflow is built around open and online data to ensure scalability\nand broad accessibility. Based on a database of 19 characteristics for more\nthan 200 disasters worldwide, a fusion approach at the decision level was used.\nThis technique allows the collected multimodal data to share a common semantic\nspace that facilitates the prediction of individual variables. Each fused\nnumerical vector was fed into an unsupervised clustering algorithm called\nSelf-Organizing-Maps (SOM). The trained SOM serves as a predictor for future\ncases, allowing predicting consequences such as total deaths, total people\naffected, and total damage, and provides specific recommendations for\nassessments in the shelter and housing sector. To achieve such prediction, a\nsatellite image from before the disaster and the geographic and demographic\nconditions are shown to the trained model, which achieved a prediction accuracy\nof 62 %",

Improving predictive accuracy is therefore extremely valuable.\nData science researchers design algorithms, models, and approaches to improve\nprediction. Prediction is also improved with larger and richer data. Beyond\nimproving algorithms and data, platforms can stealthily achieve better\nprediction accuracy by \"pushing\" users' behaviors towards their predicted\nvalues, using behavior modification techniques, thereby demonstrating more\ncertain predictions. Such apparent \"improved\" prediction can unintentionally\nresult from employing reinforcement learning algorithms that combine prediction\nand behavior modification. This strategy is absent from the machine learning\nand statistics literature. Investigating its properties requires integrating\ncausal with predictive notation. To this end, we incorporate Pearl's causal\ndo(.) operator into the predictive vocabulary. We then decompose the expected\nprediction error given behavior modification, and identify the components\nimpacting predictive power. Our derivation elucidates implications of such\nbehavior modification to data scientists, platforms, their customers, and the\nhumans whose behavior is manipulated. Behavior modification can make users'\nbehavior more predictable and even more homogeneous; yet this apparent\npredictability might not generalize when customers use predictions in practice.\nOutcomes pushed towards their predictions can be at odds with customers'\nintentions, and harmful to manipulated users.",

Finally, we address the resulting arms race, i.e., we consider\nthe ability of the malicious agent to adapt to the changing and improving\ndefensive communicative policies of the benign agents. Specifically, we model\nthe adversarial MACRL problem as a two-player zero-sum game and then utilize\nPolicy-Space Response Oracle to achieve communication robustness.

We propose QubismNet\nthat consists of two main parts: the Qubism map that visualizes the ground\nstates (or the purified reduced density matrices) as images, and a CNN that\nmaps the images to the target physical parameters. By assuming certain\nconstraints on the training set for the sake of balance, QubismNet exhibits\nimpressive powers of learning and generalization on several quantum spin\nmodels. While the training samples are restricted to the states from certain\nranges of the parameters, QubismNet can accurately estimate the parameters of\nthe states beyond such training regions.

          "description": "Noisy labels, resulting from mistakes in manual labeling or webly data\ncollecting for supervised learning, can cause neural networks to overfit the\nmisleading information and degrade the generalization performance.\nSelf-supervised learning works in the absence of labels and thus eliminates the\nnegative impact of noisy labels. Motivated by co-training with both supervised\nlearning view and self-supervised learning view, we propose a simple yet\neffective method called Co-learning for learning with noisy labels. Co-learning\nperforms supervised learning and self-supervised learning in a cooperative way.\nThe constraints of intrinsic similarity with the self-supervised module and the\nstructural similarity with the noisily-supervised module are imposed on a\nshared common feature encoder to regularize the network to maximize the\nagreement between the two constraints. Co-learning is compared with peer\nmethods on corrupted data from benchmark datasets fairly, and extensive results\nare provided which demonstrate that Co-learning is superior to many\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

          "description": "Employing a deep convolutional neural network (deep CNN) trained on spin\nconfigurations of the 2D Ising model and the temperatures, we examine whether\nthe deep CNN can detect the phase transition of the 2D $q$-state Potts model.\nTo this end, we generate binarized images of spin configurations of the\n$q$-state Potts model ($q\\ge 3$) by replacing the spin variables\n$\\{0,1,\\dots,\\lfloor q/2\\rfloor-1\\}$ and $\\{\\lfloor q/2\\rfloor,\\dots,q-1\\}$\nwith $\\{0\\}$ and $\\{1\\}$, respectively. Then, we input these images to the\ntrained CNN to output the predicted temperatures. The binarized images of the\n$q$-state Potts model are entirely different from Ising spin configurations,\nparticularly at the transition temperature. Moreover, our CNN model is not\ntrained on the information about whether phases are ordered/disordered but is\nnaively trained by Ising spin configurations labeled with temperatures at which\nthey are generated. Nevertheless, the deep CNN can detect the transition point\nwith high accuracy, regardless of the type of transition. We also find that, in\nthe high-temperature region, the CNN outputs the temperature based on the\ninternal energy, whereas, in the low-temperature region, the output depends on\nthe magnetization and possibly the internal energy as well. However, in the\nvicinity of the transition point, the CNN may use more general factors to\ndetect the transition point.",

          "description": "Sensing systems powered by energy harvesting have traditionally been designed\nto tolerate long periods without energy. As the Internet of Things (IoT)\nevolves towards a more transient and opportunistic execution paradigm, reducing\nenergy storage costs will be key for its economic and ecologic viability.\nHowever, decreasing energy storage in harvesting systems introduces reliability\nissues. Transducers only produce intermittent energy at low voltage and current\nlevels, making guaranteed task completion a challenge. Existing ad hoc methods\novercome this by buffering enough energy either for single tasks, incurring\nlarge data-retention overheads, or for one full application cycle, requiring a\nlarge energy buffer. We present Julienning: an automated method for optimizing\nthe total energy cost of batteryless applications. Using a custom specification\nmodel, developers can describe transient applications as a set of atomically\nexecuted kernels with explicit data dependencies. Our optimization flow can\npartition data- and energy-intensive applications into multiple execution\ncycles with bounded energy consumption. By leveraging interkernel data\ndependencies, these energy-bounded execution cycles minimize the number of\nsystem activations and nonvolatile data transfers, and thus the total energy\noverhead. We validate our methodology with two batteryless cameras running\nenergy-intensive machine learning applications. Results demonstrate that\ncompared to ad hoc solutions, our method can reduce the required energy storage\nby over 94% while only incurring a 0.12% energy overhead.",

          "description": "Machine learning for building energy prediction has exploded in popularity in\nrecent years, yet understanding its limitations and potential for improvement\nare lacking. The ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) Kaggle competition\nwas the largest building energy meter machine learning competition ever held\nwith 4,370 participants who submitted 39,403 predictions. The test data set\nincluded two years of hourly electricity, hot water, chilled water, and steam\nreadings from 2,380 meters in 1,448 buildings at 16 locations. This paper\nanalyzes the various sources and types of residual model error from an\naggregation of the competition's top 50 solutions. This analysis reveals the\nlimitations for machine learning using the standard model inputs of historical\nmeter, weather, and basic building metadata. The types of error are classified\naccording to the amount of time errors occur in each instance, abrupt versus\ngradual behavior, the magnitude of error, and whether the error existed on\nsingle buildings or several buildings at once from a single location. The\nresults show machine learning models have errors within a range of\nacceptability on 79.1% of the test data. Lower magnitude model errors occur in\n16.1% of the test data. These discrepancies can likely be addressed through\nadditional training data sources or innovations in machine learning. Higher\nmagnitude errors occur in 4.8% of the test data and are unlikely to be\naccurately predicted regardless of innovation. There is a diversity of error\nbehavior depending on the energy meter type (electricity prediction models have\nunacceptable error in under 10% of test data, while hot water is over 60%) and\nbuilding use type (public service less than 14%, while technology/science is\njust over 46%).",

Motivated by\nsuch behavior we study the problem of combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB)\nunder strategic manipulations of rewards, where each arm can modify the emitted\nreward signals for its own interest. This characterization of the adversarial\nbehavior is a relaxation of previously well-studied settings such as\nadversarial attacks and adversarial corruption. We propose a strategic variant\nof the combinatorial UCB algorithm, which has a regret of at most $O(m\\log T +\nm B_{max})$ under strategic manipulations, where $T$ is the time horizon, $m$\nis the number of arms, and $B_{max}$ is the maximum budget of an arm. We\nprovide lower bounds on the budget for arms to incur certain regret of the\nbandit algorithm.

          "description": "Training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a strict Lipschitz\nconstraint under the l_{2} norm is useful for provable adversarial robustness,\ninterpretable gradients and stable training. While 1-Lipschitz CNNs can be\ndesigned by enforcing a 1-Lipschitz constraint on each layer, training such\nnetworks requires each layer to have an orthogonal Jacobian matrix (for all\ninputs) to prevent gradients from vanishing during backpropagation. A layer\nwith this property is said to be Gradient Norm Preserving (GNP). To construct\nexpressive GNP activation functions, we first prove that the Jacobian of any\nGNP piecewise linear function is only allowed to change via Householder\ntransformations for the function to be continuous. Building on this result, we\nintroduce a class of nonlinear GNP activations with learnable Householder\ntransformations called Householder activations. A householder activation\nparameterized by the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ outputs $(\\mathbf{I} -\n2\\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{v}^{T})\\mathbf{z}$ for its input $\\mathbf{z}$ if\n$\\mathbf{v}^{T}\\mathbf{z} \\leq 0$; otherwise it outputs $\\mathbf{z}$. Existing\nGNP activations such as $\\mathrm{MaxMin}$ can be viewed as special cases of\n$\\mathrm{HH}$ activations for certain settings of these transformations. Thus,\nnetworks with $\\mathrm{HH}$ activations have higher expressive power than those\nwith $\\mathrm{MaxMin}$ activations. Although networks with $\\mathrm{HH}$\nactivations have nontrivial provable robustness against adversarial attacks, we\nfurther boost their robustness by (i) introducing a certificate regularization\nand (ii) relaxing orthogonalization of the last layer of the network. Our\nexperiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our regularized networks with\n$\\mathrm{HH}$ activations lead to significant improvements in both the standard\nand provable robust accuracy over the prior works (gain of 3.65\\% and 4.46\\% on\nCIFAR-100 respectively).",

Our main\nresult shows that when the budget of the adversary scales sublinearly with the\nsample complexity, (improper) PAC learnability and certification are\nachievable; in contrast, when the adversary's budget grows linearly with the\nsample complexity, the adversary can potentially drive up the expected 0-1 loss\nto one. We also study distribution-specific PAC learning in the same attack\nmodel and show that proper learning with certification is possible for learning\nhalf spaces under natural distributions. Finally, we empirically study the\nrobustness of K nearest neighbour, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron,\nand convolutional neural network on real data sets against targeted-poisoning\nattacks.

          "description": "Using simulation to predict the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous\nmaterials has applications ranging from topology optimization to multi-scale\nstructural analysis. However, full-fidelity simulation techniques such as\nFinite Element Analysis can be prohibitively computationally expensive when\nthey are used to explore the massive input parameter space of heterogeneous\nmaterials. Therefore, there has been significant recent interest in machine\nlearning-based models that, once trained, can predict mechanical behavior at a\nfraction of the computational cost. Over the past several years, research in\nthis area has been focused mainly on predicting single Quantities of Interest\n(QoIs). However, there has recently been an increased interest in a more\nchallenging problem: predicting full-field QoI (e.g., displacement/strain\nfields, damage fields) for mechanical problems. Due to the added complexity of\nfull-field information, network architectures that perform well on single QoI\nproblems may perform poorly in the full-field QoI problem setting. The work\npresented in this paper is twofold. First, we made a significant extension to\nthe Mechanical MNIST dataset designed to enable the investigation of full field\nQoI prediction. Specifically, we added Finite Element simulation results of\nquasi-static brittle fracture in a heterogeneous material captured with the\nphase-field method. Second, we established strong baseline performance for\npredicting full-field QoI with MultiRes-WNet architecture. In addition to\npresenting the results in this paper, we have released our model implementation\nand the Mechanical MNIST Crack Path dataset under open-source licenses. We\nanticipate that future researchers will directly use our model architecture on\nrelated datasets and potentially design models that exceed the baseline\nperformance for predicting full-field QoI established in this paper.",

We use Hamiltonian\nMonte-Carlo to sample the posterior distribution of a deep and dense BNN, and\nshow that it is possible to accurately capture physics of varying complexity\nwithout overfitting. 2) Recover the parameters in the underlying partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) governing the physical system. Using the trained\nBNN as a surrogate of the system response, we generate datasets of derivatives\npotentially comprising the latent PDE of the observed system and perform a\nBayesian linear regression (BLR) between the successive derivatives in space\nand time to recover the original PDE parameters. We take advantage of the\nconfidence intervals on the BNN outputs and introduce the spatial derivative\nvariance into the BLR likelihood to discard the influence of highly uncertain\nsurrogate data points, which allows for more accurate parameter discovery. We\ndemonstrate our approach on a handful of example applied to physics and\nnon-linear dynamics.",

In this work, we build upon the deep support vector data description\nalgorithm and address multi-perspective anomaly detection using three different\nfusion techniques, i.e., early fusion, late fusion, and late fusion with\nmultiple decoders. We employ different augmentation techniques with a denoising\nprocess to deal with scarce one-class data, which further improves the\nperformance (ROC AUC $= 80\\%$).

However, as the dimension of the input vector of the embedding layer is\ntoo large, the addition of the embedding layer significantly slows down the\nconvergence speed of the entire neural network, which is not acceptable in\nreal-world scenarios. In addition, as the interaction between users and items\nincreases and the relationship between items becomes more complicated, the\nembedding method proposed for sequence data is no longer suitable for graphic\ndata in the current real environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the\nDual-modal Graph Embedding Method (DGEM) to solve these problems. DGEM includes\ntwo modes, static and dynamic. We first construct the item graph to extract the\ngraph structure and use random walk of unequal probability to capture the\nhigh-order proximity between the items.

The difficulty of\nfinding quality labels for problem instances holds back leveraging supervised\nlearning across combinatorial problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms\nhave recently been adopted to solve this challenge automatically. The\nunderlying principle of this approach is to deploy a graph neural network (GNN)\nfor encoding both the local information of the nodes and the graph-structured\ndata in order to capture the current state of the environment. Then, it is\nfollowed by the actor to learn the problem-specific heuristics on its own and\nmake an informed decision at each state for finally reaching a good solution.\nRecent studies on this subject mainly focus on a family of combinatorial\nproblems on the graph, such as the travel salesman problem, where the proposed\nmodel aims to find an ordering of vertices that optimizes a given objective\nfunction. We use the security-aware phone clone allocation in the cloud as a\nclassical quadratic assignment problem (QAP) to investigate whether or not deep\nRL-based model is generally applicable to solve other classes of such hard\nproblems.

In this\npaper, we address this challenge by proposing an adaptive anomaly detection\nscheme with hierarchical edge computing (HEC).

          "description": "Graph neural networks (GNN) analysis engines are vital for real-world\nproblems that use large graph models. Challenges for a GNN hardware platform\ninclude the ability to (a) host a variety of GNNs, (b) handle high sparsity in\ninput vertex feature vectors and the graph adjacency matrix and the\naccompanying random memory access patterns, and (c) maintain load-balanced\ncomputation in the face of uneven workloads, induced by high sparsity and\npower-law vertex degree distributions. This paper proposes GNNIE, an\naccelerator designed to run a broad range of GNNs. It tackles workload\nimbalance by (i)~splitting vertex feature operands into blocks, (ii)~reordering\nand redistributing computations, (iii)~using a novel flexible MAC architecture.\nIt adopts a graph-specific, degree-aware caching policy that is well suited to\nreal-world graph characteristics. The policy enhances on-chip data reuse and\navoids random memory access to DRAM.\n\nGNNIE achieves average speedups of 21233x over a CPU and 699x over a GPU over\nmultiple datasets on graph attention networks (GATs), graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCNs), GraphSAGE, GINConv, and DiffPool. Compared to prior\napproaches, GNNIE achieves an average speedup of 35x over HyGCN (which cannot\nimplement GATs) for GCN, GraphSAGE, and GINConv, and, using 3.4x fewer\nprocessing units, an average speedup of 2.1x over AWB-GCN (which runs only\nGCNs).",

          "description": "We introduce Pathfinder, a variational method for approximately sampling from\ndifferentiable log densities. Starting from a random initialization, Pathfinder\nlocates normal approximations to the target density along a quasi-Newton\noptimization path, with local covariance estimated using the inverse Hessian\nestimates produced by the optimizer. Pathfinder returns draws from the\napproximation with the lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the\ntrue posterior. We evaluate Pathfinder on a wide range of posterior\ndistributions, demonstrating that its approximate draws are better than those\nfrom automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) and comparable to\nthose produced by short chains of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as\nmeasured by 1-Wasserstein distance. Compared to ADVI and short dynamic HMC\nruns, Pathfinder requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer log density and\ngradient evaluations, with greater reductions for more challenging posteriors.\nImportance resampling over multiple runs of Pathfinder improves the diversity\nof approximate draws, reducing 1-Wasserstein distance further and providing a\nmeasure of robustness to optimization failures on plateaus, saddle points, or\nin minor modes. The Monte Carlo KL-divergence estimates are embarrassingly\nparallelizable in the core Pathfinder algorithm, as are multiple runs in the\nresampling version, further increasing Pathfinder's speed advantage with\nmultiple cores.",

Electrification in the transportation sector has led to\ntechnology shifts and rapid deployment of electric vehicles (EVs).

Realistic scenario generators can help operators prepare, and\nmachine learning can be leveraged to this end.

We show that\nthis model structure successfully parameterizes unlabeled temporal and power\npatterns without supervision and is able to generate synthetic data conditioned\non these parameters.

          "description": "With outstanding features, Machine Learning (ML) has been the backbone of\nnumerous applications in wireless networks. However, the conventional ML\napproaches have been facing many challenges in practical implementation, such\nas the lack of labeled data, the constantly changing wireless environments, the\nlong training process, and the limited capacity of wireless devices. These\nchallenges, if not addressed, will impede the effectiveness and applicability\nof ML in future wireless networks. To address these problems, Transfer Learning\n(TL) has recently emerged to be a very promising solution. The core idea of TL\nis to leverage and synthesize distilled knowledge from similar tasks as well as\nfrom valuable experiences accumulated from the past to facilitate the learning\nof new problems. Doing so, TL techniques can reduce the dependence on labeled\ndata, improve the learning speed, and enhance the ML methods' robustness to\ndifferent wireless environments. This article aims to provide a comprehensive\nsurvey on applications of TL in wireless networks. Particularly, we first\nprovide an overview of TL including formal definitions, classification, and\nvarious types of TL techniques. We then discuss diverse TL approaches proposed\nto address emerging issues in wireless networks. The issues include spectrum\nmanagement, localization, signal recognition, security, human activity\nrecognition and caching, which are all important to next-generation networks\nsuch as 5G and beyond. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues,\nand future research directions of TL in future wireless networks.",

          "description": "As one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning, statistics and\ndifferential privacy, Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization\n(DP-SCO) has been extensively studied in recent years. However, most of the\nprevious work can only handle either regular data distribution or irregular\ndata in the low dimensional space case. To better understand the challenges\narising from irregular data distribution, in this paper we provide the first\nstudy on the problem of DP-SCO with heavy-tailed data in the high dimensional\nspace. In the first part we focus on the problem over some polytope constraint\n(such as the $\\ell_1$-norm ball). We show that if the loss function is smooth\nand its gradient has bounded second order moment, it is possible to get a (high\nprobability) error bound (excess population risk) of $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{\\log\nd}{(n\\epsilon)^\\frac{1}{3}})$ in the $\\epsilon$-DP model, where $n$ is the\nsample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the underlying space. Next, for\nLASSO, if the data distribution that has bounded fourth-order moments, we\nimprove the bound to $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{\\log d}{(n\\epsilon)^\\frac{2}{5}})$ in the\n$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP model. In the second part of the paper, we study sparse\nlearning with heavy-tailed data. We first revisit the sparse linear model and\npropose a truncated DP-IHT method whose output could achieve an error of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{s^{*2}\\log d}{n\\epsilon})$, where $s^*$ is the sparsity of the\nunderlying parameter. Then we study a more general problem over the sparsity\n({\\em i.e.,} $\\ell_0$-norm) constraint, and show that it is possible to achieve\nan error of $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{s^{*\\frac{3}{2}}\\log d}{n\\epsilon})$, which is\nalso near optimal up to a factor of $\\tilde{O}{(\\sqrt{s^*})}$, if the loss\nfunction is smooth and strongly convex.",

          "description": "The activation function is at the heart of a deep neural networks\nnonlinearity; the choice of the function has great impact on the success of\ntraining. Currently, many practitioners prefer the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)\ndue to its simplicity and reliability, despite its few drawbacks. While most\nprevious functions proposed to supplant ReLU have been hand-designed, recent\nwork on learning the function during training has shown promising results. In\nthis paper we propose an adaptive piecewise linear activation function, the\nPiecewise Linear Unit (PiLU), which can be learned independently for each\ndimension of the neural network. We demonstrate how PiLU is a generalised\nrectifier unit and note its similarities with the Adaptive Piecewise Linear\nUnits, namely adaptive and piecewise linear. Across a distribution of 30\nexperiments, we show that for the same model architecture, hyperparameters, and\npre-processing, PiLU significantly outperforms ReLU: reducing classification\nerror by 18.53% on CIFAR-10 and 13.13% on CIFAR-100, for a minor increase in\nthe number of neurons.

Feature similarity includes both the\ninvariance of marginal distributions and the closeness of conditional\ndistributions given the desired response $y$ (e.g., class labels).\nUnfortunately, traditional methods always learn such features without fully\ntaking into consideration the information in $y$, which in turn may lead to a\nmismatch of the conditional distributions or the mix-up of discriminative\nstructures underlying data distributions. In this work, we introduce the\nrecently proposed von Neumann conditional divergence to improve the\ntransferability across multiple domains. We show that this new divergence is\ndifferentiable and eligible to easily quantify the functional dependence\nbetween features and $y$. Given multiple source tasks, we integrate this\ndivergence to capture discriminative information in $y$ and design novel\nlearning objectives assuming those source tasks are observed either\nsimultaneously or sequentially. In both scenarios, we obtain favorable\nperformance against state-of-the-art methods in terms of smaller generalization\nerror on new tasks and less catastrophic forgetting on source tasks (in the\nsequential setup).",

Inspired by recent\nwork of the author [E. Tang, STOC'19], we introduce such a model, where we\nassume we can efficiently perform $\\ell^2$-norm samples of input data, a\nnatural analogue to quantum algorithms that assume efficient state preparation\nof classical data. Though this model produces less practical algorithms than\nthe (stronger) standard model of classical computation, it captures versions of\nmany of the features and nuances of quantum linear algebra algorithms.

          "description": "This paper investigates the possibility of creating a machine learning tool\nthat automatically determines the state of mind and emotion of an individual\nthrough a questionnaire, without the aid of a human expert. The state of mind\nand emotion is defined in this work as pertaining to preference, feelings, or\nopinion that is not based on logic or reason. It is the case when a person\ngives out an answer to start by saying, \"I feel...\". The tool is designed to\nmimic the expertise of a psychologist and is built without any formal knowledge\nof psychology. The idea is to build the expertise by purely computational\nmethods through thousands of questions collected from users. It is aimed\ntowards possibly diagnosing substance addiction, alcoholism, sexual attraction,\nHIV status, degree of commitment, activity inclination, etc. First, the paper\npresents the related literature and classifies them according to data gathering\nmethods. Another classification is created according to preference, emotion,\ngrouping, and rules to achieve a deeper interpretation and better understanding\nof the state of mind and emotion. Second, the proposed tool is developed using\nan online addiction questionnaire with 10 questions and 292 respondents. In\naddition, an initial investigation on the dimension of addiction is presented\nthrough the built machine learning model. Machine learning methods, namely,\nartificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), are used to\ndetermine a true or false or degree of state of a respondent.",

          "description": "Decision forests (Forests), in particular random forests and gradient\nboosting trees, have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other\nmethods in many supervised learning scenarios. In particular, Forests dominate\nother methods in tabular data, that is, when the feature space is unstructured,\nso that the signal is invariant to a permutation of the feature indices.\nHowever, in structured data lying on a manifold (such as images, text, and\nspeech) deep networks (Networks), specifically convolutional deep networks\n(ConvNets), tend to outperform Forests. We conjecture that at least part of the\nreason for this is that the input to Networks is not simply the feature\nmagnitudes, but also their indices. In contrast, naive Forest implementations\nfail to explicitly consider feature indices. A recently proposed Forest\napproach demonstrates that Forests, for each node, implicitly sample a random\nmatrix from some specific distribution. These Forests, like some classes of\nNetworks, learn by partitioning the feature space into convex polytopes\ncorresponding to linear functions. We build on that approach and show that one\ncan choose distributions in a manifold-aware fashion to incorporate feature\nlocality. We demonstrate the empirical performance on data whose features live\non three different manifolds: a torus, images, and time-series. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate its strength in multivariate simulated settings and also show\nsuperiority in predicting surgical outcome in epilepsy patients and predicting\nmovement direction from raw stereotactic EEG data from non-motor brain regions.\nIn all simulations and real data, Manifold Oblique Random Forest (MORF)\nalgorithm outperforms approaches that ignore feature space structure and\nchallenges the performance of ConvNets. Moreover, MORF runs fast and maintains\ninterpretability and theoretical justification.",

Intraoperative diagnosis\ncan be challenging due to tumor diversity and lack of intraoperative pathology\nresources.\n\nObjective: To develop an independent and parallel intraoperative pathology\nworkflow that can provide rapid and accurate skull base tumor diagnoses using\nlabel-free optical imaging and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMethod: We used a fiber laser-based, label-free, non-consumptive,\nhigh-resolution microscopy method ($<$ 60 sec per 1 $\\times$ 1 mm$^\\text{2}$),\ncalled stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a consecutive, multicenter\ncohort of skull base tumor patients. SRH images were then used to train a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) model using three representation learning\nstrategies: cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised\ncontrastive learning. Our trained CNN models were tested on a held-out,\nmulticenter SRH dataset.\n\nResults: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of both benign and\nmalignant skull base tumors. Of the three representation learning strategies,\nsupervised contrastive learning most effectively learned the distinctive and\ndiagnostic SRH image features for each of the skull base tumor types. In our\nmulticenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy\nof 91.5%, self-supervised contrastive learning 83.9%, and supervised\ncontrastive learning 96.6%.

This results in a large\nperformance boost to distinguish between standard model (SM) only and SM plus\nnew physics signals. We use the kinematic monojet features as input data which\nallow us to describe families of models with a single data sample. We found\nthat the neural network performance does not depend on the simulated number of\nbackground events if they are presented as a function of $S/\\sqrt{B}$, where\n$S$ and $B$ are the number of signal and background events per histogram,\nrespectively. This provides flexibility to the method, since testing a\nparticular model in that case only requires knowing the new physics monojet\ncross section. Furthermore, we also discuss the network performance under\nincorrect assumptions about the true DM nature.

Domain experts are interested in error measures\nrelevant for their decision making needs. Such measures may produce unreliable\nresults. Although reliability properties of several metrics have already been\ndiscussed, it has hardly been quantified in an objective way. We propose a\nmeasure named Rank Stability, which evaluates how much the rankings of an\nexperiment differ in between similar datasets, when the models and errors are\nconstant. We use this to study the evaluation setup of the M5. We find that the\nevaluation setup of the M5 is less reliable than other measures. The main\ndrivers of instability are hierarchical aggregation and scaling.\nPrice-weighting reduces the stability of all tested error measures. Scale\nnormalization of the M5 error measure results in less stability than other\nscale-free errors. Hierarchical levels taken separately are less stable with\nmore aggregation, and their combination is even less stable than individual\nlevels. We also show positive tradeoffs of retaining aggregation importance\nwithout affecting stability. Aggregation and stability can be linked to the\ninfluence of much debated magic numbers.

          "description": "Multivariate time series anomaly detection is a very common problem in the\nfield of failure prevention. Fast prevention means lower repair costs and\nlosses. The amount of sensors in novel industry systems makes the anomaly\ndetection process quite difficult for humans. Algorithms which automates the\nprocess of detecting anomalies are crucial in modern failure-prevention\nsystems. Therefore, many machine and deep learning models have been designed to\naddress this problem. Mostly, they are autoencoder-based architectures with\nsome generative adversarial elements. In this work, a framework is shown which\nincorporates neuroevolution methods to boost the anomaly-detection scores of\nnew and already known models. The presented approach adapts evolution\nstrategies for evolving ensemble model, in which every single model works on a\nsubgroup of data sensors. The next goal of neuroevolution is to optimise\narchitecture and hyperparameters like window size, the number of layers, layer\ndepths, etc. The proposed framework shows that it is possible to boost most of\nthe anomaly detection deep learning models in a reasonable time and a fully\nautomated mode. The tests were run on SWAT and WADI datasets. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first approach in which an ensemble deep learning anomaly detection\nmodel is built in a fully automatic way using a neuroevolution strategy.",

          "description": "We consider the question: what is the abstraction that should be implemented\nby the computational engine of a machine learning system? Current machine\nlearning systems typically push whole tensors through a series of compute\nkernels such as matrix multiplications or activation functions, where each\nkernel runs on an AI accelerator (ASIC) such as a GPU. This implementation\nabstraction provides little built-in support for ML systems to scale past a\nsingle machine, or for handling large models with matrices or tensors that do\nnot easily fit into the RAM of an ASIC. In this paper, we present an\nalternative implementation abstraction called the tensor relational algebra\n(TRA). The TRA is a set-based algebra based on the relational algebra.\nExpressions in the TRA operate over binary tensor relations, where keys are\nmulti-dimensional arrays and values are tensors. The TRA is easily executed\nwith high efficiency in a parallel or distributed environment, and amenable to\nautomatic optimization. Our empirical study shows that the optimized TRA-based\nback-end can significantly outperform alternatives for running ML workflows in\ndistributed clusters.",
