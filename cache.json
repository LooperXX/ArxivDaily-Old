          "description": "This paper describes our system at NLPTEA-2020 Task: Chinese Grammatical\nError Diagnosis (CGED). The goal of CGED is to diagnose four types of\ngrammatical errors: word selection (S), redundant words (R), missing words (M),\nand disordered words (W). The automatic CGED system contains two parts\nincluding error detection and error correction and our system is designed to\nsolve the error detection problem. Our system is built on three models: 1) a\nBERT-based model leveraging syntactic information; 2) a BERT-based model\nleveraging contextual embeddings; 3) a lexicon-based graph neural network\nleveraging lexical information. We also design an ensemble mechanism to improve\nthe single model's performance. Finally, our system achieves the highest F1\nscores at detection level and identification level among all teams\nparticipating in the CGED 2020 task.",

          "description": "Prior works have demonstrated that a low-resource language pair can benefit\nfrom multilingual machine translation (MT) systems, which rely on many language\npairs' joint training. This paper proposes two simple strategies to address the\nrare word issue in multilingual MT systems for two low-resource language pairs:\nFrench-Vietnamese and English-Vietnamese. The first strategy is about dynamical\nlearning word similarity of tokens in the shared space among source languages\nwhile another one attempts to augment the translation ability of rare words\nthrough updating their embeddings during the training. Besides, we leverage\nmonolingual data for multilingual MT systems to increase the amount of\nsynthetic parallel corpora while dealing with the data sparsity problem. We\nhave shown significant improvements of up to +1.62 and +2.54 BLEU points over\nthe bilingual baseline systems for both language pairs and released our\ndatasets for the research community.",

          "description": "In recent years online shopping has gained momentum and became an important\nvenue for customers wishing to save time and simplify their shopping process. A\nkey advantage of shopping online is the ability to read what other customers\nare saying about products of interest. In this work, we aim to maintain this\nadvantage in situations where extreme brevity is needed, for example, when\nshopping by voice. We suggest a novel task of extracting a single\nrepresentative helpful sentence from a set of reviews for a given product. The\nselected sentence should meet two conditions: first, it should be helpful for a\npurchase decision and second, the opinion it expresses should be supported by\nmultiple reviewers. This task is closely related to the task of Multi Document\nSummarization in the product reviews domain but differs in its objective and\nits level of conciseness. We collect a dataset in English of sentence\nhelpfulness scores via crowd-sourcing and demonstrate its reliability despite\nthe inherent subjectivity involved. Next, we describe a complete model that\nextracts representative helpful sentences with positive and negative sentiment\ntowards the product and demonstrate that it outperforms several baselines.",

          "description": "We introduce a novel embedding model, named NoGE, which aims to integrate\nco-occurrence among entities and relations into graph neural networks to\nimprove knowledge graph completion (i.e., link prediction). Given a knowledge\ngraph, NoGE constructs a single graph considering entities and relations as\nindividual nodes. NoGE then computes weights for edges among nodes based on the\nco-occurrence of entities and relations. Next, NoGE proposes Dual Quaternion\nGraph Neural Networks (Dual-QGNN) and utilizes Dual-QGNN to update vector\nrepresentations for entity and relation nodes. NoGE then adopts a score\nfunction to produce the triple scores. Comprehensive experimental results show\nthat NoGE obtains state-of-the-art results on three new and difficult benchmark\ndatasets CoDEx for knowledge graph completion.",

          "description": "End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) has recently attracted\nincreasing interest. Compared to the conventional tandem-based approach that\ncombines speech recognition and language understanding as separate modules, the\nnew approach extracts users' intentions directly from the speech signals,\nresulting in joint optimization and low latency. Such an approach, however, is\ntypically designed to process one intention at a time, which leads users to\ntake multiple rounds to fulfill their requirements while interacting with a\ndialogue system. In this paper, we propose a streaming end-to-end framework\nthat can process multiple intentions in an online and incremental way. The\nbackbone of our framework is a unidirectional RNN trained with the\nconnectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an\nintention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and\nmultiple intentions can be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on\nthe Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the intent detection accuracy is\nabout 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the\nperformance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an\nonline and incremental way. We also employ our model to a keyword spotting task\nusing the Google Speech Commands dataset and the results are also highly\npromising.",

Extensive research has been carried out\nin this field and near-perfect results are achieved by recent transformer-based\nmodels in existing benchmark datasets like the STS dataset and the SICK\ndataset.

We build a complex sentences dataset comprising of 50 sentence\npairs with associated semantic similarity values provided by 15 human\nannotators. Readability analysis is performed to highlight the increase in\ncomplexity of the sentences in the existing benchmark datasets and those in the\nproposed dataset. Further, we perform a comparative analysis of the performance\nof various word embeddings and language models on the existing benchmark\ndatasets and the proposed dataset.

          "description": "Due to the excessive cost of large-scale language model pre-training,\nconsiderable efforts have been made to train BERT progressively -- start from\nan inferior but low-cost model and gradually grow the model to increase the\ncomputational complexity. Our objective is to advance the understanding of\nTransformer growth and discover principles that guide progressive training.\nFirst, we find that similar to network architecture search, Transformer growth\nalso favors compound scaling. Specifically, while existing methods only conduct\nnetwork growth in a single dimension, we observe that it is beneficial to use\ncompound growth operators and balance multiple dimensions (e.g., depth, width,\nand input length of the model). Moreover, we explore alternative growth\noperators in each dimension via controlled comparison to give operator\nselection practical guidance. In light of our analyses, the proposed method\nspeeds up BERT pre-training by 73.6% and 82.2% for the base and large models\nrespectively, while achieving comparable performances",

          "description": "We propose a semi-supervised learning method for building end-to-end rich\ntranscription-style automatic speech recognition (RT-ASR) systems from\nsmall-scale rich transcription-style and large-scale common transcription-style\ndatasets. In spontaneous speech tasks, various speech phenomena such as\nfillers, word fragments, laughter and coughs, etc. are often included. While\ncommon transcriptions do not give special awareness to these phenomena, rich\ntranscriptions explicitly convert them into special phenomenon tokens as well\nas textual tokens. In previous studies, the textual and phenomenon tokens were\nsimultaneously estimated in an end-to-end manner. However, it is difficult to\nbuild accurate RT-ASR systems because large-scale rich transcription-style\ndatasets are often unavailable. To solve this problem, our training method uses\na limited rich transcription-style dataset and common transcription-style\ndataset simultaneously. The Key process in our semi-supervised learning is to\nconvert the common transcription-style dataset into a pseudo-rich\ntranscription-style dataset. To this end, we introduce style tokens which\ncontrol phenomenon tokens are generated or not into transformer-based\nautoregressive modeling. We use this modeling for generating the pseudo-rich\ntranscription-style datasets and for building RT-ASR system from the pseudo and\noriginal datasets.

Core component of the decoding algorithm is a\nprocess of maximization of a fitness function which aims to find most optimal\nset of substitution rules allowing to transcribe the part of the manuscript --\nwhich we call the Calendar -- into lists of feminine names. This leads to sets\nof character subsitution rules which allow us to consistently transcribe dozens\namong three hundred calendar tokens into feminine names: a result far\nsurpassing both ``popular'' as well as \"state of the art\" tentatives to crack\nthe manuscript. What's more, by using name lists stemming from different\nlanguages as potential cribs, our ``adaptive'' method can also be useful in\nidentification of the language in which the manuscript is written.\n\nAs far as we can currently tell, results of our experiments indicate that the\nCalendar part of the manuscript contains names from baltoslavic, balkanic or\nhebrew language strata. Two further indications are also given: primo, highest\nfitness values were obtained when the crib list contains names with specific\ninfixes at token's penultimate position as is the case, for example, for slavic\n\\textbf{feminine diminutives} (i.e. names ending with -ka and not -a). In the\nmost successful scenario, 240 characters contained in 35 distinct Voynichese\ntokens were successfully transcribed. Secundo, in case of crib stemming from\nHebrew language, whole adaptation process converges to significantly better\nfitness values when transcribing voynichian tokens whose order of individual\ncharacters have been reversed, and when lists feminine and not masculine names\nare used as the crib.",

          "description": "Traditional computer vision approaches, based on neural networks (NN), are\ntypically trained on a large amount of image data. By minimizing the\ncross-entropy loss between a prediction and a given class label, the NN and its\nvisual embedding space are learned to fulfill a given task. However, due to the\nsole dependence on the image data distribution of the training domain, these\nmodels tend to fail when applied to a target domain that differs from their\nsource domain. To learn a more robust NN to domain shifts, we propose the\nknowledge graph neural network (KG-NN), a neuro-symbolic approach that\nsupervises the training using image-data-invariant auxiliary knowledge. The\nauxiliary knowledge is first encoded in a knowledge graph with respective\nconcepts and their relationships, which is then transformed into a dense vector\nrepresentation via an embedding method. Using a contrastive loss function,\nKG-NN learns to adapt its visual embedding space and thus its weights according\nto the image-data invariant knowledge graph embedding space. We evaluate KG-NN\non visual transfer learning tasks for classification using the mini-ImageNet\ndataset and its derivatives, as well as road sign recognition datasets from\nGermany and China. The results show that a visual model trained with a\nknowledge graph as a trainer outperforms a model trained with cross-entropy in\nall experiments, in particular when the domain gap increases. Besides better\nperformance and stronger robustness to domain shifts, these KG-NN adapts to\nmultiple datasets and classes without suffering heavily from catastrophic\nforgetting.",

However, research in this field has not received\nsufficient attention and extracting useful information is still challenging.\nThis paper aims to improve disaster relief efficiency via mining and analyzing\nsocial media data like public attitudes towards disaster response and public\ndemands for targeted relief supplies during different types of disasters. We\nfocus on different natural disasters based on properties such as types,\ndurations, and damages, which contains a total of 41,993 tweets. In this paper,\npublic perception is assessed qualitatively by manually classified tweets,\nwhich contain information like the demand for targeted relief supplies,\nsatisfactions of disaster response, and public fear. Public attitudes to\nnatural disasters are studied via a quantitative analysis using eight machine\nlearning models. To better provide decision-makers with the appropriate model,\nthe comparison of machine learning models based on computational time and\nprediction accuracy is conducted. The change of public opinion during different\nnatural disasters and the evolution of people's behavior of using social media\nfor disaster relief in the face of the identical type of natural disasters as\nTwitter continues to evolve are studied. The results in this paper demonstrate\nthe feasibility and validation of the proposed research approach and provide\nrelief agencies with insights into better disaster management.",

However, at present, there is no coherent framework for applying\nstate-of-the-art models for Danish. We present DaCy: a unified framework for\nDanish NLP built on SpaCy. DaCy uses efficient multitask models which obtain\nstate-of-the-art performance on named entity recognition, part-of-speech\ntagging, and dependency parsing. DaCy contains tools for easy integration of\nexisting models such as for polarity, emotion, or subjectivity detection. In\naddition, we conduct a series of tests for biases and robustness of Danish NLP\npipelines through augmentation of the test set of DaNE. DaCy large compares\nfavorably and is especially robust to long input lengths and spelling\nvariations and errors. All models except DaCy large display significant biases\nrelated to ethnicity while only Polyglot shows a significant gender bias. We\nargue that for languages with limited benchmark sets, data augmentation can be\nparticularly useful for obtaining more realistic and fine-grained performance\nestimates.

The proposed framework is based on the idea of\npartial fine-tuning, i.e. only fine-tune some top layers of BERT while keep the\nother layers frozen. For each task, we train independently a single-task (ST)\nmodel using partial fine-tuning. Then we compress the task-specific layers in\neach ST model using knowledge distillation. Those compressed ST models are\nfinally merged into one MT model so that the frozen layers of the former are\nshared across the tasks. We exemplify our approach on eight GLUE tasks,\ndemonstrating that it is able to achieve both strong performance and\nefficiency.

Moreover, the use of multi-task learning can improve the\nquality of generated texts, when the classification task is appropriate. And we\npropose a function to initialize the hidden state of CatVRNN to force model to\ngenerate texts of a specific category.

          "description": "The use of phonological features (PFs) potentially allows language-specific\nphones to remain linked in training, which is highly desirable for information\nsharing for multilingual and crosslingual speech recognition methods for\nlow-resourced languages. A drawback suffered by previous methods in using\nphonological features is that the acoustic-to-PF extraction in a bottom-up way\nis itself difficult. In this paper, we propose to join phonology driven phone\nembedding (top-down) and deep neural network (DNN) based acoustic feature\nextraction (bottom-up) to calculate phone probabilities. The new method is\ncalled JoinAP (Joining of Acoustics and Phonology). Remarkably, no inversion\nfrom acoustics to phonological features is required for speech recognition. For\neach phone in the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) table, we encode its\nphonological features to a phonological-vector, and then apply linear or\nnonlinear transformation of the phonological-vector to obtain the phone\nembedding. A series of multilingual and crosslingual (both zero-shot and\nfew-shot) speech recognition experiments are conducted on the CommonVoice\ndataset (German, French, Spanish and Italian) and the AISHLL-1 dataset\n(Mandarin), and demonstrate the superiority of JoinAP with nonlinear phone\nembeddings over both JoinAP with linear phone embeddings and the traditional\nmethod with flat phone embeddings.",

          "description": "Most recently proposed approaches in dialogue state tracking (DST) leverage\nthe context and the last dialogue states to track current dialogue states,\nwhich are often slot-value pairs. Although the context contains the complete\ndialogue information, the information is usually indirect and even requires\nreasoning to obtain. The information in the lastly predicted dialogue states is\ndirect, but when there is a prediction error, the dialogue information from\nthis source will be incomplete or erroneous. In this paper, we propose the\nDialogue State Tracking with Multi-Level Fusion of Predicted Dialogue States\nand Conversations network (FPDSC). This model extracts information of each\ndialogue turn by modeling interactions among each turn utterance, the\ncorresponding last dialogue states, and dialogue slots. Then the representation\nof each dialogue turn is aggregated by a hierarchical structure to form the\npassage information, which is utilized in the current turn of DST. Experimental\nresults validate the effectiveness of the fusion network with 55.03% and 59.07%\njoint accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.1 datasets, which reaches the\nstate-of-the-art performance.

          "description": "It is beneficial to automate the process of deriving concept hierarchies from\ncorpora since a manual construction of concept hierarchies is typically a\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive process. As such, the overall process of\nlearning concept hierarchies from corpora encompasses a set of steps: parsing\nthe text into sentences, splitting the sentences and then tokenising it. After\nthe lemmatisation step, the pairs are extracted using FCA. However, there might\nbe some uninteresting and erroneous pairs in the formal context. Generating\nformal context may lead to a time-consuming process, so formal context size\nreduction is required to remove uninterested and erroneous pairs, taking less\ntime to extract the concept lattice and concept hierarchies accordingly. In\nthis premise, this study aims to propose two frameworks: (1) A framework to\nreview the current process of deriving concept hierarchies from corpus\nutilising FCA; (2) A framework to decrease the formal contexts ambiguity of the\nfirst framework using an adaptive version of ECA*. Experiments are conducted by\napplying 385 sample corpora from Wikipedia on the two frameworks to examine the\nreducing size of formal context, which leads to yield concept lattice and\nconcept hierarchy. The resulting lattice of formal context is evaluated to the\nstandard one using concept lattice-invariants. Accordingly, the homomorphic\nbetween the two lattices preserves the quality of resulting concept hierarchies\nby 89% in contrast to the basic ones, and the reduced concept lattice inherits\nthe structural relation of the standard one. The adaptive ECA* is examined\nagainst its four counterpart baseline algorithms to measure the execution time\non random datasets with different densities (fill ratios). The results show\nthat adaptive ECA* performs concept lattice faster than other mentioned\ncompetitive techniques in different fill ratios.",

The SQA task considered in this paper is to extract the answer from a\ncandidate$\\text{'}$s spoken response to a question in a prompt-response style\nlanguage assessment test. Applying these MC approaches to this SQA task rather\nthan, for example, off-topic response detection provides far more detailed\ninformation that can be used for further downstream processing. One significant\nchallenge is the lack of appropriately annotated speech corpora to train\nsystems for this task. Hence, a transfer-learning style approach is adopted\nwhere a system trained on text-based MC is evaluated on an SQA task with\nnon-native speakers. Mismatches must be considered between text documents and\nspoken responses; non-native spoken grammar and written grammar. In practical\nSQA, ASR systems are used, necessitating an investigation of the impact of ASR\nerrors. We show that a simple text-based ELECTRA MC model trained on SQuAD2.0\ntransfers well for SQA.

We extend the theories about adding noise to the input\nand prove that our method gives a stabler regularization effect. We provide\nsupportive evidence by experimentally confirming that well-performing models\nshow a low sensitivity to noise and fine-tuning with LNSR exhibits clearly\nhigher generalizability and stability. Furthermore, our method also\ndemonstrates advantages over other state-of-the-art algorithms including L2-SP\n(Li et al., 2018), Mixout (Lee et al., 2020) and SMART (Jiang et al., 2020).",

However, leveraging topic-word distribution for learning better\nfeatures during document encoding has not been explored much. To this end, we\ndevelop a framework TAN-NTM, which processes document as a sequence of tokens\nthrough a LSTM whose contextual outputs are attended in a topic-aware manner.\nWe propose a novel attention mechanism which factors in topic-word distribution\nto enable the model to attend on relevant words that convey topic related cues.\nThe output of topic attention module is then used to carry out variational\ninference. We perform extensive ablations and experiments resulting in ~9-15\npercentage improvement over score of existing SOTA topic models in NPMI\ncoherence on several benchmark datasets - 20Newsgroups, Yelp Review Polarity\nand AGNews.

          "description": "Data-to-Text Generation (DTG) is a subfield of Natural Language Generation\naiming at transcribing structured data in natural language descriptions. The\nfield has been recently boosted by the use of neural-based generators which\nexhibit on one side great syntactic skills without the need of hand-crafted\npipelines; on the other side, the quality of the generated text reflects the\nquality of the training data, which in realistic settings only offer\nimperfectly aligned structure-text pairs. Consequently, state-of-art neural\nmodels include misleading statements - usually called hallucinations - in their\noutputs. The control of this phenomenon is today a major challenge for DTG, and\nis the problem addressed in the paper.\n\nPrevious work deal with this issue at the instance level: using an alignment\nscore for each table-reference pair. In contrast, we propose a finer-grained\napproach, arguing that hallucinations should rather be treated at the word\nlevel. Specifically, we propose a Multi-Branch Decoder which is able to\nleverage word-level labels to learn the relevant parts of each training\ninstance. These labels are obtained following a simple and efficient scoring\nprocedure based on co-occurrence analysis and dependency parsing. Extensive\nevaluations, via automated metrics and human judgment on the standard WikiBio\nbenchmark, show the accuracy of our alignment labels and the effectiveness of\nthe proposed Multi-Branch Decoder. Our model is able to reduce and control\nhallucinations, while keeping fluency and coherence in generated texts.

          "description": "An important research direction in automatic speech recognition (ASR) has\ncentered around the development of effective methods to rerank the output\nhypotheses of an ASR system with more sophisticated language models (LMs) for\nfurther gains. A current mainstream school of thoughts for ASR N-best\nhypothesis reranking is to employ a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based LM or\nits variants, with performance superiority over the conventional n-gram LMs\nacross a range of ASR tasks. In real scenarios such as a long conversation, a\nsequence of consecutive sentences may jointly contain ample cues of\nconversation-level information such as topical coherence, lexical entrainment\nand adjacency pairs, which however remains to be underexplored. In view of\nthis, we first formulate ASR N-best reranking as a prediction problem, putting\nforward an effective cross-sentence neural LM approach that reranks the ASR\nN-best hypotheses of an upcoming sentence by taking into consideration the word\nusage in its precedent sentences. Furthermore, we also explore to extract\ntask-specific global topical information of the cross-sentence history in an\nunsupervised manner for better ASR performance.

The samples are generated from 3,539 multiple-choice questions\nwith the least amount of annotator interventions in a way similar to the\nSciTail dataset. A carefully designed multi-step process is adopted to ensure\nthe quality of the dataset. We also present the results of traditional and\nstate-of-the-art methods on FarsTail including di erent embedding methods such\nas word2vec, fastText, ELMo, BERT, and LASER, as well as di erent modeling\napproaches such as DecompAtt, ESIM, HBMP, and ULMFiT to provide a solid\nbaseline for the future research. The best obtained test accuracy is 83.38%\nwhich shows that there is a big room for improving the current methods to be\nuseful for real-world NLP applications in di erent languages. We also\ninvestigate the extent to which the models exploit super cial clues, also known\nas dataset biases, in FarsTail, and partition the test set into easy and hard\nsubsets according to the success of biased models. The dataset is available at\nhttps://github.com/dml-qom/ FarsTail.",

          "description": "Automatic evaluation metrics are a crucial component of dialog systems\nresearch. Standard language evaluation metrics are known to be ineffective for\nevaluating dialog. As such, recent research has proposed a number of novel,\ndialog-specific metrics that correlate better with human judgements. Due to the\nfast pace of research, many of these metrics have been assessed on different\ndatasets and there has as yet been no time for a systematic comparison between\nthem. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of recently\nproposed dialog evaluation metrics on a number of datasets. In this paper, 23\ndifferent automatic evaluation metrics are evaluated on 10 different datasets.\nFurthermore, the metrics are assessed in different settings, to better qualify\ntheir respective strengths and weaknesses. Metrics are assessed (1) on both the\nturn level and the dialog level, (2) for different dialog lengths, (3) for\ndifferent dialog qualities (e.g., coherence, engaging), (4) for different types\nof response generation models (i.e., generative, retrieval, simple models and\nstate-of-the-art models), (5) taking into account the similarity of different\nmetrics and (6) exploring combinations of different metrics. This comprehensive\nassessment offers several takeaways pertaining to dialog evaluation metrics in\ngeneral. It also suggests how to best assess evaluation metrics and indicates\npromising directions for future work.",

          "description": "Natural language is perhaps the most flexible and intuitive way for humans to\ncommunicate tasks to a robot. Prior work in imitation learning typically\nrequires each task be specified with a task id or goal image -- something that\nis often impractical in open-world environments. On the other hand, previous\napproaches in instruction following allow agent behavior to be guided by\nlanguage, but typically assume structure in the observations, actuators, or\nlanguage that limit their applicability to complex settings like robotics. In\nthis work, we present a method for incorporating free-form natural language\nconditioning into imitation learning. Our approach learns perception from\npixels, natural language understanding, and multitask continuous control\nend-to-end as a single neural network. Unlike prior work in imitation learning,\nour method is able to incorporate unlabeled and unstructured demonstration data\n(i.e. no task or language labels). We show this dramatically improves language\nconditioned performance, while reducing the cost of language annotation to less\nthan 1% of total data. At test time, a single language conditioned visuomotor\npolicy trained with our method can perform a wide variety of robotic\nmanipulation skills in a 3D environment, specified only with natural language\ndescriptions of each task (e.g. \"open the drawer...now pick up the block...now\npress the green button...\"). To scale up the number of instructions an agent\ncan follow, we propose combining text conditioned policies with large\npretrained neural language models. We find this allows a policy to be robust to\nmany out-of-distribution synonym instructions, without requiring new\ndemonstrations.

A growing body of research directs this goal towards augmenting the\ncreative writing abilities of human authors. In this paper, we pursue this\nobjective by analyzing how observing examples of automatically generated text\ninfluences writing. In particular, we examine a task referred to as sentence\ninfilling, which involves transforming a list of words into a complete\nsentence. We emphasize \"storiability\" as a desirable feature of the resulting\nsentences, where \"storiable\" sentences are those that suggest a story a reader\nwould be curious to hear about. Both humans and an automated system (based on a\nneural language model) performed this sentence infilling task. In one setting,\npeople wrote sentences on their own; in a different setting, people observed\nthe sentences produced by the model while writing their own sentences. Readers\nthen assigned storiability preferences to the resulting sentences in a\nsubsequent evaluation. We find that human-authored sentences were judged as\nmore storiable when authors observed the generated examples, and that\nstoriability increased as authors derived more semantic content from the\nexamples. This result gives evidence of an \"inspiration through observation\"\nparadigm for human-computer collaborative writing, through which human writing\ncan be enhanced by text generation models without directly copying their\noutput.",

Yet abbreviations\npresent particular challenges to computational approaches such as handwritten\ntext recognition and natural language processing tasks. Often, pre-processing\nultimately aims to lead from a digitised image of the source to a normalised\ntext, which includes expansion of the abbreviations. We explore different\nsetups to obtain such a normalised text, either directly, by training HTR\nengines on normalised (i.e., expanded, disabbreviated) text, or by decomposing\nthe process into discrete steps, each making use of specialist models for\nrecognition, word segmentation and normalisation. The case studies considered\nhere are drawn from the medieval Latin tradition.",

Most recent work uses direct supervision on the\ntask; we show that by simply finetuning a RoBERTa model, we can achieve a near\nperfect accuracy of 97.8%, a state-of-the-art. We argue that this outstanding\nperformance is unlikely to lead to a good model of text coherence, and suggest\nthat the Shuffle Test should be approached in a Zero-Shot setting: models\nshould be evaluated without being trained on the task itself. We evaluate\ncommon models in this setting, such as Generative and Bi-directional\nTransformers, and find that larger architectures achieve high-performance\nout-of-the-box. Finally, we suggest the k-Block Shuffle Test, a modification of\nthe original by increasing the size of blocks shuffled. Even though human\nreader performance remains high (around 95% accuracy), model performance drops\nfrom 94% to 78% as block size increases, creating a conceptually simple\nchallenge to benchmark NLP models.

The conventional\nmethod of source code generation tries to generate source code directly, which\nis impractical for creating complex software. We overcome this limitation by\ntransforming natural language into an abstract intermediate formal language\nrepresenting an application with a substantially smaller number of tokens. The\nintermediate formal representation is then compiled into target source codes.\nThis abstraction of programming details allows seq2seq networks to learn\ncomplex application structures with less overhead. In order to train sequence\nmodels, we introduce a data synthesis method grounded in a human survey. We\ndemonstrate that Text2App generalizes well to unseen combination of app\ncomponents and it is capable of handling noisy natural language instructions.\nWe explore the possibility of creating applications from highly abstract\ninstructions by coupling our system with GPT-3 -- a large pretrained language\nmodel. We perform an extensive human evaluation and identify the capabilities\nand limitations of our system.

          "description": "The syntactic structure of a sentence is often represented using syntactic\ndependency trees. The sum of the distances between syntactically related words\nhas been in the limelight for the past decades. Research on dependency\ndistances led to the formulation of the principle of dependency distance\nminimization whereby words in sentences are ordered so as to minimize that sum.\nNumerous random baselines have been defined to carry out related quantitative\nstudies on languages. The simplest random baseline is the expected value of the\nsum in unconstrained random permutations of the words in the sentence, namely\nwhen all the shufflings of the words of a sentence are allowed and equally\nlikely. Here we focus on a popular baseline: random projective permutations of\nthe words of the sentence, that is, permutations where the syntactic dependency\nstructure is projective, a formal constraint that sentences satisfy often in\nlanguages. Thus far, the expectation of the sum of dependency distances in\nrandom projective shufflings of a sentence has been estimated approximately\nwith a Monte Carlo procedure whose cost is of the order of $Zn$, where $n$ is\nthe number of words of the sentence and $Z$ is the number of samples; the\nlarger $Z$, the lower the error of the estimation but the larger the time cost.\nHere we present formulae to compute that expectation without error in time of\nthe order of $n$. Furthermore, we show that star trees maximize it, and devise\na dynamic programming algorithm to retrieve the trees that minimize it.",

Secondly, we\nexplore to use the encoder structure of Transformer to model the global context\ninterdependence features at an utterance level which can capture better long\nterm temporal characteristics. Before the pooling layer, we aggregate the\noutputs of SE-Res2Blocks and Transformer encoder to leverage the complementary\nchannel and context interdependence features learned by themself respectively.\nFinally, instead of performing a single attentive statistics pooling, we also\nfind it beneficial to extend the pooling method in a multi-head way which can\ndiscriminate features from multiple aspect. The proposed MACCIF-TDNN\narchitecture can outperform most of the state-of-the-art TDNN-based systems on\nVoxCeleb1 test sets.",

          "description": "Digital text is increasing day by day on the internet. It is very challenging\nto classify a large and heterogeneous collection of data, which require\nimproved information processing methods to organize text. To classify large\nsize of corpus, one common approach is to use hierarchical text classification,\nwhich aims to classify textual data in a hierarchical structure. Several\napproaches have been proposed to tackle classification of text but most of the\nresearch has been done on English language. This paper proposes a deep learning\nmodel for hierarchical text classification of news in Urdu language -\nconsisting of 51,325 sentences from 8 online news websites belonging to the\nfollowing genres: Sports; Technology; and Entertainment. The objectives of this\npaper are twofold: (1) to develop a large human-annotated dataset of news in\nUrdu language for hierarchical text classification; and (2) to classify Urdu\nnews hierarchically using our proposed model based on LSTM mechanism named as\nHierarchical Multi-layer LSTMs (HMLSTM). Our model consists of two modules:\nText Representing Layer, for obtaining text representation in which we use\nWord2vec embedding to transform the words to vector and Urdu Hierarchical LSTM\nLayer (UHLSTML) an end-to-end fully connected deep LSTMs network to perform\nautomatic feature learning, we train one LSTM layer for each level of the class\nhierarchy. We have performed extensive experiments on our self created dataset\nnamed as Urdu News Dataset for Hierarchical Text Classification (UNDHTC). The\nresult shows that our proposed method is very effective for hierarchical text\nclassification and it outperforms baseline methods significantly and also\nachieved good results as compare to deep neural model.",

          "description": "Android is among the most targeted platform by attackers. While attackers are\nimproving their techniques, traditional solutions based on static and dynamic\nanalysis have been also evolving. In addition to the application code, Android\napplications have some metadata that could be useful for security analysis of\napplications. Unlike traditional application distribution mechanisms, Android\napplications are distributed centrally in mobile markets. Therefore, beside\napplication packages, such markets contain app information provided by app\ndevelopers and app users. The availability of such useful textual data together\nwith the advancement in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that is used to\nprocess and understand textual data has encouraged researchers to investigate\nthe use of NLP techniques in Android security. Especially, security solutions\nbased on NLP have accelerated in the last 5 years and proven to be useful. This\nstudy reviews these proposals and aim to explore possible research directions\nfor future studies by presenting state-of-the-art in this domain. We mainly\nfocus on NLP-based solutions under four categories: description-to-behaviour\nfidelity, description generation, privacy and malware detection.",

          "description": "Entity alignment (EA) is to discover entities referring to the same object in\nthe real world from different knowledge graphs (KGs). It plays an important\nrole in automatically integrating KGs from multiple sources.\n\nExisting knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods based on Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) have achieved promising results, which enhance entity\nrepresentation with relation information unidirectionally. Besides, more and\nmore methods introduce semi-supervision to ask for more labeled training data.\n\nHowever, two challenges still exist in these methods: (1) Insufficient\ninteraction: The interaction between entities and relations is insufficiently\nutilized. (2) Low-quality bootstrapping: The generated semi-supervised data is\nof low quality.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel framework, Echo Entity Alignment (EchoEA),\nwhich leverages self-attention mechanism to spread entity information to\nrelations and echo back to entities. The relation representation is dynamically\ncomputed from entity representation. Symmetrically, the next entity\nrepresentation is dynamically calculated from relation representation, which\nshows sufficient interaction.\n\nFurthermore, we propose attribute-combined bi-directional global-filtered\nstrategy (ABGS) to improve bootstrapping, reduce false samples and generate\nhigh-quality training data.\n\nThe experimental results on three real-world cross-lingual datasets are\nstable at around 96\\% at hits@1 on average, showing that our approach not only\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, but also is universal\nand transferable for existing KGE methods.",

          "description": "The goal of Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) is to find\nanswers for natural language questions over a knowledge graph. Recent KGQA\napproaches adopt a neural machine translation (NMT) approach, where the natural\nlanguage question is translated into a structured query language. However, NMT\nsuffers from the out-of-vocabulary problem, where terms in a question may not\nhave been seen during training, impeding their translation. This issue is\nparticularly problematic for the millions of entities that large knowledge\ngraphs describe. We rather propose a KGQA approach that delegates the\nprocessing of entities to entity linking (EL) systems. NMT is then used to\ncreate a query template with placeholders that are filled by entities\nidentified in an EL phase. Slot filling is used to decide which entity fills\nwhich placeholder. Experiments for QA over Wikidata show that our approach\noutperforms pure NMT: while there remains a strong dependence on having seen\nsimilar query templates during training, errors relating to entities are\ngreatly reduced.",

          "description": "Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) is a task to\nrecognize \"who spoke what\" from multi-talker recordings. An SA-ASR system\nusually consists of multiple modules such as speech separation, speaker\ndiarization and ASR. On the other hand, considering the joint optimization, an\nend-to-end (E2E) SA-ASR model has recently been proposed with promising results\non simulation data. In this paper, we present our recent study on the\ncomparison of such modular and joint approaches towards SA-ASR on real monaural\nrecordings. We develop state-of-the-art SA-ASR systems for both modular and\njoint approaches by leveraging large-scale training data, including 75 thousand\nhours of ASR training data and the VoxCeleb corpus for speaker representation\nlearning. We also propose a new pipeline that performs the E2E SA-ASR model\nafter speaker clustering. Our evaluation on the AMI meeting corpus reveals that\nafter fine-tuning with a small real data, the joint system performs 9.2--29.4%\nbetter in accuracy compared to the best modular system while the modular system\nperforms better before such fine-tuning. We also conduct various error analyses\nto show the remaining issues for the monaural SA-ASR.",

          "description": "Recently, neural networks have been successfully employed to improve upon\nstate-of-the-art performance in ad-hoc retrieval tasks via machine-learned\nranking functions. While neural retrieval models grow in complexity and impact,\nlittle is understood about their correspondence with well-studied IR\nprinciples. Recent work on interpretability in machine learning has provided\ntools and techniques to understand neural models in general, yet there has been\nlittle progress towards explaining ranking models.\n\nWe investigate whether one can explain the behavior of neural ranking models\nin terms of their congruence with well understood principles of document\nranking by using established theories from axiomatic IR. Axiomatic analysis of\ninformation retrieval models has formalized a set of constraints on ranking\ndecisions that reasonable retrieval models should fulfill. We operationalize\nthis axiomatic thinking to reproduce rankings based on combinations of\nelementary constraints. This allows us to investigate to what extent the\nranking decisions of neural rankers can be explained in terms of retrieval\naxioms, and which axioms apply in which situations. Our experimental study\nconsiders a comprehensive set of axioms over several representative neural\nrankers. While the existing axioms can already explain the particularly\nconfident ranking decisions rather well, future work should extend the axiom\nset to also cover the other still \"unexplainable\" neural IR rank decisions.",

          "description": "Departing from the postulate that Voynich Manuscript is not a hoax but rather\nencodes authentic contents, our article presents an evolutionary algorithm\nwhich aims to find the most optimal mapping between voynichian glyphs and\ncandidate phonemic values. Core component of the decoding algorithm is a\nprocess of maximization of a fitness function which aims to find most optimal\nset of substitution rules allowing to transcribe the part of the manuscript --\nwhich we call the Calendar -- into lists of feminine names. This leads to sets\nof character subsitution rules which allow us to consistently transcribe dozens\namong three hundred calendar tokens into feminine names: a result far\nsurpassing both ``popular'' as well as \"state of the art\" tentatives to crack\nthe manuscript. What's more, by using name lists stemming from different\nlanguages as potential cribs, our ``adaptive'' method can also be useful in\nidentification of the language in which the manuscript is written.\n\nAs far as we can currently tell, results of our experiments indicate that the\nCalendar part of the manuscript contains names from baltoslavic, balkanic or\nhebrew language strata. Two further indications are also given: primo, highest\nfitness values were obtained when the crib list contains names with specific\ninfixes at token's penultimate position as is the case, for example, for slavic\n\\textbf{feminine diminutives} (i.e. names ending with -ka and not -a). In the\nmost successful scenario, 240 characters contained in 35 distinct Voynichese\ntokens were successfully transcribed. Secundo, in case of crib stemming from\nHebrew language, whole adaptation process converges to significantly better\nfitness values when transcribing voynichian tokens whose order of individual\ncharacters have been reversed, and when lists feminine and not masculine names\nare used as the crib.",

          "description": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) learns users' preferences by capturing the\nshort-term and sequential patterns from the evolution of user behaviors. Among\nthe studies in the SBR field, graph-based approaches are a relatively powerful\nkind of way, which generally extract item information by message aggregation\nunder Euclidean space. However, such methods can't effectively extract the\nhierarchical information contained among consecutive items in a session, which\nis critical to represent users' preferences. In this paper, we present a\nhyperbolic contrastive graph recommender (HCGR), a principled session-based\nrecommendation framework involving Lorentz hyperbolic space to adequately\ncapture the coherence and hierarchical representations of the items. Within\nthis framework, we design a novel adaptive hyperbolic attention computation to\naggregate the graph message of each user's preference in a session-based\nbehavior sequence. In addition, contrastive learning is leveraged to optimize\nthe item representation by considering the geodesic distance between positive\nand negative samples in hyperbolic space. Extensive experiments on four\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that HCGR consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines by 0.43$\\%$-28.84$\\%$ in terms of $HitRate$, $NDCG$\nand $MRR$.",

          "description": "Polarization is implicated in the erosion of democracy and the progression to\nviolence, which makes the polarization properties of large algorithmic content\nselection systems (recommender systems) a matter of concern for peace and\nsecurity. While algorithm-driven social media does not seem to be a primary\ndriver of polarization at the country level, it could be a useful intervention\npoint in polarized societies. This paper examines algorithmic depolarization\ninterventions with the goal of conflict transformation: not suppressing or\neliminating conflict but moving towards more constructive conflict. Algorithmic\nintervention is considered at three stages: which content is available\n(moderation), how content is selected and personalized (ranking), and content\npresentation and controls (user interface). Empirical studies of online\nconflict suggest that the exposure diversity intervention proposed as an\nantidote to \"filter bubbles\" can be improved and can even worsen polarization\nunder some conditions. Using civility metrics in conjunction with diversity in\ncontent selection may be more effective. However, diversity-based interventions\nhave not been tested at scale and may not work in the diverse and dynamic\ncontexts of real platforms. Instead, intervening in platform polarization\ndynamics will likely require continuous monitoring of polarization metrics,\nsuch as the widely used \"feeling thermometer.\" These metrics can be used to\nevaluate product features, and potentially engineered as algorithmic\nobjectives. It may further prove necessary to include polarization measures in\nthe objective functions of recommender algorithms to prevent optimization\nprocesses from creating conflict as a side effect.",

          "description": "Most of the existing deep learning-based sequential recommendation approaches\nutilize the recurrent neural network architecture or self-attention to model\nthe sequential patterns and temporal influence among a user's historical\nbehavior and learn the user's preference at a specific time. However, these\nmethods have two main drawbacks. First, they focus on modeling users' dynamic\nstates from a user-centric perspective and always neglect the dynamics of items\nover time. Second, most of them deal with only the first-order user-item\ninteractions and do not consider the high-order connectivity between users and\nitems, which has recently been proved helpful for the sequential\nrecommendation. To address the above problems, in this article, we attempt to\nmodel user-item interactions by a bipartite graph structure and propose a new\nrecommendation approach based on a Position-enhanced and Time-aware Graph\nConvolutional Network (PTGCN) for the sequential recommendation. PTGCN models\nthe sequential patterns and temporal dynamics between user-item interactions by\ndefining a position-enhanced and time-aware graph convolution operation and\nlearning the dynamic representations of users and items simultaneously on the\nbipartite graph with a self-attention aggregator. Also, it realizes the\nhigh-order connectivity between users and items by stacking multi-layer graph\nconvolutions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PTGCN, we carried out a\ncomprehensive evaluation of PTGCN on three real-world datasets of different\nsizes compared with a few competitive baselines. Experimental results indicate\nthat PTGCN outperforms several state-of-the-art models in terms of two\ncommonly-used evaluation metrics for ranking.",

          "description": "In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown powerful ability in\ncollaborative filtering, which is a widely adopted recommendation scenario.\nWhile without any side information, existing graph neural network based methods\ngenerally learn a one-hot embedding for each user or item as the initial input\nrepresentation of GNNs. However, such one-hot embedding is intrinsically\ntransductive, making these methods with no inductive ability, i.e., failing to\ndeal with new users or new items that are unseen during training. Besides, the\nnumber of model parameters depends on the number of users and items, which is\nexpensive and not scalable. In this paper, we give a formal definition of\ninductive recommendation and solve the above problems by proposing Inductive\nrepresentation based Graph Convolutional Network (IGCN) for collaborative\nfiltering. Specifically, we design an inductive representation layer, which\nutilizes the interaction behavior with core users or items as the initial\nrepresentation, improving the general recommendation performance while bringing\ninductive ability. Note that, the number of parameters of IGCN only depends on\nthe number of core users or items, which is adjustable and scalable.

The proposed\nframework mines the target instance gradually from the queries and their\ncorresponding top-ranked search results.

Following this observation, this paper makes the following main\ncontributions: (1) characterizing the effect of sampling on algorithm\nperformance, in terms of algorithm and dataset characteristics (e.g. sparsity\ncharacteristics, sequential dynamics, etc.); and (2) designing SVP-CF, which is\na data-specific sampling strategy, that aims to preserve the relative\nperformance of models after sampling, and is especially suited to long-tail\ninteraction data.

          "description": "Social-aware recommendation approaches have been recognized as an effective\nway to solve the data sparsity issue of traditional recommender systems. The\nassumption behind is that the knowledge in social user-user connections can be\nshared and transferred to the domain of user-item interactions, whereby to help\nlearn user preferences. However, most existing approaches merely adopt the\nfirst-order connections among users during transfer learning, ignoring those\nconnections in higher orders.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Propagation-aware Transfer Learning Network (PTLN) based on the\npropagation of social relations. We aim to better mine the sharing knowledge\nhidden in social networks and thus further improve recommendation performance.\nSpecifically, we explore social influence in two aspects: (a) higher-order\nfriends have been taken into consideration by order bias; (b) different friends\nin the same order will have distinct importance for recommendation by an\nattention mechanism.

          "description": "Recommending cold-start items is a long-standing and fundamental challenge in\nrecommender systems. Without any historical interaction on cold-start items, CF\nscheme fails to use collaborative signals to infer user preference on these\nitems. To solve this problem, extensive studies have been conducted to\nincorporate side information into the CF scheme. Specifically, they employ\nmodern neural network techniques (e.g., dropout, consistency constraint) to\ndiscover and exploit the coalition effect of content features and collaborative\nrepresentations. However, we argue that these works less explore the mutual\ndependencies between content features and collaborative representations and\nlack sufficient theoretical supports, thus resulting in unsatisfactory\nperformance. In this work, we reformulate the cold-start item representation\nlearning from an information-theoretic standpoint. It aims to maximize the\nmutual dependencies between item content and collaborative signals.\nSpecifically, the representation learning is theoretically lower-bounded by the\nintegration of two terms: mutual information between collaborative embeddings\nof users and items, and mutual information between collaborative embeddings and\nfeature representations of items. To model such a learning process, we devise a\nnew objective function founded upon contrastive learning and develop a simple\nyet effective Contrastive Learning-based Cold-start Recommendation\nframework(CLCRec). In particular, CLCRec consists of three components:\ncontrastive pair organization, contrastive embedding, and contrastive\noptimization modules. It allows us to preserve collaborative signals in the\ncontent representations for both warm and cold-start items.

          "description": "For present e-commerce platforms, session-based recommender systems are\ndeveloped to predict users' preference for next-item recommendation. Although a\nsession can usually reflect a user's current preference, a local shift of the\nuser's intention within the session may still exist. Specifically, the\ninteractions that take place in the early positions within a session generally\nindicate the user's initial intention, while later interactions are more likely\nto represent the latest intention. Such positional information has been rarely\nconsidered in existing methods, which restricts their ability to capture the\nsignificance of interactions at different positions. To thoroughly exploit the\npositional information within a session, a theoretical framework is developed\nin this paper to provide an in-depth analysis of the positional information. We\nformally define the properties of forward-awareness and backward-awareness to\nevaluate the ability of positional encoding schemes in capturing the initial\nand the latest intention. According to our analysis, existing positional\nencoding schemes are generally forward-aware only, which can hardly represent\nthe dynamics of the intention in a session. To enhance the positional encoding\nscheme for the session-based recommendation, a dual positional encoding (DPE)\nis proposed to account for both forward-awareness and backward-awareness. Based\non DPE, we propose a novel Positional Recommender (PosRec) model with a\nwell-designed Position-aware Gated Graph Neural Network module to fully exploit\nthe positional information for session-based recommendation tasks.

          "description": "Different from the traditional recommender system, the session-based\nrecommender system introduces the concept of the session, i.e., a sequence of\ninteractions between a user and multiple items within a period, to preserve the\nuser's recent interest. The existing work on the session-based recommender\nsystem mainly relies on mining sequential patterns within individual sessions,\nwhich are not expressive enough to capture more complicated dependency\nrelationships among items. In addition, it does not consider the cross-session\ninformation due to the anonymity of the session data, where the linkage between\ndifferent sessions is prevented. In this paper, we solve these problems with\nthe graph neural networks technique. First, each session is represented as a\ngraph rather than a linear sequence structure, based on which a novel Full\nGraph Neural Network (FGNN) is proposed to learn complicated item dependency.\nTo exploit and incorporate cross-session information in the individual\nsession's representation learning, we further construct a Broadly Connected\nSession (BCS) graph to link different sessions and a novel Mask-Readout\nfunction to improve session embedding based on the BCS graph. Extensive\nexperiments have been conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets, i.e.,\nYoochoose and Diginetica, and the experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposal through comparisons with state-of-the-art\nsession-based recommender models.",

          "description": "Streaming session-based recommendation (SSR) is a challenging task that\nrequires the recommender system to do the session-based recommendation (SR) in\nthe streaming scenario. In the real-world applications of e-commerce and social\nmedia, a sequence of user-item interactions generated within a certain period\nare grouped as a session, and these sessions consecutively arrive in the form\nof streams. Most of the recent SR research has focused on the static setting\nwhere the training data is first acquired and then used to train a\nsession-based recommender model. They need several epochs of training over the\nwhole dataset, which is infeasible in the streaming setting. Besides, they can\nhardly well capture long-term user interests because of the neglect or the\nsimple usage of the user information. Although some streaming recommendation\nstrategies have been proposed recently, they are designed for streams of\nindividual interactions rather than streams of sessions. In this paper, we\npropose a Global Attributed Graph (GAG) neural network model with a Wasserstein\nreservoir for the SSR problem. On one hand, when a new session arrives, a\nsession graph with a global attribute is constructed based on the current\nsession and its associate user. Thus, the GAG can take both the global\nattribute and the current session into consideration to learn more\ncomprehensive representations of the session and the user, yielding a better\nperformance in the recommendation. On the other hand, for the adaptation to the\nstreaming session scenario, a Wasserstein reservoir is proposed to help\npreserve a representative sketch of the historical data. Extensive experiments\non two real-world datasets have been conducted to verify the superiority of the\nGAG model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

Recent\nresearch of the session-based recommender system mainly focuses on sequential\npatterns by utilizing the attention mechanism, which is straightforward for the\nsession's natural sequence sorted by time. However, the user's preference is\nmuch more complicated than a solely consecutive time pattern in the transition\nof item choices. In this paper, therefore, we study the item transition pattern\nby constructing a session graph and propose a novel model which collaboratively\nconsiders the sequence order and the latent order in the session graph for a\nsession-based recommender system. We formulate the next item recommendation\nwithin the session as a graph classification problem.

          "description": "Recent studies have shown that providing personalized explanations alongside\nrecommendations increases trust and perceived quality. Furthermore, it gives\nusers an opportunity to refine the recommendations by critiquing parts of the\nexplanations. On one hand, current recommender systems model the\nrecommendation, explanation, and critiquing objectives jointly, but this\ncreates an inherent trade-off between their respective performance. On the\nother hand, although recent latent linear critiquing approaches are built upon\nan existing recommender system, they suffer from computational inefficiency at\ninference due to the objective optimized at each conversation's turn. We\naddress these deficiencies with M&Ms-VAE, a novel variational autoencoder for\nrecommendation and explanation that is based on multimodal modeling\nassumptions. We train the model under a weak supervision scheme to simulate\nboth fully and partially observed variables. Then, we leverage the\ngeneralization ability of a trained M&Ms-VAE model to embed the user preference\nand the critique separately. Our work's most important innovation is our\ncritiquing module, which is built upon and trained in a self-supervised manner\nwith a simple ranking objective. Experiments on four real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that among state-of-the-art models, our system is the first to\ndominate or match the performance in terms of recommendation, explanation, and\nmulti-step critiquing. Moreover, M&Ms-VAE processes the critiques up to 25.6x\nfaster than the best baselines. Finally, we show that our model infers coherent\njoint and cross generation, even under weak supervision, thanks to our\nmultimodal-based modeling and training scheme.",

Specifically, with the weak correlation assumption over image-text pairs,\nwe propose a two-tower pre-training model called BriVL within the cross-modal\ncontrastive learning framework. Unlike OpenAI CLIP that adopts a simple\ncontrastive learning method, we devise a more advanced algorithm by adapting\nthe latest method MoCo into the cross-modal scenario. By building a large\nqueue-based dictionary, our BriVL can incorporate more negative samples in\nlimited GPU resources.

          "description": "Fairness is a critical system-level objective in recommender systems that has\nbeen the subject of extensive recent research. A specific form of fairness is\nsupplier exposure fairness where the objective is to ensure equitable coverage\nof items across all suppliers in recommendations provided to users. This is\nespecially important in multistakeholder recommendation scenarios where it may\nbe important to optimize utilities not just for the end-user, but also for\nother stakeholders such as item sellers or producers who desire a fair\nrepresentation of their items. This type of supplier fairness is sometimes\naccomplished by attempting to increasing aggregate diversity in order to\nmitigate popularity bias and to improve the coverage of long-tail items in\nrecommendations. In this paper, we introduce FairMatch, a general graph-based\nalgorithm that works as a post processing approach after recommendation\ngeneration to improve exposure fairness for items and suppliers. The algorithm\niteratively adds high quality items that have low visibility or items from\nsuppliers with low exposure to the users' final recommendation lists. A\ncomprehensive set of experiments on two datasets and comparison with\nstate-of-the-art baselines show that FairMatch, while significantly improves\nexposure fairness and aggregate diversity, maintains an acceptable level of\nrelevance of the recommendations.",

          "description": "Leveraging the side information associated with entities (i.e.\\ users and\nitems) to enhance the performance of recommendation systems has been widely\nrecognized as an important modelling dimension. While many existing approaches\nfocus on the \\emph{integration scheme} to incorporate entity side information\n-- by combining the recommendation loss function with an extra side\ninformation-aware loss -- in this paper, we propose instead a novel\n\\emph{pre-training scheme} for leveraging the side information. In particular,\nwe first pre-train a representation model using the side information of the\nentities, and then fine-tune it using an existing general representation-based\nrecommendation model. Specifically, we propose two pre-training models, named\n\\gcn{} and \\com{}, by considering the entities and their relations constructed\nfrom side information as two different types of graphs respectively, to\npre-train entity embeddings. For the \\gcn{} model, two single-relational graphs\nare constructed from all the users' and items' side information respectively,\nto pre-train entity representations by using the Graph Convolutional Networks.\nFor the \\com{} model, two multi-relational graphs are constructed to pre-train\nthe entity representations by using the Composition-based Graph Convolutional\nNetworks. An extensive evaluation of our pre-training models fine-tuned under\nfour general representation-based recommender models, i.e.\\ MF, NCF, NGCF and\nLightGCN, shows that effectively pre-training embeddings with both the user's\nand item's side information can significantly improve these original models in\nterms of both effectiveness and stability.",

          "description": "Session-based Recommender Systems (SRSs) have been actively developed to\nrecommend the next item of an anonymous short item sequence (i.e., session).\nUnlike sequence-aware recommender systems where the whole interaction sequence\nof each user can be used to model both the short-term interest and the general\ninterest of the user, the absence of user-dependent information in SRSs makes\nit difficult to directly derive the user's general interest from data.\nTherefore, existing SRSs have focused on how to effectively model the\ninformation about short-term interest within the sessions, but they are\ninsufficient to capture the general interest of users. To this end, we propose\na novel framework to overcome the limitation of SRSs, named ProxySR, which\nimitates the missing information in SRSs (i.e., general interest of users) by\nmodeling proxies of sessions. ProxySR selects a proxy for the input session in\nan unsupervised manner, and combines it with the encoded short-term interest of\nthe session. As a proxy is jointly learned with the short-term interest and\nselected by multiple sessions, a proxy learns to play the role of the general\ninterest of a user and ProxySR learns how to select a suitable proxy for an\ninput session. Moreover, we propose another real-world situation of SRSs where\na few users are logged-in and leave their identifiers in sessions, and a\nrevision of ProxySR for the situation. Our experiments on real-world datasets\nshow that ProxySR considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors,\nand the proxies successfully imitate the general interest of the users without\nany user-dependent information.",

With three decades of research, Bangla NLP\n(BNLP) is still lagging behind mainly due to the scarcity of resources and the\nchallenges that come with it. There is sparse work in different areas of BNLP;\nhowever, a thorough survey reporting previous work and recent advances is yet\nto be done. In this study, we first provide a review of Bangla NLP tasks,\nresources, and tools available to the research community; we benchmark datasets\ncollected from various platforms for nine NLP tasks using current\nstate-of-the-art algorithms (i.e., transformer-based models). We provide\ncomparative results for the studied NLP tasks by comparing monolingual vs.\nmultilingual models of varying sizes. We report our results using both\nindividual and consolidated datasets and provide data splits for future\nresearch. We reviewed a total of 108 papers and conducted 175 sets of\nexperiments. Our results show promising performance using transformer-based\nmodels while highlighting the trade-off with computational costs.

          "description": "Predicting the next interaction of a short-term interaction session is a\nchallenging task in session-based recommendation. Almost all existing works\nrely on item transition patterns, and neglect the impact of user historical\nsessions while modeling user preference, which often leads to non-personalized\nrecommendation. Additionally, existing personalized session-based recommenders\ncapture user preference only based on the sessions of the current user, but\nignore the useful item-transition patterns from other user's historical\nsessions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Global\nGraph Neural Networks (HG-GNN) to exploit the item transitions over all\nsessions in a subtle manner for better inferring user preference from the\ncurrent and historical sessions. To effectively exploit the item transitions\nover all sessions from users, we propose a novel heterogeneous global graph\nthat contains item transitions of sessions, user-item interactions and global\nco-occurrence items. Moreover, to capture user preference from sessions\ncomprehensively, we propose to learn two levels of user representations from\nthe global graph via two graph augmented preference encoders. Specifically, we\ndesign a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) on the heterogeneous\nglobal graph to learn the long-term user preference and item representations\nwith rich semantics. Based on the HGNN, we propose the Current Preference\nEncoder and the Historical Preference Encoder to capture the different levels\nof user preference from the current and historical sessions, respectively. To\nachieve personalized recommendation, we integrate the representations of the\nuser current preference and historical interests to generate the final user\npreference representation. Extensive experimental results on three real-world\ndatasets show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used to learn an informative latent\nrepresentation of a user or item from observed interactions. Existing CF-based\nmethods commonly adopt negative sampling to discriminate different items. That\nis, observed user-item pairs are treated as positive instances; unobserved\npairs are considered as negative instances and are sampled under a defined\ndistribution for training. Training with negative sampling on large datasets is\ncomputationally expensive. Further, negative items should be carefully sampled\nunder the defined distribution, in order to avoid selecting an observed\npositive item in the training dataset. Unavoidably, some negative items sampled\nfrom the training dataset could be positive in the test set. Recently,\nself-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful tool to learn a model\nwithout negative samples. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised\ncollaborative filtering framework (SelfCF), that is specially designed for\nrecommender scenario with implicit feedback. The main idea of SelfCF is to\naugment the output embeddings generated by backbone networks, because it is\ninfeasible to augment raw input of user/item ids. We propose and study three\noutput perturbation techniques that can be applied to different types of\nbackbone networks including both traditional CF models and graph-based models.\nBy encapsulating two popular recommendation models into the framework, our\nexperiments on three datasets show that the best performance of our framework\nis comparable or better than the supervised counterpart. We also show that\nSelfCF can boost up the performance by up to 8.93\\% on average, compared with\nanother self-supervised framework as the baseline.

          "description": "Recommender systems rely on user behavior data like ratings and clicks to\nbuild personalization model. However, the collected data is observational\nrather than experimental, causing various biases in the data which\nsignificantly affect the learned model. Most existing work for recommendation\ndebiasing, such as the inverse propensity scoring and imputation approaches,\nfocuses on one or two specific biases, lacking the universal capacity that can\naccount for mixed or even unknown biases in the data.\n\nTowards this research gap, we first analyze the origin of biases from the\nperspective of \\textit{risk discrepancy} that represents the difference between\nthe expectation empirical risk and the true risk. Remarkably, we derive a\ngeneral learning framework that well summarizes most existing debiasing\nstrategies by specifying some parameters of the general framework. This\nprovides a valuable opportunity to develop a universal solution for debiasing,\ne.g., by learning the debiasing parameters from data. However, the training\ndata lacks important signal of how the data is biased and what the unbiased\ndata looks like. To move this idea forward, we propose \\textit{AotoDebias} that\nleverages another (small) set of uniform data to optimize the debiasing\nparameters by solving the bi-level optimization problem with meta-learning.\nThrough theoretical analyses, we derive the generalization bound for AutoDebias\nand prove its ability to acquire the appropriate debiasing strategy.

          "description": "Recent work has proposed stochastic Plackett-Luce (PL) ranking models as a\nrobust choice for optimizing relevance and fairness metrics. Unlike their\ndeterministic counterparts that require heuristic optimization algorithms, PL\nmodels are fully differentiable. Theoretically, they can be used to optimize\nranking metrics via stochastic gradient descent. However, in practice, the\ncomputation of the gradient is infeasible because it requires one to iterate\nover all possible permutations of items. Consequently, actual applications rely\non approximating the gradient via sampling techniques. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel algorithm: PL-Rank, that estimates the gradient of a PL\nranking model w.r.t. both relevance and fairness metrics. Unlike existing\napproaches that are based on policy gradients, PL-Rank makes use of the\nspecific structure of PL models and ranking metrics. Our experimental analysis\nshows that PL-Rank has a greater sample-efficiency and is computationally less\ncostly than existing policy gradients, resulting in faster convergence at\nhigher performance. PL-Rank further enables the industry to apply PL models for\nmore relevant and fairer real-world ranking systems.",

          "description": "Recommending cold-start items is a long-standing and fundamental challenge in\nrecommender systems. Without any historical interaction on cold-start items, CF\nscheme fails to use collaborative signals to infer user preference on these\nitems. To solve this problem, extensive studies have been conducted to\nincorporate side information into the CF scheme. Specifically, they employ\nmodern neural network techniques (e.g., dropout, consistency constraint) to\ndiscover and exploit the coalition effect of content features and collaborative\nrepresentations. However, we argue that these works less explore the mutual\ndependencies between content features and collaborative representations and\nlack sufficient theoretical supports, thus resulting in unsatisfactory\nperformance. In this work, we reformulate the cold-start item representation\nlearning from an information-theoretic standpoint. It aims to maximize the\nmutual dependencies between item content and collaborative signals.\nSpecifically, the representation learning is theoretically lower-bounded by the\nintegration of two terms: mutual information between collaborative embeddings\nof users and items, and mutual information between collaborative embeddings and\nfeature representations of items. To model such a learning process, we devise a\nnew objective function founded upon contrastive learning and develop a simple\nyet effective Contrastive Learning-based Cold-start Recommendation\nframework(CLCRec). In particular, CLCRec consists of three components:\ncontrastive pair organization, contrastive embedding, and contrastive\noptimization modules. It allows us to preserve collaborative signals in the\ncontent representations for both warm and cold-start items. Through extensive\nexperiments on four publicly accessible datasets, we observe that CLCRec\nachieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both\nwarm- and cold-start scenarios.",

It is often\nassociated with increased chances of non-communicable diseases such as\ndiabetes, cardiovascular problems, various cancers, etc. Evidence suggests that\ndiet-related mobile applications play a vital role in assisting individuals in\nmaking healthier choices and keeping track of food intake. However, due to an\nabundance of similar applications, it becomes pertinent to evaluate each of\nthem in terms of functionality, usability, and possible design issues to truly\ndetermine state-of-the-art solutions for the future. Since these applications\ninvolve implementing multiple user requirements and recommendations from\ndifferent dietitians, the evaluation becomes quite complex. Therefore, this\nstudy aims to review existing dietary applications at length to highlight key\nfeatures and problems that enhance or undermine an application's usability. For\nthis purpose, we have examined the published literature from various scientific\ndatabases of the PUBMED, CINAHL (January 2010-December 2019) and Science Direct\n(2010-2019). We followed PRISMA guidelines, and out of our findings, fifty-six\nprimary studies met our inclusion criteria after identification, screening,\neligibility and full-text evaluation. We analyzed 35 apps from the selected\nstudies and extracted the data of each of the identified apps.Following our\ndetailed analysis on the comprehensiveness of freely available mHealth\napplications, we specified potential future research challenges and stated\nrecommendations to help grow clinically accurate diet-related applications.",

These include two note-level\nclassification tasks, i.e., melody extraction and velocity prediction, as well\nas two sequence-level classification tasks, i.e., composer classification and\nemotion classification. We find that, given a pre-trained Transformer, our\nmodels outperform recurrent neural network based baselines with less than 10\nepochs of fine-tuning. Ablation studies show that the pre-training remains\neffective even if none of the MIDI data of the downstream tasks are seen at the\npre-training stage, and that freezing the self-attention layers of the\nTransformer at the fine-tuning stage slightly degrades performance. All the\nfive datasets employed in this work are publicly available, as well as\ncheckpoints of our pre-trained and fine-tuned models.

This means that they have trouble transcribing\nreal-world music recordings from diverse musical genres that are not presented\nin the labelled training data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised\nframework, ReconVAT, which solves this issue by leveraging the huge amount of\navailable unlabelled music recordings. The proposed ReconVAT uses\nreconstruction loss and virtual adversarial training. When combined with\nexisting U-net models for AMT, ReconVAT achieves competitive results on common\nbenchmark datasets such as MAPS and MusicNet. For example, in the few-shot\nsetting for the string part version of MusicNet, ReconVAT achieves F1-scores of\n61.0% and 41.6% for the note-wise and note-with-offset-wise metrics\nrespectively, which translates into an improvement of 22.2% and 62.5% compared\nto the supervised baseline model.

          "description": "This paper demonstrates the feasibility of received power strength indicator\n(RSSI)-based single-antenna localization (R-SAL) with decimeter-level\nlocalization accuracy. To achieve decimeter-level accuracy, either fine-grained\nradio frequency (RF) information (e.g., channel state information) or\ncoarse-grained RF information (e.g., RSSI) from more than multiple antennas is\nrequired. Meanwhile, owing to deficiency of single-antenna RSSI which only\nindicates a distance between a receiver and a transmitter, realizing\nfine-grained localization accuracy with single coarse-grained RF information is\nchallenging. Our key idea to address this challenge is to leverage computer\nvision (CV) and to estimate the most likely Fresnel zone between the receiver\nand transmitter, where the role of RSSI is to detect blockage timings.\nSpecifically, historical positions of an obstacle that dynamically blocks the\nFresnel zone are detected by the CV technique, and we estimate positions at\nwhich a blockage starts and ends via a time series of RSSI. These estimated\nobstacle positions, in principle, coincide with points on the Fresnel zone\nboundaries, enabling the estimation of the Fresnel zone and localization of the\ntransmitter. The experimental evaluation revealed that the proposed R-SAL\nachieved decimeter-level localization in an indoor environment, which is\ncomparable to that of a simple previous RSSI-based localization with three\nreceivers.",

Most of the state-of-the-arts focus on\nshort-range spatio-temporal modeling and then average multiple snippet-level\npredictions to yield the final video-level prediction. Thus, their video-level\nprediction does not consider spatio-temporal features of how video evolves\nalong the temporal dimension. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dynamic\nSegment Aggregation (DSA) module to capture relationship among snippets. To be\nmore specific, we attempt to generate a dynamic kernel for a convolutional\noperation to aggregate long-range temporal information among adjacent snippets\nadaptively. The DSA module is an efficient plug-and-play module and can be\ncombined with the off-the-shelf clip-based models (i.e., TSM, I3D) to perform\npowerful long-range modeling with minimal overhead. The final video\narchitecture, coined as DSANet. We conduct extensive experiments on several\nvideo recognition benchmarks (i.e., Mini-Kinetics-200, Kinetics-400,\nSomething-Something V1 and ActivityNet) to show its superiority. Our proposed\nDSA module is shown to benefit various video recognition models significantly.\nFor example, equipped with DSA modules, the top-1 accuracy of I3D ResNet-50 is\nimproved from 74.9% to 78.2% on Kinetics-400.

          "description": "This paper describes a variational auto-encoder based non-autoregressive\ntext-to-speech (VAENAR-TTS) model. The autoregressive TTS (AR-TTS) models based\non the sequence-to-sequence architecture can generate high-quality speech, but\ntheir sequential decoding process can be time-consuming. Recently,\nnon-autoregressive TTS (NAR-TTS) models have been shown to be more efficient\nwith the parallel decoding process. However, these NAR-TTS models rely on\nphoneme-level durations to generate a hard alignment between the text and the\nspectrogram. Obtaining duration labels, either through forced alignment or\nknowledge distillation, is cumbersome. Furthermore, hard alignment based on\nphoneme expansion can degrade the naturalness of the synthesized speech. In\ncontrast, the proposed model of VAENAR-TTS is an end-to-end approach that does\nnot require phoneme-level durations. The VAENAR-TTS model does not contain\nrecurrent structures and is completely non-autoregressive in both the training\nand inference phases. Based on the VAE architecture, the alignment information\nis encoded in the latent variable, and attention-based soft alignment between\nthe text and the latent variable is used in the decoder to reconstruct the\nspectrogram. Experiments show that VAENAR-TTS achieves state-of-the-art\nsynthesis quality, while the synthesis speed is comparable with other NAR-TTS\nmodels.",

          "description": "Cross-view video synthesis task seeks to generate video sequences of one view\nfrom another dramatically different view. In this paper, we investigate the\nexocentric (third-person) view to egocentric (first-person) view video\ngeneration task. This is challenging because egocentric view sometimes is\nremarkably different from the exocentric view. Thus, transforming the\nappearances across the two different views is a non-trivial task. Particularly,\nwe propose a novel Bi-directional Spatial Temporal Attention Fusion Generative\nAdversarial Network (STA-GAN) to learn both spatial and temporal information to\ngenerate egocentric video sequences from the exocentric view. The proposed\nSTA-GAN consists of three parts: temporal branch, spatial branch, and attention\nfusion. First, the temporal and spatial branches generate a sequence of fake\nframes and their corresponding features. The fake frames are generated in both\ndownstream and upstream directions for both temporal and spatial branches.\nNext, the generated four different fake frames and their corresponding features\n(spatial and temporal branches in two directions) are fed into a novel\nmulti-generation attention fusion module to produce the final video sequence.\nMeanwhile, we also propose a novel temporal and spatial dual-discriminator for\nmore robust network optimization.

          "description": "Compared with tedious per-pixel mask annotating, it is much easier to\nannotate data by clicks, which costs only several seconds for an image.\nHowever, applying clicks to learn video semantic segmentation model has not\nbeen explored before. In this work, we propose an effective weakly-supervised\nvideo semantic segmentation pipeline with click annotations, called WeClick,\nfor saving laborious annotating effort by segmenting an instance of the\nsemantic class with only a single click. Since detailed semantic information is\nnot captured by clicks, directly training with click labels leads to poor\nsegmentation predictions. To mitigate this problem, we design a novel memory\nflow knowledge distillation strategy to exploit temporal information (named\nmemory flow) in abundant unlabeled video frames, by distilling the neighboring\npredictions to the target frame via estimated motion. Moreover, we adopt\nvanilla knowledge distillation for model compression. In this case, WeClick\nlearns compact video semantic segmentation models with the low-cost click\nannotations during the training phase yet achieves real-time and accurate\nmodels during the inference period. Experimental results on Cityscapes and\nCamvid show that WeClick outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, increases\nperformance by 10.24% mIoU than baseline, and achieves real-time execution.",

          "description": "Contrastive Learning (CL) is a recent representation learning approach, which\nencourages inter-class separability and intra-class compactness in learned\nimage representations. Since medical images often contain multiple semantic\nclasses in an image, using CL to learn representations of local features (as\nopposed to global) is important. In this work, we present a novel\nsemi-supervised 2D medical segmentation solution that applies CL on image\npatches, instead of full images. These patches are meaningfully constructed\nusing the semantic information of different classes obtained via pseudo\nlabeling. We also propose a novel consistency regularization (CR) scheme, which\nworks in synergy with CL. It addresses the problem of confirmation bias, and\nencourages better clustering in the feature space. We evaluate our method on\nfour public medical segmentation datasets and a novel histopathology dataset\nthat we introduce. Our method obtains consistent improvements over\nstate-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation approaches for all datasets.",

          "description": "Scene understanding based on LiDAR point cloud is an essential task for\nautonomous cars to drive safely, which often employs spherical projection to\nmap 3D point cloud into multi-channel 2D images for semantic segmentation. Most\nexisting methods simply stack different point attributes/modalities (e.g.\ncoordinates, intensity, depth, etc.) as image channels to increase information\ncapacity, but ignore distinct characteristics of point attributes in different\nimage channels. We design FPS-Net, a convolutional fusion network that exploits\nthe uniqueness and discrepancy among the projected image channels for optimal\npoint cloud segmentation. FPS-Net adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Instead\nof simply stacking multiple channel images as a single input, we group them\ninto different modalities to first learn modality-specific features separately\nand then map the learned features into a common high-dimensional feature space\nfor pixel-level fusion and learning. Specifically, we design a residual dense\nblock with multiple receptive fields as a building block in the encoder which\npreserves detailed information in each modality and learns hierarchical\nmodality-specific and fused features effectively. In the FPS-Net decoder, we\nuse a recurrent convolution block likewise to hierarchically decode fused\nfeatures into output space for pixel-level classification. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on two widely adopted point cloud datasets show that\nFPS-Net achieves superior semantic segmentation as compared with\nstate-of-the-art projection-based methods. In addition, the proposed modality\nfusion idea is compatible with typical projection-based methods and can be\nincorporated into them with consistent performance improvements.",

          "description": "This paper presents a novel active marker for dynamic projection mapping (PM)\nthat emits a temporal blinking pattern of infrared (IR) light representing its\nID. We used a multi-material three dimensional (3D) printer to fabricate a\nprojection object with optical fibers that can guide IR light from LEDs\nattached on the bottom of the object. The aperture of an optical fiber is\ntypically very small; thus, it is unnoticeable to human observers under\nprojection and can be placed on a strongly curved part of a projection surface.\nIn addition, the working range of our system can be larger than previous\nmarker-based methods as the blinking patterns can theoretically be recognized\nby a camera placed at a wide range of distances from markers. We propose an\nautomatic marker placement algorithm to spread multiple active markers over the\nsurface of a projection object such that its pose can be robustly estimated\nusing captured images from arbitrary directions. We also propose an\noptimization framework for determining the routes of the optical fibers in such\na way that collisions of the fibers can be avoided while minimizing the loss of\nlight intensity in the fibers.

          "description": "This paper jointly resolves two problems in vision transformer: i) the\ncomputation of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) has high computational/space\ncomplexity; ii) recent vision transformer networks are overly tuned for image\nclassification, ignoring the difference between image classification (simple\nscenarios, more similar to NLP) and downstream scene understanding tasks\n(complicated scenarios, rich structural and contextual information). To this\nend, we note that pyramid pooling has been demonstrated to be effective in\nvarious vision tasks owing to its powerful ability in context abstraction, and\nits natural property of spatial invariance is also suitable to address the loss\nof structural information (problem ii)). Hence, we propose to adapt pyramid\npooling to MHSA for alleviating its high requirement on computational resources\n(problem i)). In this way, this pooling-based MHSA can well address the above\ntwo problems and is thus flexible and powerful for downstream scene\nunderstanding tasks. Plugged with our pooling-based MHSA, we build a\ndownstream-task-oriented transformer network, dubbed Pyramid Pooling\nTransformer (P2T).

We augment boxes with a notion of resolution and\ndefine their clustering coverage, which is intuitively a quantitative metric\nthat indicates the abstraction quality. This allows studying the effect of\ndifferent clustering parameters on the constructed boxes and estimating an\ninterval of sub-optimal parameters. Moreover, we automatically construct\nmonitors that leverage both the correct and incorrect behaviors of a system.\nThis allows checking the size of the monitor abstractions and analyzing the\nseparability of the network.

          "description": "Modern top-performing object detectors depend heavily on backbone networks,\nwhose advances bring consistent performance gains through exploring more\neffective network structures. In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible\nbackbone framework, namely CBNetV2, to better train existing open-sourced\npre-trained backbones under the pre-training fine-tuning protocol. In\nparticular, CBNetV2 architecture groups multiple identical backbones, which are\nconnected through composite connections. Specifically, it integrates the high-\nand low-level features of multiple backbone networks and gradually expands the\nreceptive field to more efficiently perform object detection. We also propose a\nbetter training strategy with assistant supervision for CBNet-based detectors.\nCBNetV2 has strong generalization capabilities for different backbones and head\ndesigns of the detector architecture. Without additional pre-training, CBNetV2\ncan be adapted to various backbones, including manual-based and NAS-based, as\nwell as CNN-based and Transformer-based ones. Experiments provide strong\nevidence showing that composite backbones are more efficient, effective, and\nresource-friendly than wider and deeper networks. CBNetV2 is compatible with\nthe head designs of most mainstream detectors, including one-stage and\ntwo-stage detectors, as well as anchor-based and anchor-free-based ones, and\nsignificantly improve their performances by more than 3.0% AP over the baseline\non COCO. Particularly, under the single-model and single-scale testing\nprotocol, our Dual-Swin-L achieves 59.4% box AP and 51.6% mask AP on COCO\ntest-dev, which is significantly better than the state-of-the-art result (i.e.,\n57.7% box AP and 50.2% mask AP).

          "description": "How can neural networks be trained on large-volume temporal data efficiently?\nTo compute the gradients required to update parameters, backpropagation blocks\ncomputations until the forward and backward passes are completed. For temporal\nsignals, this introduces high latency and hinders real-time learning. It also\ncreates a coupling between consecutive layers, which limits model parallelism\nand increases memory consumption. In this paper, we build upon Sideways, which\navoids blocking by propagating approximate gradients forward in time, and we\npropose mechanisms for temporal integration of information based on different\nvariants of skip connections. We also show how to decouple computation and\ndelegate individual neural modules to different devices, allowing distributed\nand parallel training. The proposed Skip-Sideways achieves low latency\ntraining, model parallelism, and, importantly, is capable of extracting\ntemporal features, leading to more stable training and improved performance on\nreal-world action recognition video datasets such as HMDB51, UCF101, and the\nlarge-scale Kinetics-600. Finally, we also show that models trained with\nSkip-Sideways generate better future frames than Sideways models, and hence\nthey can better utilize motion cues.",

          "description": "Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in the wild is an extremely challenging\ntask in computer vision due to variant backgrounds, low-quality facial images,\nand the subjectiveness of annotators. These uncertainties make it difficult for\nneural networks to learn robust features on limited-scale datasets. Moreover,\nthe networks can be easily distributed by the above factors and perform\nincorrect decisions. Recently, vision transformer (ViT) and data-efficient\nimage transformers (DeiT) present their significant performance in traditional\nclassification tasks. The self-attention mechanism makes transformers obtain a\nglobal receptive field in the first layer which dramatically enhances the\nfeature extraction capability. In this work, we first propose a novel pure\ntransformer-based mask vision transformer (MVT) for FER in the wild, which\nconsists of two modules: a transformer-based mask generation network (MGN) to\ngenerate a mask that can filter out complex backgrounds and occlusion of face\nimages, and a dynamic relabeling module to rectify incorrect labels in FER\ndatasets in the wild. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our MVT\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on RAF-DB with 88.62%, FERPlus with\n89.22%, and AffectNet-7 with 64.57%, respectively, and achieves a comparable\nresult on AffectNet-8 with 61.40%.",

Existing works usually encode low-level features such as\ncoordinate, normal, reflection intensity, etc., as local or global descriptors\nto represent scenes. Besides, they often ignore the translation between point\nclouds when matching descriptors.

One of the foremost outstanding hurdles is to obtain robust\nvisual perception in harsh weather and low light conditions where accuracy\ndegradation is severe. It is critical to have a weather classification model to\ndecrease visual perception confidence during these scenarios. Thus, we have\nbuilt a new dataset for weather (fog, rain, and snow) classification and light\nlevel (bright, moderate, and low) classification. Furthermore, we provide\nstreet type (asphalt, grass, and cobblestone) classification, leading to 9\nlabels. Each image has three labels corresponding to weather, light level, and\nstreet type. We recorded the data utilizing an industrial front camera of RCCC\n(red/clear) format with a resolution of $1024\\times1084$. We collected 15k\nvideo sequences and sampled 60k images. We implement an active learning\nframework to reduce the dataset's redundancy and find the optimal set of frames\nfor training a model. We distilled the 60k images further to 1.1k images, which\nwill be shared publicly after privacy anonymization. There is no public dataset\nfor weather and light level classification focused on autonomous driving to the\nbest of our knowledge.

However, due to the complex environment,\nsevere vegetation mixture, and difficulty of access, it is impossible to\naccurately classify coastal wetlands and identify their species with\ntraditional classifiers. Despite the integration of multisource remote sensing\ndata for performance enhancement, there are still challenges with acquiring and\nexploiting the complementary merits from multisource data. In this paper, the\nDeepwise Feature Interaction Network (DFINet) is proposed for wetland\nclassification. A depthwise cross attention module is designed to extract\nself-correlation and cross-correlation from multisource feature pairs. In this\nway, meaningful complementary information is emphasized for classification.\nDFINet is optimized by coordinating consistency loss, discrimination loss, and\nclassification loss. Accordingly, DFINet reaches the standard solution-space\nunder the regularity of loss functions, while the spatial consistency and\nfeature discrimination are preserved. Comprehensive experimental results on two\nhyperspectral and multispectral wetland datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nDFINet outperforms other competitive methods in terms of overall accuracy.",

          "description": "Low-light imaging on mobile devices is typically challenging due to\ninsufficient incident light coming through the relatively small aperture,\nresulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the previous works on\nlow-light image processing focus either only on a single task such as\nillumination adjustment, color enhancement, or noise removal; or on a joint\nillumination adjustment and denoising task that heavily relies on short-long\nexposure image pairs collected from specific camera models, and thus these\napproaches are less practical and generalizable in real-world settings where\ncamera-specific joint enhancement and restoration is required. To tackle this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a low-light image processing framework that\nperforms joint illumination adjustment, color enhancement, and denoising.\nConsidering the difficulty in model-specific data collection and the ultra-high\ndefinition of the captured images, we design two branches: a coefficient\nestimation branch as well as a joint enhancement and denoising branch. The\ncoefficient estimation branch works in a low-resolution space and predicts the\ncoefficients for enhancement via bilateral learning, whereas the joint\nenhancement and denoising branch works in a full-resolution space and\nprogressively performs joint enhancement and denoising. In contrast to existing\nmethods, our framework does not need to recollect massive data when being\nadapted to another camera model, which significantly reduces the efforts\nrequired to fine-tune our approach for practical usage.

          "description": "Being able to explain the prediction to clinical end-users is a necessity to\nleverage the power of AI models for clinical decision support. For medical\nimages, saliency maps are the most common form of explanation. The maps\nhighlight important features for AI model's prediction. Although many saliency\nmap methods have been proposed, it is unknown how well they perform on\nexplaining decisions on multi-modal medical images, where each modality/channel\ncarries distinct clinical meanings of the same underlying biomedical\nphenomenon.

To tackle this clinically\nimportant but technically ignored problem, we propose the MSFI\n(Modality-Specific Feature Importance) metric to examine whether saliency maps\ncan highlight modality-specific important features. MSFI encodes the clinical\nrequirements on modality prioritization and modality-specific feature\nlocalization. Our evaluations on 16 commonly used saliency map methods,\nincluding a clinician user study, show that although most saliency map methods\ncaptured modality importance information in general, most of them failed to\nhighlight modality-specific important features consistently and precisely. The\nevaluation results guide the choices of saliency map methods and provide\ninsights to propose new ones targeting clinical applications.",

Our\nbenchmark overcomes these limitations by introducing a large-scale driving\ndataset, lightweight closed-loop simulator, and motion-planning-specific\nmetrics. We provide a high-quality dataset with 1500h of human driving data\nfrom 4 cities across the US and Asia with widely varying traffic patterns\n(Boston, Pittsburgh, Las Vegas and Singapore).

Existing depth estimation methods either suffer from the\nlack of geometric constraints, or are limited to the difficulty of reliably\ncapturing geometric context, which leads to a bottleneck of depth estimation\nquality. We therefore introduce a simple yet effective method, named Adaptive\nSurface Normal (ASN) constraint, to effectively correlate the depth estimation\nwith geometric consistency. Our key idea is to adaptively determine the\nreliable local geometry from a set of randomly sampled candidates to derive\nsurface normal constraint, for which we measure the consistency of the\ngeometric contextual features. As a result, our method can faithfully\nreconstruct the 3D geometry and is robust to local shape variations, such as\nboundaries, sharp corners and noises.

Most of the research is\nfocused on achieving higher accuracy and these models are not optimized for\ndeployment on embedded systems from the perspective of latency and power\nefficiency. For high speed driving scenarios, latency is a crucial parameter as\nit provides more time to react to dangerous situations. Typically a voxel or\npoint-cloud based 3D convolution approach is utilized for this module. Firstly,\nthey are inefficient on embedded platforms as they are not suitable for\nefficient parallelization. Secondly, they have a variable runtime due to level\nof sparsity of the scene which is against the determinism needed in a safety\nsystem. In this work, we aim to develop a very low latency algorithm with fixed\nruntime. We propose a novel semantic segmentation architecture as a single\nunified model for object center detection using key points, box predictions and\norientation prediction using binned classification in a simpler Bird's Eye View\n(BEV) 2D representation. The proposed architecture can be trivially extended to\ninclude semantic segmentation classes like road without any additional\ncomputation.

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have led to significant improvements in\ntasks involving semantic segmentation of images. CNNs are vulnerable in the\narea of biomedical image segmentation because of distributional gap between two\nsource and target domains with different data modalities which leads to domain\nshift. Domain shift makes data annotations in new modalities necessary because\nmodels must be retrained from scratch. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is\nproposed to adapt a model to new modalities using solely unlabeled target\ndomain data. Common UDA algorithms require access to data points in the source\ndomain which may not be feasible in medical imaging due to privacy concerns. In\nthis work, we develop an algorithm for UDA in a privacy-constrained setting,\nwhere the source domain data is inaccessible. Our idea is based on encoding the\ninformation from the source samples into a prototypical distribution that is\nused as an intermediate distribution for aligning the target domain\ndistribution with the source domain distribution.

          "description": "Modern change detection (CD) has achieved remarkable success by the powerful\ndiscriminative ability of deep convolutions. However, high-resolution remote\nsensing CD remains challenging due to the complexity of objects in the scene.\nObjects with the same semantic concept may show distinct spectral\ncharacteristics at different times and spatial locations. Most recent CD\npipelines using pure convolutions are still struggling to relate long-range\nconcepts in space-time. Non-local self-attention approaches show promising\nperformance via modeling dense relations among pixels, yet are computationally\ninefficient. Here, we propose a bitemporal image transformer (BIT) to\nefficiently and effectively model contexts within the spatial-temporal domain.\nOur intuition is that the high-level concepts of the change of interest can be\nrepresented by a few visual words, i.e., semantic tokens. To achieve this, we\nexpress the bitemporal image into a few tokens, and use a transformer encoder\nto model contexts in the compact token-based space-time. The learned\ncontext-rich tokens are then feedback to the pixel-space for refining the\noriginal features via a transformer decoder. We incorporate BIT in a deep\nfeature differencing-based CD framework. Extensive experiments on three CD\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.\nNotably, our BIT-based model significantly outperforms the purely convolutional\nbaseline using only 3 times lower computational costs and model parameters.\nBased on a naive backbone (ResNet18) without sophisticated structures (e.g.,\nFPN, UNet), our model surpasses several state-of-the-art CD methods, including\nbetter than four recent attention-based methods in terms of efficiency and\naccuracy.

          "description": "Traditional computer vision approaches, based on neural networks (NN), are\ntypically trained on a large amount of image data. By minimizing the\ncross-entropy loss between a prediction and a given class label, the NN and its\nvisual embedding space are learned to fulfill a given task. However, due to the\nsole dependence on the image data distribution of the training domain, these\nmodels tend to fail when applied to a target domain that differs from their\nsource domain. To learn a more robust NN to domain shifts, we propose the\nknowledge graph neural network (KG-NN), a neuro-symbolic approach that\nsupervises the training using image-data-invariant auxiliary knowledge. The\nauxiliary knowledge is first encoded in a knowledge graph with respective\nconcepts and their relationships, which is then transformed into a dense vector\nrepresentation via an embedding method. Using a contrastive loss function,\nKG-NN learns to adapt its visual embedding space and thus its weights according\nto the image-data invariant knowledge graph embedding space. We evaluate KG-NN\non visual transfer learning tasks for classification using the mini-ImageNet\ndataset and its derivatives, as well as road sign recognition datasets from\nGermany and China. The results show that a visual model trained with a\nknowledge graph as a trainer outperforms a model trained with cross-entropy in\nall experiments, in particular when the domain gap increases. Besides better\nperformance and stronger robustness to domain shifts, these KG-NN adapts to\nmultiple datasets and classes without suffering heavily from catastrophic\nforgetting.",

Results: 1) With the help of the super-resolution\nmodel, the YOLOv4 model and the CenterNet model both increased the mAP score by\n9.6% and 13.8%. 2) Two methods for transforming the target model into a\nclassification model are proposed. And the unified output is in a specified\nformat to facilitate the call of the molti-AI model. 3) In the classification\nevaluation experiment, concatenated by the YOLOv4 model (sensitivity 57.73%,\nspecificity 90.08%) and the CenterNet model (sensitivity 62.64%, specificity\n92.54%), the multi-AI model will refuse to make judgments on 23.55% of the\ninput data. Correspondingly, the performance has been greatly improved to\n95.91% for the sensitivity and 96.02% for the specificity. Conclusion: Our work\nmakes the AI model more reliable in medical image diagnosis. Significance: 1)\nThe proposed method makes the target detection model more suitable for\ndiagnosing breast ultrasound images. 2) It provides a new idea for artificial\nintelligence in medical diagnosis, which can more conveniently introduce target\ndetection models from other fields to serve medical lesion screening.",

          "description": "Multi-view clustering is an important research topic due to its capability to\nutilize complementary information from multiple views. However, there are few\nmethods to consider the negative impact caused by certain views with unclear\nclustering structures, resulting in poor multi-view clustering performance. To\naddress this drawback, we propose self-supervised discriminative feature\nlearning for deep multi-view clustering (SDMVC). Concretely, deep autoencoders\nare applied to learn embedded features for each view independently. To leverage\nthe multi-view complementary information, we concatenate all views' embedded\nfeatures to form the global features, which can overcome the negative impact of\nsome views' unclear clustering structures. In a self-supervised manner,\npseudo-labels are obtained to build a unified target distribution to perform\nmulti-view discriminative feature learning. During this process, global\ndiscriminative information can be mined to supervise all views to learn more\ndiscriminative features, which in turn are used to update the target\ndistribution. Besides, this unified target distribution can make SDMVC learn\nconsistent cluster assignments, which accomplishes the clustering consistency\nof multiple views while preserving their features' diversity. Experiments on\nvarious types of multi-view datasets show that SDMVC achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.",

          "description": "The success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation tasks\nusually requires a large amount of labeled data. However, obtaining reliable\nannotations is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised learning has\nattracted much attention in medical image segmentation by taking the advantage\nof unlabeled data which is much easier to acquire. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel dual-task mutual learning framework for semi-supervised medical image\nsegmentation. Our framework can be formulated as an integration of two\nindividual segmentation networks based on two tasks: learning region-based\nshape constraint and learning boundary-based surface mismatch. Different from\nthe one-way transfer between teacher and student networks, an ensemble of\ndual-task students can learn collaboratively and implicitly explore useful\nknowledge from each other during the training process. By jointly learning the\nsegmentation probability maps and signed distance maps of targets, our\nframework can enforce the geometric shape constraint and learn more reliable\ninformation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves\nperformance gains by leveraging unlabeled data and outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods.",

However, what makes for its\none-to-one prediction has not been well understood. In this paper, we first\npoint out that one-to-one positive sample assignment is the key factor, while,\none-to-many assignment in previous detectors causes redundant predictions in\ninference. Second, we surprisingly find that even training with one-to-one\nassignment, previous detectors still produce redundant predictions. We identify\nthat classification cost in matching cost is the main ingredient: (1) previous\ndetectors only consider location cost, (2) by additionally introducing\nclassification cost, previous detectors immediately produce one-to-one\nprediction during inference. We introduce the concept of score gap to explore\nthe effect of matching cost. Classification cost enlarges the score gap by\nchoosing positive samples as those of highest score in the training iteration\nand reducing noisy positive samples brought by only location cost. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the advantages of end-to-end object detection on crowded scenes.\nThe code is available at: \\url{https://github.com/PeizeSun/OneNet}.",

          "description": "Colorectal cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers and colorectal\ncancer liver metastases (CRLM) is the major cause of death in patients with\ncolorectal cancer. Multifocality occurs frequently in CRLM, but is relatively\nunexplored in CRLM outcome prediction. Most existing clinical and imaging\nbiomarkers do not take the imaging features of all multifocal lesions into\naccount. In this paper, we present an end-to-end autoencoder-based multiple\ninstance neural network (AMINN) for the prediction of survival outcomes in\nmultifocal CRLM patients using radiomic features extracted from\ncontrast-enhanced MRIs. Specifically, we jointly train an autoencoder to\nreconstruct input features and a multiple instance network to make predictions\nby aggregating information from all tumour lesions of a patient. Also, we\nincorporate a two-step normalization technique to improve the training of deep\nneural networks, built on the observation that the distributions of radiomic\nfeatures are almost always severely skewed. Experimental results empirically\nvalidated our hypothesis that incorporating imaging features of all lesions\nimproves outcome prediction for multifocal cancer. The proposed AMINN framework\nachieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.70, which is 11.4% higher than\nthe best baseline method. A risk score based on the outputs of AMINN achieved\nsuperior prediction in our multifocal CRLM cohort. The effectiveness of\nincorporating all lesions and applying two-step normalization is demonstrated\nby a series of ablation studies. A Keras implementation of AMINN is released.",

          "description": "Visual object tracking aims to precisely estimate the bounding box for the\ngiven target, which is a challenging problem due to factors such as deformation\nand occlusion. Many recent trackers adopt the multiple-stage tracking strategy\nto improve the quality of bounding box estimation. These methods first coarsely\nlocate the target and then refine the initial prediction in the following\nstages. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited precision, and\nthe coupling of different stages severely restricts the method's\ntransferability. This work proposes a novel, flexible, and accurate refinement\nmodule called Alpha-Refine (AR), which can significantly improve the base\ntrackers' box estimation quality. By exploring a series of design options, we\nconclude that the key to successful refinement is extracting and maintaining\ndetailed spatial information as much as possible. Following this principle,\nAlpha-Refine adopts a pixel-wise correlation, a corner prediction head, and an\nauxiliary mask head as the core components. Comprehensive experiments on\nTrackingNet, LaSOT, GOT-10K, and VOT2020 benchmarks with multiple base trackers\nshow that our approach significantly improves the base trackers' performance\nwith little extra latency. The proposed Alpha-Refine method leads to a series\nof strengthened trackers, among which the ARSiamRPN (AR strengthened SiamRPNpp)\nand the ARDiMP50 (ARstrengthened DiMP50) achieve good efficiency-precision\ntrade-off, while the ARDiMPsuper (AR strengthened DiMP-super) achieves very\ncompetitive performance at a real-time speed.

          "description": "Recently, many plug-and-play self-attention modules are proposed to enhance\nthe model generalization by exploiting the internal information of deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). Previous works lay an emphasis on the\ndesign of attention module for specific functionality, e.g., light-weighted or\ntask-oriented attention. However, they ignore the importance of where to plug\nin the attention module since they connect the modules individually with each\nblock of the entire CNN backbone for granted, leading to incremental\ncomputational cost and number of parameters with the growth of network depth.\nThus, we propose a framework called Efficient Attention Network (EAN) to\nimprove the efficiency for the existing attention modules. In EAN, we leverage\nthe sharing mechanism (Huang et al. 2020) to share the attention module within\nthe backbone and search where to connect the shared attention module via\nreinforcement learning. Finally, we obtain the attention network with sparse\nconnections between the backbone and modules, while (1) maintaining accuracy\n(2) reducing extra parameter increment and (3) accelerating inference.\nExtensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks and popular attention networks\nshow the effectiveness of EAN. Furthermore, we empirically illustrate that our\nEAN has the capacity of transferring to other tasks and capturing the\ninformative features.

However, their kernel shapes and pooling operations are\nempirically predetermined; typically, a fixed-size square kernel shape and max\npooling operation are used.

As part of our framework, a parameterized pooling layer is\nproposed in which the kernel shape and pooling operation are trainable using\ntwo parameters, thereby allowing flexible pooling of the input data. We also\npropose a meta-learning algorithm for the parameterized pooling layer, which\nallows us to acquire a suitable pooling layer across multiple tasks. In the\nexperiment, we applied the proposed meta-learning framework to character\nrecognition tasks. The results demonstrate that a pooling layer that is\nsuitable across character recognition tasks was obtained via meta-learning, and\nthe obtained pooling layer improved the performance of the model in both\nfew-shot character recognition and noisy image recognition tasks.",

          "description": "Chest X-ray becomes one of the most common medical diagnoses due to its\nnoninvasiveness. The number of chest X-ray images has skyrocketed, but reading\nchest X-rays still have been manually performed by radiologists, which creates\nhuge burnouts and delays. Traditionally, radiomics, as a subfield of radiology\nthat can extract a large number of quantitative features from medical images,\ndemonstrates its potential to facilitate medical imaging diagnosis before the\ndeep learning era. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end framework,\nChexRadiNet, that can utilize the radiomics features to improve the abnormality\nclassification performance. Specifically, ChexRadiNet first applies a\nlight-weight but efficient triplet-attention mechanism to classify the chest\nX-rays and highlight the abnormal regions. Then it uses the generated class\nactivation map to extract radiomic features, which further guides our model to\nlearn more robust image features. After a number of iterations and with the\nhelp of radiomic features, our framework can converge to more accurate image\nregions. We evaluate the ChexRadiNet framework using three public datasets: NIH\nChestX-ray, CheXpert, and MIMIC-CXR. We find that ChexRadiNet outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art on both disease detection (0.843 in AUC) and localization\n(0.679 in T(IoU) = 0.1). We will make the code publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/bionlplab/lung_disease_detection_amia2021, with the hope\nthat this method can facilitate the development of automatic systems with a\nhigher-level understanding of the radiological world.",

To handle this limitation, an intuitive\nsolution is to utilize collaborative training to purify the pseudo label\nquality. However, there exists a challenge that the complementarity of two\nnetworks, which inevitably share a high similarity, becomes weakened gradually\nas training process goes on; worse still, these approaches typically ignore to\nconsider the self-discrepancy of intra-class relations.

Although previous learning-based methods\nhave demonstrated compelling results, most works estimate depth maps of\nindividual video frames independently, without taking into consideration the\nstrong geometric and temporal coherence among the frames. Moreover, current\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models mostly adopt a fully 3D convolution network for\ncost regularization and therefore require high computational cost, thus\nlimiting their deployment in real-world applications. Our method achieves\ntemporally coherent depth estimation results by using a novel Epipolar\nSpatio-Temporal (EST) transformer to explicitly associate geometric and\ntemporal correlation with multiple estimated depth maps. Furthermore, to reduce\nthe computational cost, inspired by recent Mixture-of-Experts models, we design\na compact hybrid network consisting of a 2D context-aware network and a 3D\nmatching network which learn 2D context information and 3D disparity cues\nseparately.

However, the furry\ncharacteristics and various appearance of the foregrounds, e.g., animal and\nportrait, challenge existing matting methods, which usually require extra user\ninputs such as trimap or scribbles. To resolve these problems, we study the\ndistinct roles of semantics and details for image matting and decompose the\ntask into two parallel sub-tasks: high-level semantic segmentation and\nlow-level details matting. Specifically, we propose a novel Glance and Focus\nMatting network (GFM), which employs a shared encoder and two separate decoders\nto learn both tasks in a collaborative manner for end-to-end natural image\nmatting. Besides, due to the limitation of available natural images in the\nmatting task, previous methods typically adopt composite images for training\nand evaluation, which result in limited generalization ability on real-world\nimages. In this paper, we investigate the domain gap issue between composite\nimages and real-world images systematically by conducting comprehensive\nanalyses of various discrepancies between foreground and background images. We\nfind that a carefully designed composition route RSSN that aims to reduce the\ndiscrepancies can lead to a better model with remarkable generalization\nability. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark containing 2,000 high-resolution\nreal-world animal images and 10,000 portrait images along with their manually\nlabeled alpha mattes to serve as a test bed for evaluating matting model's\ngeneralization ability on real-world images.

          "description": "Capturing uncertainty in object detection is indispensable for safe\nautonomous driving. In recent years, deep learning has become the de-facto\napproach for object detection, and many probabilistic object detectors have\nbeen proposed. However, there is no summary on uncertainty estimation in deep\nobject detection, and existing methods are not only built with different\nnetwork architectures and uncertainty estimation methods, but also evaluated on\ndifferent datasets with a wide range of evaluation metrics. As a result, a\ncomparison among methods remains challenging, as does the selection of a model\nthat best suits a particular application. This paper aims to alleviate this\nproblem by providing a review and comparative study on existing probabilistic\nobject detection methods for autonomous driving applications. First, we provide\nan overview of generic uncertainty estimation in deep learning, and then\nsystematically survey existing methods and evaluation metrics for probabilistic\nobject detection. Next, we present a strict comparative study for probabilistic\nobject detection based on an image detector and three public autonomous driving\ndatasets. Finally, we present a discussion of the remaining challenges and\nfuture works. Code has been made available at\nhttps://github.com/asharakeh/pod_compare.git",

          "description": "Data augmentation has greatly contributed to improving the performance in\nimage recognition tasks, and a lot of related studies have been conducted.\nHowever, data augmentation on 3D point cloud data has not been much explored.\n3D label has more sophisticated and rich structural information than the 2D\nlabel, so it enables more diverse and effective data augmentation. In this\npaper, we propose part-aware data augmentation (PA-AUG) that can better utilize\nrich information of 3D label to enhance the performance of 3D object detectors.\nPA-AUG divides objects into partitions and stochastically applies five\naugmentation methods to each local region. It is compatible with existing point\ncloud data augmentation methods and can be used universally regardless of the\ndetector's architecture. PA-AUG has improved the performance of\nstate-of-the-art 3D object detector for all classes of the KITTI dataset and\nhas the equivalent effect of increasing the train data by about 2.5$\\times$.

          "description": "Vision transformer (ViT) models exhibit substandard optimizability. In\nparticular, they are sensitive to the choice of optimizer (AdamW vs. SGD),\noptimizer hyperparameters, and training schedule length. In comparison, modern\nconvolutional neural networks are far easier to optimize. Why is this the case?\nIn this work, we conjecture that the issue lies with the patchify stem of ViT\nmodels, which is implemented by a stride-p pxp convolution (p=16 by default)\napplied to the input image. This large-kernel plus large-stride convolution\nruns counter to typical design choices of convolutional layers in neural\nnetworks. To test whether this atypical design choice causes an issue, we\nanalyze the optimization behavior of ViT models with their original patchify\nstem versus a simple counterpart where we replace the ViT stem by a small\nnumber of stacked stride-two 3x3 convolutions. While the vast majority of\ncomputation in the two ViT designs is identical, we find that this small change\nin early visual processing results in markedly different training behavior in\nterms of the sensitivity to optimization settings as well as the final model\naccuracy. Using a convolutional stem in ViT dramatically increases optimization\nstability and also improves peak performance (by ~1-2% top-1 accuracy on\nImageNet-1k), while maintaining flops and runtime. The improvement can be\nobserved across the wide spectrum of model complexities (from 1G to 36G flops)\nand dataset scales (from ImageNet-1k to ImageNet-21k). These findings lead us\nto recommend using a standard, lightweight convolutional stem for ViT models as\na more robust architectural choice compared to the original ViT model design.",

          "description": "Neuromorphic vision sensors (NVS) have been recently explored to tackle\nscenarios where conventional sensors result in high data rate and processing\ntime. This paper presents a hybrid event-frame approach for detecting and\ntracking objects recorded by a stationary neuromorphic sensor, thereby\nexploiting the sparse NVS output in a low-power setting for traffic monitoring.\nSpecifically, we propose a hardware efficient processing pipeline that\noptimizes memory and computational needs. The usage of NVS gives the advantage\nof rejecting background while it has a unique disadvantage of fragmented\nobjects. To exploit the background removal, we propose an event-based binary\nimage creation that signals presence or absence of events in a frame duration.\nThis reduces memory requirement and enables usage of simple algorithms like\nmedian filtering and connected component labeling for denoise and region\nproposal respectively. To overcome the fragmentation issue, a YOLO-inspired\nneural network based detector and classifier to merge fragmented region\nproposals has been proposed. Finally, an overlap based tracker exploiting\noverlap between detections and tracks is proposed with heuristics to overcome\nocclusion. The proposed pipeline is evaluated with more than 5 hours of traffic\nrecording spanning three different locations on two different NVS and\ndemonstrate similar performance. Compared to existing event-based feature\ntrackers, our method provides similar accuracy while needing 6 times less\ncomputes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a stationary NVS\nbased traffic monitoring solution is extensively compared to simultaneously\nrecorded RGB frame-methods while showing tremendous promise by outperforming\nstate-of-the-art deep learning solutions.",

While recent learning-based methods\nestimate depth at high accuracy, 3D point clouds exported from their depth maps\noften fail to preserve important geometric feature (e.g., corners, edges,\nplanes) of man-made scenes. Widely-used pixel-wise depth errors do not\nspecifically penalize inconsistency on these features. These inaccuracies are\nparticularly severe when subsequent depth reconstructions are accumulated in an\nattempt to scan a full environment with man-made objects with this kind of\nfeatures.

In order to further improve the depth\nestimation accuracy, we introduce a new occlusion-aware strategy that\naggregates initial depth predictions from multiple adjacent views into one\nfinal depth map and one occlusion probability map for the current reference\nview.

          "description": "It is commonly believed that networks cannot be both accurate and robust,\nthat gaining robustness means losing accuracy. It is also generally believed\nthat, unless making networks larger, network architectural elements would\notherwise matter little in improving adversarial robustness. Here we present\nevidence to challenge these common beliefs by a careful study about adversarial\ntraining. Our key observation is that the widely-used ReLU activation function\nsignificantly weakens adversarial training due to its non-smooth nature. Hence\nwe propose smooth adversarial training (SAT), in which we replace ReLU with its\nsmooth approximations to strengthen adversarial training. The purpose of smooth\nactivation functions in SAT is to allow it to find harder adversarial examples\nand compute better gradient updates during adversarial training.\n\nCompared to standard adversarial training, SAT improves adversarial\nrobustness for \"free\", i.e., no drop in accuracy and no increase in\ncomputational cost. For example, without introducing additional computations,\nSAT significantly enhances ResNet-50's robustness from 33.0% to 42.3%, while\nalso improving accuracy by 0.9% on ImageNet. SAT also works well with larger\nnetworks: it helps EfficientNet-L1 to achieve 82.2% accuracy and 58.6%\nrobustness on ImageNet, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art defense by\n9.5% for accuracy and 11.6% for robustness.

In this\nstudy, we focus on the development of contextual, semantically meaningful\nrepresentations of the driver state, which can then be used to determine the\nappropriate timing and conditions for transfer of control between driver and\nvehicle. To this end, we conduct a large-scale real-world controlled data study\nwhere participants are instructed to take-over control from an autonomous agent\nunder different driving conditions while engaged in a variety of distracting\nactivities. These take-over events are captured using multiple driver-facing\ncameras, which when labelled result in a dataset of control transitions and\ntheir corresponding take-over times (TOTs). We then develop and train TOT\nmodels that operate sequentially on mid to high-level features produced by\ncomputer vision algorithms operating on different driver-facing camera views.\nThe proposed TOT model produces continuous estimates of take-over times without\ndelay, and shows promising qualitative and quantitative results in complex\nreal-world scenarios.",

Our kernel approximations\nallow for fast GPU-implementation of the PDE-solvers, we release our\nimplementation with this article. Just like for linear convolution a\nmorphological convolution is specified by a kernel that we train in our\nPDE-G-CNNs.

In this paper, we introduce Split, Embed\nand Merge (SEM), an accurate table structure recognizer. In the first stage, we\nuse the FCN to predict the potential regions of the table row (column)\nseparators, so as to obtain the bounding boxes of the basic grids in the table.\nIn the second stage, we not only extract the visual features corresponding to\neach grid through RoIAlign, but also use the off-the-shelf recognizer and the\nBERT to extract the semantic features. The fused features of both are used to\ncharacterize each table grid. We find that by adding additional semantic\nfeatures to each grid, the ambiguity problem of the table structure from the\nvisual perspective can be solved to a certain extent and achieve higher\nprecision. Finally, we process the merging of these basic grids in a\nself-regression manner. The correspondent merging results is learned by the\nattention maps in attention mechanism. With the proposed method, we can\nrecognize the structure of tables well, even for complex tables. SEM can\nachieve an average F-Measure of $96.9\\%$ on the SciTSR dataset which\noutperforms other methods by a large margin.

Tracking all dynamic objects around the vehicle is\nessential for tasks such as obstacle avoidance and path planning. Autonomous\nvehicles are usually equipped with different sensor modalities to improve\naccuracy and reliability. While sensor fusion has been widely used in object\ndetection networks in recent years, most existing multi-object tracking\nalgorithms either rely on a single input modality, or do not fully exploit the\ninformation provided by multiple sensing modalities. In this work, we propose\nan end-to-end network for joint object detection and tracking based on radar\nand camera sensor fusion.

The proposed greedy algorithm uses the depth, velocity and\n2D displacement of the detected objects to associate them through time. This\nmakes our tracking algorithm very robust to occluded and overlapping objects,\nas the depth and velocity information can help the network in distinguishing\nthem. We evaluate our method on the challenging nuScenes dataset, where it\nachieves 20.0 AMOTA and outperforms all vision-based 3D tracking methods in the\nbenchmark, as well as the baseline LiDAR-based method.

          "description": "Extending computational harmonic analysis tools from the classical setting of\nregular lattices to the more general setting of graphs and networks is very\nimportant and much research has been done recently. The Generalized Haar-Walsh\nTransform (GHWT) developed by Irion and Saito (2014) is a multiscale transform\nfor signals on graphs, which is a generalization of the classical Haar and\nWalsh-Hadamard Transforms. We propose the extended Generalized Haar-Walsh\nTransform (eGHWT), which is a generalization of the adapted time-frequency\ntilings of Thiele and Villemoes (1996). The eGHWT examines not only the\nefficiency of graph-domain partitions but also that of \"sequency-domain\"\npartitions simultaneously. Consequently, the eGHWT and its associated\nbest-basis selection algorithm for graph signals significantly improve the\nperformance of the previous GHWT with the similar computational cost, $O(N \\log\nN)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes of an input graph. While the GHWT\nbest-basis algorithm seeks the most suitable orthonormal basis for a given task\namong more than $(1.5)^N$ possible orthonormal bases in $\\mathbb{R}^N$, the\neGHWT best-basis algorithm can find a better one by searching through more than\n$0.618\\cdot(1.84)^N$ possible orthonormal bases in $\\mathbb{R}^N$. This article\ndescribes the details of the eGHWT best-basis algorithm and demonstrates its\nsuperiority using several examples including genuine graph signals as well as\nconventional digital images viewed as graph signals. Furthermore, we also show\nhow the eGHWT can be extended to 2D signals and matrix-form data by viewing\nthem as a tensor product of graphs generated from their columns and rows and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness on applications such as image approximation.",

Humans differentiate these complex\nactivities by recognising critical spatio-temporal relations among explicitly\nrecognised objects and parts, for example, an object entering the aperture of a\ncontainer. Deep neural networks can struggle to learn such critical\nrelationships effectively. Therefore we propose a more human-like approach to\nactivity recognition, which interprets a video in sequential temporal phases\nand extracts specific relationships among objects and hands in those phases.\nRandom forest classifiers are learnt from these extracted relationships. We\napply the method to a challenging subset of the something-something dataset and\nachieve a more robust performance against neural network baselines on\nchallenging activities.",

In this study, we address action prediction by\ninvestigating how action patterns evolve over time in a spatial feature space.\nThere are three key components to our system. First, we work with\nintermediate-layer ConvNet features, which allow for abstraction from raw data,\nwhile retaining spatial layout. Second, instead of propagating features per se,\nwe propagate their residuals across time, which allows for a compact\nrepresentation that reduces redundancy. Third, we employ a Kalman filter to\ncombat error build-up and unify across prediction start times. Extensive\nexperimental results on multiple benchmarks show that our approach leads to\ncompetitive performance in action prediction. Notably, we investigate the\nlearned components of our system to shed light on their otherwise opaque\nnatures in two ways. First, we document that our learned feature propagation\nmodule works as a spatial shifting mechanism under convolution to propagate\ncurrent observations into the future. Thus, it captures flow-based image motion\ninformation. Second, the learned Kalman filter adaptively updates prior\nestimation to aid the sequence learning process.",

          "description": "With the development of deep encoder-decoder architectures and large-scale\nannotated medical datasets, great progress has been achieved in the development\nof automatic medical image segmentation. Due to the stacking of convolution\nlayers and the consecutive sampling operations, existing standard models\ninevitably encounter the information recession problem of feature\nrepresentations, which fails to fully model the global contextual feature\ndependencies. To overcome the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel\nTransformer based medical image semantic segmentation framework called\nTransAttUnet, in which the multi-level guided attention and multi-scale skip\nconnection are jointly designed to effectively enhance the functionality and\nflexibility of traditional U-shaped architecture. Inspired by Transformer, a\nnovel self-aware attention (SAA) module with both Transformer Self Attention\n(TSA) and Global Spatial Attention (GSA) is incorporated into TransAttUnet to\neffectively learn the non-local interactions between encoder features. In\nparticular, we also establish additional multi-scale skip connections between\ndecoder blocks to aggregate the different semantic-scale upsampling features.\nIn this way, the representation ability of multi-scale context information is\nstrengthened to generate discriminative features. Benefitting from these\ncomplementary components, the proposed TransAttUnet can effectively alleviate\nthe loss of fine details caused by the information recession problem, improving\nthe diagnostic sensitivity and segmentation quality of medical image analysis.\nExtensive experiments on multiple medical image segmentation datasets of\ndifferent imaging demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

Action prediction is a major sub-area of\nvideo predictive understanding and is the focus of this review. This sub-area\nhas two major subdivisions: early action recognition and future action\nprediction. Early action recognition is concerned with recognizing an ongoing\naction as soon as possible. Future action prediction is concerned with the\nanticipation of actions that follow those previously observed. In either case,\nthe \\textbf{\\textit{causal}} relationship between the past, current, and\npotential future information is the main focus.

However, these approaches face challenges such as the\ncurse of dimensionality, poor generalization, and constraints from\ndomain-specific knowledge. Recently, structures that rely on deep convolutional\nneural networks and recurrent neural networks have been extensively proposed\nfor improving the performance of existing vision tasks, in general, and action\nprediction tasks, in particular.

We\npropose an episode-based cross-attention (EpiCA) network which combines merits\nof cross-attention mechanism and episode-based training strategy to recognize\nnovel compositional concepts. Firstly, EpiCA bases on cross-attention to\ncorrelate concept-visual information and utilizes the gated pooling layer to\nbuild contextualized representations for both images and concepts. The updated\nrepresentations are used for a more in-depth multi-modal relevance calculation\nfor concept recognition. Secondly, a two-phase episode training strategy,\nespecially the transductive phase, is adopted to utilize unlabeled test\nexamples to alleviate the low-resource learning problem. Experiments on two\nwidely-used zero-shot compositional learning (ZSCL) benchmarks have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of the model compared with recent approaches on\nboth conventional and generalized ZSCL settings.",

In addition, most MPI techniques use fixed\ndepth/disparity planes which cannot be modified once the training is complete,\nhence offering very little flexibility at run-time.\n\nWe propose LiveView - a novel MPI generation and rendering technique that\nproduces high-quality view synthesis in real-time. Our method can also offer\nthe flexibility to select scene-dependent MPI planes (number of planes and\nspacing between them) at run-time. LiveView first warps input images to target\nview (target-centered) and then learns to generate a target view centered MPI,\none depth plane at a time (dynamically). The method generates high-quality\nrenderings, while also enabling fast MPI generation and novel view synthesis.\nAs a result, LiveView enables real-time view synthesis applications where an\nMPI needs to be updated frequently based on a video stream of input views. We\ndemonstrate that LiveView improves the quality of view synthesis while being 70\ntimes faster at run-time compared to state-of-the-art MPI-based methods.",

Therefore, CT lung screening has started to be\nused widely all across the world. However, analyzing these images is a serious\nburden for radiologists. The number of slices in a CT scan can be up to 600.\nTherefore, computer-aided-detection (CAD) systems are very important for faster\nand more accurate assessment of the data. In this study, we proposed a\nframework that analyzes CT lung screenings using convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) to reduce false positives. We trained our model with different volume\nsizes and showed that volume size plays a critical role in the performance of\nthe system. We also used different fusions in order to show their power and\neffect on the overall accuracy. 3D CNNs were preferred over 2D CNNs because 2D\nconvolutional operations applied to 3D data could result in information loss.\nThe proposed framework has been tested on the dataset provided by the LUNA16\nChallenge and resulted in a sensitivity of 0.831 at 1 false positive per scan.",

          "description": "During pregnancy, ultrasound examination in the second trimester can assess\nfetal size according to standardized charts. To achieve a reproducible and\naccurate measurement, a sonographer needs to identify three standard 2D planes\nof the fetal anatomy (head, abdomen, femur) and manually mark the key\nanatomical landmarks on the image for accurate biometry and fetal weight\nestimation. This can be a time-consuming operator-dependent task, especially\nfor a trainee sonographer. Computer-assisted techniques can help in automating\nthe fetal biometry computation process. In this paper, we present a unified\nautomated framework for estimating all measurements needed for the fetal weight\nassessment. The proposed framework semantically segments the key fetal\nanatomies using state-of-the-art segmentation models, followed by region\nfitting and scale recovery for the biometry estimation. We present an ablation\nstudy of segmentation algorithms to show their robustness through 4-fold\ncross-validation on a dataset of 349 ultrasound standard plane images from 42\npregnancies. Moreover, we show that the network with the best segmentation\nperformance tends to be more accurate for biometry estimation.

Clinical findings show that it is possible for COVID-19 patients to\nhave significantly low SpO$_2$ before any obvious symptoms. The prevalence of\ncameras has motivated researchers to investigate methods for monitoring SpO$_2$\nusing videos. Most prior schemes involving smartphones are contact-based: They\nrequire a fingertip to cover the phone's camera and the nearby light source to\ncapture re-emitted light from the illuminated tissue. In this paper, we propose\nthe first convolutional neural network based noncontact SpO$_2$ estimation\nscheme using smartphone cameras. The scheme analyzes the videos of a\nparticipant's hand for physiological sensing, which is convenient and\ncomfortable, and can protect their privacy and allow for keeping face masks on.\nWe design our neural network architectures inspired by the optophysiological\nmodels for SpO$_2$ measurement and demonstrate the explainability by\nvisualizing the weights for channel combination. Our proposed models outperform\nthe state-of-the-art model that is designed for contact-based SpO$_2$\nmeasurement, showing the potential of our proposed method to contribute to\npublic health.

In our 2-D model, we introduce the Deep\nWilcoxon signed-rank test (DWCC) to determine the importance of each slice of a\nCT scan to overcome the issue mentioned previously. Furthermore, a\nConvolutional CT scan-Aware Transformer (CCAT) is proposed to discover the\ncontext of the slices fully. The frame-level feature is extracted from each CT\nslice based on any backbone network and followed by feeding the features to our\nwithin-slice-Transformer (WST) to discover the context information in the pixel\ndimension.

However, the quality of\ndeep-learning-based methods relies heavily on the amount of training data, and\nthe cost of acquiring a large amount of data is often prohibitive in medical\nfields. Therefore, we performed CT modality conversion based on deep learning\nrequiring only a small number of unsupervised images. The proposed method is\nbased on generative adversarial networks (GANs) with several extensions\ntailored for CT images. This method emphasizes the preservation of the\nstructure in the processed images and reduction in the amount of training data.\nThis method was applied to realize the conversion of mega-voltage computed\ntomography (MVCT) to kilo-voltage computed tomography (kVCT) images. Training\nwas performed using several datasets acquired from patients with head and neck\ncancer. The size of the datasets ranged from 16 slices (for two patients) to\n2745 slices (for 137 patients) of MVCT and 2824 slices of kVCT for 98 patients.\nThe quality of the processed MVCT images was considerably enhanced, and the\nstructural changes in the images were minimized. With an increase in the size\nof training data, the image quality exhibited a satisfactory convergence from a\nfew hundred slices. In addition to statistical and visual evaluations, these\nresults were clinically evaluated by medical doctors in terms of the accuracy\nof contouring. We developed an MVCT to kVCT conversion model based on deep\nlearning, which can be trained using a few hundred unpaired images. The\nstability of the model against the change in the data size was demonstrated.\nThis research promotes the reliable use of deep learning in clinical medicine\nby partially answering the commonly asked questions: \"Is our data enough?

And the experimental results show that the CSS plays a significant role in\nthe reconstruction accuracy of an HSI.

To solve\nthese issues, we propose a novel multi-view learning method with locality\nrelationship constraint to explore the problem of multi-view clustering, called\nLocality Relationship Constrained Multi-view Clustering Framework (LRC-MCF).\nLRC-MCF aims to explore the diversity, geometric, consensus and complementary\ninformation among different views, by capturing the locality relationship\ninformation and the common similarity relationships among multiple views.\nMoreover, LRC-MCF takes sufficient consideration to weights of different views\nin finding the common-view locality structure and straightforwardly produce the\nfinal clusters. To effectually reduce the redundancy of the learned\nrepresentations, the low-rank constraint on the common similarity matrix is\nconsidered additionally. To solve the minimization problem of LRC-MCF, an\nAlternating Direction Minimization (ADM) method is provided to iteratively\ncalculate all variables LRC-MCF.

          "description": "The advancement of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on various vision\napplications has attracted lots of attention. Yet the majority of CNNs are\nunable to satisfy the strict requirement for real-world deployment. To overcome\nthis, the recent popular network pruning is an effective method to reduce the\nredundancy of the models. However, the ranking of filters according to their\n\"importance\" on different pruning criteria may be inconsistent. One filter\ncould be important according to a certain criterion, while it is unnecessary\naccording to another one, which indicates that each criterion is only a partial\nview of the comprehensive \"importance\". From this motivation, we propose a\nnovel framework to integrate the existing filter pruning criteria by exploring\nthe criteria diversity. The proposed framework contains two stages: Criteria\nClustering and Filters Importance Calibration. First, we condense the pruning\ncriteria via layerwise clustering based on the rank of \"importance\" score.\nSecond, within each cluster, we propose a calibration factor to adjust their\nsignificance for each selected blending candidates and search for the optimal\nblending criterion via Evolutionary Algorithm. Quantitative results on the\nCIFAR-100 and ImageNet benchmarks show that our framework outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines, regrading to the compact model performance after\npruning.",

          "description": "A large labeled dataset is a key to the success of supervised deep learning,\nbut for medical image segmentation, it is highly challenging to obtain\nsufficient annotated images for model training. In many scenarios, unannotated\nimages are abundant and easy to acquire. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has\nshown great potentials in exploiting raw data information and representation\nlearning. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Supervised Learning\n(HSSL), a new self-supervised framework that boosts medical image segmentation\nby making good use of unannotated data. Unlike the current literature on\ntask-specific self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning,\nwe utilize SSL to learn task-agnostic knowledge from heterogeneous data for\nvarious medical image segmentation tasks. Specifically, we first aggregate a\ndataset from several medical challenges, then pre-train the network in a\nself-supervised manner, and finally fine-tune on labeled data. We develop a new\nloss function by combining contrastive loss and classification loss and\npretrain an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation tasks. Our extensive\nexperiments show that multi-domain joint pre-training benefits downstream\nsegmentation tasks and outperforms single-domain pre-training significantly.\nCompared to learning from scratch, our new method yields better performance on\nvarious tasks (e.g., +0.69% to +18.60% in Dice scores with 5% of annotated\ndata). With limited amounts of training data, our method can substantially\nbridge the performance gap w.r.t. denser annotations (e.g., 10% vs.~100% of\nannotated data).",

          "description": "Domain adaptation (DA) approaches address domain shift and enable networks to\nbe applied to different scenarios. Although various image DA approaches have\nbeen proposed in recent years, there is limited research towards video DA. This\nis partly due to the complexity in adapting the different modalities of\nfeatures in videos, which includes the correlation features extracted as\nlong-term dependencies of pixels across spatiotemporal dimensions. The\ncorrelation features are highly associated with action classes and proven their\neffectiveness in accurate video feature extraction through the supervised\naction recognition task. Yet correlation features of the same action would\ndiffer across domains due to domain shift. Therefore we propose a novel\nAdversarial Correlation Adaptation Network (ACAN) to align action videos by\naligning pixel correlations. ACAN aims to minimize the distribution of\ncorrelation information, termed as Pixel Correlation Discrepancy (PCD).\nAdditionally, video DA research is also limited by the lack of cross-domain\nvideo datasets with larger domain shifts. We, therefore, introduce a novel\nHMDB-ARID dataset with a larger domain shift caused by a larger statistical\ndifference between domains. This dataset is built in an effort to leverage\ncurrent datasets for dark video classification. Empirical results demonstrate\nthe state-of-the-art performance of our proposed ACAN for both existing and the\nnew video DA datasets.",

          "description": "The segmentation of medical images is a fundamental step in automated\nclinical decision support systems. Existing medical image segmentation methods\nbased on supervised deep learning, however, remain problematic because of their\nreliance on large amounts of labelled training data. Although medical imaging\ndata repositories continue to expand, there has not been a commensurate\nincrease in the amount of annotated data. Hence, we propose a new spatial\nguided self-supervised clustering network (SGSCN) for medical image\nsegmentation, where we introduce multiple loss functions designed to aid in\ngrouping image pixels that are spatially connected and have similar feature\nrepresentations. It iteratively learns feature representations and clustering\nassignment of each pixel in an end-to-end fashion from a single image. We also\npropose a context-based consistency loss that better delineates the shape and\nboundaries of image regions. It enforces all the pixels belonging to a cluster\nto be spatially close to the cluster centre. We evaluated our method on 2\npublic medical image datasets and compared it to existing conventional and\nself-supervised clustering methods. Experimental results show that our method\nwas most accurate for medical image segmentation.",

          "description": "Detection of moving objects is a very important task in autonomous driving\nsystems. After the perception phase, motion planning is typically performed in\nBird's Eye View (BEV) space. This would require projection of objects detected\non the image plane to top view BEV plane. Such a projection is prone to errors\ndue to lack of depth information and noisy mapping in far away areas. CNNs can\nleverage the global context in the scene to project better. In this work, we\nexplore end-to-end Moving Object Detection (MOD) on the BEV map directly using\nmonocular images as input. To the best of our knowledge, such a dataset does\nnot exist and we create an extended KITTI-raw dataset consisting of 12.9k\nimages with annotations of moving object masks in BEV space for five classes.\nThe dataset is intended to be used for class agnostic motion cue based object\ndetection and classes are provided as meta-data for better tuning. We design\nand implement a two-stream RGB and optical flow fusion architecture which\noutputs motion segmentation directly in BEV space. We compare it with inverse\nperspective mapping of state-of-the-art motion segmentation predictions on the\nimage plane. We observe a significant improvement of 13% in mIoU using the\nsimple baseline implementation. This demonstrates the ability to directly learn\nmotion segmentation output in BEV space.

It is shown that\nEPC are capable to visualize multidimensional data and support visual machine\nlearning with preservation of multidimensional information in 2-D. Relative to\nparallel and radial coordinates, EPC visualization requires only a half of the\nvisual elements for each n-D point.

By using interactive and automatic\nprocesses it discovers zones in EPC with a high dominance of a single class.\nThe EPC methodology has been successful in discovering non-linear predictive\nmodels with high coverage and precision in the computational experiments. This\ncan benefit multiple domains by producing visually appealing dominance rules.\nThis chapter presents results of successful testing the EPC non-linear\nmethodology in experiments using real and simulated data, EPC generalized to\nthe Dynamic Elliptic Paired Coordinates (DEPC), incorporation of the weights of\ncoordinates to optimize the visual discovery, introduction of an alternative\nEPC design and introduction of the concept of incompact machine learning\nmethodology based on EPC/DEPC.",

          "description": "Event-based cameras are biologically inspired sensors that output events,\ni.e., asynchronous pixel-wise brightness changes in the scene. Their high\ndynamic range and temporal resolution of a microsecond makes them more reliable\nthan standard cameras in environments of challenging illumination and in\nhigh-speed scenarios, thus developing odometry algorithms based solely on event\ncameras offers exciting new possibilities for autonomous systems and robots. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel stereo visual odometry method for event cameras\nbased on feature detection and matching with careful feature management, while\npose estimation is done by reprojection error minimization. We evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed method on two publicly available datasets: MVSEC\nsequences captured by an indoor flying drone and DSEC outdoor driving\nsequences. MVSEC offers accurate ground truth from motion capture, while for\nDSEC, which does not offer ground truth, in order to obtain a reference\ntrajectory on the standard camera frames we used our SOFT visual odometry, one\nof the highest ranking algorithms on the KITTI scoreboards. We compared our\nmethod to the ESVO method, which is the first and still the only stereo event\nodometry method, showing on par performance on the MVSEC sequences, while on\nthe DSEC dataset ESVO, unlike our method, was unable to handle outdoor driving\nscenario with default parameters. Furthermore, two important advantages of our\nmethod over ESVO are that it adapts tracking frequency to the asynchronous\nevent rate and does not require initialization.",

In this work, we present a strategy\naiming at distributing inference requests to a swarm of resource-constrained\nUAVs that classifies captured images on-board and finds the minimum\ndecision-making latency. We formulate the model as an optimization problem that\nminimizes the latency between acquiring images and making the final decisions.\nThe formulated optimization solution is an NP-hard problem. Hence it is not\nadequate for online resource allocation. Therefore, we introduce an online\nheuristic solution, namely DistInference, to find the layers placement strategy\nthat gives the best latency among the available UAVs. The proposed approach is\ngeneral enough to be used for different low decision-latency applications as\nwell as for all CNN types organized into the pipeline of layers (e.g., VGG) or\nbased on residual blocks (e.g., ResNet).",

          "description": "Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA) is a practical and general domain adaptation\nscenario, which relaxes the fully shared label space assumption such that the\nsource label space subsumes the target one. The key challenge of PDA is the\nissue of negative transfer caused by source-only classes. For videos, such\nnegative transfer could be triggered by both spatial and temporal features,\nwhich leads to a more challenging Partial Video Domain Adaptation (PVDA)\nproblem. In this paper, we propose a novel Partial Adversarial Temporal\nAttentive Network (PATAN) to address the PVDA problem by utilizing both spatial\nand temporal features for filtering source-only classes. Besides, PATAN\nconstructs effective overall temporal features by attending to local temporal\nfeatures that contribute more toward the class filtration process. We further\nintroduce new benchmarks to facilitate research on PVDA problems, covering a\nwide range of PVDA scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art performance of our proposed PATAN across the multiple PVDA\nbenchmarks.",

          "description": "Domain Adaptation (DA) methods are widely used in medical image segmentation\ntasks to tackle the problem of differently distributed train (source) and test\n(target) data. We consider the supervised DA task with a limited number of\nannotated samples from the target domain. It corresponds to one of the most\nrelevant clinical setups: building a sufficiently accurate model on the minimum\npossible amount of annotated data. Existing methods mostly fine-tune specific\nlayers of the pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, there is\nno consensus on which layers are better to fine-tune, e.g. the first layers for\nimages with low-level domain shift or the deeper layers for images with\nhigh-level domain shift. To this end, we propose SpotTUnet - a CNN architecture\nthat automatically chooses the layers which should be optimally fine-tuned.\nMore specifically, on the target domain, our method additionally learns the\npolicy that indicates whether a specific layer should be fine-tuned or reused\nfrom the pretrained network. We show that our method performs at the same level\nas the best of the nonflexible fine-tuning methods even under the extreme\nscarcity of annotated data. Secondly, we show that SpotTUnet policy provides a\nlayer-wise visualization of the domain shift impact on the network, which could\nbe further used to develop robust domain generalization methods. In order to\nextensively evaluate SpotTUnet performance, we use a publicly available dataset\nof brain MR images (CC359), characterized by explicit domain shift.

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on one set of medical images often\nexperience severe performance drop on unseen test images, due to various domain\ndiscrepancy between the training images (source domain) and the test images\n(target domain), which raises a domain adaptation issue. In clinical settings,\nit is difficult to collect enough annotated target domain data in a short\nperiod. Few-shot domain adaptation, i.e., adapting a trained model with a\nhandful of annotations, is highly practical and useful in this case. In this\npaper, we propose a Polymorphic Transformer (Polyformer), which can be\nincorporated into any DNN backbones for few-shot domain adaptation.\nSpecifically, after the polyformer layer is inserted into a model trained on\nthe source domain, it extracts a set of prototype embeddings, which can be\nviewed as a \"basis\" of the source-domain features. On the target domain, the\npolyformer layer adapts by only updating a projection layer which controls the\ninteractions between image features and the prototype embeddings. All other\nmodel weights (except BatchNorm parameters) are frozen during adaptation. Thus,\nthe chance of overfitting the annotations is greatly reduced, and the model can\nperform robustly on the target domain after being trained on a few annotated\nimages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Polyformer on two medical\nsegmentation tasks (i.e., optic disc/cup segmentation, and polyp segmentation).\nThe source code of Polyformer is released at\nhttps://github.com/askerlee/segtran.",

          "description": "Common neural network architectures are susceptible to attack by adversarial\nsamples. Neural network architectures are commonly thought of as divided into\nlow-level feature extraction layers and high-level classification layers;\nsusceptibility of networks to adversarial samples is often thought of as a\nproblem related to classification rather than feature extraction. We test this\nidea by selectively retraining different portions of VGG and ResNet\narchitectures on CIFAR-10, Imagenette and ImageNet using non-adversarial and\nadversarial data. Our experimental results show that susceptibility to\nadversarial samples is associated with low-level feature extraction layers.\nTherefore, retraining high-level layers is insufficient for achieving\nrobustness. This phenomenon could have two explanations: either, adversarial\nattacks yield outputs from early layers that are indistinguishable from\nfeatures found in the attack classes, or adversarial attacks yield outputs from\nearly layers that differ statistically from features for non-adversarial\nsamples and do not permit consistent classification by subsequent layers. We\ntest this question by large-scale non-linear dimensionality reduction and\ndensity modeling on distributions of feature vectors in hidden layers and find\nthat the feature distributions between non-adversarial and adversarial samples\ndiffer substantially. Our results provide new insights into the statistical\norigins of adversarial samples and possible defenses.",

          "description": "Surgical phase recognition is of particular interest to computer assisted\nsurgery systems, in which the goal is to predict what phase is occurring at\neach frame for a surgery video. Networks with multi-stage architecture have\nbeen widely applied in many computer vision tasks with rich patterns, where a\npredictor stage first outputs initial predictions and an additional refinement\nstage operates on the initial predictions to perform further refinement.\nExisting works show that surgical video contents are well ordered and contain\nrich temporal patterns, making the multi-stage architecture well suited for the\nsurgical phase recognition task. However, we observe that when simply applying\nthe multi-stage architecture to the surgical phase recognition task, the\nend-to-end training manner will make the refinement ability fall short of its\nwishes. To address the problem, we propose a new non end-to-end training\nstrategy and explore different designs of multi-stage architecture for surgical\nphase recognition task. For the non end-to-end training strategy, the\nrefinement stage is trained separately with proposed two types of disturbed\nsequences. Meanwhile, we evaluate three different choices of refinement models\nto show that our analysis and solution are robust to the choices of specific\nmulti-stage models. We conduct experiments on two public benchmarks, the\nM2CAI16 Workflow Challenge, and the Cholec80 dataset.

          "description": "Presence of noise in the labels of large scale facial expression datasets has\nbeen a key challenge towards Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in the wild.\nDuring early learning stage, deep networks fit on clean data. Then, eventually,\nthey start overfitting on noisy labels due to their memorization ability, which\nlimits FER performance. This work proposes an effective training strategy in\nthe presence of noisy labels, called as Consensual Collaborative Training (CCT)\nframework. CCT co-trains three networks jointly using a convex combination of\nsupervision loss and consistency loss, without making any assumption about the\nnoise distribution. A dynamic transition mechanism is used to move from\nsupervision loss in early learning to consistency loss for consensus of\npredictions among networks in the later stage. Inference is done using a single\nnetwork based on a simple knowledge distillation scheme. Effectiveness of the\nproposed framework is demonstrated on synthetic as well as real noisy FER\ndatasets. In addition, a large test subset of around 5K images is annotated\nfrom the FEC dataset using crowd wisdom of 16 different annotators and reliable\nlabels are inferred. CCT is also validated on it.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel representation learning algorithm which combines\nthe inference abilities of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with the\ngeneralization capability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The\nproposed model, called InfoVAEGAN, consists of three networks~: Encoder,\nGenerator and Discriminator. InfoVAEGAN aims to jointly learn discrete and\ncontinuous interpretable representations in an unsupervised manner by using two\ndifferent data-free log-likelihood functions onto the variables sampled from\nthe generator's distribution. We propose a two-stage algorithm for optimizing\nthe inference network separately from the generator training. Moreover, we\nenforce the learning of interpretable representations through the maximization\nof the mutual information between the existing latent variables and those\ncreated through generative and inference processes.",

Recently, several deep\nlearning methods designed for these problems have been successful.

In this work, we present a systemic approach to design network\narchitectures that can provide a larger receptive field while maintaining a\nhigher spatial feature resolution. To achieve a larger ERF, we utilized dilated\nconvolutional layers. By aggressively increasing dilation rates in the deeper\nlayers, we were able to achieve a sufficiently larger ERF with a significantly\nfewer number of trainable parameters. We used optical flow estimation problem\nas the primary benchmark to illustrate our network design strategy.

Recent work has shown that depth estimation\nfrom a stereo images pair could be solved with convolutional neural networks.\nHowever, most recent depth estimation models were trained on datasets with\nper-pixel ground truth. Such data is especially rare for laparoscopic imaging,\nmaking it hard to apply supervised depth estimation to real surgical\napplications. To overcome this limitation, we propose SADepth, a new\nself-supervised depth estimation method based on Generative Adversarial\nNetworks. It consists of an encoder-decoder generator and a discriminator to\nincorporate geometry constraints during training. Multi-scale outputs from the\ngenerator help to solve the local minima caused by the photometric reprojection\nloss, while the adversarial learning improves the framework generation quality.\nExtensive experiments on two public datasets show that SADepth outperforms\nrecent state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin, and reduces the\ngap between supervised and unsupervised depth estimation in laparoscopic\nimages.",

In addition, we\nleverage the changes in this distribution over time to control the sampling of\ndiverse future states by estimating the end of ongoing sequences.

Moreover,\ninstead of merely concatenating the descriptors, HPNet optimally combines\nhybrid representations by learning combination weights.

Firstly, a\nwell-performing survival model has minimal clinical application if it does not\ncontribute to the stratification of a cancer patient cohort into different risk\ngroups, preferably driven by histologic morphologies. In the clinical setting,\nindividuals are not given specific prognostic predictions, but are rather\npredicted to lie within a risk group which has a general survival trend. Thus,\nIt is imperative that a survival model produces well-stratified risk groups.\nSecondly, until now, survival modelling was done in a two-stage approach\n(encoding and aggregation). The massive amount of pixels in digitized whole\nslide images were never utilized to their fullest extent due to technological\nconstraints on data processing, forcing decoupled learning. EPIC-Survival\nbridges encoding and aggregation into an end-to-end survival modelling\napproach, while introducing stratification boosting to encourage the model to\nnot only optimize ranking, but also to discriminate between risk groups. In\nthis study we show that EPIC-Survival performs better than other approaches in\nmodelling intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a historically difficult cancer to\nmodel. Further, we show that stratification boosting improves further improves\nmodel performance, resulting in a concordance-index of 0.880 on a held-out test\nset.

Given an input photo, the layer-mixed model produces detailed\ncolor stylization for a caricature but without shape exaggerations. We then\nappend shape exaggeration blocks to the coarse layers of the layer-mixed model\nand train the blocks to create shape exaggerations while preserving the\ncharacteristic appearances of the input. Experimental results show that our\nStyleCariGAN generates realistic and detailed caricatures compared to the\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate StyleCariGAN also supports\nother StyleGAN-based image manipulations, such as facial expression control.",

          "description": "The process of aggregation is ubiquitous in almost all deep nets models. It\nfunctions as an important mechanism for consolidating deep features into a more\ncompact representation, whilst increasing robustness to overfitting and\nproviding spatial invariance in deep nets. In particular, the proximity of\nglobal aggregation layers to the output layers of DNNs mean that aggregated\nfeatures have a direct influence on the performance of a deep net. A better\nunderstanding of this relationship can be obtained using information theoretic\nmethods. However, this requires the knowledge of the distributions of the\nactivations of aggregation layers. To achieve this, we propose a novel\nmathematical formulation for analytically modelling the probability\ndistributions of output values of layers involved with deep feature\naggregation. An important outcome is our ability to analytically predict the\nKL-divergence of output nodes in a DNN. We also experimentally verify our\ntheoretical predictions against empirical observations across a range of\ndifferent classification tasks and datasets.",

          "description": "Randomized smoothing has recently emerged as an effective tool that enables\ncertification of deep neural network classifiers at scale. All prior art on\nrandomized smoothing has focused on isotropic $\\ell_p$ certification, which has\nthe advantage of yielding certificates that can be easily compared among\nisotropic methods via $\\ell_p$-norm radius. However, isotropic certification\nlimits the region that can be certified around an input to worst-case\nadversaries, \\ie it cannot reason about other \"close\", potentially large,\nconstant prediction safe regions. To alleviate this issue, (i) we theoretically\nextend the isotropic randomized smoothing $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ certificates to\ntheir generalized anisotropic counterparts following a simplified analysis.\nMoreover, (ii) we propose evaluation metrics allowing for the comparison of\ngeneral certificates - a certificate is superior to another if it certifies a\nsuperset region - with the quantification of each certificate through the\nvolume of the certified region. We introduce ANCER, a practical framework for\nobtaining anisotropic certificates for a given test set sample via volume\nmaximization. Our empirical results demonstrate that ANCER achieves\nstate-of-the-art $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ certified accuracy on both CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet at multiple radii, while certifying substantially larger regions in\nterms of volume, thus highlighting the benefits of moving away from isotropic\nanalysis.

Online social media provides an exciting\nplatform to study the use of masks and analyze underlying mask-wearing\npatterns. In this article, we analyze 2.04 million social media images for six\nUS cities.

We\nalso found a decrease in the posting of group pictures as stay-at-home laws\nwere put into place. Furthermore, mask compliance in the Black Lives Matter\nprotest was analyzed, eliciting that 40% of the people in group photos wore\nmasks, and 45% of them wore the masks with a fit score of greater than 80%. We\nintroduce two new datasets, VAriety MAsks - Classification (VAMA-C) and VAriety\nMAsks - Segmentation (VAMA-S), for mask detection and mask fit analysis tasks,\nrespectively. For the analysis, we create two frameworks, face mask detector\n(for classifying masked and unmasked faces) and mask fit analyzer (a semantic\nsegmentation based model to calculate a mask-fit score). The face mask detector\nachieved a classification accuracy of 98%, and the semantic segmentation model\nfor the mask fit analyzer achieved an Intersection Over Union (IOU) score of\n98%.

In\nthis paper, we present hierarchical contrastive motion learning, a new\nself-supervised learning framework to extract effective motion representations\nfrom raw video frames. Our approach progressively learns a hierarchy of motion\nfeatures that correspond to different abstraction levels in a network. This\nhierarchical design bridges the semantic gap between low-level motion cues and\nhigh-level recognition tasks, and promotes the fusion of appearance and motion\ninformation at multiple levels. At each level, an explicit motion\nself-supervision is provided via contrastive learning to enforce the motion\nfeatures at the current level to predict the future ones at the previous level.\nThus, the motion features at higher levels are trained to gradually capture\nsemantic dynamics and evolve more discriminative for action recognition. Our\nmotion learning module is lightweight and flexible to be embedded into various\nbackbone networks. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that the\nproposed approach consistently achieves superior results.",

          "description": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a prevalent imaging technique for\nretina. However, it is affected by multiplicative speckle noise that can\ndegrade the visibility of essential anatomical structures, including blood\nvessels and tissue layers. Although averaging repeated B-scan frames can\nsignificantly improve the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), this requires longer\nacquisition time, which can introduce motion artifacts and cause discomfort to\npatients. In this study, we propose a learning-based method that exploits\ninformation from the single-frame noisy B-scan and a pseudo-modality that is\ncreated with the aid of the self-fusion method. The pseudo-modality provides\ngood SNR for layers that are barely perceptible in the noisy B-scan but can\nover-smooth fine features such as small vessels. By using a fusion network,\ndesired features from each modality can be combined, and the weight of their\ncontribution is adjustable. Evaluated by intensity-based and structural\nmetrics, the result shows that our method can effectively suppress the speckle\nnoise and enhance the contrast between retina layers while the overall\nstructure and small blood vessels are preserved. Compared to the single\nmodality network, our method improves the structural similarity with low noise\nB-scan from 0.559 +\\- 0.033 to 0.576 +\\- 0.031.",

Then the descriptors of the query images and the support classes are\nprojected into different non-linear spaces in our proposed similarity metric\nlearning network to learn discriminative projection factors. This design can\neffectively operate in the challenging and restricted condition of a FSFGIC\ntask for making the distance between the samples within the same class smaller\nand the distance between samples from different classes larger and for reducing\nthe coupling relationship between samples from different categories.\nFurthermore, a novel similarity measure based on the proposed non-linear data\nproject is presented for evaluating the relationships of feature information\nbetween a query image and a support set. It is worth to note that our proposed\narchitecture can be easily embedded into any episodic training mechanisms for\nend-to-end training from scratch.

Complex scenes\ninclude enormous redundancy. The human vision system cannot process all\ninformation simultaneously, due to the visual information bottleneck.

          "description": "In order to handle the challenges of autonomous driving, deep learning has\nproven to be crucial in tackling increasingly complex tasks, such as 3D\ndetection or instance segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches for image-based\ndetection tasks tackle this complexity by operating in a cascaded fashion: they\nfirst extract a 2D bounding box based on which additional attributes, e.g.\ninstance masks, are inferred. While these methods perform well, a key challenge\nremains the lack of accurate and cheap annotations for the growing variety of\ntasks. Synthetic data presents a promising solution but, despite the effort in\ndomain adaptation research, the gap between synthetic and real data remains an\nopen problem. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised domain adaptation\nsetting which exploits the structure of cascaded detection tasks. In\nparticular, we learn to infer the attributes solely from the source domain\nwhile leveraging 2D bounding boxes as weak labels in both domains to explain\nthe domain shift. We further encourage domain-invariant features through\nclass-wise feature alignment using ground-truth class information, which is not\navailable in the unsupervised setting.

          "description": "Robotic visual systems operating in the wild must act in unconstrained\nscenarios, under different environmental conditions while facing a variety of\nsemantic concepts, including unknown ones. To this end, recent works tried to\nempower visual object recognition methods with the capability to i) detect\nunseen concepts and ii) extended their knowledge over time, as images of new\nsemantic classes arrive. This setting, called Open World Recognition (OWR), has\nthe goal to produce systems capable of breaking the semantic limits present in\nthe initial training set. However, this training set imposes to the system not\nonly its own semantic limits, but also environmental ones, due to its bias\ntoward certain acquisition conditions that do not necessarily reflect the high\nvariability of the real-world. This discrepancy between training and test\ndistribution is called domain-shift. This work investigates whether OWR\nalgorithms are effective under domain-shift, presenting the first benchmark\nsetup for assessing fairly the performances of OWR algorithms, with and without\ndomain-shift. We then use this benchmark to conduct analyses in various\nscenarios, showing how existing OWR algorithms indeed suffer a severe\nperformance degradation when train and test distributions differ. Our analysis\nshows that this degradation is only slightly mitigated by coupling OWR with\ndomain generalization techniques, indicating that the mere plug-and-play of\nexisting algorithms is not enough to recognize new and unknown categories in\nunseen domains. Our results clearly point toward open issues and future\nresearch directions, that need to be investigated for building robot visual\nsystems able to function reliably under these challenging yet very real\nconditions.

          "description": "In the present study, we propose to implement a new framework for estimating\ngenerative models via an adversarial process to extend an existing GAN\nframework and develop a white-box controllable image cartoonization, which can\ngenerate high-quality cartooned images/videos from real-world photos and\nvideos. The learning purposes of our system are based on three distinct\nrepresentations: surface representation, structure representation, and texture\nrepresentation. The surface representation refers to the smooth surface of the\nimages. The structure representation relates to the sparse colour blocks and\ncompresses generic content. The texture representation shows the texture,\ncurves, and features in cartoon images. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\nframework decomposes the images into different representations and learns from\nthem to generate cartoon images. This decomposition makes the framework more\ncontrollable and flexible which allows users to make changes based on the\nrequired output. This approach overcomes any previous system in terms of\nmaintaining clarity, colours, textures, shapes of images yet showing the\ncharacteristics of cartoon images.",

          "description": "Video question answering (Video QA) presents a powerful testbed for\nhuman-like intelligent behaviors. The task demands new capabilities to\nintegrate video processing, language understanding, binding abstract linguistic\nconcepts to concrete visual artifacts, and deliberative reasoning over\nspacetime. Neural networks offer a promising approach to reach this potential\nthrough learning from examples rather than handcrafting features and rules.\nHowever, neural networks are predominantly feature-based - they map data to\nunstructured vectorial representation and thus can fall into the trap of\nexploiting shortcuts through surface statistics instead of true systematic\nreasoning seen in symbolic systems. To tackle this issue, we advocate for\nobject-centric representation as a basis for constructing spatio-temporal\nstructures from videos, essentially bridging the semantic gap between low-level\npattern recognition and high-level symbolic algebra. To this end, we propose a\nnew query-guided representation framework to turn a video into an evolving\nrelational graph of objects, whose features and interactions are dynamically\nand conditionally inferred. The object lives are then summarized into resumes,\nlending naturally for deliberative relational reasoning that produces an answer\nto the query. The framework is evaluated on major Video QA datasets,\ndemonstrating clear benefits of the object-centric approach to video reasoning.",

          "description": "In person re-identification (Re-ID), supervised methods usually need a large\namount of expensive label information, while unsupervised ones are still unable\nto deliver satisfactory identification performance. In this paper, we introduce\na novel person Re-ID task called unsupervised cross-camera person Re-ID, which\nonly needs the within-camera (intra-camera) label information but not\ncross-camera (inter-camera) labels which are more expensive to obtain. In\nreal-world applications, the intra-camera label information can be easily\ncaptured by tracking algorithms or few manual annotations. In this situation,\nthe main challenge becomes the distribution discrepancy across different camera\nviews, caused by the various body pose, occlusion, image resolution,\nillumination conditions, and background noises in different cameras. To address\nthis situation, we propose a novel Adversarial Camera Alignment Network (ACAN)\nfor unsupervised cross-camera person Re-ID. It consists of the camera-alignment\ntask and the supervised within-camera learning task. To achieve the camera\nalignment, we develop a Multi-Camera Adversarial Learning (MCAL) to map images\nof different cameras into a shared subspace. Particularly, we investigate two\ndifferent schemes, including the existing GRL (i.e., gradient reversal layer)\nscheme and the proposed scheme called \"other camera equiprobability\" (OCE), to\nconduct the multi-camera adversarial task. Based on this shared subspace, we\nthen leverage the within-camera labels to train the network. Extensive\nexperiments on five large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of ACAN\nover multiple state-of-the-art unsupervised methods that take advantage of\nlabeled source domains and generated images by GAN-based models. In particular,\nwe verify that the proposed multi-camera adversarial task does contribute to\nthe significant improvement.",

The framework is an extension of the LOR-DWI density-based hierarchical\nscale-space model that varies and optimizes the integration, spatial,\ndirectional, and intensity scales. As affine transformations are insufficient\nfor inter-subject registration, we extend the model to non-rigid deformations.\nWe illustrate that the proposed model deforms orientation distribution\nfunctions (ODFs) correctly and is capable of handling the classic complex\nchallenges in DWI-registrations, such as the registration of fiber-crossings\nalong with kissing, fanning, and interleaving fibers. Our experimental results\nclearly illustrate a novel promising regularizing effect, that comes from the\nnonlinear orientation-based cost function.

The scenes are replicas of\nreal-world homes, with distribution and the layout of objects aligned to those\nof the real world. iGibson integrates several key features to facilitate the\nstudy of interactive tasks: i) generation of high-quality virtual sensor\nsignals (RGB, depth, segmentation, LiDAR, flow and so on), ii) domain\nrandomization to change the materials of the objects (both visual and physical)\nand/or their shapes, iii) integrated sampling-based motion planners to generate\ncollision-free trajectories for robot bases and arms, and iv) intuitive\nhuman-iGibson interface that enables efficient collection of human\ndemonstrations. Through experiments, we show that the full interactivity of the\nscenes enables agents to learn useful visual representations that accelerate\nthe training of downstream manipulation tasks. We also show that iGibson\nfeatures enable the generalization of navigation agents, and that the\nhuman-iGibson interface and integrated motion planners facilitate efficient\nimitation learning of human demonstrated (mobile) manipulation behaviors.\niGibson is open-source, equipped with comprehensive examples and documentation.\nFor more information, visit our project website:\nthis http URL",

In this paper, a novel method by acting\nthe gradient activation function (GAF) on the gradient is proposed to handle\nthese challenges. Intuitively, the GAF enlarges the tiny gradients and\nrestricts the large gradient. Theoretically, this paper gives conditions that\nthe GAF needs to meet, and on this basis, proves that the GAF alleviates the\nproblems mentioned above. In addition, this paper proves that the convergence\nrate of SGD with the GAF is faster than that without the GAF under some\nassumptions. Furthermore, experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet, and PASCAL visual\nobject classes confirm the GAF's effectiveness.

Still, a \"thorn in the side\" of the deep learning\nmovement is the argument that deep networks are prone to overfitting and are\nthus unable to generalize well when datasets are small (as is common in medical\nimaging tasks). One way to bolster confidence is to provide mathematical\nguarantees, or bounds, on network performance after training which explicitly\nquantify the possibility of overfitting. In this work, we explore recent\nadvances using the PAC-Bayesian framework to provide bounds on generalization\nerror for large (stochastic) networks. While previous efforts focus on\nclassification in larger natural image datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR-10), we\napply these techniques to both classification and segmentation in a smaller\nmedical imagining dataset: the ISIC 2018 challenge set. We observe the\nresultant bounds are competitive compared to a simpler baseline, while also\nbeing more explainable and alleviating the need for holdout sets.",

          "description": "Differentiable architecture search is prevalent in the field of NAS because\nof its simplicity and efficiency, where two paradigms, multi-path algorithms\nand single-path methods, are dominated. Multi-path framework (e.g. DARTS) is\nintuitive but suffers from memory usage and training collapse. Single-path\nmethods (e.g.GDAS and ProxylessNAS) mitigate the memory issue and shrink the\ngap between searching and evaluation but sacrifice the performance. In this\npaper, we propose a conceptually simple yet efficient method to bridge these\ntwo paradigms, referred as Mutually-aware Sub-Graphs Differentiable\nArchitecture Search (MSG-DAS). The core of our framework is a differentiable\nGumbel-TopK sampler that produces multiple mutually exclusive single-path\nsub-graphs. To alleviate the severer skip-connect issue brought by multiple\nsub-graphs setting, we propose a Dropblock-Identity module to stabilize the\noptimization. To make best use of the available models (super-net and\nsub-graphs), we introduce a memory-efficient super-net guidance distillation to\nimprove training.

          "description": "Multi-object tracking is a critical component in autonomous navigation, as it\nprovides valuable information for decision-making. Many researchers tackled the\n3D multi-object tracking task by filtering out the frame-by-frame 3D\ndetections; however, their focus was mainly on finding useful features or\nproper matching metrics. Our work focuses on a neglected part of the tracking\nsystem: score refinement and tracklet termination. We show that manipulating\nthe scores depending on time consistency while terminating the tracklets\ndepending on the tracklet score improves tracking results. We do this by\nincreasing the matched tracklets' score with score update functions and\ndecreasing the unmatched tracklets' score. Compared to count-based methods, our\nmethod consistently produces better AMOTA and MOTA scores when utilizing\nvarious detectors and filtering algorithms on different datasets. The\nimprovements in AMOTA score went up to 1.83 and 2.96 in MOTA. We also used our\nmethod as a late-fusion ensembling method, and it performed better than\nvoting-based ensemble methods by a solid margin. It achieved an AMOTA score of\n67.6 on nuScenes test evaluation, which is comparable to other state-of-the-art\ntrackers.

          "description": "Image inpainting aims to restore the missing regions and make the recovery\nresults identical to the originally complete image, which is different from the\ncommon generative task emphasizing the naturalness of generated images.\nNevertheless, existing works usually regard it as a pure generation problem and\nemploy cutting-edge generative techniques to address it. The generative\nnetworks fill the main missing parts with realistic contents but usually\ndistort the local structures. In this paper, we formulate image inpainting as a\nmix of two problems, i.e., predictive filtering and deep generation. Predictive\nfiltering is good at preserving local structures and removing artifacts but\nfalls short to complete the large missing regions. The deep generative network\ncan fill the numerous missing pixels based on the understanding of the whole\nscene but hardly restores the details identical to the original ones. To make\nuse of their respective advantages, we propose the joint predictive filtering\nand generative network (JPGNet) that contains three branches: predictive\nfiltering & uncertainty network (PFUNet), deep generative network, and\nuncertainty-aware fusion network (UAFNet). The PFUNet can adaptively predict\npixel-wise kernels for filtering-based inpainting according to the input image\nand output an uncertainty map. This map indicates the pixels should be\nprocessed by filtering or generative networks, which is further fed to the\nUAFNet for a smart combination between filtering and generative results. Note\nthat, our method as a novel framework for the image inpainting problem can\nbenefit any existing generation-based methods. We validate our method on three\npublic datasets, i.e., Dunhuang, Places2, and CelebA, and demonstrate that our\nmethod can enhance three state-of-the-art generative methods (i.e., StructFlow,\nEdgeConnect, and RFRNet) significantly with the slightly extra time cost.",

Towards the end, we propose a novel\nsampler learning strategy that learns sampling point displacement supervised by\ntask-related ground truth information and can be trained jointly with the\nunderlying tasks.

We\npresent a large scale urban scene dataset associated with a handy simulator\nbased on Unreal Engine 4 and AirSim, which consists of both man-made and\nreal-world reconstruction scenes in different scales, referred to as\nUrbanScene3D. Unlike previous works that purely based on 2D information or\nman-made 3D CAD models, UrbanScene3D contains both compact man-made models and\ndetailed real-world models reconstructed by aerial images. Each building has\nbeen manually extracted from the entire scene model and then has been assigned\nwith a unique label, forming an instance segmentation map. The provided 3D\nground-truth textured models with instance segmentation labels in UrbanScene3D\nallow users to obtain all kinds of data they would like to have: instance\nsegmentation map, depth map in arbitrary resolution, 3D point cloud/mesh in\nboth visible and invisible places, etc. In addition, with the help of AirSim,\nusers can also simulate the robots (cars/drones)to test a variety of autonomous\ntasks in the proposed city environment.

          "description": "Video object segmentation, aiming to segment the foreground objects given the\nannotation of the first frame, has been attracting increasing attentions. Many\nstate-of-the-art approaches have achieved great performance by relying on\nonline model updating or mask-propagation techniques. However, most online\nmodels require high computational cost due to model fine-tuning during\ninference. Most mask-propagation based models are faster but with relatively\nlow performance due to failure to adapt to object appearance variation. In this\npaper, we are aiming to design a new model to make a good balance between speed\nand performance. We propose a model, called NPMCA-net, which directly localizes\nforeground objects based on mask-propagation and non-local technique by\nmatching pixels in reference and target frames. Since we bring in information\nof both first and previous frames, our network is robust to large object\nappearance variation, and can better adapt to occlusions. Extensive experiments\nshow that our approach can achieve a new state-of-the-art performance with a\nfast speed at the same time (86.5% IoU on DAVIS-2016 and 72.2% IoU on\nDAVIS-2017, with speed of 0.11s per frame) under the same level comparison.\nSource code is available at https://github.com/siyueyu/NPMCA-net.",

          "description": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a large number of parameters\nrequires huge computational resources, which has limited the application of\nCNNs on resources constrained appliances. Decomposition-based methods,\ntherefore, have been utilized to compress CNNs in recent years. However, since\nthe compression factor and performance are negatively correlated, the\nstate-of-the-art works either suffer from severe performance degradation or\nhave limited low compression factors. To overcome these problems, unlike\nprevious works compressing layers separately, we propose to compress CNNs and\nalleviate performance degradation via joint matrix decomposition. The idea is\ninspired by the fact that there are lots of repeated modules in CNNs, and by\nprojecting weights with the same structures into the same subspace, networks\ncan be further compressed and even accelerated. In particular, three joint\nmatrix decomposition schemes are developed, and the corresponding optimization\napproaches based on Singular Values Decomposition are proposed. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted across three challenging compact CNNs and 3 benchmark\ndata sets to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms.\nAs a result, our methods can compress the size of ResNet-34 by 22x with\nslighter accuracy degradation compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Relatively abundant availability of medical imaging data has provided\nsignificant support in the development and testing of Neural Network based\nimage processing methods. Clinicians often face issues in selecting suitable\nimage processing algorithm for medical imaging data. A strategy for the\nselection of a proper model is presented here. The training data set comprises\noptical coherence tomography (OCT) and angiography (OCT-A) images of 50 mice\neyes with more than 100 days follow-up. The data contains images from treated\nand untreated mouse eyes. Four deep learning variants are tested for automatic\n(a) differentiation of tumor region with healthy retinal layer and (b)\nsegmentation of 3D ocular tumor volumes. Exhaustive sensitivity analysis of\ndeep learning models is performed with respect to the number of training and\ntesting images using 8 eight performance indices to study accuracy,\nreliability/reproducibility, and speed. U-net with UVgg16 is best for malign\ntumor data set with treatment (having considerable variation) and U-net with\nInception backbone for benign tumor data (with minor variation). Loss value and\nroot mean square error (R.M.S.E.) are found most and least sensitive\nperformance indices, respectively. The performance (via indices) is found to be\nexponentially improving regarding a number of training images. The segmented\nOCT-Angiography data shows that neovascularization drives the tumor volume.\nImage analysis shows that photodynamic imaging-assisted tumor treatment\nprotocol is transforming an aggressively growing tumor into a cyst. An\nempirical expression is obtained to help medical professionals to choose a\nparticular model given the number of images and types of characteristics. We\nrecommend that the presented exercise should be taken as standard practice\nbefore employing a particular deep learning model for biomedical image\nanalysis.",

For the\nproposed research work, we have inspected the effectiveness of four\nconventional yet effective SR algorithms and three deep learning-based SR\nalgorithms to seek the finest method that executes well in a surveillance\nenvironment with limited training data op-tions. These algorithms generate an\nenhanced resolution output image from a sin-gle low-resolution (LR) input\nimage. For performance analysis, a subset of 220 images from six surveillance\ndatasets has been used, consisting of individuals with varying distances from\nthe camera, changing illumination conditions, and complex backgrounds. The\nperformance of these algorithms has been evaluated and compared using both\nqualitative and quantitative metrics. These SR algo-rithms have also been\ncompared based on face detection accuracy. By analyzing and comparing the\nperformance of all the algorithms, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based\nSR technique using an external dictionary proved to be best by achieving robust\nface detection accuracy and scoring optimal quantitative metric results under\ndifferent surveillance conditions.

While it has tremendous potential to promote the image\ncolorization task, the performance is limited owing to the manifold hypothesis\nin machine learning. This study presents a novel scheme that exploiting the\nscore-based generative model in wavelet domain to address the issue. By taking\nadvantage of the multi-scale and multi-channel representation via wavelet\ntransform, the proposed model learns the priors from stacked wavelet\ncoefficient components, thus learns the image characteristics under coarse and\ndetail frequency spectrums jointly and effectively. Moreover, such a highly\nflexible generative model without adversarial optimization can execute\ncolorization tasks better under dual consistency terms in wavelet domain,\nnamely data-consistency and structure-consistency. Specifically, in the\ntraining phase, a set of multi-channel tensors consisting of wavelet\ncoefficients are used as the input to train the network by denoising score\nmatching. In the test phase, samples are iteratively generated via annealed\nLangevin dynamics with data and structure consistencies.

          "description": "Adaptation of a classifier to new domains is one of the challenging problems\nin machine learning. This has been addressed using many deep and non-deep\nlearning based methods. Among the methodologies used, that of adversarial\nlearning is widely applied to solve many deep learning problems along with\ndomain adaptation. These methods are based on a discriminator that ensures\nsource and target distributions are close. However, here we suggest that rather\nthan using a point estimate obtaining by a single discriminator, it would be\nuseful if a distribution based on ensembles of discriminators could be used to\nbridge this gap. This could be achieved using multiple classifiers or using\ntraditional ensemble methods. In contrast, we suggest that a Monte Carlo\ndropout based ensemble discriminator could suffice to obtain the distribution\nbased discriminator. Specifically, we propose a curriculum based dropout\ndiscriminator that gradually increases the variance of the sample based\ndistribution and the corresponding reverse gradients are used to align the\nsource and target feature representations. An ensemble of discriminators helps\nthe model to learn the data distribution efficiently. It also provides a better\ngradient estimates to train the feature extractor. The detailed results and\nthorough ablation analysis show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art\nresults.",

          "description": "State-of-the-art temporal action detectors to date are based on two-stream\ninput including RGB frames and optical flow. Although combining RGB frames and\noptical flow boosts performance significantly, optical flow is a hand-designed\nrepresentation which not only requires heavy computation, but also makes it\nmethodologically unsatisfactory that two-stream methods are often not learned\nend-to-end jointly with the flow. In this paper, we argue that optical flow is\ndispensable in high-accuracy temporal action detection and image level data\naugmentation (ILDA) is the key solution to avoid performance degradation when\noptical flow is removed. To evaluate the effectiveness of ILDA, we design a\nsimple yet efficient one-stage temporal action detector based on single RGB\nstream named DaoTAD. Our results show that when trained with ILDA, DaoTAD has\ncomparable accuracy with all existing state-of-the-art two-stream detectors\nwhile surpassing the inference speed of previous methods by a large margin and\nthe inference speed is astounding 6668 fps on GeForce GTX 1080 Ti.

          "description": "Inspired by BatchNorm, there has been an explosion of normalization layers\nfor deep neural networks (DNNs). However, these alternative normalization\nlayers have seen minimal use, partially due to a lack of guiding principles\nthat can help identify when these layers can serve as a replacement for\nBatchNorm. To address this problem, we take a theoretical approach,\ngeneralizing the known beneficial mechanisms of BatchNorm to several recently\nproposed normalization techniques. Our generalized theory leads to the\nfollowing set of principles: (i) similar to BatchNorm, activations-based\nnormalization layers can prevent exponential growth of activations in ResNets,\nbut parametric layers require explicit remedies; (ii) use of GroupNorm can\nensure informative forward propagation, with different samples being assigned\ndissimilar activations, but increasing group size results in increasingly\nindistinguishable activations for different samples, explaining slow\nconvergence speed in models with LayerNorm; (iii) small group sizes result in\nlarge gradient norm in earlier layers, hence explaining training instability\nissues in Instance Normalization and illustrating a speed-stability tradeoff in\nGroupNorm. Overall, our analysis reveals a unified set of mechanisms that\nunderpin the success of normalization methods in deep learning, providing us\nwith a compass to systematically explore the vast design space of DNN\nnormalization layers.",

          "description": "Natural language is perhaps the most flexible and intuitive way for humans to\ncommunicate tasks to a robot. Prior work in imitation learning typically\nrequires each task be specified with a task id or goal image -- something that\nis often impractical in open-world environments. On the other hand, previous\napproaches in instruction following allow agent behavior to be guided by\nlanguage, but typically assume structure in the observations, actuators, or\nlanguage that limit their applicability to complex settings like robotics. In\nthis work, we present a method for incorporating free-form natural language\nconditioning into imitation learning. Our approach learns perception from\npixels, natural language understanding, and multitask continuous control\nend-to-end as a single neural network. Unlike prior work in imitation learning,\nour method is able to incorporate unlabeled and unstructured demonstration data\n(i.e. no task or language labels). We show this dramatically improves language\nconditioned performance, while reducing the cost of language annotation to less\nthan 1% of total data. At test time, a single language conditioned visuomotor\npolicy trained with our method can perform a wide variety of robotic\nmanipulation skills in a 3D environment, specified only with natural language\ndescriptions of each task (e.g. \"open the drawer...now pick up the block...now\npress the green button...\"). To scale up the number of instructions an agent\ncan follow, we propose combining text conditioned policies with large\npretrained neural language models. We find this allows a policy to be robust to\nmany out-of-distribution synonym instructions, without requiring new\ndemonstrations.

Point cloud and mesh are the two most\nwidely used electronic representation formats of 3D models, the quality of\nwhich is quite sensitive to operations like simplification and compression.\nTherefore, many studies concerning point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) and\nmesh quality assessment (MQA) have been carried out to measure the visual\nquality degradations caused by lossy operations. However, a large part of\nprevious studies utilizes full-reference (FR) metrics, which means they may\nfail to predict the accurate quality level of 3D models when the reference 3D\nmodel is not available. Furthermore, limited numbers of 3D-QA metrics are\ncarried out to take color features into consideration, which significantly\nrestricts the effectiveness and scope of application. In many quality\nassessment studies, natural scene statistics (NSS) have shown a good ability to\nquantify the distortion of natural scenes to statistical parameters. Therefore,\nwe propose an NSS-based no-reference quality assessment metric for colored 3D\nmodels. In this paper, quality-aware features are extracted from the aspects of\ncolor and geometry directly from the 3D models. Then the statistic parameters\nare estimated using different distribution models to describe the\ncharacteristic of the 3D models. Our method is mainly validated on the colored\npoint cloud quality assessment database (SJTU-PCQA) and the colored mesh\nquality assessment database (CMDM).

In this paper, we present OXnet, the first\ndeep omni-supervised thoracic disease detection network to our best knowledge\nthat uses as much available supervision as possible for CXR diagnosis. We first\nintroduce supervised learning via a one-stage detection model. Then, we inject\na global classification head to the detection model and propose dual attention\nalignment to guide the global gradient to the local detection branch, which\nenables learning lesion detection from image-level annotations. We also impose\nintra-class compactness and inter-class separability with global prototype\nalignment to further enhance the global information learning. Moreover, we\nleverage a soft focal loss to distill the soft pseudo-labels of unlabeled data\ngenerated by a teacher model. Extensive experiments on a large-scale chest\nX-ray dataset show the proposed OXnet outperforms competitive methods with\nsignificant margins.

          "description": "Multi-modal pre-training models have been intensively explored to bridge\nvision and language in recent years. However, most of them explicitly model the\ncross-modal interaction between image-text pairs, by assuming that there exists\nstrong semantic correlation between the text and image modalities. Since this\nstrong assumption is often invalid in real-world scenarios, we choose to\nimplicitly model the cross-modal correlation for large-scale multi-modal\npre-training, which is the focus of the Chinese project `WenLan' led by our\nteam. Specifically, with the weak correlation assumption over image-text pairs,\nwe propose a two-tower pre-training model called BriVL within the cross-modal\ncontrastive learning framework. Unlike OpenAI CLIP that adopts a simple\ncontrastive learning method, we devise a more advanced algorithm by adapting\nthe latest method MoCo into the cross-modal scenario. By building a large\nqueue-based dictionary, our BriVL can incorporate more negative samples in\nlimited GPU resources. We further construct a large Chinese multi-source\nimage-text dataset called RUC-CAS-WenLan for pre-training our BriVL model.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the pre-trained BriVL model outperforms\nboth UNITER and OpenAI CLIP on various downstream tasks.",

Meta learning studies how learning systems can increase in\nefficiency through experience and could thus evolve as an important concept to\novercome data sparsity. However, the core capability of meta learning-based\napproaches is the identification of similar previous tasks given a new task - a\nchallenge largely unexplored in the biomedical imaging domain. In this paper,\nwe address the problem of quantifying task similarity with a concept that we\nrefer to as task fingerprinting. The concept involves converting a given task,\nrepresented by imaging data and corresponding labels, to a fixed-length vector\nrepresentation. In fingerprint space, different tasks can be directly compared\nirrespective of their data set sizes, types of labels or specific resolutions.\nAn initial feasibility study in the field of surgical data science (SDS) with\n26 classification tasks from various medical and non-medical domains suggests\nthat task fingerprinting could be leveraged for both (1) selecting appropriate\ndata sets for pretraining and (2) selecting appropriate architectures for a new\ntask.

          "description": "An explainable, efficient and lightweight method for texture generation,\ncalled TGHop (an acronym of Texture Generation PixelHop), is proposed in this\nwork. Although synthesis of visually pleasant texture can be achieved by deep\nneural networks, the associated models are large in size, difficult to explain\nin theory, and computationally expensive in training. In contrast, TGHop is\nsmall in its model size, mathematically transparent, efficient in training and\ninference, and able to generate high quality texture. Given an exemplary\ntexture, TGHop first crops many sample patches out of it to form a collection\nof sample patches called the source. Then, it analyzes pixel statistics of\nsamples from the source and obtains a sequence of fine-to-coarse subspaces for\nthese patches by using the PixelHop++ framework. To generate texture patches\nwith TGHop, we begin with the coarsest subspace, which is called the core, and\nattempt to generate samples in each subspace by following the distribution of\nreal samples. Finally, texture patches are stitched to form texture images of a\nlarge size.

          "description": "Probabilistic finite mixture models are widely used for unsupervised\nclustering. These models can often be improved by adapting them to the topology\nof the data. For instance, in order to classify spatially adjacent data points\nsimilarly, it is common to introduce a Laplacian constraint on the posterior\nprobability that each data point belongs to a class. Alternatively, the mixing\nprobabilities can be treated as free parameters, while assuming Gauss-Markov or\nmore complex priors to regularize those mixing probabilities. However, these\napproaches are constrained by the shape of the prior and often lead to\ncomplicated or intractable inference. Here, we propose a new parametrization of\nthe Dirichlet distribution to flexibly regularize the mixing probabilities of\nover-parametrized mixture distributions. Using the Expectation-Maximization\nalgorithm, we show that our approach allows us to define any linear update rule\nfor the mixing probabilities, including spatial smoothing regularization as a\nspecial case. We then show that this flexible design can be extended to share\nclass information between multiple mixture models. We apply our algorithm to\nartificial and natural image segmentation tasks, and we provide quantitative\nand qualitative comparison of the performance of Gaussian and Student-t\nmixtures on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. We also demonstrate how to\npropagate class information across the layers of deep convolutional neural\nnetworks in a probabilistically optimal way, suggesting a new interpretation\nfor feedback signals in biological visual systems. Our flexible approach can be\neasily generalized to adapt probabilistic mixture models to arbitrary data\ntopologies.",

          "description": "In large studies involving multi protocol Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),\nit can occur to miss one or more sub-modalities for a given patient owing to\npoor quality (e.g. imaging artifacts), failed acquisitions, or hallway\ninterrupted imaging examinations. In some cases, certain protocols are\nunavailable due to limited scan time or to retrospectively harmonise the\nimaging protocols of two independent studies. Missing image modalities pose a\nchallenge to segmentation frameworks as complementary information contributed\nby the missing scans is then lost. In this paper, we propose a novel model,\nMulti-modal Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoder (MGP-VAE), to impute\none or more missing sub-modalities for a patient scan. MGP-VAE can leverage the\nGaussian Process (GP) prior on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to utilize the\nsubjects/patients and sub-modalities correlations. Instead of designing one\nnetwork for each possible subset of present sub-modalities or using frameworks\nto mix feature maps, missing data can be generated from a single model based on\nall the available samples. We show the applicability of MGP-VAE on brain tumor\nsegmentation where either, two, or three of four sub-modalities may be missing.\nOur experiments against competitive segmentation baselines with missing\nsub-modality on BraTS'19 dataset indicate the effectiveness of the MGP-VAE\nmodel for segmentation tasks.",

          "description": "This paper tackles video prediction from a new dimension of predicting\nspacetime-varying motions that are incessantly changing across both space and\ntime. Prior methods mainly capture the temporal state transitions but overlook\nthe complex spatiotemporal variations of the motion itself, making them\ndifficult to adapt to ever-changing motions. We observe that physical world\nmotions can be decomposed into transient variation and motion trend, while the\nlatter can be regarded as the accumulation of previous motions. Thus,\nsimultaneously capturing the transient variation and the motion trend is the\nkey to make spacetime-varying motions more predictable. Based on these\nobservations, we propose the MotionRNN framework, which can capture the complex\nvariations within motions and adapt to spacetime-varying scenarios. MotionRNN\nhas two main contributions. The first is that we design the MotionGRU unit,\nwhich can model the transient variation and motion trend in a unified way. The\nsecond is that we apply the MotionGRU to RNN-based predictive models and\nindicate a new flexible video prediction architecture with a Motion Highway\nthat can significantly improve the ability to predict changeable motions and\navoid motion vanishing for stacked multiple-layer predictive models. With high\nflexibility, this framework can adapt to a series of models for deterministic\nspatiotemporal prediction.

          "description": "Deep learning has demonstrated radiograph screening performances that are\ncomparable or superior to radiologists. However, recent studies show that deep\nmodels for thoracic disease classification usually show degraded performance\nwhen applied to external data. Such phenomena can be categorized into shortcut\nlearning, where the deep models learn unintended decision rules that can fit\nthe identically distributed training and test set but fail to generalize to\nother distributions. A natural way to alleviate this defect is explicitly\nindicating the lesions and focusing the model on learning the intended\nfeatures. In this paper, we conduct extensive retrospective experiments to\ncompare a popular thoracic disease classification model, CheXNet, and a\nthoracic lesion detection model, CheXDet. We first showed that the two models\nachieved similar image-level classification performance on the internal test\nset with no significant differences under many scenarios. Meanwhile, we found\nincorporating external training data even led to performance degradation for\nCheXNet. Then, we compared the models' internal performance on the lesion\nlocalization task and showed that CheXDet achieved significantly better\nperformance than CheXNet even when given 80% less training data. By further\nvisualizing the models' decision-making regions, we revealed that CheXNet\nlearned patterns other than the target lesions, demonstrating its shortcut\nlearning defect. Moreover, CheXDet achieved significantly better external\nperformance than CheXNet on both the image-level classification task and the\nlesion localization task.

          "description": "Many current neural networks for medical imaging generalise poorly to data\nunseen during training. Such behaviour can be caused by networks overfitting\neasy-to-learn, or statistically dominant, features while disregarding other\npotentially informative features. For example, indistinguishable differences in\nthe sharpness of the images from two different scanners can degrade the\nperformance of the network significantly. All neural networks intended for\nclinical practice need to be robust to variation in data caused by differences\nin imaging equipment, sample preparation and patient populations.\n\nTo address these challenges, we evaluate the utility of spectral decoupling\nas an implicit bias mitigation method. Spectral decoupling encourages the\nneural network to learn more features by simply regularising the networks'\nunnormalised prediction scores with an L2 penalty, thus having no added\ncomputational costs.\n\nWe show that spectral decoupling allows training neural networks on datasets\nwith strong spurious correlations. Networks trained without spectral decoupling\ndo not learn the original task and appear to make false predictions based on\nthe spurious correlations. Spectral decoupling also increases networks'\nrobustness for data distribution shifts. To validate our findings, we train\nnetworks with and without spectral decoupling to detect prostate cancer tissue\nslides and COVID-19 in chest radiographs. Networks trained with spectral\ndecoupling achieve substantially higher performance on all evaluation datasets.\n\nOur results show that spectral decoupling helps with generalisation issues\nassociated with neural networks. We recommend using spectral decoupling as an\nimplicit bias mitigation method in any neural network intended for clinical\nuse.",

          "description": "With the rapid development of social websites, recent years have witnessed an\nexplosive growth of social images with user-provided tags which continuously\narrive in a streaming fashion. Due to the fast query speed and low storage\ncost, hashing-based methods for image search have attracted increasing\nattention. However, existing hashing methods for social image retrieval are\nbased on batch mode which violates the nature of social images, i.e., social\nimages are usually generated periodically or collected in a stream fashion.\nAlthough there exist many online image hashing methods, they either adopt\nunsupervised learning which ignore the relevant tags, or are designed in the\nsupervised manner which needs high-quality labels. In this paper, to overcome\nthe above limitations, we propose a new method named Weakly-supervised Online\nHashing (WOH). In order to learn high-quality hash codes, WOH exploits the weak\nsupervision by considering the semantics of tags and removing the noise.\nBesides, We develop a discrete online optimization algorithm for WOH, which is\nefficient and scalable. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of WOH compared with several\nstate-of-the-art hashing baselines.",

          "description": "Autonomous vehicles rely heavily upon their perception subsystems to see the\nenvironment in which they operate. Unfortunately, the effect of variable\nweather conditions presents a significant challenge to object detection\nalgorithms, and thus it is imperative to test the vehicle extensively in all\nconditions which it may experience. However, development of robust autonomous\nvehicle subsystems requires repeatable, controlled testing - while real weather\nis unpredictable and cannot be scheduled. Real-world testing in adverse\nconditions is an expensive and time-consuming task, often requiring access to\nspecialist facilities. Simulation is commonly relied upon as a substitute, with\nincreasingly visually realistic representations of the real-world being\ndeveloped. In the context of the complete autonomous vehicle control pipeline,\nsubsystems downstream of perception need to be tested with accurate recreations\nof the perception system output, rather than focusing on subjective visual\nrealism of the input - whether in simulation or the real world. This study\ndevelops the untapped potential of a lightweight weather augmentation method in\nan autonomous racing vehicle - focusing not on visual accuracy, but rather the\neffect upon perception subsystem performance in real time. With minimal\nadjustment, the prototype developed in this study can replicate the effects of\nwater droplets on the camera lens, and fading light conditions. This approach\nintroduces a latency of less than 8 ms using compute hardware well suited to\nbeing carried in the vehicle - rendering it ideal for real-time implementation\nthat can be run during experiments in simulation, and augmented reality testing\nin the real world.",

          "description": "To safely navigate unknown environments, robots must accurately perceive\ndynamic obstacles. Instead of directly measuring the scene depth with a LiDAR\nsensor, we explore the use of a much cheaper and higher resolution sensor:\nprogrammable light curtains. Light curtains are controllable depth sensors that\nsense only along a surface that a user selects. We use light curtains to\nestimate the safety envelope of a scene: a hypothetical surface that separates\nthe robot from all obstacles. We show that generating light curtains that sense\nrandom locations (from a particular distribution) can quickly discover the\nsafety envelope for scenes with unknown objects. Importantly, we produce\ntheoretical safety guarantees on the probability of detecting an obstacle using\nrandom curtains. We combine random curtains with a machine learning based model\nthat forecasts and tracks the motion of the safety envelope efficiently. Our\nmethod accurately estimates safety envelopes while providing probabilistic\nsafety guarantees that can be used to certify the efficacy of a robot\nperception system to detect and avoid dynamic obstacles. We evaluate our\napproach in a simulated urban driving environment and a real-world environment\nwith moving pedestrians using a light curtain device and show that we can\nestimate safety envelopes efficiently and effectively.

          "description": "Precise localization of polyp is crucial for early cancer screening in\ngastrointestinal endoscopy. Videos given by endoscopy bring both richer\ncontextual information as well as more challenges than still images. The\ncamera-moving situation, instead of the common camera-fixed-object-moving one,\nleads to significant background variation between frames. Severe internal\nartifacts (e.g. water flow in the human body, specular reflection by tissues)\ncan make the quality of adjacent frames vary considerately. These factors\nhinder a video-based model to effectively aggregate features from neighborhood\nframes and give better predictions. In this paper, we present Spatial-Temporal\nFeature Transformation (STFT), a multi-frame collaborative framework to address\nthese issues. Spatially, STFT mitigates inter-frame variations in the\ncamera-moving situation with feature alignment by proposal-guided deformable\nconvolutions. Temporally, STFT proposes a channel-aware attention module to\nsimultaneously estimate the quality and correlation of adjacent frames for\nadaptive feature aggregation. Empirical studies and superior results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method. For example, STFT\nimproves the still image baseline FCOS by 10.6% and 20.6% on the comprehensive\nF1-score of the polyp localization task in CVC-Clinic and ASUMayo datasets,\nrespectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art video-based method by 3.6%\nand 8.0%, respectively.

          "description": "Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems on pixel domain use low-level\nfeatures, such as colour, texture and shape, to retrieve images. In this\ncontext, two types of image representations i.e. local and global image\nfeatures have been studied in the literature. Extracting these features from\npixel images and comparing them with images from the database is very\ntime-consuming. Therefore, in recent years, there has been some effort to\naccomplish image analysis directly in the compressed domain with lesser\ncomputations. Furthermore, most of the images in our daily transactions are\nstored in the JPEG compressed format. Therefore, it would be ideal if we could\nretrieve features directly from the partially decoded or compressed data and\nuse them for retrieval. Here, we propose a unified model for image retrieval\nwhich takes DCT coefficients as input and efficiently extracts global and local\nfeatures directly in the JPEG compressed domain for accurate image retrieval.\nThe experimental findings indicate that our proposed model performed similarly\nto the current DELG model which takes RGB features as an input with reference\nto mean average precision while having a faster training and retrieval speed.",

While\nlearning-based locomotion has made great advances using RL, most methods still\nrely on domain randomization for training blind agents that generalize to\nchallenging terrains. Our key insight is that proprioceptive states only offer\ncontact measurements for immediate reaction, whereas an agent equipped with\nvisual sensory observations can learn to proactively maneuver environments with\nobstacles and uneven terrain by anticipating changes in the environment many\nsteps ahead.

When a whole slide image (WSI) is used as an input\nquery, it is desirable to be able to retrieve similar cases by focusing on\nimage patches in pathologically important regions such as tumor cells. To\naddress this problem, we employ attention-based multiple instance learning,\nwhich enables us to focus on tumor-specific regions when the similarity between\ncases is computed. Moreover, we employ contrastive distance metric learning to\nincorporate immunohistochemical (IHC) staining patterns as useful supervised\ninformation for defining appropriate similarity between heterogeneous malignant\nlymphoma cases. In the experiment with 249 malignant lymphoma patients, we\nconfirmed that the proposed method exhibited higher evaluation measures than\nthe baseline case-based SIR methods. Furthermore, the subjective evaluation by\npathologists revealed that our similarity measure using IHC staining patterns\nis appropriate for representing the similarity of H&E-stained tissue images for\nmalignant lymphoma.",

          "description": "Complex sensors like video cameras include tens of configurable parameters,\nwhich can be set by end-users to customize the sensors to specific application\nscenarios. Although parameter settings significantly affect the quality of the\nsensor output and the accuracy of insights derived from sensor data, most\nend-users use a fixed parameter setting because they lack the skill or\nunderstanding to appropriately configure these parameters. We propose CamTuner,\nwhich is a system to automatically, and dynamically adapt the complex sensor to\nchanging environments. CamTuner includes two key components. First, a bespoke\nanalytics quality estimator, which is a deep-learning model to automatically\nand continuously estimate the quality of insights from an analytics unit as the\nenvironment around a sensor change. Second, a reinforcement learning (RL)\nmodule, which reacts to the changes in quality, and automatically adjusts the\ncamera parameters to enhance the accuracy of insights. We improve the training\ntime of the RL module by an order of magnitude by designing virtual models to\nmimic essential behavior of the camera: we design virtual knobs that can be set\nto different values to mimic the effects of assigning different values to the\ncamera's configurable parameters, and we design a virtual camera model that\nmimics the output from a video camera at different times of the day. These\nvirtual models significantly accelerate training because (a) frame rates from a\nreal camera are limited to 25-30 fps while the virtual models enable processing\nat 300 fps, (b) we do not have to wait until the real camera sees different\nenvironments, which could take weeks or months, and (c) virtual knobs can be\nupdated instantly, while it can take 200-500 ms to change the camera parameter\nsettings. Our dynamic tuning approach results in up to 12% improvement in the\naccuracy of insights from several video analytics tasks.",

          "description": "This paper presents a new insight into improving the performance of\nStochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) by using Isolation kernel instead of\nGaussian kernel. Isolation kernel outperforms Gaussian kernel in two aspects.\nFirst, the use of Isolation kernel in t-SNE overcomes the drawback of\nmisrepresenting some structures in the data, which often occurs when Gaussian\nkernel is applied in t-SNE. This is because Gaussian kernel determines each\nlocal bandwidth based on one local point only, while Isolation kernel is\nderived directly from the data based on space partitioning. Second, the use of\nIsolation kernel yields a more efficient similarity computation because\ndata-dependent Isolation kernel has only one parameter that needs to be tuned.\nIn contrast, the use of data-independent Gaussian kernel increases the\ncomputational cost by determining n bandwidths for a dataset of n points. As\nthe root cause of these deficiencies in t-SNE is Gaussian kernel, we show that\nsimply replacing Gaussian kernel with Isolation kernel in t-SNE significantly\nimproves the quality of the final visualisation output (without creating\nmisrepresented structures) and removes one key obstacle that prevents t-SNE\nfrom processing large datasets. Moreover, Isolation kernel enables t-SNE to\ndeal with large-scale datasets in less runtime without trading off accuracy,\nunlike existing methods in speeding up t-SNE.",

          "description": "PSNR and SSIM are the most widely used metrics in super-resolution problems,\nbecause they are easy to use and can evaluate the similarities between\ngenerated images and reference images. However, single image super-resolution\nis an ill-posed problem, there are multiple corresponding high-resolution\nimages for the same low-resolution image. The similarities can't totally\nreflect the restoration effect. The perceptual quality of generated images is\nalso important, but PSNR and SSIM do not reflect perceptual quality well. To\nsolve the problem, we proposed a method called regional differential\ninformation entropy to measure both of the similarities and perceptual quality.\nTo overcome the problem that traditional image information entropy can't\nreflect the structure information, we proposed to measure every region's\ninformation entropy with sliding window. Considering that the human visual\nsystem is more sensitive to the brightness difference at low brightness, we\ntake $\\gamma$ quantization rather than linear quantization. To accelerate the\nmethod, we reorganized the calculation procedure of information entropy with a\nneural network.

          "description": "Face recognition approaches often rely on equal image resolution for\nverification faces on two images. However, in practical applications, those\nimage resolutions are usually not in the same range due to different image\ncapture mechanisms or sources. In this work, we first analyze the impact of\nimage resolutions on the face verification performance with a state-of-the-art\nface recognition model. For images, synthetically reduced to $5\\, \\times 5\\,\n\\mathrm{px}$ resolution, the verification performance drops from $99.23\\%$\nincreasingly down to almost $55\\%$. Especially, for cross-resolution image\npairs (one high- and one low-resolution image), the verification accuracy\ndecreases even further. We investigate this behavior more in-depth by looking\nat the feature distances for every 2-image test pair. To tackle this problem,\nwe propose the following two methods: 1) Train a state-of-the-art\nface-recognition model straightforward with $50\\%$ low-resolution images\ndirectly within each batch. \\\\ 2) Train a siamese-network structure and adding\na cosine distance feature loss between high- and low-resolution features. Both\nmethods show an improvement for cross-resolution scenarios and can increase the\naccuracy at very low resolution to approximately $70\\%$. However, a\ndisadvantage is that a specific model needs to be trained for every\nresolution-pair ...",

          "description": "We propose an atlas-based method to segment the intracochlear anatomy (ICA)\nin the post-implantation CT (Post-CT) images of cochlear implant (CI)\nrecipients that preserves the point-to-point correspondence between the meshes\nin the atlas and the segmented volumes. To solve this problem, which is\nchallenging because of the strong artifacts produced by the implant, we use a\npair of co-trained deep networks that generate dense deformation fields (DDFs)\nin opposite directions. One network is tasked with registering an atlas image\nto the Post-CT images and the other network is tasked with registering the\nPost-CT images to the atlas image. The networks are trained using loss\nfunctions based on voxel-wise labels, image content, fiducial registration\nerror, and cycle-consistency constraint. The segmentation of the ICA in the\nPost-CT images is subsequently obtained by transferring the predefined\nsegmentation meshes of the ICA in the atlas image to the Post-CT images using\nthe corresponding DDFs generated by the trained registration networks. Our\nmodel can learn the underlying geometric features of the ICA even though they\nare obscured by the metal artifacts. We show that our end-to-end network\nproduces results that are comparable to the current state of the art (SOTA)\nthat relies on a two-steps approach that first uses conditional generative\nadversarial networks to synthesize artifact-free images from the Post-CT images\nand then uses an active shape model-based method to segment the ICA in the\nsynthetic images. Our method requires a fraction of the time needed by the\nSOTA, which is important for end-user acceptance.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have increased the accuracy of automatic segmentation,\nhowever, their accuracy depends on the availability of a large number of fully\nsegmented images. Methods to train deep neural networks using images for which\nsome, but not all, regions of interest are segmented are necessary to make\nbetter use of partially annotated datasets. In this paper, we propose the first\naxiomatic definition of label-set loss functions that are the loss functions\nthat can handle partially segmented images. We prove that there is one and only\none method to convert a classical loss function for fully segmented images into\na proper label-set loss function. Our theory also allows us to define the\nleaf-Dice loss, a label-set generalization of the Dice loss particularly suited\nfor partial supervision with only missing labels. Using the leaf-Dice loss, we\nset a new state of the art in partially supervised learning for fetal brain 3D\nMRI segmentation. We achieve a deep neural network able to segment white\nmatter, ventricles, cerebellum, extra-ventricular CSF, cortical gray matter,\ndeep gray matter, brainstem, and corpus callosum based on fetal brain 3D MRI of\nanatomically normal fetuses or with open spina bifida.

          "description": "Online continual learning aims to learn from a non-IID stream of data from a\nnumber of different tasks, where the learner is only allowed to consider data\nonce. Methods are typically allowed to use a limited buffer to store some of\nthe images in the stream. Recently, it was found that feature replay, where an\nintermediate layer representation of the image is stored (or generated) leads\nto superior results than image replay, while requiring less memory. Quantized\nexemplars can further reduce the memory usage. However, a drawback of these\nmethods is that they use a fixed (or very intransigent) backbone network. This\nsignificantly limits the learning of representations that can discriminate\nbetween all tasks. To address this problem, we propose an auxiliary classifier\nauto-encoder (ACAE) module for feature replay at intermediate layers with high\ncompression rates. The reduced memory footprint per image allows us to save\nmore exemplars for replay. In our experiments, we conduct task-agnostic\nevaluation under online continual learning setting and get state-of-the-art\nperformance on ImageNet-Subset, CIFAR100 and CIFAR10 dataset.",

          "description": "Video-based human pose estimation (HPE) is a vital yet challenging task.\nWhile deep learning methods have made significant progress for the HPE, most\napproaches to this task detect each joint independently, damaging the pose\nstructural information. In this paper, unlike the prior methods, we propose a\nRelation-based Pose Semantics Transfer Network (RPSTN) to locate joints\nassociatively. Specifically, we design a lightweight joint relation extractor\n(JRE) to model the pose structural features and associatively generate heatmaps\nfor joints by modeling the relation between any two joints heuristically\ninstead of building each joint heatmap independently. Actually, the proposed\nJRE module models the spatial configuration of human poses through the\nrelationship between any two joints. Moreover, considering the temporal\nsemantic continuity of videos, the pose semantic information in the current\nframe is beneficial for guiding the location of joints in the next frame.\nTherefore, we use the idea of knowledge reuse to propagate the pose semantic\ninformation between consecutive frames. In this way, the proposed RPSTN\ncaptures temporal dynamics of poses. On the one hand, the JRE module can infer\ninvisible joints according to the relationship between the invisible joints and\nother visible joints in space. On the other hand, in the time, the propose\nmodel can transfer the pose semantic features from the non-occluded frame to\nthe occluded frame to locate occluded joints. Therefore, our method is robust\nto the occlusion and achieves state-of-the-art results on the two challenging\ndatasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness for video-based human pose\nestimation. We will release the code and models publicly.",

A standard CNN-RNN cascade constitutes the backbone of our proposed\nmodel for sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning. Apart from learning through\nthe \\textit{RGB} input modality, we construct an aural stream which operates on\nsequences of extracted mel-spectrograms. Our extensive experiments on the\nchallenging and newly assembled Affect-in-the-wild-2 (Aff-Wild2) dataset verify\nthe superiority of our methods over existing approaches, while by properly\nincorporating all of the aforementioned modules in a network ensemble, we\nmanage to surpass the previous best published recognition scores, in the\nofficial validation set.

Although numerous\nmethods are proposed and make tremendous progress, we argue that it is time to\nstep back and analyze the status quo of the area. We review and rethink the\nrecent progress from three perspectives. First, given that there is no explicit\nand complete definition of pedestrian attribute recognition, we formally define\nand distinguish pedestrian attribute recognition from other similar tasks.\nSecond, based on the proposed definition, we expose the limitations of the\nexisting datasets, which violate the academic norm and are inconsistent with\nthe essential requirement of practical industry application. Thus, we propose\ntwo datasets, PETA\\textsubscript{$ZS$} and RAP\\textsubscript{$ZS$}, constructed\nfollowing the zero-shot settings on pedestrian identity. In addition, we also\nintroduce several realistic criteria for future pedestrian attribute dataset\nconstruction.

We train CAPNet to learn causal inference between past images and\ncorresponding affective valence and arousal through supervised learning by\npairing the sequence of past images with the current label using the Aff-Wild2\ndataset. We show through experiments that the well-trained CAPNet outperforms\nthe baseline of the second challenge of the Affective Behavior Analysis\nin-the-wild (ABAW2) Competition by predicting affective valence and arousal\nonly with past facial images one-third of a second earlier.

          "description": "Point clouds and RGB images are naturally complementary modalities for 3D\nvisual understanding - the former provides sparse but accurate locations of\npoints on objects, while the latter contains dense color and texture\ninformation. Despite this potential for close sensor fusion, many methods train\ntwo models in isolation and use simple feature concatenation to represent 3D\nsensor data. This separated training scheme results in potentially sub-optimal\nperformance and prevents 3D tasks from being used to benefit 2D tasks that are\noften useful on their own. To provide a more integrated approach, we propose a\nnovel Multi-Modality Task Cascade network (MTC-RCNN) that leverages 3D box\nproposals to improve 2D segmentation predictions, which are then used to\nfurther refine the 3D boxes. We show that including a 2D network between two\nstages of 3D modules significantly improves both 2D and 3D task performance.\nMoreover, to prevent the 3D module from over-relying on the overfitted 2D\npredictions, we propose a dual-head 2D segmentation training and inference\nscheme, allowing the 2nd 3D module to learn to interpret imperfect 2D\nsegmentation predictions. Evaluating our model on the challenging SUN RGB-D\ndataset, we improve upon state-of-the-art results of both single modality and\nfusion networks by a large margin ($\\textbf{+3.8}$ mAP@0.5).

While this problem can be mitigated by using the\ntarget domain data to align the source and target domain feature\nrepresentations, the target domain data may be unavailable due to privacy\nconcerns. Consequently, there is a need for methods that generalize well\nwithout access to target domain data during training. In this work, we propose\nan adversarial hallucination approach, which combines a class-wise\nhallucination module and a semantic segmentation module.

          "description": "In cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, a 3D high-resolution\nsegmentation of the heart is essential for detailed description of its\nanatomical structures. However, due to the limit of acquisition duration and\nrespiratory/cardiac motion, stacks of multi-slice 2D images are acquired in\nclinical routine. The segmentation of these images provides a low-resolution\nrepresentation of cardiac anatomy, which may contain artefacts caused by\nmotion. Here we propose a novel latent optimisation framework that jointly\nperforms motion correction and super resolution for cardiac image\nsegmentations. Given a low-resolution segmentation as input, the framework\naccounts for inter-slice motion in cardiac MR imaging and super-resolves the\ninput into a high-resolution segmentation consistent with input. A multi-view\nloss is incorporated to leverage information from both short-axis view and\nlong-axis view of cardiac imaging. To solve the inverse problem, iterative\noptimisation is performed in a latent space, which ensures the anatomical\nplausibility. This alleviates the need of paired low-resolution and\nhigh-resolution images for supervised learning. Experiments on two cardiac MR\ndatasets show that the proposed framework achieves high performance, comparable\nto state-of-the-art super-resolution approaches and with better cross-domain\ngeneralisability and anatomical plausibility.",

We confirm the\nfeasibility of the proposed system by applying our prototype to two\nunsignalized crosswalks in Osan city, South Korea. To conclude, we compare\nbehaviors of vehicles and pedestrians in those two areas by simple statistical\nanalysis. This study demonstrates the potential for a network of connected\nvideo sensors to provide actionable data for smart cities to improve pedestrian\nsafety in dangerous road environments.",

          "description": "Malicious activities in cyberspace have gone further than simply hacking\nmachines and spreading viruses. It has become a challenge for a nations\nsurvival and hence has evolved to cyber warfare. Malware is a key component of\ncyber-crime, and its analysis is the first line of defence against attack. This\nwork proposes a novel deep boosted hybrid learning-based malware classification\nframework and named as Deep boosted Feature Space-based Malware classification\n(DFS-MC). In the proposed framework, the discrimination power is enhanced by\nfusing the feature spaces of the best performing customized CNN architectures\nmodels and its discrimination by an SVM for classification. The discrimination\ncapacity of the proposed classification framework is assessed by comparing it\nagainst the standard customized CNNs. The customized CNN models are implemented\nin two ways: softmax classifier and deep hybrid learning-based malware\nclassification. In the hybrid learning, Deep features are extracted from\ncustomized CNN architectures and fed into the conventional machine learning\nclassifier to improve the classification performance. We also introduced the\nconcept of transfer learning in a customized CNN architecture based malware\nclassification framework through fine-tuning. The performance of the proposed\nmalware classification approaches are validated on the MalImg malware dataset\nusing the hold-out cross-validation technique. Experimental comparisons were\nconducted by employing innovative, customized CNN, trained from scratch and\nfine-tuning the customized CNN using transfer learning. The proposed\nclassification framework DFS-MC showed improved results, Accuracy: 98.61%,\nF-score: 0.96, Precision: 0.96, and Recall: 0.96.",

Most existing approaches have been proposed to\nrealize motion prediction. However, they ignore an important task, the\nevaluation of the quality of the predicted result. It is far more enough for\ncurrent approaches in actual scenarios because people can't know how to\ninteract with the machine without the evaluation of prediction, and unreliable\npredictions may mislead the machine to harm the human. Hence, we propose an\nuncertainty-aware framework for human motion prediction (UA-HMP). Concretely,\nwe first design an uncertainty-aware predictor through Gaussian modeling to\nachieve the value and the uncertainty of predicted motion. Then, an\nuncertainty-guided learning scheme is proposed to quantitate the uncertainty\nand reduce the negative effect of the noisy samples during optimization for\nbetter performance. Our proposed framework is easily combined with current SOTA\nbaselines to overcome their weakness in uncertainty modeling with slight\nparameters increment.

          "description": "Crowd counting is critical for numerous video surveillance scenarios. One of\nthe main issues in this task is how to handle the dramatic scale variations of\npedestrians caused by the perspective effect. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes a novel convolution neural network-based crowd counting method, termed\nPerspective-guided Fractional-Dilation Network (PFDNet). By modeling the\ncontinuous scale variations, the proposed PFDNet is able to select the proper\nfractional dilation kernels for adapting to different spatial locations. It\nsignificantly improves the flexibility of the state-of-the-arts that only\nconsider the discrete representative scales. In addition, by avoiding the\nmulti-scale or multi-column architecture that used in other methods, it is\ncomputationally more efficient. In practice, the proposed PFDNet is constructed\nby stacking multiple Perspective-guided Fractional-Dilation Convolutions (PFC)\non a VGG16-BN backbone. By introducing a novel generalized dilation convolution\noperation, the PFC can handle fractional dilation ratios in the spatial domain\nunder the guidance of perspective annotations, achieving continuous scales\nmodeling of pedestrians. To deal with the problem of unavailable perspective\ninformation in some cases, we further introduce an effective perspective\nestimation branch to the proposed PFDNet, which can be trained in either\nsupervised or weakly-supervised setting once the branch has been pre-trained.\nExtensive experiments show that the proposed PFDNet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on ShanghaiTech A, ShanghaiTech B, WorldExpo'10,\nUCF-QNRF, UCF_CC_50 and TRANCOS dataset, achieving MAE 53.8, 6.5, 6.8, 84.3,\n205.8, and 3.06 respectively.",

          "description": "Adversarial robustness of deep neural networks has been actively\ninvestigated. However, most existing defense approaches are limited to a\nspecific type of adversarial perturbations. Specifically, they often fail to\noffer resistance to multiple attack types simultaneously, i.e., they lack\nmulti-perturbation robustness. Furthermore, compared to image recognition\nproblems, the adversarial robustness of video recognition models is relatively\nunexplored. While several studies have proposed how to generate adversarial\nvideos, only a handful of approaches about the defense strategies have been\npublished in the literature. In this paper, we propose one of the first defense\nstrategies against multiple types of adversarial videos for video recognition.\nThe proposed method, referred to as MultiBN, performs adversarial training on\nmultiple adversarial video types using multiple independent batch normalization\n(BN) layers with a learning-based BN selection module. With a multiple BN\nstructure, each BN brach is responsible for learning the distribution of a\nsingle perturbation type and thus provides more precise distribution\nestimations. This mechanism benefits dealing with multiple perturbation types.\nThe BN selection module detects the attack type of an input video and sends it\nto the corresponding BN branch, making MultiBN fully automatic and allow\nend-to-end training. Compared to present adversarial training approaches, the\nproposed MultiBN exhibits stronger multi-perturbation robustness against\ndifferent and even unforeseen adversarial video types, ranging from Lp-bounded\nattacks and physically realizable attacks. This holds true on different\ndatasets and target models. Moreover, we conduct an extensive analysis to study\nthe properties of the multiple BN structure.",

Recently, two works have been proposed\nto detect saliency ranking by assigning different degrees of saliency to\ndifferent objects. However, one of these models cannot differentiate object\ninstances and the other focuses more on sequential attention shift order\ninference. In this paper, we investigate a practical problem setting that\nrequires simultaneously segment salient instances and infer their relative\nsaliency rank order. We present a novel unified model as the first end-to-end\nsolution, where an improved Mask R-CNN is first used to segment salient\ninstances and a saliency ranking branch is then added to infer the relative\nsaliency. For relative saliency ranking, we build a new graph reasoning module\nby combining four graphs to incorporate the instance interaction relation,\nlocal contrast, global contrast, and a high-level semantic prior, respectively.\nA novel loss function is also proposed to effectively train the saliency\nranking branch. Besides, a new dataset and an evaluation metric are proposed\nfor this task, aiming at pushing forward this field of research.

The methods\ndeveloped up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing\ndensity, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent\nmorphological features from the human's visual and intuitive perspective. We\ntake the first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based\ntechnique to automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual\nbasis. The method is implemented by generating an image of the street network\n(Colored Road Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and\nclassifying it using a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model\nachieves an overall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the\nworld are selected as the study areas with their road networks acquired from\nOpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through\nclustering on the percentage of each road network category.

          "description": "Pruning seeks to design lightweight architectures by removing redundant\nweights in overparameterized networks.

However, removing a whole\nstructure is a strong topological prior and recovering the accuracy, with\nfine-tuning, is highly cumbersome. In this paper, we introduce an \"end-to-end\"\nlightweight network design that achieves training and pruning simultaneously\nwithout fine-tuning. The design principle of our method relies on\nreparametrization that learns not only the weights but also the topological\nstructure of the lightweight sub-network. This reparametrization acts as a\nprior (or regularizer) that defines pruning masks implicitly from the weights\nof the underlying network, without increasing the number of training\nparameters. Sparsity is induced with a budget loss that provides an accurate\npruning.

The data received by\nground stations is often unprocessed, making this an expensive process\nconsidering the large data sizes and that not all of the data is useful. This,\ncoupled with the increasing demand for real-time data processing, has led to a\ngrowing need for on-orbit processing solutions. In this work, we investigate\nthe performance of CNN-based object detectors on constrained devices by\napplying different image compression techniques to satellite data. We examine\nthe capabilities of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier;\nlow-power, high-performance computers, with integrated GPUs, small enough to\nfit on-board a nanosatellite. We take a closer look at object detection\nnetworks, including the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Region-based\nFully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) models that are pre-trained on DOTA - a\nLarge Scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images. The performance is\nmeasured in terms of execution time, memory consumption, and accuracy, and are\ncompared against a baseline containing a server with two powerful GPUs. The\nresults show that by applying image compression techniques, we are able to\nimprove the execution time and memory consumption, achieving a fully runnable\ndataset. A lossless compression technique achieves roughly a 10% reduction in\nexecution time and about a 3% reduction in memory consumption, with no impact\non the accuracy. While a lossy compression technique improves the execution\ntime by up to 144% and the memory consumption is reduced by as much as 97%.\nHowever, it has a significant impact on accuracy, varying depending on the\ncompression ratio. Thus the application and ratio of these compression\ntechniques may differ depending on the required level of accuracy for a\nparticular task.",

          "description": "Risk assessment is relevant in any workplace, however there is a degree of\nunpredictability when dealing with flammable or hazardous materials so that\ndetection of fire accidents by itself may not be enough. An example of this is\nthe impingement of jet fires, where the heat fluxes of the flame could reach\nnearby equipment and dramatically increase the probability of a domino effect\nwith catastrophic results. Because of this, the characterization of such fire\naccidents is important from a risk management point of view. One such\ncharacterization would be the segmentation of different radiation zones within\nthe flame, so this paper presents an exploratory research regarding several\ntraditional computer vision and Deep Learning segmentation approaches to solve\nthis specific problem. A data set of propane jet fires is used to train and\nevaluate the different approaches and given the difference in the distribution\nof the zones and background of the images, different loss functions, that seek\nto alleviate data imbalance, are also explored. Additionally, different metrics\nare correlated to a manual ranking performed by experts to make an evaluation\nthat closely resembles the expert's criteria. The Hausdorff Distance and\nAdjsted Random Index were the metrics with the highest correlation and the best\nresults were obtained from the UNet architecture with a Weighted Cross-Entropy\nLoss. These results can be used in future research to extract more geometric\ninformation from the segmentation masks or could even be implemented on other\ntypes of fire accidents.",

          "description": "As the data scale grows, deep recognition models often suffer from\nlong-tailed data distributions due to the heavy imbalanced sample number across\ncategories. Indeed, real-world data usually exhibit some similarity relation\namong different categories (e.g., pigeons and sparrows), called category\nsimilarity in this work. It is doubly difficult when the imbalance occurs\nbetween such categories with similar appearances. However, existing solutions\nmainly focus on the sample number to re-balance data distribution. In this\nwork, we systematically investigate the essence of the long-tailed problem from\na unified perspective. Specifically, we demonstrate that long-tailed\nrecognition suffers from both sample number and category similarity.\nIntuitively, using a toy example, we first show that sample number is not the\nunique influence factor for performance dropping of long-tailed recognition.\nTheoretically, we demonstrate that (1) category similarity, as an inevitable\nfactor, would also influence the model learning under long-tailed distribution\nvia similar samples, (2) using more discriminative representation methods\n(e.g., self-supervised learning) for similarity reduction, the classifier bias\ncan be further alleviated with greatly improved performance. Extensive\nexperiments on several long-tailed datasets verify the rationality of our\ntheoretical analysis, and show that based on existing state-of-the-arts\n(SOTAs), the performance could be further improved by similarity reduction.

          "description": "Optical flow estimation is a fundamental problem of computer vision and has\nmany applications in the fields of robot learning and autonomous driving. This\npaper reveals novel geometric laws of optical flow based on the insight and\ndetailed definition of non-occlusion. Then, two novel loss functions are\nproposed for the unsupervised learning of optical flow based on the geometric\nlaws of non-occlusion. Specifically, after the occlusion part of the images are\nmasked, the flowing process of pixels is carefully considered and geometric\nconstraints are conducted based on the geometric laws of optical flow. First,\nneighboring pixels in the first frame will not intersect during the pixel\ndisplacement to the second frame. Secondly, when the cluster containing\nadjacent four pixels in the first frame moves to the second frame, no other\npixels will flow into the quadrilateral formed by them. According to the two\ngeometrical constraints, the optical flow non-intersection loss and the optical\nflow non-blocking loss in the non-occlusion regions are proposed. Two loss\nfunctions punish the irregular and inexact optical flows in the non-occlusion\nregions. The experiments on datasets demonstrated that the proposed\nunsupervised losses of optical flow based on the geometric laws in\nnon-occlusion regions make the estimated optical flow more refined in detail,\nand improve the performance of unsupervised learning of optical flow. In\naddition, the experiments training on synthetic data and evaluating on real\ndata show that the generalization ability of optical flow network is improved\nby our proposed unsupervised approach.",

At the same time,\nimage synthesis using generative adversarial networks (GANs) has drastically\nimproved over the last few years. The recently proposed TransGAN is the first\nGAN using only transformer-based architectures and achieves competitive results\nwhen compared to convolutional GANs. However, since transformers are\ndata-hungry architectures, TransGAN requires data augmentation, an auxiliary\nsuper-resolution task during training, and a masking prior to guide the\nself-attention mechanism. In this paper, we study the combination of a\ntransformer-based generator and convolutional discriminator and successfully\nremove the need of the aforementioned required design choices. We evaluate our\napproach by conducting a benchmark of well-known CNN discriminators, ablate the\nsize of the transformer-based generator, and show that combining both\narchitectural elements into a hybrid model leads to better results.\nFurthermore, we investigate the frequency spectrum properties of generated\nimages and observe that our model retains the benefits of an attention based\ngenerator.",

          "description": "Traditionally, CNN models possess hierarchical structures and utilize the\nfeature mapping of the last layer to obtain the prediction output. However, it\ncan be difficulty to settle the optimal network depth and make the middle\nlayers learn distinguished features. This paper proposes the Interflow\nalgorithm specially for traditional CNN models. Interflow divides CNNs into\nseveral stages according to the depth and makes predictions by the feature\nmappings in each stage. Subsequently, we input these prediction branches into a\nwell-designed attention module, which learns the weights of these prediction\nbranches, aggregates them and obtains the final output. Interflow weights and\nfuses the features learned in both shallower and deeper layers, making the\nfeature information at each stage processed reasonably and effectively,\nenabling the middle layers to learn more distinguished features, and enhancing\nthe model representation ability. In addition, Interflow can alleviate gradient\nvanishing problem, lower the difficulty of network depth selection, and lighten\npossible over-fitting problem by introducing attention mechanism. Besides, it\ncan avoid network degradation as a byproduct. Compared with the original model,\nthe CNN model with Interflow achieves higher test accuracy on multiple\nbenchmark datasets.",

          "description": "Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely employed to\npromote the face hallucination due to the ability to predict high-frequency\ndetails from a large number of samples. However, most of them fail to take into\naccount the overall facial profile and fine texture details simultaneously,\nresulting in reduced naturalness and fidelity of the reconstructed face, and\nfurther impairing the performance of downstream tasks (e.g., face detection,\nfacial recognition). To tackle this issue, we propose a novel external-internal\nsplit attention group (ESAG), which encompasses two paths responsible for\nfacial structure information and facial texture details, respectively. By\nfusing the features from these two paths, the consistency of facial structure\nand the fidelity of facial details are strengthened at the same time. Then, we\npropose a split-attention in split-attention network (SISN) to reconstruct\nphotorealistic high-resolution facial images by cascading several ESAGs.\nExperimental results on face hallucination and face recognition unveil that the\nproposed method not only significantly improves the clarity of hallucinated\nfaces, but also encourages the subsequent face recognition performance\nsubstantially.

Most of the state-of-the-arts focus on\nshort-range spatio-temporal modeling and then average multiple snippet-level\npredictions to yield the final video-level prediction. Thus, their video-level\nprediction does not consider spatio-temporal features of how video evolves\nalong the temporal dimension. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dynamic\nSegment Aggregation (DSA) module to capture relationship among snippets. To be\nmore specific, we attempt to generate a dynamic kernel for a convolutional\noperation to aggregate long-range temporal information among adjacent snippets\nadaptively. The DSA module is an efficient plug-and-play module and can be\ncombined with the off-the-shelf clip-based models (i.e., TSM, I3D) to perform\npowerful long-range modeling with minimal overhead.

However, when\ntraining neural networks the loss function changes over (iteration) time due to\nthe randomized selection of a subset of the samples.

This\ninterpretation of the loss allows us to adopt Kalman filtering as an optimizer,\nas its recursive formulation is designed to estimate unknown parameters from\nnoisy measurements. Moreover, we show that the Kalman Filter dynamical model\nfor the evolution of the unknown parameters can be used to capture the gradient\ndynamics of advanced methods such as Momentum and Adam. We call this stochastic\noptimization method KaFiStO. KaFiStO is an easy to implement, scalable, and\nefficient method to train neural networks.

In practical applications, the computational cost of convolutional\nneural networks is often high with the deepening of the network and the growth\nof data volume, mostly due to a large amount of multiplication operations of\nfloating-point numbers in convolution operations. To reduce the amount of\nmultiplications, we propose a new type of CNNs called Tropical Convolutional\nNeural Networks (TCNNs) which are built on tropical convolutions in which the\nmultiplications and additions in conventional convolutional layers are replaced\nby additions and min/max operations respectively. In addition, since tropical\nconvolution operators are essentially nonlinear operators, we expect TCNNs to\nhave higher nonlinear fitting ability than conventional CNNs. In the\nexperiments, we test and analyze several different architectures of TCNNs for\nimage classification tasks in comparison with similar-sized conventional CNNs.\nThe results show that TCNN can achieve higher expressive power than ordinary\nconvolutional layers on the MNIST and CIFAR10 image data set.

          "description": "Deep learning has been successful for many computer vision tasks due to the\navailability of shared and centralised large-scale training data. However,\nincreasing awareness of privacy concerns poses new challenges to deep learning,\nespecially for human subject related recognition such as person\nre-identification (Re-ID). In this work, we solve the Re-ID problem by\ndecentralised learning from non-shared private training data distributed at\nmultiple user sites of independent multi-domain label spaces. We propose a\nnovel paradigm called Federated Person Re-Identification (FedReID) to construct\na generalisable global model (a central server) by simultaneously learning with\nmultiple privacy-preserved local models (local clients). Specifically, each\nlocal client receives global model updates from the server and trains a local\nmodel using its local data independent from all the other clients. Then, the\ncentral server aggregates transferrable local model updates to construct a\ngeneralisable global feature embedding model without accessing local data so to\npreserve local privacy. This client-server collaborative learning process is\niteratively performed under privacy control, enabling FedReID to realise\ndecentralised learning without sharing distributed data nor collecting any\ncentralised data. Extensive experiments on ten Re-ID benchmarks show that\nFedReID achieves compelling generalisation performance beyond any locally\ntrained models without using shared training data, whilst inherently protects\nthe privacy of each local client. This is uniquely advantageous over\ncontemporary Re-ID methods.",

          "description": "In this paper, an enhancement technique for the class activation mapping\nmethods such as gradient-weighted class activation maps or excitation\nbackpropagation is proposed to present the visual explanations of decisions\nfrom convolutional neural network-based models. The proposed idea, called\nGradual Extrapolation, can supplement any method that generates a heatmap\npicture by sharpening the output. Instead of producing a coarse localization\nmap that highlights the important predictive regions in the image, the proposed\nmethod outputs the specific shape that most contributes to the model output.\nThus, the proposed method improves the accuracy of saliency maps. The effect\nhas been achieved by the gradual propagation of the crude map obtained in the\ndeep layer through all preceding layers with respect to their activations. In\nvalidation tests conducted on a selected set of images, the faithfulness,\ninterpretability, and applicability of the method are evaluated. The proposed\ntechnique significantly improves the localization detection of the neural\nnetworks attention at low additional computational costs. Furthermore, the\nproposed method is applicable to a variety deep neural network models. The code\nfor the method can be found at\nhttps://github.com/szandala/gradual-extrapolation",

Recent approaches mainly tackle the problem of\ndepth prediction in monocular images by treating the problem as a regression\ntask. Yet, being interested in an order relation in the first place, ranking\nmethods suggest themselves as a natural alternative to regression, and indeed,\nranking approaches leveraging pairwise comparisons as training information\n(\"object A is closer to the camera than B\") have shown promising performance on\nthis problem. In this paper, we elaborate on the use of so-called listwise\nranking as a generalization of the pairwise approach. Our method is based on\nthe Plackett-Luce (PL) model, a probability distribution on rankings, which we\ncombine with a state-of-the-art neural network architecture and a simple\nsampling strategy to reduce training complexity. Moreover, taking advantage of\nthe representation of PL as a random utility model, the proposed predictor\noffers a natural way to recover (shift-invariant) metric depth information from\nranking-only data provided at training time. An empirical evaluation on several\nbenchmark datasets in a \"zero-shot\" setting demonstrates the effectiveness of\nour approach compared to existing ranking and regression methods.",

          "description": "Compression is a standard procedure for making convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) adhere to some specific computing resource constraints. However,\nsearching for a compressed architecture typically involves a series of\ntime-consuming training/validation experiments to determine a good compromise\nbetween network size and performance accuracy. To address this, we propose an\nimage complexity-guided network compression technique for biomedical image\nsegmentation. Given any resource constraints, our framework utilizes data\ncomplexity and network architecture to quickly estimate a compressed model\nwhich does not require network training. Specifically, we map the dataset\ncomplexity to the target network accuracy degradation caused by compression.\nSuch mapping enables us to predict the final accuracy for different network\nsizes, based on the computed dataset complexity. Thus, one may choose a\nsolution that meets both the network size and segmentation accuracy\nrequirements. Finally, the mapping is used to determine the convolutional\nlayer-wise multiplicative factor for generating a compressed network. We\nconduct experiments using 5 datasets, employing 3 commonly-used CNN\narchitectures for biomedical image segmentation as representative networks. Our\nproposed framework is shown to be effective for generating compressed\nsegmentation networks, retaining up to $\\approx 95\\%$ of the full-sized network\nsegmentation accuracy, and at the same time, utilizing $\\approx 32x$ fewer\nnetwork trainable weights (average reduction) of the full-sized networks.",

In particular, we\ninvestigate attacks on the visual encoder's hidden layer that is fed to the\nsubsequent recurrent network.

          "description": "Deepfakes pose growing challenges to the trust of information on the\nInternet. Thus, detecting deepfakes has attracted increasing attentions from\nboth academia and industry. State-of-the-art deepfake detection methods consist\nof two key components, i.e., face extractor and face classifier, which extract\nthe face region in an image and classify it to be real/fake, respectively.\nExisting studies mainly focused on improving the detection performance in\nnon-adversarial settings, leaving security of deepfake detection in adversarial\nsettings largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap. In\nparticular, we perform a systematic measurement study to understand the\nsecurity of the state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods in adversarial\nsettings. We use two large-scale public deepfakes data sources including\nFaceForensics++ and Facebook Deepfake Detection Challenge, where the deepfakes\nare fake face images; and we train state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods.\nThese detection methods can achieve 0.94--0.99 accuracies in non-adversarial\nsettings on these datasets. However, our measurement results uncover multiple\nsecurity limitations of the deepfake detection methods in adversarial settings.\nFirst, we find that an attacker can evade a face extractor, i.e., the face\nextractor fails to extract the correct face regions, via adding small Gaussian\nnoise to its deepfake images. Second, we find that a face classifier trained\nusing deepfakes generated by one method cannot detect deepfakes generated by\nanother method, i.e., an attacker can evade detection via generating deepfakes\nusing a new method. Third, we find that an attacker can leverage backdoor\nattacks developed by the adversarial machine learning community to evade a face\nclassifier.

          "description": "Over the past decade, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have been widely\nadopted for medical image segmentation and shown to achieve adequate\nperformance. However, due to the inherent inductive biases present in the\nconvolutional architectures, they lack understanding of long-range dependencies\nin the image. Recently proposed Transformer-based architectures that leverage\nself-attention mechanism encode long-range dependencies and learn\nrepresentations that are highly expressive. This motivates us to explore\nTransformer-based solutions and study the feasibility of using\nTransformer-based network architectures for medical image segmentation tasks.\nMajority of existing Transformer-based network architectures proposed for\nvision applications require large-scale datasets to train properly. However,\ncompared to the datasets for vision applications, for medical imaging the\nnumber of data samples is relatively low, making it difficult to efficiently\ntrain transformers for medical applications. To this end, we propose a Gated\nAxial-Attention model which extends the existing architectures by introducing\nan additional control mechanism in the self-attention module. Furthermore, to\ntrain the model effectively on medical images, we propose a Local-Global\ntraining strategy (LoGo) which further improves the performance. Specifically,\nwe operate on the whole image and patches to learn global and local features,\nrespectively. The proposed Medical Transformer (MedT) is evaluated on three\ndifferent medical image segmentation datasets and it is shown that it achieves\nbetter performance than the convolutional and other related transformer-based\narchitectures.

          "description": "We introduce a method for egocentric videoconferencing that enables\nhands-free video calls, for instance by people wearing smart glasses or other\nmixed-reality devices. Videoconferencing portrays valuable non-verbal\ncommunication and face expression cues, but usually requires a front-facing\ncamera. Using a frontal camera in a hands-free setting when a person is on the\nmove is impractical. Even holding a mobile phone camera in the front of the\nface while sitting for a long duration is not convenient. To overcome these\nissues, we propose a low-cost wearable egocentric camera setup that can be\nintegrated into smart glasses. Our goal is to mimic a classical video call, and\ntherefore, we transform the egocentric perspective of this camera into a front\nfacing video. To this end, we employ a conditional generative adversarial\nneural network that learns a transition from the highly distorted egocentric\nviews to frontal views common in videoconferencing. Our approach learns to\ntransfer expression details directly from the egocentric view without using a\ncomplex intermediate parametric expressions model, as it is used by related\nface reenactment methods. We successfully handle subtle expressions, not easily\ncaptured by parametric blendshape-based solutions, e.g., tongue movement, eye\nmovements, eye blinking, strong expressions and depth varying movements. To get\ncontrol over the rigid head movements in the target view, we condition the\ngenerator on synthetic renderings of a moving neutral face. This allows us to\nsynthesis results at different head poses. Our technique produces temporally\nsmooth video-realistic renderings in real-time using a video-to-video\ntranslation network in conjunction with a temporal discriminator. We\ndemonstrate the improved capabilities of our technique by comparing against\nrelated state-of-the art approaches.",

Machine learning methods, specifically supervised learning is\ncommonly used in a variety of tasks formulated as semantic segmentation. One of\nthe major challenges in the supervised learning approaches is expressing and\ncollecting the rich knowledge that experts have with respect to the meaning\npresent in the image data. Towards this, typically a fixed set of labels is\nspecified and experts are tasked with annotating the pixels, patches or\nsegments in the images with the given labels. In general, however, the set of\nclasses does not fully capture the rich semantic information present in the\nimages.

          "description": "Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) is the task of leveraging semantic\ninformation (e.g., attributes) to recognize the seen and unseen samples, where\nunseen classes are not observable during training. It is natural to derive\ngenerative models and hallucinate training samples for unseen classes based on\nthe knowledge learned from the seen samples. However, most of these models\nsuffer from the `generation shifts', where the synthesized samples may drift\nfrom the real distribution of unseen data. In this paper, we conduct an\nin-depth analysis on this issue and propose a novel Generation Shifts\nMitigating Flow (GSMFlow) framework, which is comprised of multiple conditional\naffine coupling layers for learning unseen data synthesis efficiently and\neffectively. In particular, we identify three potential problems that trigger\nthe generation shifts, i.e., semantic inconsistency, variance decay, and\nstructural permutation and address them respectively. First, to reinforce the\ncorrelations between the generated samples and the respective attributes, we\nexplicitly embed the semantic information into the transformations in each of\nthe coupling layers. Second, to recover the intrinsic variance of the\nsynthesized unseen features, we introduce a visual perturbation strategy to\ndiversify the intra-class variance of generated data and hereby help adjust the\ndecision boundary of the classifier. Third, to avoid structural permutation in\nthe semantic space, we propose a relative positioning strategy to manipulate\nthe attribute embeddings, guiding which to fully preserve the inter-class\ngeometric structure. Experimental results demonstrate that GSMFlow achieves\nstate-of-the-art recognition performance in both conventional and generalized\nzero-shot settings.

However, segmenting these safety-critical\nobjects is rarely covered by conventional assistive technologies. To tackle\nthis issue, we construct a wearable system with a novel dual-head Transformer\nfor Transparency (Trans4Trans) model, which is capable of segmenting general\nand transparent objects and performing real-time wayfinding to assist people\nwalking alone more safely. Especially, both decoders created by our proposed\nTransformer Parsing Module (TPM) enable effective joint learning from different\ndatasets. Besides, the efficient Trans4Trans model composed of symmetric\ntransformer-based encoder and decoder, requires little computational expenses\nand is readily deployed on portable GPUs. Our Trans4Trans model outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on the test sets of Stanford2D3D and Trans10K-v2\ndatasets and obtains mIoU of 45.13% and 75.14%, respectively. Through various\npre-tests and a user study conducted in indoor and outdoor scenarios, the\nusability and reliability of our assistive system have been extensively\nverified.",

This is a more realistic and challenging\nsetting than conventional semi-supervised learning. We propose a two-branch\nlearning framework for this problem, with one branch focusing on local\npart-level information and the other branch focusing on overall\ncharacteristics. To transfer knowledge from the labelled data to the\nunlabelled, we propose using dual ranking statistics on both branches to\ngenerate pseudo labels for training on the unlabelled data. We further\nintroduce a mutual knowledge distillation method to allow information exchange\nand encourage agreement between the two branches for discovering new\ncategories, allowing our model to enjoy the benefits of global and local\nfeatures.

In this paper we examine an alternative pooling\nmethod, where pairwise correlations between channels for given frequencies are\nused as statistics. The method is inspired by style-transfer methods in\ncomputer vision, where the style of an image, modeled by the matrix of\nchannel-wise correlations, is transferred to another image, in order to produce\na new image having the style of the first and the content of the second. By\ndrawing analogies between image style and speaker characteristics, and between\nimage content and phonetic sequence, we explore the use of such channel-wise\ncorrelations features to train a ResNet architecture in an end-to-end fashion.\nOur experiments on VoxCeleb demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\npooling method in speaker recognition.",

          "description": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become the de-facto standard in\nimage synthesis. However, without considering the foreground-background\ndecomposition, existing GANs tend to capture excessive content correlation\nbetween foreground and background, thus constraining the diversity in image\ngeneration. This paper presents a novel Foreground-Background Composition GAN\n(FBC-GAN) that performs image generation by generating foreground objects and\nbackground scenes concurrently and independently, followed by composing them\nwith style and geometrical consistency. With this explicit design, FBC-GAN can\ngenerate images with foregrounds and backgrounds that are mutually independent\nin contents, thus lifting the undesirably learned content correlation\nconstraint and achieving superior diversity. It also provides excellent\nflexibility by allowing the same foreground object with different background\nscenes, the same background scene with varying foreground objects, or the same\nforeground object and background scene with different object positions, sizes\nand poses. It can compose foreground objects and background scenes sampled from\ndifferent datasets as well. Extensive experiments over multiple datasets show\nthat FBC-GAN achieves competitive visual realism and superior diversity as\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Recent work has shown that the performance of machine learning models can\nvary substantially when models are evaluated on data drawn from a distribution\nthat is close to but different from the training distribution. As a result,\npredicting model performance on unseen distributions is an important challenge.\nOur work connects techniques from domain adaptation and predictive uncertainty\nliterature, and allows us to predict model accuracy on challenging unseen\ndistributions without access to labeled data. In the context of distribution\nshift, distributional distances are often used to adapt models and improve\ntheir performance on new domains, however accuracy estimation, or other forms\nof predictive uncertainty, are often neglected in these investigations. Through\ninvestigating a wide range of established distributional distances, such as\nFrechet distance or Maximum Mean Discrepancy, we determine that they fail to\ninduce reliable estimates of performance under distribution shift. On the other\nhand, we find that the difference of confidences (DoC) of a classifier's\npredictions successfully estimates the classifier's performance change over a\nvariety of shifts. We specifically investigate the distinction between\nsynthetic and natural distribution shifts and observe that despite its\nsimplicity DoC consistently outperforms other quantifications of distributional\ndifference. $DoC$ reduces predictive error by almost half ($46\\%$) on several\nrealistic and challenging distribution shifts, e.g., on the ImageNet-Vid-Robust\nand ImageNet-Rendition datasets.",

In this work, we propose an effective weakly-supervised\nvideo semantic segmentation pipeline with click annotations, called WeClick,\nfor saving laborious annotating effort by segmenting an instance of the\nsemantic class with only a single click. Since detailed semantic information is\nnot captured by clicks, directly training with click labels leads to poor\nsegmentation predictions. To mitigate this problem, we design a novel memory\nflow knowledge distillation strategy to exploit temporal information (named\nmemory flow) in abundant unlabeled video frames, by distilling the neighboring\npredictions to the target frame via estimated motion. Moreover, we adopt\nvanilla knowledge distillation for model compression. In this case, WeClick\nlearns compact video semantic segmentation models with the low-cost click\nannotations during the training phase yet achieves real-time and accurate\nmodels during the inference period.

          "description": "Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) aims to solve tasks in target domain\nby utilizing transferable information learned from the available source domain\nand a few labeled target data. However, source data is not always accessible in\npractical scenarios, which restricts the application of SSDA in real world\ncircumstances. In this paper, we propose a novel task named Semi-supervised\nSource Hypothesis Transfer (SSHT), which performs domain adaptation based on\nsource trained model, to generalize well in target domain with a few\nsupervisions. In SSHT, we are facing two challenges: (1) The insufficient\nlabeled target data may result in target features near the decision boundary,\nwith the increased risk of mis-classification; (2) The data are usually\nimbalanced in source domain, so the model trained with these data is biased.\nThe biased model is prone to categorize samples of minority categories into\nmajority ones, resulting in low prediction diversity. To tackle the above\nissues, we propose Consistency and Diversity Learning (CDL), a simple but\neffective framework for SSHT by facilitating prediction consistency between two\nrandomly augmented unlabeled data and maintaining the prediction diversity when\nadapting model to target domain. Encouraging consistency regularization brings\ndifficulty to memorize the few labeled target data and thus enhances the\ngeneralization ability of the learned model. We further integrate Batch\nNuclear-norm Maximization into our method to enhance the discriminability and\ndiversity. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing SSDA\nmethods and unsupervised model adaptation methods on DomainNet, Office-Home and\nOffice-31 datasets.

Most previous algorithms in few-shot learning only utilize spatial\ninformation of the images. In this paper, we propose to integrate the frequency\ninformation into the learning model to boost the discrimination ability of the\nsystem. We employ Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) to generate the\nfrequency representation, then, integrate the features from both the spatial\ndomain and frequency domain for classification. The proposed strategy and its\neffectiveness are validated with different backbones, datasets, and algorithms.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the frequency information is\ncomplementary to the spatial representations in few-shot classification.

          "description": "The performance of human pose estimation depends on the spatial accuracy of\nkeypoint localization. Most existing methods pursue the spatial accuracy\nthrough learning the high-resolution (HR) representation from input images. By\nthe experimental analysis, we find that the HR representation leads to a sharp\nincrease of computational cost, while the accuracy improvement remains marginal\ncompared with the low-resolution (LR) representation. In this paper, we propose\na design paradigm for cost-effective network with LR representation for\nefficient pose estimation, named FasterPose. Whereas the LR design largely\nshrinks the model complexity, yet how to effectively train the network with\nrespect to the spatial accuracy is a concomitant challenge. We study the\ntraining behavior of FasterPose, and formulate a novel regressive cross-entropy\n(RCE) loss function for accelerating the convergence and promoting the\naccuracy. The RCE loss generalizes the ordinary cross-entropy loss from the\nbinary supervision to a continuous range, thus the training of pose estimation\nnetwork is able to benefit from the sigmoid function. By doing so, the output\nheatmap can be inferred from the LR features without loss of spatial accuracy,\nwhile the computational cost and model size has been significantly reduced.\nCompared with the previously dominant network of pose estimation, our method\nreduces 58% of the FLOPs and simultaneously gains 1.3% improvement of accuracy.\nExtensive experiments show that FasterPose yields promising results on the\ncommon benchmarks, i.e., COCO and MPII, consistently validating the\neffectiveness and efficiency for practical utilization, especially the\nlow-latency and low-energy-budget applications in the non-GPU scenarios.",

          "description": "Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a multi-modal challenging task\nwidely considered by research communities of the computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing. Since most current medical VQA models focus on visual\ncontent, ignoring the importance of text, this paper proposes a multi-view\nattention-based model(MuVAM) for medical visual question answering which\nintegrates the high-level semantics of medical images on the basis of text\ndescription. Firstly, different methods are utilized to extract the features of\nthe image and the question for the two modalities of vision and text. Secondly,\nthis paper proposes a multi-view attention mechanism that include\nImage-to-Question (I2Q) attention and Word-to-Text (W2T) attention. Multi-view\nattention can correlate the question with image and word in order to better\nanalyze the question and get an accurate answer. Thirdly, a composite loss is\npresented to predict the answer accurately after multi-modal feature fusion and\nimprove the similarity between visual and textual cross-modal features. It\nconsists of classification loss and image-question complementary (IQC) loss.\nFinally, for data errors and missing labels in the VQA-RAD dataset, we\ncollaborate with medical experts to correct and complete this dataset and then\nconstruct an enhanced dataset, VQA-RADPh. The experiments on these two datasets\nshow that the effectiveness of MuVAM surpasses the state-of-the-art method.",

However, the feature distribution\nis ignored. Poor feature distribution will wipe out the performance improvement\nbrought about by margin scheme. Recent studies focus on the unbalanced\ninter-class distribution and form a equidistributed feature representations by\npenalizing the angle between identity and its nearest neighbor. But the problem\nis more than that, we also found the anisotropy of intra-class distribution. In\nthis paper, we propose the `gradient-enhancing term' that concentrates on the\ndistribution characteristics within the class. This method, named IntraLoss,\nexplicitly performs gradient enhancement in the anisotropic region so that the\nintra-class distribution continues to shrink, resulting in isotropic and more\ncompact intra-class distribution and further margin between identities. The\nexperimental results on LFW, YTF and CFP-FP show that our outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by gradient enhancement, demonstrating the superiority\nof our method.

          "description": "Building vehicles capable of operating without human supervision requires the\ndetermination of the agent's pose. Visual Odometry (VO) algorithms estimate the\negomotion using only visual changes from the input images. The most recent VO\nmethods implement deep-learning techniques using convolutional neural networks\n(CNN) extensively, which add a substantial cost when dealing with\nhigh-resolution images. Furthermore, in VO tasks, more input data does not mean\na better prediction; on the contrary, the architecture may filter out useless\ninformation. Therefore, the implementation of computationally efficient and\nlightweight architectures is essential. In this work, we propose the RAM-VO, an\nextension of the Recurrent Attention Model (RAM) for visual odometry tasks.\nRAM-VO improves the visual and temporal representation of information and\nimplements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to learn robust\npolicies. The results indicate that RAM-VO can perform regressions with six\ndegrees of freedom from monocular input images using approximately 3 million\nparameters. In addition, experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that\nRAM-VO achieves competitive results using only 5.7% of the available visual\ninformation.",

In this work we present StixelPointNet, a novel method to perform\nfast instance segmentation directly on Stixels. By regarding the Stixel\nrepresentation as unstructured data similar to point clouds, architectures like\nPointNet are able to learn features from Stixels. We use a bounding box\ndetector to propose candidate instances, for which the relevant Stixels are\nextracted from the input image. On these Stixels, a PointNet models learns\nbinary segmentations, which we then unify throughout the whole image in a final\nselection step. StixelPointNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nStixel-level, is considerably faster than pixel-based segmentation methods, and\nshows that with our approach the Stixel domain can be introduced to many new 3D\nDeep Learning tasks.",

Therefore, automated\ndiagnosis of CAD has indispensable significance in clinical medicine. However,\nthe complexity of coronary artery plaques that cause CAD makes the automatic\ndetection of coronary artery stenosis in Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) a\ndifficult task. In this paper, we propose a Transformer network (TR-Net) for\nthe automatic detection of significant stenosis (i.e. luminal narrowing > 50%)\nwhile practically completing the computer-assisted diagnosis of CAD. The\nproposed TR-Net introduces a novel Transformer, and tightly combines\nconvolutional layers and Transformer encoders, allowing their advantages to be\ndemonstrated in the task. By analyzing semantic information sequences, TR-Net\ncan fully understand the relationship between image information in each\nposition of a multiplanar reformatted (MPR) image, and accurately detect\nsignificant stenosis based on both local and global information. We evaluate\nour TR-Net on a dataset of 76 patients from different patients annotated by\nexperienced radiologists. Experimental results illustrate that our TR-Net has\nachieved better results in ACC (0.92), Spec (0.96), PPV (0.84), F1 (0.79) and\nMCC (0.74) indicators compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

          "description": "Different types of spectroscopies, such as X-ray absorption near edge\nstructure (XANES) and Raman spectroscopy, play a very important role in\nanalyzing the characteristics of different materials. In scientific literature,\nXANES/Raman data are usually plotted in line graphs which is a visually\nappropriate way to represent the information when the end-user is a human\nreader. However, such graphs are not conducive to direct programmatic analysis\ndue to the lack of automatic tools. In this paper, we develop a plot digitizer,\nnamed Plot2Spectra, to extract data points from spectroscopy graph images in an\nautomatic fashion, which makes it possible for large scale data acquisition and\nanalysis. Specifically, the plot digitizer is a two-stage framework. In the\nfirst axis alignment stage, we adopt an anchor-free detector to detect the plot\nregion and then refine the detected bounding boxes with an edge-based\nconstraint to locate the position of two axes. We also apply scene text\ndetector to extract and interpret all tick information below the x-axis. In the\nsecond plot data extraction stage, we first employ semantic segmentation to\nseparate pixels belonging to plot lines from the background, and from there,\nincorporate optical flow constraints to the plot line pixels to assign them to\nthe appropriate line (data instance) they encode. Extensive experiments are\nconducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed plot digitizer, which\nshows that such a tool could help accelerate the discovery and machine learning\nof materials properties.",

This includes\ncorruption with transition matrices that mimic Gaussian kernels in continuous\nspace, matrices based on nearest neighbors in embedding space, and matrices\nthat introduce absorbing states. The third allows us to draw a connection\nbetween diffusion models and autoregressive and mask-based generative models.\nWe show that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision\nthat leads to improved results in image and text domains. We also introduce a\nnew loss function that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary\ncross entropy loss.

But\nsensors alone are often insufficient to provide this capability, and they are\nprone to errors due to various conditions in the environment. Furthermore,\nthere is a need for robots to maintain a model of its surroundings even when\nobjects go out of view and are no longer visible. This requires anchoring\nperceptual information onto symbols that represent the objects in the\nenvironment. In this paper, we present a model for action-aware perceptual\nanchoring that enables robots to track objects in a persistent manner. Our\nrule-based approach considers inductive biases to perform high-level reasoning\nover the results from low-level object detection, and it improves the robot's\nperceptual capability for complex tasks. We evaluate our model against existing\nbaseline models for object permanence and show that it outperforms these on a\nsnitch localisation task using a dataset of 1,371 videos.

          "description": "Hyperspectral (HS) images are characterized by approximately contiguous\nspectral information, enabling the fine identification of materials by\ncapturing subtle spectral discrepancies. Owing to their excellent locally\ncontextual modeling ability, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been\nproven to be a powerful feature extractor in HS image classification. However,\nCNNs fail to mine and represent the sequence attributes of spectral signatures\nwell due to the limitations of their inherent network backbone. To solve this\nissue, we rethink HS image classification from a sequential perspective with\ntransformers, and propose a novel backbone network called \\ul{SpectralFormer}.\nBeyond band-wise representations in classic transformers, SpectralFormer is\ncapable of learning spectrally local sequence information from neighboring\nbands of HS images, yielding group-wise spectral embeddings. More\nsignificantly, to reduce the possibility of losing valuable information in the\nlayer-wise propagation process, we devise a cross-layer skip connection to\nconvey memory-like components from shallow to deep layers by adaptively\nlearning to fuse \"soft\" residuals across layers. It is worth noting that the\nproposed SpectralFormer is a highly flexible backbone network, which can be\napplicable to both pixel- and patch-wise inputs. We evaluate the classification\nperformance of the proposed SpectralFormer on three HS datasets by conducting\nextensive experiments, showing the superiority over classic transformers and\nachieving a significant improvement in comparison with state-of-the-art\nbackbone networks.

These supervised methods require a large amount of\nannotated data to train deep neural networks to ensure the generalization\nability on the unseen test set. In this paper, we introduce a\nmeta-learning-based method for few-shot 3D shape segmentation where only a few\nlabeled samples are provided for the unseen classes. To achieve this, we treat\nthe shape segmentation as a point labeling problem in the metric space.\nSpecifically, we first design a meta-metric learner to transform input shapes\ninto embedding space and our model learns to learn a proper metric space for\neach object class based on point embeddings. Then, for each class, we design a\nmetric learner to extract part-specific prototype representations from a few\nsupport shapes and our model performs per-point segmentation over the query\nshapes by matching each point to its nearest prototype in the learned metric\nspace. A metric-based loss function is used to dynamically modify distances\nbetween point embeddings thus maximizes in-part similarity while minimizing\ninter-part similarity. A dual segmentation branch is adopted to make full use\nof the support information and implicitly encourages consistency between the\nsupport and query prototypes.

In order to\nimprove the visual representation ability for transformers, we propose a new\nsearch space and searching algorithm. Specifically, we introduce a locality\nmodule that models the local correlations in images explicitly with fewer\ncomputational cost.

          "description": "Based on PixelHop and PixelHop++, which are recently developed using the\nsuccessive subspace learning (SSL) framework, we propose an enhanced solution\nfor object classification, called E-PixelHop, in this work. E-PixelHop consists\nof the following steps. First, to decouple the color channels for a color\nimage, we apply principle component analysis and project RGB three color\nchannels onto two principle subspaces which are processed separately for\nclassification. Second, to address the importance of multi-scale features, we\nconduct pixel-level classification at each hop with various receptive fields.\nThird, to further improve pixel-level classification accuracy, we develop a\nsupervised label smoothing (SLS) scheme to ensure prediction consistency.\nForth, pixel-level decisions from each hop and from each color subspace are\nfused together for image-level decision. Fifth, to resolve confusing classes\nfor further performance boosting, we formulate E-PixelHop as a two-stage\npipeline. In the first stage, multi-class classification is performed to get a\nsoft decision for each class, where the top 2 classes with the highest\nprobabilities are called confusing classes. Then,we conduct a binary\nclassification in the second stage. The main contributions lie in Steps 1, 3\nand 5.We use the classification of the CIFAR-10 dataset as an example to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the above-mentioned key components of\nE-PixelHop.",

          "description": "In recent years, multi-view learning technologies for various applications\nhave attracted a surge of interest. Due to more compatible and complementary\ninformation from multiple views, existing multi-view methods could achieve more\npromising performance than conventional single-view methods in most situations.\nHowever, there are still no sufficient researches on the unified framework in\nexisting multi-view works. Meanwhile, how to efficiently integrate multi-view\ninformation is still full of challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmulti-view learning framework, which aims to leverage most existing graph\nembedding works into a unified formula via introducing the graph consensus\nterm. In particular, our method explores the graph structure in each view\nindependently to preserve the diversity property of graph embedding methods.\nMeanwhile, we choose heterogeneous graphs to construct the graph consensus term\nto explore the correlations among multiple views jointly. To this end, the\ndiversity and complementary information among different views could be\nsimultaneously considered. Furthermore, the proposed framework is utilized to\nimplement the multi-view extension of Locality Linear Embedding, named\nMulti-view Locality Linear Embedding (MvLLE), which could be efficiently solved\nby applying the alternating optimization strategy. Empirical validations\nconducted on six benchmark datasets can show the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod.",

          "description": "We present a coupled Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) method that improves the\naccuracy and robustness of the probabilistic inferences on represented data.\nThe new method models the dependency between input feature vectors (images) and\nweighs the outliers with a higher penalty by generalizing the original loss\nfunction to the coupled entropy function, using the principles of nonlinear\nstatistical coupling. We evaluate the performance of the coupled VAE model\nusing the MNIST dataset. Compared with the traditional VAE algorithm, the\noutput images generated by the coupled VAE method are clearer and less blurry.\nThe visualization of the input images embedded in 2D latent variable space\nprovides a deeper insight into the structure of new model with coupled loss\nfunction: the latent variable has a smaller deviation and a more compact latent\nspace generates the output values. We analyze the histogram of the likelihoods\nof the input images using the generalized mean, which measures the model's\naccuracy as a function of the relative risk. The neutral accuracy, which is the\ngeometric mean and is consistent with a measure of the Shannon cross-entropy,\nis improved. The robust accuracy, measured by the -2/3 generalized mean, is\nalso improved.",

          "description": "There are two major classes of natural language grammar -- the dependency\ngrammar that models one-to-one correspondences between words and the\nconstituency grammar that models the assembly of one or several corresponded\nwords. While previous unsupervised parsing methods mostly focus on only\ninducing one class of grammars, we introduce a novel model, StructFormer, that\ncan simultaneously induce dependency and constituency structure. To achieve\nthis, we propose a new parsing framework that can jointly generate a\nconstituency tree and dependency graph. Then we integrate the induced\ndependency relations into the transformer, in a differentiable manner, through\na novel dependency-constrained self-attention mechanism.

In order to attain greater diversity in GAN\nsynthesized data, it is critical to solving the problem of mode loss. Our work\nexplores probabilistic approaches to GAN modelling that could allow us to\ntackle these issues. We present Prb-GANs, a new variation that uses dropout to\ncreate a distribution over the network parameters with the posterior learnt\nusing variational inference. We describe theoretically and validate\nexperimentally using simple and complex datasets the benefits of such an\napproach. We look into further improvements using the concept of uncertainty\nmeasures. Through a set of further modifications to the loss functions for each\nnetwork of the GAN, we are able to get results that show the improvement of GAN\nperformance.

We analyze a variant of fitted-Q\niteration (FQI) algorithm under a new dynamic condition that we call Besov\ndynamic closure, which encompasses the conditions from prior analyses for deep\nneural network function approximation. Under Besov dynamic closure, we prove\nthat the FQI-type algorithm enjoys the sample complexity of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\kappa^{1 + d/\\alpha} \\cdot \\epsilon^{-2 -\n2d/\\alpha} \\right)$ where $\\kappa$ is a distribution shift measure, $d$ is the\ndimensionality of the state-action space, $\\alpha$ is the (possibly fractional)\nsmoothness parameter of the underlying MDP, and $\\epsilon$ is a user-specified\nprecision. This is an improvement over the sample complexity of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( K \\cdot \\kappa^{2 + d/\\alpha} \\cdot \\epsilon^{-2 -\nd/\\alpha} \\right)$ in the prior result [Yang et al., 2019] where $K$ is an\nalgorithmic iteration number which is arbitrarily large in practice.\nImportantly, our sample complexity is obtained under the new general dynamic\ncondition and a data-dependent structure where the latter is either ignored in\nprior algorithms or improperly handled by prior analyses.

This approach features a deep model\nthat transforms perceived intensities to IGRs, which are mapped to a 3D\nrepresentation encoding object orientation in the camera coordinate system.\nCore problems are what IGRs to use and how to learn them more effectively. We\nanswer the former question by designing IGRs based on an interpolated cuboid\nthat derives from primitive 3D annotation readily. The latter question\nmotivates us to incorporate geometry knowledge with a new loss function based\non a projective invariant. This loss function allows unlabeled data to be used\nin the training stage to improve representation learning.

          "description": "Plant leaf diseases pose a significant danger to food security and they cause\ndepletion in quality and volume of production. Therefore accurate and timely\ndetection of leaf disease is very important to check the loss of the crops and\nmeet the growing food demand of the people. Conventional techniques depend on\nlab investigation and human skills which are generally costly and inaccessible.\nRecently, Deep Neural Networks have been exceptionally fruitful in image\nclassification. In this research paper, plant leaf disease detection employing\ntransfer learning is explored in the JPEG compressed domain. Here, the JPEG\ncompressed stream consisting of DCT coefficients is, directly fed into the\nNeural Network to improve the efficiency of classification. The experimental\nresults on JPEG compressed leaf dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the\nproposed model.",

          "description": "Most of the existing deep learning-based sequential recommendation approaches\nutilize the recurrent neural network architecture or self-attention to model\nthe sequential patterns and temporal influence among a user's historical\nbehavior and learn the user's preference at a specific time. However, these\nmethods have two main drawbacks. First, they focus on modeling users' dynamic\nstates from a user-centric perspective and always neglect the dynamics of items\nover time. Second, most of them deal with only the first-order user-item\ninteractions and do not consider the high-order connectivity between users and\nitems, which has recently been proved helpful for the sequential\nrecommendation. To address the above problems, in this article, we attempt to\nmodel user-item interactions by a bipartite graph structure and propose a new\nrecommendation approach based on a Position-enhanced and Time-aware Graph\nConvolutional Network (PTGCN) for the sequential recommendation. PTGCN models\nthe sequential patterns and temporal dynamics between user-item interactions by\ndefining a position-enhanced and time-aware graph convolution operation and\nlearning the dynamic representations of users and items simultaneously on the\nbipartite graph with a self-attention aggregator. Also, it realizes the\nhigh-order connectivity between users and items by stacking multi-layer graph\nconvolutions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PTGCN, we carried out a\ncomprehensive evaluation of PTGCN on three real-world datasets of different\nsizes compared with a few competitive baselines. Experimental results indicate\nthat PTGCN outperforms several state-of-the-art models in terms of two\ncommonly-used evaluation metrics for ranking.",

The baseline policy can arise from demonstration data or a teacher\nagent and may provide useful cues for learning, but it might also be\nsub-optimal for the task at hand, and is not guaranteed to satisfy the\nspecified constraints, which might encode safety, fairness or other\napplication-specific requirements. In order to safely learn from baseline\npolicies, we propose an iterative policy optimization algorithm that alternates\nbetween maximizing expected return on the task, minimizing distance to the\nbaseline policy, and projecting the policy onto the constraint-satisfying set.\nWe analyze our algorithm theoretically and provide a finite-time convergence\nguarantee.

The decoding part retains the bottom upsampling structure for better\ndetail segmentation performance.

          "description": "Modeling and managing portfolio risk is perhaps the most important step to\nachieve growing and preserving investment performance. Within the modern\nportfolio construction framework that built on Markowitz's theory, the\ncovariance matrix of stock returns is required to model the portfolio risk.\nTraditional approaches to estimate the covariance matrix are based on human\ndesigned risk factors, which often requires tremendous time and effort to\ndesign better risk factors to improve the covariance estimation. In this work,\nwe formulate the quest of mining risk factors as a learning problem and propose\na deep learning solution to effectively \"design\" risk factors with neural\nnetworks. The learning objective is carefully set to ensure the learned risk\nfactors are effective in explaining stock returns as well as have desired\northogonality and stability. Our experiments on the stock market data\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method: our method can obtain\n$1.9\\%$ higher explained variance measured by $R^2$ and also reduce the risk of\na global minimum variance portfolio. Incremental analysis further supports our\ndesign of both the architecture and the learning objective.",

          "description": "Many modern machine learning applications come with complex and nuanced\ndesign goals such as minimizing the worst-case error, satisfying a given\nprecision or recall target, or enforcing group-fairness constraints. Popular\ntechniques for optimizing such non-decomposable objectives reduce the problem\ninto a sequence of cost-sensitive learning tasks, each of which is then solved\nby re-weighting the training loss with example-specific costs. We point out\nthat the standard approach of re-weighting the loss to incorporate label costs\ncan produce unsatisfactory results when used to train over-parameterized\nmodels. As a remedy, we propose new cost-sensitive losses that extend the\nclassical idea of logit adjustment to handle more general cost matrices. Our\nlosses are calibrated, and can be further improved with distilled labels from a\nteacher model. Through experiments on benchmark image datasets, we showcase the\neffectiveness of our approach in training ResNet models with common robust and\nconstrained optimization objectives.",

We\nfocus on different natural disasters based on properties such as types,\ndurations, and damages, which contains a total of 41,993 tweets.

To better provide decision-makers with the appropriate model,\nthe comparison of machine learning models based on computational time and\nprediction accuracy is conducted. The change of public opinion during different\nnatural disasters and the evolution of people's behavior of using social media\nfor disaster relief in the face of the identical type of natural disasters as\nTwitter continues to evolve are studied.

          "description": "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer precursors require frequent monitoring for risk\nstratification of patients. Automated segmentation methods can help to assess\nrisk areas more accurately, and assist in therapeutic procedures or even\nremoval. In clinical practice, addition to the conventional white-light imaging\n(WLI), complimentary modalities such as narrow-band imaging (NBI) and\nfluorescence imaging are used. While, today most segmentation approaches are\nsupervised and only concentrated on a single modality dataset, this work\nexploits to use a target-independent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)\ntechnique that is capable to generalize to an unseen target modality. In this\ncontext, we propose a novel UDA-based segmentation method that couples the\nvariational autoencoder and U-Net with a common EfficientNet-B4 backbone, and\nuses a joint loss for latent-space optimization for target samples.

          "description": "In machine learning, the notion of multi-armed bandits refers to a class of\nonline learning problems, in which an agent is supposed to simultaneously\nexplore and exploit a given set of choice alternatives in the course of a\nsequential decision process. In the standard setting, the agent learns from\nstochastic feedback in the form of real-valued rewards. In many applications,\nhowever, numerical reward signals are not readily available -- instead, only\nweaker information is provided, in particular relative preferences in the form\nof qualitative comparisons between pairs of alternatives. This observation has\nmotivated the study of variants of the multi-armed bandit problem, in which\nmore general representations are used both for the type of feedback to learn\nfrom and the target of prediction. The aim of this paper is to provide a survey\nof the state of the art in this field, referred to as preference-based\nmulti-armed bandits or dueling bandits. To this end, we provide an overview of\nproblems that have been considered in the literature as well as methods for\ntackling them.

In spontaneous speech tasks, various speech phenomena such as\nfillers, word fragments, laughter and coughs, etc. are often included. While\ncommon transcriptions do not give special awareness to these phenomena, rich\ntranscriptions explicitly convert them into special phenomenon tokens as well\nas textual tokens. In previous studies, the textual and phenomenon tokens were\nsimultaneously estimated in an end-to-end manner. However, it is difficult to\nbuild accurate RT-ASR systems because large-scale rich transcription-style\ndatasets are often unavailable. To solve this problem, our training method uses\na limited rich transcription-style dataset and common transcription-style\ndataset simultaneously. The Key process in our semi-supervised learning is to\nconvert the common transcription-style dataset into a pseudo-rich\ntranscription-style dataset. To this end, we introduce style tokens which\ncontrol phenomenon tokens are generated or not into transformer-based\nautoregressive modeling. We use this modeling for generating the pseudo-rich\ntranscription-style datasets and for building RT-ASR system from the pseudo and\noriginal datasets.

Although many saliency\nmap methods have been proposed, it is unknown how well they perform on\nexplaining decisions on multi-modal medical images, where each modality/channel\ncarries distinct clinical meanings of the same underlying biomedical\nphenomenon. Understanding such modality-dependent features is essential for\nclinical users' interpretation of AI decisions. To tackle this clinically\nimportant but technically ignored problem, we propose the MSFI\n(Modality-Specific Feature Importance) metric to examine whether saliency maps\ncan highlight modality-specific important features. MSFI encodes the clinical\nrequirements on modality prioritization and modality-specific feature\nlocalization. Our evaluations on 16 commonly used saliency map methods,\nincluding a clinician user study, show that although most saliency map methods\ncaptured modality importance information in general, most of them failed to\nhighlight modality-specific important features consistently and precisely.

This contrasts with\ntraditional traffic forecasting problems, which have focused on predicting\naggregated traffic variables, typically over intervals that are no shorter than\n5 minutes.

Second, we employ a block-coordinate descent algorithm and demonstrate\nthat the algorithm converges in sub-linear time to a block coordinate-wise\noptimizer. This allows us to capitalize on the \"bigness\" of high-resolution\ndata in a computationally feasible way. Third, we develop an ensemble learning\n(or adaptive boosting) approach to reduce the training error to within any\narbitrary error threshold. The latter utilizes past days so that the boosting\ncan be interpreted as capturing periodic patterns in the data. The performance\nof the proposed method is analyzed theoretically and tested empirically using\nboth simulated data and a real-world high-resolution traffic dataset from Abu\nDhabi, UAE.

We will\ndiscuss our PDE-based G-CNNs (PDE-G-CNNs) in a general homogeneous space\nsetting while also going into the specifics of our primary case of interest:\nroto-translation equivariance.\n\nWe solve the PDE of interest by a combination of linear group convolutions\nand non-linear morphological group convolutions with analytic kernel\napproximations that we underpin with formal theorems. Our kernel approximations\nallow for fast GPU-implementation of the PDE-solvers, we release our\nimplementation with this article. Just like for linear convolution a\nmorphological convolution is specified by a kernel that we train in our\nPDE-G-CNNs. In PDE-G-CNNs we do not use non-linearities such as max/min-pooling\nand ReLUs as they are already subsumed by morphological convolutions.\n\nWe present a set of experiments to demonstrate the strength of the proposed\nPDE-G-CNNs in increasing the performance of deep learning based imaging\napplications with far fewer parameters than traditional CNNs.",

          "description": "In this demonstration, we present an efficient BERT-based multi-task (MT)\nframework that is particularly suitable for iterative and incremental\ndevelopment of the tasks. The proposed framework is based on the idea of\npartial fine-tuning, i.e. only fine-tune some top layers of BERT while keep the\nother layers frozen. For each task, we train independently a single-task (ST)\nmodel using partial fine-tuning. Then we compress the task-specific layers in\neach ST model using knowledge distillation. Those compressed ST models are\nfinally merged into one MT model so that the frozen layers of the former are\nshared across the tasks. We exemplify our approach on eight GLUE tasks,\ndemonstrating that it is able to achieve both strong performance and\nefficiency. We have implemented our method in the utterance understanding\nsystem of XiaoAI, a commercial AI assistant developed by Xiaomi. We estimate\nthat our model reduces the overall serving cost by 86%.",

          "description": "We explore the ability of overparameterized shallow neural networks to learn\nLipschitz regression functions with and without label noise when trained by\nGradient Descent (GD). To avoid the problem that in the presence of noisy\nlabels, neural networks trained to nearly zero training error are inconsistent\non this class, we propose an early stopping rule that allows us to show optimal\nrates. This provides an alternative to the result of Hu et al. (2021) who\nstudied the performance of $\\ell 2$ -regularized GD for training shallow\nnetworks in nonparametric regression which fully relied on the infinite-width\nnetwork (Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)) approximation. Here we present a simpler\nanalysis which is based on a partitioning argument of the input space (as in\nthe case of 1-nearest-neighbor rule) coupled with the fact that trained neural\nnetworks are smooth with respect to their inputs when trained by GD. In the\nnoise-free case the proof does not rely on any kernelization and can be\nregarded as a finite-width result. In the case of label noise, by slightly\nmodifying the proof, the noise is controlled using a technique of Yao, Rosasco,\nand Caponnetto (2007).",

          "description": "Fully Bayesian approaches to sequential decision-making assume that problem\nparameters are generated from a known prior, while in practice, such\ninformation is often lacking, and needs to be estimated through learning. This\nproblem is exacerbated in decision-making setups with partial information,\nwhere using a misspecified prior may lead to poor exploration and inferior\nperformance. In this work we prove, in the context of stochastic linear bandits\nand Gaussian priors, that as long as the prior estimate is sufficiently close\nto the true prior, the performance of an algorithm that uses the misspecified\nprior is close to that of the algorithm that uses the true prior. Next, we\naddress the task of learning the prior through metalearning, where a learner\nupdates its estimate of the prior across multiple task instances in order to\nimprove performance on future tasks. The estimated prior is then updated within\neach task based on incoming observations, while actions are selected in order\nto maximize expected reward. In this work we apply this scheme within a linear\nbandit setting, and provide algorithms and regret bounds, demonstrating its\neffectiveness, as compared to an algorithm that knows the correct prior.

In this work, we propose to model counterfactual\ndistributions using a novel Hilbert space representation called counterfactual\nmean embedding (CME). The CME embeds the associated counterfactual distribution\ninto a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) endowed with a positive definite\nkernel, which allows us to perform causal inference over the entire landscape\nof the counterfactual distribution. Based on this representation, we propose a\ndistributional treatment effect (DTE) that can quantify the causal effect over\nentire outcome distributions. Our approach is nonparametric as the CME can be\nestimated under the unconfoundedness assumption from observational data without\nrequiring any parametric assumption about the underlying distributions. We also\nestablish a rate of convergence of the proposed estimator which depends on the\nsmoothness of the conditional mean and the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the\nunderlying marginal distributions. Furthermore, our framework allows for more\ncomplex outcomes such as images, sequences, and graphs.

Mammographic findings\nsuch as microcalcifications and masses, as well as morphologic features of\nmasses in sonographic scans, are the main diagnostic targets for tumor\ndetection.

          "description": "Recent studies have shown that lung cancer screening using annual low-dose\ncomputed tomography (CT) reduces lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to\ntraditional chest radiography. Therefore, CT lung screening has started to be\nused widely all across the world. However, analyzing these images is a serious\nburden for radiologists. The number of slices in a CT scan can be up to 600.\nTherefore, computer-aided-detection (CAD) systems are very important for faster\nand more accurate assessment of the data. In this study, we proposed a\nframework that analyzes CT lung screenings using convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) to reduce false positives. We trained our model with different volume\nsizes and showed that volume size plays a critical role in the performance of\nthe system. We also used different fusions in order to show their power and\neffect on the overall accuracy. 3D CNNs were preferred over 2D CNNs because 2D\nconvolutional operations applied to 3D data could result in information loss.\nThe proposed framework has been tested on the dataset provided by the LUNA16\nChallenge and resulted in a sensitivity of 0.831 at 1 false positive per scan.",

          "description": "We consider a continuous-time multi-arm bandit problem (CTMAB), where the\nlearner can sample arms any number of times in a given interval and obtain a\nrandom reward from each sample, however, increasing the frequency of sampling\nincurs an additive penalty/cost. Thus, there is a tradeoff between obtaining\nlarge reward and incurring sampling cost as a function of the sampling\nfrequency. The goal is to design a learning algorithm that minimizes regret,\nthat is defined as the difference of the payoff of the oracle policy and that\nof the learning algorithm. CTMAB is fundamentally different than the usual\nmulti-arm bandit problem (MAB), e.g., even the single-arm case is non-trivial\nin CTMAB, since the optimal sampling frequency depends on the mean of the arm,\nwhich needs to be estimated. We first establish lower bounds on the regret\nachievable with any algorithm and then propose algorithms that achieve the\nlower bound up to logarithmic factors. For the single-arm case, we show that\nthe lower bound on the regret is $\\Omega((\\log T)^2/\\mu)$, where $\\mu$ is the\nmean of the arm, and $T$ is the time horizon. For the multiple arms case, we\nshow that the lower bound on the regret is $\\Omega((\\log T)^2 \\mu/\\Delta^2)$,\nwhere $\\mu$ now represents the mean of the best arm, and $\\Delta$ is the\ndifference of the mean of the best and the second-best arm. We then propose an\nalgorithm that achieves the bound up to constant terms.",

This approach becomes challenging in generic\nsituations where the trained energy is nonconvex, due to the need to sample the\nGibbs distribution associated with this energy. Using general Fenchel duality\nresults, we derive variational principles dual to maximum likelihood EBMs with\nshallow overparametrized neural network energies, both in the active (aka\nfeature-learning) and lazy regimes. In the active regime, this dual formulation\nleads to a training algorithm in which one updates concurrently the particles\nin the sample space and the neurons in the parameter space of the energy. We\nalso consider a variant of this algorithm in which the particles are sometimes\nrestarted at random samples drawn from the data set, and show that performing\nthese restarts at every iteration step corresponds to score matching training.\nUsing intermediate parameter setups in our dual algorithm thereby gives a way\nto interpolate between maximum likelihood and score matching training.

We consider the supervised DA task with a limited number of\nannotated samples from the target domain.

Existing methods mostly fine-tune specific\nlayers of the pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, there is\nno consensus on which layers are better to fine-tune, e.g. the first layers for\nimages with low-level domain shift or the deeper layers for images with\nhigh-level domain shift. To this end, we propose SpotTUnet - a CNN architecture\nthat automatically chooses the layers which should be optimally fine-tuned.\nMore specifically, on the target domain, our method additionally learns the\npolicy that indicates whether a specific layer should be fine-tuned or reused\nfrom the pretrained network. We show that our method performs at the same level\nas the best of the nonflexible fine-tuning methods even under the extreme\nscarcity of annotated data.

However, it is a nontrivial task for accurate real estate\nappraisal because of three major challenges: (1) The complicated influencing\nfactors for property value; (2) The asynchronously spatiotemporal dependencies\namong real estate transactions; (3) The diversified correlations between\nresidential communities. To this end, we propose a Multi-Task Hierarchical\nGraph Representation Learning (MugRep) framework for accurate real estate\nappraisal. Specifically, by acquiring and integrating multi-source urban data,\nwe first construct a rich feature set to comprehensively profile the real\nestate from multiple perspectives (e.g., geographical distribution, human\nmobility distribution, and resident demographics distribution). Then, an\nevolving real estate transaction graph and a corresponding event graph\nconvolution module are proposed to incorporate asynchronously spatiotemporal\ndependencies among real estate transactions. Moreover, to further incorporate\nvaluable knowledge from the view of residential communities, we devise a\nhierarchical heterogeneous community graph convolution module to capture\ndiversified correlations between residential communities.

Improving predictive power\nwas the focus of previous representation techniques, which unfortunately\nperform rather poorly on the interpretability in terms of extracting underlying\ninsights of the data. Recently, Kolmogorov model (KM) was studied, which is an\ninterpretable and predictable representation approach to learning the\nunderlying probabilistic structure of a set of random variables. The existing\nKM learning algorithms using semi-definite relaxation with randomization\n(SDRwR) or discrete monotonic optimization (DMO) have, however, limited utility\nto big data applications because they do not scale well computationally. In\nthis paper, we propose a computationally scalable KM learning algorithm, based\non the regularized dual optimization combined with enhanced gradient descent\n(GD) method. To make our method more scalable to large-dimensional problems, we\npropose two acceleration schemes, namely, eigenvalue decomposition (EVD)\nelimination strategy and proximal EVD algorithm. Furthermore, a thresholding\ntechnique by exploiting the approximation error analysis and leveraging the\nnormalized Minkowski $\\ell_1$-norm and its bounds, is provided for the\nselection of the number of iterations of the proximal EVD algorithm. When\napplied to big data applications, it is demonstrated that the proposed method\ncan achieve compatible training/prediction performance with significantly\nreduced computational complexity; roughly two orders of magnitude improvement\nin terms of the time overhead, compared to the existing KM learning algorithms.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the accuracy of logical relation mining for\ninterpretability by using the proposed KM learning algorithm exceeds $80\\%$.",

We develop\nMOOCRep, a novel method based on Transformer language model trained with two\npre-training objectives : 1) graph-based objective to capture the powerful\nsignal of entities and relations that exist in the graph, and 2)\ndomain-oriented objective to effectively incorporate the complexity level of\nconcepts. Our experiments reveal that MOOCRep's embeddings outperform\nstate-of-the-art representation learning methods on two tasks important for\neducation community, concept pre-requisite prediction and lecture\nrecommendation.",

          "description": "Social-aware recommendation approaches have been recognized as an effective\nway to solve the data sparsity issue of traditional recommender systems. The\nassumption behind is that the knowledge in social user-user connections can be\nshared and transferred to the domain of user-item interactions, whereby to help\nlearn user preferences. However, most existing approaches merely adopt the\nfirst-order connections among users during transfer learning, ignoring those\nconnections in higher orders. We argue that better recommendation performance\ncan also benefit from high-order social relations. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Propagation-aware Transfer Learning Network (PTLN) based on the\npropagation of social relations. We aim to better mine the sharing knowledge\nhidden in social networks and thus further improve recommendation performance.\nSpecifically, we explore social influence in two aspects: (a) higher-order\nfriends have been taken into consideration by order bias; (b) different friends\nin the same order will have distinct importance for recommendation by an\nattention mechanism. Besides, we design a novel regularization to bridge the\ngap between social relations and user-item interactions. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on two real-world datasets and beat other counterparts in terms of\nranking accuracy, especially for the cold-start users with few historical\ninteractions.",

To reduce the labeling error effects, one common practice is\nto distribute each instance to multiple workers, whereas each worker only\nannotates a subset of data, resulting in the {\\it sparse annotation}\nphenomenon. In this paper, we note that when meeting with class-imbalance,\ni.e., when the ground truth labels are {\\it class-imbalanced}, the sparse\nannotations are prone to be skewly distributed, which thus can severely bias\nthe learning algorithm. To combat this issue, we propose one self-training\nbased approach named {\\it Self-Crowd} by progressively adding confident\npseudo-annotations and rebalancing the annotation distribution. Specifically,\nwe propose one distribution aware confidence measure to select confident\npseudo-annotations, which adopts the resampling strategy to oversample the\nminority annotations and undersample the majority annotations.

          "description": "The advancement of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on various vision\napplications has attracted lots of attention. Yet the majority of CNNs are\nunable to satisfy the strict requirement for real-world deployment. To overcome\nthis, the recent popular network pruning is an effective method to reduce the\nredundancy of the models. However, the ranking of filters according to their\n\"importance\" on different pruning criteria may be inconsistent. One filter\ncould be important according to a certain criterion, while it is unnecessary\naccording to another one, which indicates that each criterion is only a partial\nview of the comprehensive \"importance\". From this motivation, we propose a\nnovel framework to integrate the existing filter pruning criteria by exploring\nthe criteria diversity. The proposed framework contains two stages: Criteria\nClustering and Filters Importance Calibration. First, we condense the pruning\ncriteria via layerwise clustering based on the rank of \"importance\" score.\nSecond, within each cluster, we propose a calibration factor to adjust their\nsignificance for each selected blending candidates and search for the optimal\nblending criterion via Evolutionary Algorithm. Quantitative results on the\nCIFAR-100 and ImageNet benchmarks show that our framework outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines, regrading to the compact model performance after\npruning.",

          "description": "Multi-epoch, small-batch, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been the\nmethod of choice for learning with large over-parameterized models. A popular\ntheory for explaining why SGD works well in practice is that the algorithm has\nan implicit regularization that biases its output towards a good solution.\nPerhaps the theoretically most well understood learning setting for SGD is that\nof Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO), where it is well known that SGD learns\nat a rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of samples. In this\npaper, we consider the problem of SCO and explore the role of implicit\nregularization, batch size and multiple epochs for SGD. Our main contributions\nare threefold:\n\n(a) We show that for any regularizer, there is an SCO problem for which\nRegularized Empirical Risk Minimzation fails to learn. This automatically rules\nout any implicit regularization based explanation for the success of SGD.\n\n(b) We provide a separation between SGD and learning via Gradient Descent on\nempirical loss (GD) in terms of sample complexity. We show that there is an SCO\nproblem such that GD with any step size and number of iterations can only learn\nat a suboptimal rate: at least $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(1/n^{5/12})$.\n\n(c) We present a multi-epoch variant of SGD commonly used in practice. We\nprove that this algorithm is at least as good as single pass SGD in the worst\ncase. However, for certain SCO problems, taking multiple passes over the\ndataset can significantly outperform single pass SGD.\n\nWe extend our results to the general learning setting by showing a problem\nwhich is learnable for any data distribution, and for this problem, SGD is\nstrictly better than RERM for any regularization function. We conclude by\ndiscussing the implications of our results for deep learning, and show a\nseparation between SGD and ERM for two layer diagonal neural networks.",

          "description": "Recently, deep learning methods have become mainstream in code search since\nthey do better at capturing semantic correlations between code snippets and\nsearch queries and have promising performance. However, code snippets have\ndiverse information from different dimensions, such as business logic, specific\nalgorithm, and hardware communication, so it is hard for a single code\nrepresentation module to cover all the perspectives. On the other hand, as a\nspecific query may focus on one or several perspectives, it is difficult for a\nsingle query representation module to represent different user intents. In this\npaper, we propose MuCoS, a multi-model ensemble learning architecture for\nsemantic code search. It combines several individual learners, each of which\nemphasizes a specific perspective of code snippets. We train the individual\nlearners on different datasets which contain different perspectives of code\ninformation, and we use a data augmentation strategy to get these different\ndatasets.

          "description": "Causal discovery from observational data is an important tool in many\nbranches of science. Under certain assumptions it allows scientists to explain\nphenomena, predict, and make decisions. In the large sample limit, sound and\ncomplete causal discovery algorithms have been previously introduced, where a\ndirected acyclic graph (DAG), or its equivalence class, representing causal\nrelations is searched. However, in real-world cases, only finite training data\nis available, which limits the power of statistical tests used by these\nalgorithms, leading to errors in the inferred causal model. This is commonly\naddressed by devising a strategy for using as few as possible statistical\ntests. In this paper, we introduce such a strategy in the form of a recursive\nwrapper for existing constraint-based causal discovery algorithms, which\npreserves soundness and completeness. It recursively clusters the observed\nvariables using the normalized min-cut criterion from the outset, and uses a\nbaseline causal discovery algorithm during backtracking for learning local\nsub-graphs. It then combines them and ensures completeness. By an ablation\nstudy, using synthetic data, and by common real-world benchmarks, we\ndemonstrate that our approach requires significantly fewer statistical tests,\nlearns more accurate graphs, and requires shorter run-times than the baseline\nalgorithm.",

          "description": "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have shown impressive success in\nexploring high-dimensional environments to learn complex, long-horizon tasks,\nbut can often exhibit unsafe behaviors and require extensive environment\ninteraction when exploration is unconstrained. A promising strategy for safe\nlearning in dynamically uncertain environments is requiring that the agent can\nrobustly return to states where task success (and therefore safety) can be\nguaranteed. While this approach has been successful in low-dimensions,\nenforcing this constraint in environments with high-dimensional state spaces,\nsuch as images, is challenging. We present Latent Space Safe Sets (LS3), which\nextends this strategy to iterative, long-horizon tasks with image observations\nby using suboptimal demonstrations and a learned dynamics model to restrict\nexploration to the neighborhood of a learned Safe Set where task completion is\nlikely. We evaluate LS3 on 4 domains, including a challenging sequential\npushing task in simulation and a physical cable routing task. We find that LS3\ncan use prior task successes to restrict exploration and learn more efficiently\nthan prior algorithms while satisfying constraints.

As these efforts intensify, reasoning within the burgeoning field of\n\"algorithmic fairness\" increasingly shapes how fairness manifests in practice.\nThis paper interrogates whether algorithmic fairness provides the appropriate\nconceptual and practical tools for enhancing social equality. I argue that the\ndominant, \"formal\" approach to algorithmic fairness is ill-equipped as a\nframework for pursuing equality, as its narrow frame of analysis generates\nrestrictive approaches to reform. In light of these shortcomings, I propose an\nalternative: a \"substantive\" approach to algorithmic fairness that centers\nopposition to social hierarchies and provides a more expansive analysis of how\nto address inequality. This substantive approach enables more fruitful\ntheorizing about the role of algorithms in combatting oppression. The\ndistinction between formal and substantive algorithmic fairness is exemplified\nby each approach's responses to the \"impossibility of fairness\" (an\nincompatibility between mathematical definitions of algorithmic fairness).\nWhile the formal approach requires us to accept the \"impossibility of fairness\"\nas a harsh limit on efforts to enhance equality, the substantive approach\nallows us to escape the \"impossibility of fairness\" by suggesting reforms that\nare not subject to this false dilemma and that are better equipped to\nameliorate conditions of social oppression.",

Neural network architectures are commonly thought of as divided into\nlow-level feature extraction layers and high-level classification layers;\nsusceptibility of networks to adversarial samples is often thought of as a\nproblem related to classification rather than feature extraction. We test this\nidea by selectively retraining different portions of VGG and ResNet\narchitectures on CIFAR-10, Imagenette and ImageNet using non-adversarial and\nadversarial data. Our experimental results show that susceptibility to\nadversarial samples is associated with low-level feature extraction layers.\nTherefore, retraining high-level layers is insufficient for achieving\nrobustness. This phenomenon could have two explanations: either, adversarial\nattacks yield outputs from early layers that are indistinguishable from\nfeatures found in the attack classes, or adversarial attacks yield outputs from\nearly layers that differ statistically from features for non-adversarial\nsamples and do not permit consistent classification by subsequent layers. We\ntest this question by large-scale non-linear dimensionality reduction and\ndensity modeling on distributions of feature vectors in hidden layers and find\nthat the feature distributions between non-adversarial and adversarial samples\ndiffer substantially.

          "description": "Extracting accurate foregrounds from natural images benefits many downstream\napplications such as film production and augmented reality. However, the furry\ncharacteristics and various appearance of the foregrounds, e.g., animal and\nportrait, challenge existing matting methods, which usually require extra user\ninputs such as trimap or scribbles. To resolve these problems, we study the\ndistinct roles of semantics and details for image matting and decompose the\ntask into two parallel sub-tasks: high-level semantic segmentation and\nlow-level details matting. Specifically, we propose a novel Glance and Focus\nMatting network (GFM), which employs a shared encoder and two separate decoders\nto learn both tasks in a collaborative manner for end-to-end natural image\nmatting. Besides, due to the limitation of available natural images in the\nmatting task, previous methods typically adopt composite images for training\nand evaluation, which result in limited generalization ability on real-world\nimages. In this paper, we investigate the domain gap issue between composite\nimages and real-world images systematically by conducting comprehensive\nanalyses of various discrepancies between foreground and background images. We\nfind that a carefully designed composition route RSSN that aims to reduce the\ndiscrepancies can lead to a better model with remarkable generalization\nability. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark containing 2,000 high-resolution\nreal-world animal images and 10,000 portrait images along with their manually\nlabeled alpha mattes to serve as a test bed for evaluating matting model's\ngeneralization ability on real-world images.

However, direct\nnonparametric estimation for high-dimensional joint probability is in general\nimpossible, due to the curse of dimensionality. Recent work has proposed to\nrecover the joint probability mass function (PMF) of an arbitrary number of RVs\nfrom three-dimensional marginals, leveraging the algebraic properties of\nlow-rank tensor decomposition and the (unknown) dependence among the RVs.\nNonetheless, accurately estimating three-dimensional marginals can still be\ncostly in terms of sample complexity, affecting the performance of this line of\nwork in practice in the sample-starved regime. Using three-dimensional\nmarginals also involves challenging tensor decomposition problems whose\ntractability is unclear. This work puts forth a new framework for learning the\njoint PMF using only pairwise marginals, which naturally enjoys a lower sample\ncomplexity relative to the third-order ones. A coupled nonnegative matrix\nfactorization (CNMF) framework is developed, and its joint PMF recovery\nguarantees under various conditions are analyzed. Our method also features a\nGram--Schmidt (GS)-like algorithm that exhibits competitive runtime\nperformance. The algorithm is shown to provably recover the joint PMF up to\nbounded error in finite iterations, under reasonable conditions. It is also\nshown that a recently proposed economical expectation maximization (EM)\nalgorithm guarantees to improve upon the GS-like algorithm's output, thereby\nfurther lifting up the accuracy and efficiency.

Thanks to its equivariance\nproperties, the proposed model is extremely more data efficient with respect to\nclassical graph architectures and also intrinsically equipped with a better\ninductive bias. We show that, learning on a minimal amount of data, the\narchitecture we propose can perfectly generalise to unseen data in a synthetic\nproblem, while much more training data are required from a standard model to\nreach comparable performance.",

          "description": "Recent years have witnessed a growing list of systems for distributed\ndata-parallel training. Existing systems largely fit into two paradigms, i.e.,\nparameter server and MPI-style collective operations. On the algorithmic side,\nresearchers have proposed a wide range of techniques to lower the communication\nvia system relaxations: quantization, decentralization, and communication\ndelay. However, most, if not all, existing systems only rely on standard\nsynchronous and asynchronous stochastic gradient (SG) based optimization,\ntherefore, cannot take advantage of all possible optimizations that the machine\nlearning community has been developing recently. Given this emerging gap\nbetween the current landscapes of systems and theory, we build BAGUA, a\ncommunication framework whose design goal is to provide a system abstraction\nthat is both flexible and modular to support state-of-the-art system relaxation\ntechniques of distributed training. Powered by the new system design, BAGUA has\na great ability to implement and extend various state-of-the-art distributed\nlearning algorithms. In a production cluster with up to 16 machines (128 GPUs),\nBAGUA can outperform PyTorch-DDP, Horovod and BytePS in the end-to-end training\ntime by a significant margin (up to 1.95 times) across a diverse range of\ntasks. Moreover, we conduct a rigorous tradeoff exploration showing that\ndifferent algorithms and system relaxations achieve the best performance over\ndifferent network conditions.",

In this survey,\nwe systematically review the work on random features from the past ten years.\nFirst, the motivations, characteristics and contributions of representative\nrandom features based algorithms are summarized according to their sampling\nschemes, learning procedures, variance reduction properties and how they\nexploit training data. Second, we review theoretical results that center around\nthe following key question: how many random features are needed to ensure a\nhigh approximation quality or no loss in the empirical/expected risks of the\nlearned estimator. Third, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of popular\nrandom features based algorithms on several large-scale benchmark datasets and\ndiscuss their approximation quality and prediction performance for\nclassification. Last, we discuss the relationship between random features and\nmodern over-parameterized deep neural networks (DNNs), including the use of\nhigh dimensional random features in the analysis of DNNs as well as the gaps\nbetween current theoretical and empirical results. This survey may serve as a\ngentle introduction to this topic, and as a users' guide for practitioners\ninterested in applying the representative algorithms and understanding\ntheoretical results under various technical assumptions.

The proposed Iterative\nVisual Logical Classifier (IVLC) is an interpretable machine learning algorithm\nthat allows end users to design a model and classify data with more confidence\nand without having to compromise on the accuracy. Such technique is especially\nhelpful when dealing with sensitive and crucial data like cancer data in the\nmedical domain with high cost of errors. With the help of the proposed\ninteractive and lossless multidimensional visualization, end users can identify\nthe pattern in the data based on which they can make explainable decisions.\nSuch options would not be possible in black box machine learning methodologies.\nThe interpretable IVLC algorithm is supported by the Interactive Shifted Paired\nCoordinates Software System (SPCVis). It is a lossless multidimensional data\nvisualization system with user interactive features. The interactive approach\nprovides flexibility to the end user to perform data classification as\nself-service without having to rely on a machine learning expert. Interactive\npattern discovery becomes challenging while dealing with large data sets with\nhundreds of dimensions/features. To overcome this problem, this chapter\nproposes an automated classification approach combined with new Coordinate\nOrder Optimizer (COO) algorithm and a Genetic algorithm. The COO algorithm\nautomatically generates the coordinate pair sequences that best represent the\ndata separation and the genetic algorithm helps optimizing the proposed IVLC\nalgorithm by automatically generating the areas for data classification.

Runtime monitoring techniques on the\nneuron activation pattern can be used to detect such inputs. We present an\napproach for monitoring classification systems via data abstraction. Data\nabstraction relies on the notion of box with a resolution. Box-based\nabstraction consists in representing a set of values by its minimal and maximal\nvalues in each dimension. We augment boxes with a notion of resolution and\ndefine their clustering coverage, which is intuitively a quantitative metric\nthat indicates the abstraction quality. This allows studying the effect of\ndifferent clustering parameters on the constructed boxes and estimating an\ninterval of sub-optimal parameters. Moreover, we automatically construct\nmonitors that leverage both the correct and incorrect behaviors of a system.\nThis allows checking the size of the monitor abstractions and analyzing the\nseparability of the network. Monitors are obtained by combining the\nsub-monitors of each class of the system placed at some selected layers. Our\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our clustering coverage estimation\nand show how to assess the effectiveness and precision of monitors according to\nthe selected clustering parameter and monitored layers.",

          "description": "The monitoring of coastal wetlands is of great importance to the protection\nof marine and terrestrial ecosystems. However, due to the complex environment,\nsevere vegetation mixture, and difficulty of access, it is impossible to\naccurately classify coastal wetlands and identify their species with\ntraditional classifiers. Despite the integration of multisource remote sensing\ndata for performance enhancement, there are still challenges with acquiring and\nexploiting the complementary merits from multisource data. In this paper, the\nDeepwise Feature Interaction Network (DFINet) is proposed for wetland\nclassification. A depthwise cross attention module is designed to extract\nself-correlation and cross-correlation from multisource feature pairs. In this\nway, meaningful complementary information is emphasized for classification.\nDFINet is optimized by coordinating consistency loss, discrimination loss, and\nclassification loss. Accordingly, DFINet reaches the standard solution-space\nunder the regularity of loss functions, while the spatial consistency and\nfeature discrimination are preserved. Comprehensive experimental results on two\nhyperspectral and multispectral wetland datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nDFINet outperforms other competitive methods in terms of overall accuracy.",

          "description": "Order-agnostic autoregressive distribution (density) estimation (OADE), i.e.,\nautoregressive distribution estimation where the features can occur in an\narbitrary order, is a challenging problem in generative machine learning. Prior\nwork on OADE has encoded feature identity by assigning each feature to a\ndistinct fixed position in an input vector. As a result, architectures built\nfor these inputs must strategically mask either the input or model weights to\nlearn the various conditional distributions necessary for inferring the full\njoint distribution of the dataset in an order-agnostic way. In this paper, we\npropose an alternative approach for encoding feature identities, where each\nfeature's identity is included alongside its value in the input. This feature\nidentity encoding strategy allows neural architectures designed for sequential\ndata to be applied to the OADE task without modification. As a proof of\nconcept, we show that a Transformer trained on this input (which we refer to as\n\"the DEformer\", i.e., the distribution estimating Transformer) can effectively\nmodel binarized-MNIST, approaching the performance of fixed-order\nautoregressive distribution estimating algorithms while still being entirely\norder-agnostic. Additionally, we find that the DEformer surpasses the\nperformance of recent flow-based architectures when modeling a tabular dataset.",

The framework incorporates nearly\nall existing models in which a polynomial sample complexity is achievable, and,\nnotably, also includes new models, such as the Linear $Q^*/V^*$ model in which\nboth the optimal $Q$-function and the optimal $V$-function are linear in some\nknown feature space. Our main result provides an RL algorithm which has\npolynomial sample complexity for Bilinear Classes; notably, this sample\ncomplexity is stated in terms of a reduction to the generalization error of an\nunderlying supervised learning sub-problem. These bounds nearly match the best\nknown sample complexity bounds for existing models. Furthermore, this framework\nalso extends to the infinite dimensional (RKHS) setting: for the the Linear\n$Q^*/V^*$ model, linear MDPs, and linear mixture MDPs, we provide sample\ncomplexities that have no explicit dependence on the explicit feature dimension\n(which could be infinite), but instead depends only on information theoretic\nquantities.",

          "description": "Deep learning methods have shown suitability for time series classification\nin the health and medical domain, with promising results for electrocardiogram\ndata classification. Successful identification of myocardial infarction holds\nlife saving potential and any meaningful improvement upon deep learning models\nin this area is of great interest. Conventionally, data augmentation methods\nare applied universally to the training set when data are limited in order to\nameliorate data resolution or sample size. In the method proposed in this\nstudy, data augmentation was not applied in the context of data scarcity.\nInstead, samples that yield low confidence predictions were selectively\naugmented in order to bolster the model's sensitivity to features or patterns\nless strongly associated with a given class. This approach was tested for\nimproving the performance of a Fully Convolutional Network. The proposed\napproach achieved 90 percent accuracy for classifying myocardial infarction as\nopposed to 82 percent accuracy for the baseline, a marked improvement. Further,\nthe accuracy of the proposed approach was optimal near a defined upper\nthreshold for qualifying low confidence samples and decreased as this threshold\nwas raised to include higher confidence samples. This suggests exclusively\nselecting lower confidence samples for data augmentation comes with distinct\nbenefits for electrocardiogram data classification with Fully Convolutional\nNetworks.",

          "description": "A promising characteristic of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is its\ncapability to learn optimal policy in an end-to-end manner without relying on\nfeature engineering. However, most approaches assume a fully observable state\nspace, i.e. fully observable Markov Decision Process (MDP). In real-world\nrobotics, this assumption is unpractical, because of the sensor issues such as\nsensors' capacity limitation and sensor noise, and the lack of knowledge about\nif the observation design is complete or not. These scenarios lead to Partially\nObservable MDP (POMDP) and need special treatment. In this paper, we propose\nLong-Short-Term-Memory-based Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient\n(LSTM-TD3) by introducing a memory component to TD3, and compare its\nperformance with other DRL algorithms in both MDPs and POMDPs. Our results\ndemonstrate the significant advantages of the memory component in addressing\nPOMDPs, including the ability to handle missing and noisy observation data.",

          "description": "Multi-view clustering is an important research topic due to its capability to\nutilize complementary information from multiple views. However, there are few\nmethods to consider the negative impact caused by certain views with unclear\nclustering structures, resulting in poor multi-view clustering performance. To\naddress this drawback, we propose self-supervised discriminative feature\nlearning for deep multi-view clustering (SDMVC). Concretely, deep autoencoders\nare applied to learn embedded features for each view independently. To leverage\nthe multi-view complementary information, we concatenate all views' embedded\nfeatures to form the global features, which can overcome the negative impact of\nsome views' unclear clustering structures. In a self-supervised manner,\npseudo-labels are obtained to build a unified target distribution to perform\nmulti-view discriminative feature learning. During this process, global\ndiscriminative information can be mined to supervise all views to learn more\ndiscriminative features, which in turn are used to update the target\ndistribution. Besides, this unified target distribution can make SDMVC learn\nconsistent cluster assignments, which accomplishes the clustering consistency\nof multiple views while preserving their features' diversity. Experiments on\nvarious types of multi-view datasets show that SDMVC achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.",

          "description": "While the open-source software development model has led to successful\nlarge-scale collaborations in building software systems, data science projects\nare frequently developed by individuals or small teams. We describe challenges\nto scaling data science collaborations and present a conceptual framework and\nML programming model to address them. We instantiate these ideas in Ballet, a\nlightweight framework for collaborative, open-source data science through a\nfocus on feature engineering, and an accompanying cloud-based development\nenvironment. Using our framework, collaborators incrementally propose feature\ndefinitions to a repository which are each subjected to an ML performance\nevaluation and can be automatically merged into an executable feature\nengineering pipeline. We leverage Ballet to conduct a case study analysis of an\nincome prediction problem with 27 collaborators, and discuss implications for\nfuture designers of collaborative projects.",

          "description": "This work considers clustering nodes of a largely incomplete graph. Under the\nproblem setting, only a small amount of queries about the edges can be made,\nbut the entire graph is not observable. This problem finds applications in\nlarge-scale data clustering using limited annotations, community detection\nunder restricted survey resources, and graph topology inference under\nhidden/removed node interactions. Prior works tackled this problem from various\nperspectives, e.g., convex programming-based low-rank matrix completion and\nactive query-based clique finding. Nonetheless, many existing methods are\ndesigned for estimating the single-cluster membership of the nodes, but nodes\nmay often have mixed (i.e., multi-cluster) membership in practice. Some query\nand computational paradigms, e.g., the random query patterns and nuclear\nnorm-based optimization advocated in the convex approaches, may give rise to\nscalability and implementation challenges. This work aims at learning mixed\nmembership of nodes using queried edges. The proposed method is developed\ntogether with a systematic query principle that can be controlled and adjusted\nby the system designers to accommodate implementation challenges -- e.g., to\navoid querying edges that are physically hard to acquire. Our framework also\nfeatures a lightweight and scalable algorithm with membership learning\nguarantees. Real-data experiments on crowdclustering and community detection\nare used to showcase the effectiveness of our method.",

          "description": "Recently, many plug-and-play self-attention modules are proposed to enhance\nthe model generalization by exploiting the internal information of deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). Previous works lay an emphasis on the\ndesign of attention module for specific functionality, e.g., light-weighted or\ntask-oriented attention. However, they ignore the importance of where to plug\nin the attention module since they connect the modules individually with each\nblock of the entire CNN backbone for granted, leading to incremental\ncomputational cost and number of parameters with the growth of network depth.\nThus, we propose a framework called Efficient Attention Network (EAN) to\nimprove the efficiency for the existing attention modules. In EAN, we leverage\nthe sharing mechanism (Huang et al. 2020) to share the attention module within\nthe backbone and search where to connect the shared attention module via\nreinforcement learning. Finally, we obtain the attention network with sparse\nconnections between the backbone and modules, while (1) maintaining accuracy\n(2) reducing extra parameter increment and (3) accelerating inference.\nExtensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks and popular attention networks\nshow the effectiveness of EAN. Furthermore, we empirically illustrate that our\nEAN has the capacity of transferring to other tasks and capturing the\ninformative features.

In our work, graphs are encoded through their nodes'\npairwise relations and modeled as convex combination of graph atoms, i.e.\ndictionary elements, estimated thanks to an online stochastic algorithm, which\noperates on a dataset of unregistered graphs with potentially different number\nof nodes. Our approach naturally extends to labeled graphs, and is completed by\na novel upper bound that can be used as a fast approximation of Gromov\nWasserstein in the embedding space.

          "description": "Electromagnetic source imaging (ESI) is a highly ill-posed inverse problem.\nTo find a unique solution, traditional ESI methods impose a variety of priors\nthat may not reflect the actual source properties. Such limitations of\ntraditional ESI methods hinder their further applications. Inspired by deep\nlearning approaches, a novel data-synthesized spatio-temporal denoising\nautoencoder method (DST-DAE) method was proposed to solve the ESI inverse\nproblem. Unlike the traditional methods, we utilize a neural network to\ndirectly seek generalized mapping from the measured E/MEG signals to the\ncortical sources. A novel data synthesis strategy is employed by introducing\nthe prior information of sources to the generated large-scale samples using the\nforward model of ESI. All the generated data are used to drive the neural\nnetwork to automatically learn inverse mapping. To achieve better estimation\nperformance, a denoising autoencoder (DAE) architecture with spatio-temporal\nfeature extraction blocks is designed. Compared with the traditional methods,\nwe show (1) that the novel deep learning approach provides an effective and\neasy-to-apply way to solve the ESI problem, that (2) compared to traditional\nmethods, DST-DAE with the data synthesis strategy can better consider the\ncharacteristics of real sources than the mathematical formulation of prior\nassumptions, and that (3) the specifically designed architecture of DAE can not\nonly provide a better estimation of source signals but also be robust to noise\npollution. Extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed method is\nsuperior to the traditional knowledge-driven ESI methods.",

          "description": "For a tall $n\\times d$ matrix $A$ and a random $m\\times n$ sketching matrix\n$S$, the sketched estimate of the inverse covariance matrix $(A^\\top A)^{-1}$\nis typically biased: $E[(\\tilde A^\\top\\tilde A)^{-1}]\\ne(A^\\top A)^{-1}$, where\n$\\tilde A=SA$. This phenomenon, which we call inversion bias, arises, e.g., in\nstatistics and distributed optimization, when averaging multiple independently\nconstructed estimates of quantities that depend on the inverse covariance. We\ndevelop a framework for analyzing inversion bias, based on our proposed concept\nof an $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-unbiased estimator for random matrices. We show that\nwhen the sketching matrix $S$ is dense and has i.i.d. sub-gaussian entries,\nthen after simple rescaling, the estimator $(\\frac m{m-d}\\tilde A^\\top\\tilde\nA)^{-1}$ is $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-unbiased for $(A^\\top A)^{-1}$ with a sketch of\nsize $m=O(d+\\sqrt d/\\epsilon)$. This implies that for $m=O(d)$, the inversion\nbias of this estimator is $O(1/\\sqrt d)$, which is much smaller than the\n$\\Theta(1)$ approximation error obtained as a consequence of the subspace\nembedding guarantee for sub-gaussian sketches. We then propose a new sketching\ntechnique, called LEverage Score Sparsified (LESS) embeddings, which uses ideas\nfrom both data-oblivious sparse embeddings as well as data-aware leverage-based\nrow sampling methods, to get $\\epsilon$ inversion bias for sketch size\n$m=O(d\\log d+\\sqrt d/\\epsilon)$ in time $O(\\text{nnz}(A)\\log n+md^2)$, where\nnnz is the number of non-zeros. The key techniques enabling our analysis\ninclude an extension of a classical inequality of Bai and Silverstein for\nrandom quadratic forms, which we call the Restricted Bai-Silverstein\ninequality; and anti-concentration of the Binomial distribution via the\nPaley-Zygmund inequality, which we use to prove a lower bound showing that\nleverage score sampling sketches generally do not achieve small inversion bias.",

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have led to significant improvements in\ntasks involving semantic segmentation of images. CNNs are vulnerable in the\narea of biomedical image segmentation because of distributional gap between two\nsource and target domains with different data modalities which leads to domain\nshift. Domain shift makes data annotations in new modalities necessary because\nmodels must be retrained from scratch. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is\nproposed to adapt a model to new modalities using solely unlabeled target\ndomain data. Common UDA algorithms require access to data points in the source\ndomain which may not be feasible in medical imaging due to privacy concerns. In\nthis work, we develop an algorithm for UDA in a privacy-constrained setting,\nwhere the source domain data is inaccessible. Our idea is based on encoding the\ninformation from the source samples into a prototypical distribution that is\nused as an intermediate distribution for aligning the target domain\ndistribution with the source domain distribution.

          "description": "Real-world classification problems typically exhibit an imbalanced or\nlong-tailed label distribution, wherein many labels are associated with only a\nfew samples. This poses a challenge for generalisation on such labels, and also\nmakes na\\\"ive learning biased towards dominant labels. In this paper, we\npresent two simple modifications of standard softmax cross-entropy training to\ncope with these challenges. Our techniques revisit the classic idea of logit\nadjustment based on the label frequencies, either applied post-hoc to a trained\nmodel, or enforced in the loss during training. Such adjustment encourages a\nlarge relative margin between logits of rare versus dominant labels. These\ntechniques unify and generalise several recent proposals in the literature,\nwhile possessing firmer statistical grounding and empirical performance.",

          "description": "Active learning is widely used to reduce labeling effort and training time by\nrepeatedly querying only the most beneficial samples from unlabeled data. In\nreal-world problems where data cannot be stored indefinitely due to limited\nstorage or privacy issues, the query selection and the model update should be\nperformed as soon as a new data sample is observed. Various online active\nlearning methods have been studied to deal with these challenges; however,\nthere are difficulties in selecting representative query samples and updating\nthe model efficiently without forgetting. In this study, we propose Message\nPassing Adaptive Resonance Theory (MPART) that learns the distribution and\ntopology of input data online. Through message passing on the topological\ngraph, MPART actively queries informative and representative samples, and\ncontinuously improves the classification performance using both labeled and\nunlabeled data. We evaluate our model in stream-based selective sampling\nscenarios with comparable query selection strategies, showing that MPART\nsignificantly outperforms competitive models.",

Deep denoising CNNs (DnCNNs) use many feedforward\nconvolution layers with added regularization methods of batch normalization and\nresidual learning to improve denoising performance significantly.

          "description": "(Artificial) neural networks have become increasingly popular in mechanics to\naccelerate computations with model order reduction techniques and as universal\nmodels for a wide variety of materials. However, the major disadvantage of\nneural networks remains: their numerous parameters are challenging to interpret\nand explain. Thus, neural networks are often labeled as black boxes, and their\nresults often elude human interpretation. In mechanics, the new and active\nfield of physics-informed neural networks attempts to mitigate this\ndisadvantage by designing deep neural networks on the basis of mechanical\nknowledge. By using this a priori knowledge, deeper and more complex neural\nnetworks became feasible, since the mechanical assumptions could be explained.\nHowever, the internal reasoning and explanation of neural network parameters\nremain mysterious.\n\nComplementary to the physics-informed approach, we propose a first step\ntowards a physics-informing approach, which explains neural networks trained on\nmechanical data a posteriori. This novel explainable artificial intelligence\napproach aims at elucidating the black box of neural networks and their\nhigh-dimensional representations. Therein, the principal component analysis\ndecorrelates the distributed representations in cell states of RNNs and allows\nthe comparison to known and fundamental functions. The novel approach is\nsupported by a systematic hyperparameter search strategy that identifies the\nbest neural network architectures and training parameters. The findings of\nthree case studies on fundamental constitutive models (hyperelasticity,\nelastoplasticity, and viscoelasticity) imply that the proposed strategy can\nhelp identify numerical and analytical closed-form solutions to characterize\nnew materials.",

          "description": "It is commonly believed that networks cannot be both accurate and robust,\nthat gaining robustness means losing accuracy. It is also generally believed\nthat, unless making networks larger, network architectural elements would\notherwise matter little in improving adversarial robustness. Here we present\nevidence to challenge these common beliefs by a careful study about adversarial\ntraining. Our key observation is that the widely-used ReLU activation function\nsignificantly weakens adversarial training due to its non-smooth nature. Hence\nwe propose smooth adversarial training (SAT), in which we replace ReLU with its\nsmooth approximations to strengthen adversarial training. The purpose of smooth\nactivation functions in SAT is to allow it to find harder adversarial examples\nand compute better gradient updates during adversarial training.\n\nCompared to standard adversarial training, SAT improves adversarial\nrobustness for \"free\", i.e., no drop in accuracy and no increase in\ncomputational cost. For example, without introducing additional computations,\nSAT significantly enhances ResNet-50's robustness from 33.0% to 42.3%, while\nalso improving accuracy by 0.9% on ImageNet. SAT also works well with larger\nnetworks: it helps EfficientNet-L1 to achieve 82.2% accuracy and 58.6%\nrobustness on ImageNet, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art defense by\n9.5% for accuracy and 11.6% for robustness.

          "description": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) beam-tracking based on machine learning enables the\ndevelopment of accurate tracking policies while obviating the need to\nperiodically solve beam-optimization problems. However, its applicability is\nstill arguable when training-test gaps exist in terms of environmental\nparameters that affect the node dynamics. From this skeptical point of view,\nthe contribution of this study is twofold. First, by considering an example\nscenario, we confirm that the training-test gap adversely affects the\nbeam-tracking performance. More specifically, we consider nodes placed on\noverhead messenger wires, where the node dynamics are affected by several\nenvironmental parameters, e.g, the wire mass and tension. Although these are\nparticular scenarios, they yield insight into the validation of the\ntraining-test gap problems. Second, we demonstrate the feasibility of\n\\textit{zero-shot adaptation} as a solution, where a learning agent adapts to\nenvironmental parameters unseen during training. This is achieved by leveraging\na robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) technique, where such\ntraining-and-test gaps are regarded as disturbances by adversaries that are\njointly trained with a legitimate beam-tracking agent. Numerical evaluations\ndemonstrate that the beam-tracking policy learned via RARL can be applied to a\nwide range of environmental parameters without severely degrading the received\npower.",

For example, in recommendation systems, repeatedly asking the\nuser to provide feedback on the quality of recommendations will annoy them. In\nthis work, we formalize decision-making problems with querying budget, where\nthere is a (possibly time-dependent) hard limit on the number of reward queries\nallowed. Specifically, we consider multi-armed bandits, linear bandits, and\nreinforcement learning problems. We start by analyzing the performance of\n`greedy' algorithms that query a reward whenever they can. We show that in\nfully stochastic settings, doing so performs surprisingly well, but in the\npresence of any adversity, this might lead to linear regret. To overcome this\nissue, we propose the Confidence-Budget Matching (CBM) principle that queries\nrewards when the confidence intervals are wider than the inverse square root of\nthe available budget. We analyze the performance of CBM based algorithms in\ndifferent settings and show that they perform well in the presence of adversity\nin the contexts, initial states, and budgets.",

However, it has been shown\nthat the MMD test is unaware of adversarial attacks -- the MMD test failed to\ndetect the discrepancy between natural and adversarial data. Given this\nphenomenon, we raise a question: are natural and adversarial data really from\ndifferent distributions? The answer is affirmative -- the previous use of the\nMMD test on the purpose missed three key factors, and accordingly, we propose\nthree components. Firstly, the Gaussian kernel has limited representation\npower, and we replace it with an effective deep kernel. Secondly, the test\npower of the MMD test was neglected, and we maximize it following asymptotic\nstatistics. Finally, adversarial data may be non-independent, and we overcome\nthis issue with the wild bootstrap. By taking care of the three factors, we\nverify that the MMD test is aware of adversarial attacks, which lights up a\nnovel road for adversarial data detection based on two-sample tests.",

          "description": "Structured pruning is an effective compression technique to reduce the\ncomputation of neural networks, which is usually achieved by adding\nperturbations to reduce network parameters at the cost of slightly increasing\ntraining loss. A more reasonable approach is to find a sparse minimizer along\nthe flat minimum valley found by optimizers, i.e. stochastic gradient descent,\nwhich keeps the training loss constant. To achieve this goal, we propose the\nstructured directional pruning based on orthogonal projecting the perturbations\nonto the flat minimum valley. We also propose a fast solver sDprun and further\nprove that it achieves directional pruning asymptotically after sufficient\ntraining. Experiments using VGG-Net and ResNet on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100\ndatasets show that our method obtains the state-of-the-art pruned accuracy\n(i.e. 93.97% on VGG16, CIFAR-10 task) without retraining.

Granger causality is a practical framework\nfor analyzing the interactions from observed time-series data; however, this\nframework ignores the structures of the generative process in animal behaviors,\nwhich may lead to interpretational problems and sometimes erroneous assessments\nof causality. In this paper, we propose a new framework for learning Granger\ncausality from multi-animal trajectories via augmented theory-based behavioral\nmodels with interpretable data-driven models. We adopt an approach for\naugmenting incomplete multi-agent behavioral models described by time-varying\ndynamical systems with neural networks. For efficient and interpretable\nlearning, our model leverages theory-based architectures separating navigation\nand motion processes, and the theory-guided regularization for reliable\nbehavioral modeling.

In addition, these methods are also computationally inefficient,\nand require significant hyper-parameter tuning. In this paper, we address the\naforementioned challenges by developing a novel Bayesian framework for\ngenerating local explanations along with their associated uncertainty. We\ninstantiate this framework to obtain Bayesian versions of LIME and KernelSHAP\nwhich output credible intervals for the feature importances, capturing the\nassociated uncertainty. The resulting explanations not only enable us to make\nconcrete inferences about their quality (e.g., there is a 95\\% chance that the\nfeature importance lies within the given range), but are also highly consistent\nand stable. We carry out a detailed theoretical analysis that leverages the\naforementioned uncertainty to estimate how many perturbations to sample, and\nhow to sample for faster convergence. This work makes the first attempt at\naddressing several critical issues with popular explanation methods in one\nshot, thereby generating consistent, stable, and reliable explanations with\nguarantees in a computationally efficient manner.

          "description": "Uncertainty quantification for deep neural networks has recently evolved\nthrough many techniques. In this work, we revisit Laplace approximation, a\nclassical approach for posterior approximation that is computationally\nattractive. However, instead of computing the curvature matrix, we show that,\nunder some regularity conditions, the Laplace approximation can be easily\nconstructed using the gradient second moment. This quantity is already\nestimated by many exponential moving average variants of Adagrad such as Adam\nand RMSprop, but is traditionally discarded after training. We show that our\nmethod (L2M) does not require changes in models or optimization, can be\nimplemented in a few lines of code to yield reasonable results, and it does not\nrequire any extra computational steps besides what is already being computed by\noptimizers, without introducing any new hyperparameter. We hope our method can\nopen new research directions on using quantities already computed by optimizers\nfor uncertainty estimation in deep neural networks.",

Developing such insights can help understand the\ncapabilities and limits of these models and enable the research community to\nmore efficiently develop their usage for downstream applications. In this work,\nwe begin to fill this gap by examining one recent and successful pre-trained\nmodel (wav2vec 2.0), via its intermediate representation vectors, using a suite\nof analysis tools. We use the metrics of canonical correlation, mutual\ninformation, and performance on simple downstream tasks with non-parametric\nprobes, in order to (i) query for acoustic and linguistic information content,\n(ii) characterize the evolution of information across model layers, and (iii)\nunderstand how fine-tuning the model for automatic speech recognition (ASR)\naffects these observations.

          "description": "Deep learning is a type of machine learning that adapts a deep hierarchy of\nconcepts. Deep learning classifiers link the most basic version of concepts at\nthe input layer to the most abstract version of concepts at the output layer,\nalso known as a class or label. However, once trained over a finite set of\nclasses, a deep learning model does not have the power to say that a given\ninput does not belong to any of the classes and simply cannot be linked.\nCorrectly invalidating the prediction of unrelated classes is a challenging\nproblem that has been tackled in many ways in the literature. Novelty detection\ngives deep learning the ability to output \"do not know\" for novel/unseen\nclasses. Still, no attention has been given to the security aspects of novelty\ndetection. In this paper, we consider the case study of abstraction-based\nnovelty detection and show that it is not robust against adversarial samples.\nMoreover, we show the feasibility of crafting adversarial samples that fool the\ndeep learning classifier and bypass the novelty detection monitoring at the\nsame time.

It requires modeling the temporal coherence of videos and\nmulti-modality in terms of diversity in the potential future states. Current\nvariational approaches for video generation tend to marginalize over\nmulti-modal future outcomes. Instead, we propose to explicitly model the\nmulti-modality in the future outcomes and leverage it to sample diverse\nfutures. Our approach, Diverse Video Generator, uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to\nlearn priors on future states given the past and maintains a probability\ndistribution over possible futures given a particular sample. In addition, we\nleverage the changes in this distribution over time to control the sampling of\ndiverse future states by estimating the end of ongoing sequences. That is, we\nuse the variance of GP over the output function space to trigger a change in an\naction sequence. We achieve state-of-the-art results on diverse future frame\ngeneration in terms of reconstruction quality and diversity of the generated\nsequences.",

          "description": "In machine learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extremely\ninfluential in both computer vision and in recognizing patterns extended over\ntime. In computer vision, part of the flexibility arises from the use of\nmax-pooling operations over the convolutions to attain translation invariance.\nIn the mammalian brain, neural representations of time use a set of temporal\nbasis functions. Critically, these basis functions appear to be arranged in a\ngeometric series such that the basis set is evenly distributed over logarithmic\ntime. This paper introduces a Scale-Invariant Temporal History Convolution\nnetwork (SITHCon) that uses a logarithmically-distributed temporal memory. A\nmax-pool over a logarithmically-distributed temporal memory results in\nscale-invariance in time. We compare performance of SITHCon to a Temporal\nConvolution Network (TCN) and demonstrate that, although both networks can\nlearn classification and regression problems on both univariate and\nmultivariate time series $f(t)$, only SITHCon has the property that it\ngeneralizes without retraining to rescaled versions of the input $f(at)$. This\nproperty, inspired by findings from neuroscience and psychology, could lead to\nlarge-scale networks with dramatically different capabilities, including faster\ntraining and greater generalizability, even with significantly fewer free\nparameters.",

Thus, the\nquestion arises: how complex does the inferential model need to be, in order to\nbe able to accurately model the posterior distribution of a given generative\nmodel?\n\nIn this paper, we identify an important property of the generative map\nimpacting the required size of the encoder. We show that if the generative map\nis \"strongly invertible\" (in a sense we suitably formalize), the inferential\nmodel need not be much more complex. Conversely, we prove that there exist\nnon-invertible generative maps, for which the encoding direction needs to be\nexponentially larger (under standard assumptions in computational complexity).\nImportantly, we do not require the generative model to be layerwise invertible,\nwhich a lot of the related literature assumes and isn't satisfied by many\narchitectures used in practice (e.g. convolution and pooling based networks).\nThus, we provide theoretical support for the empirical wisdom that learning\ndeep generative models is harder when data lies on a low-dimensional manifold.",

The proposed Lifelong mixture of\nVAE (L-MVAE) expands its architecture with new components when learning a\ncompletely new task. After the training, our model can automatically determine\nthe relevant expert to be used when fed with new data samples. This mechanism\nbenefits both the memory efficiency and the required computational cost as only\none expert is used during the inference. The L-MVAE inference model is able to\nperform interpolation in the joint latent space across the data domains\nassociated with different tasks and is shown to be efficient for disentangled\nlearning representation.",

          "description": "How can neural networks be trained on large-volume temporal data efficiently?\nTo compute the gradients required to update parameters, backpropagation blocks\ncomputations until the forward and backward passes are completed. For temporal\nsignals, this introduces high latency and hinders real-time learning. It also\ncreates a coupling between consecutive layers, which limits model parallelism\nand increases memory consumption. In this paper, we build upon Sideways, which\navoids blocking by propagating approximate gradients forward in time, and we\npropose mechanisms for temporal integration of information based on different\nvariants of skip connections. We also show how to decouple computation and\ndelegate individual neural modules to different devices, allowing distributed\nand parallel training. The proposed Skip-Sideways achieves low latency\ntraining, model parallelism, and, importantly, is capable of extracting\ntemporal features, leading to more stable training and improved performance on\nreal-world action recognition video datasets such as HMDB51, UCF101, and the\nlarge-scale Kinetics-600. Finally, we also show that models trained with\nSkip-Sideways generate better future frames than Sideways models, and hence\nthey can better utilize motion cues.",

Our method produces competitive results on these datasets and\nsurpasses all baselines on 4 of them.

We infer the posterior of exogenous\nvariables, intervene on observations, and draw samples from the resultant SCM\nto obtain counterfactuals.

          "description": "When an agent encounters a continual stream of new tasks in the lifelong\nlearning setting, it leverages the knowledge it gained from the earlier tasks\nto help learn the new tasks better. In such a scenario, identifying an\nefficient knowledge representation becomes a challenging problem. Most research\nworks propose to either store a subset of examples from the past tasks in a\nreplay buffer, dedicate a separate set of parameters to each task or penalize\nexcessive updates over parameters by introducing a regularization term. While\nexisting methods employ the general task-agnostic stochastic gradient descent\nupdate rule, we propose a task-aware optimizer that adapts the learning rate\nbased on the relatedness among tasks. We utilize the directions taken by the\nparameters during the updates by accumulating the gradients specific to each\ntask. These task-based accumulated gradients act as a knowledge base that is\nmaintained and updated throughout the stream. We empirically show that our\nproposed adaptive learning rate not only accounts for catastrophic forgetting\nbut also allows positive backward transfer.

          "description": "Traditional computer vision approaches, based on neural networks (NN), are\ntypically trained on a large amount of image data. By minimizing the\ncross-entropy loss between a prediction and a given class label, the NN and its\nvisual embedding space are learned to fulfill a given task. However, due to the\nsole dependence on the image data distribution of the training domain, these\nmodels tend to fail when applied to a target domain that differs from their\nsource domain. To learn a more robust NN to domain shifts, we propose the\nknowledge graph neural network (KG-NN), a neuro-symbolic approach that\nsupervises the training using image-data-invariant auxiliary knowledge. The\nauxiliary knowledge is first encoded in a knowledge graph with respective\nconcepts and their relationships, which is then transformed into a dense vector\nrepresentation via an embedding method. Using a contrastive loss function,\nKG-NN learns to adapt its visual embedding space and thus its weights according\nto the image-data invariant knowledge graph embedding space. We evaluate KG-NN\non visual transfer learning tasks for classification using the mini-ImageNet\ndataset and its derivatives, as well as road sign recognition datasets from\nGermany and China. The results show that a visual model trained with a\nknowledge graph as a trainer outperforms a model trained with cross-entropy in\nall experiments, in particular when the domain gap increases. Besides better\nperformance and stronger robustness to domain shifts, these KG-NN adapts to\nmultiple datasets and classes without suffering heavily from catastrophic\nforgetting.",

          "description": "In constrained reinforcement learning (RL), a learning agent seeks to not\nonly optimize the overall reward but also satisfy the additional safety,\ndiversity, or budget constraints. Consequently, existing constrained RL\nsolutions require several new algorithmic ingredients that are notably\ndifferent from standard RL. On the other hand, reward-free RL is independently\ndeveloped in the unconstrained literature, which learns the transition dynamics\nwithout using the reward information, and thus naturally capable of addressing\nRL with multiple objectives under the common dynamics. This paper bridges\nreward-free RL and constrained RL. Particularly, we propose a simple\nmeta-algorithm such that given any reward-free RL oracle, the approachability\nand constrained RL problems can be directly solved with negligible overheads in\nsample complexity. Utilizing the existing reward-free RL solvers, our framework\nprovides sharp sample complexity results for constrained RL in the tabular MDP\nsetting, matching the best existing results up to a factor of horizon\ndependence; our framework directly extends to a setting of tabular two-player\nMarkov games, and gives a new result for constrained RL with linear function\napproximation.",

          "description": "Differential privacy (DP) is a widely-accepted and widely-applied notion of\nprivacy based on worst-case analysis. Often, DP classifies most mechanisms\nwithout external noise as non-private [Dwork et al., 2014], and external\nnoises, such as Gaussian noise or Laplacian noise [Dwork et al., 2006], are\nintroduced to improve privacy. In many real-world applications, however, adding\nexternal noise is undesirable and sometimes prohibited. For example,\npresidential elections often require a deterministic rule to be used [Liu et\nal., 2020], and small noises can lead to dramatic decreases in the prediction\naccuracy of deep neural networks, especially the underrepresented classes\n[Bagdasaryan et al., 2019].\n\nIn this paper, we propose a natural extension and relaxation of DP following\nthe worst average-case idea behind the celebrated smoothed analysis [Spielman\nand Teng, 2004]. Our notion, the smoothed DP, can effectively measure the\nprivacy leakage of mechanisms without external noises under realistic settings.\n\nWe prove several strong properties of the smoothed DP, including\ncomposability, robustness to post-processing and etc. We proved that any\ndiscrete mechanism with sampling procedures is more private than what DP\npredicts. In comparison, many continuous mechanisms with sampling procedures\nare still non-private under smoothed DP. Experimentally, we first verified that\nthe discrete sampling mechanisms are private in real-world elections. Then, we\napply the smoothed DP notion on quantized gradient descent, which indicates\nsome neural networks can be private without adding any extra noises.

This method transports a\nset of particles using not only importance sampling (IS), Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) and resampling steps - as in SMC, but also relies on NFs which are\nlearned sequentially to push particles towards the successive annealed targets.\nWe provide limit theorems for the resulting Monte Carlo estimates of the\nnormalizing constant and expectations with respect to the target distribution.\nAdditionally, we show that a continuous-time scaling limit of the population\nversion of AFT is given by a Feynman--Kac measure which simplifies to the law\nof a controlled diffusion for expressive NFs. We demonstrate experimentally the\nbenefits and limitations of our methodology on a variety of applications.",

          "description": "There has been a long history of using ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\nto understand the dynamics of discrete-time algorithms (DTAs). Surprisingly,\nthere are still two fundamental and unanswered questions: (i) it is unclear how\nto obtain a \\emph{suitable} ODE from a given DTA, and (ii) it is unclear the\nconnection between the convergence of a DTA and its corresponding ODEs. In this\npaper, we propose a new machinery -- an $O(s^r)$-resolution ODE framework --\nfor analyzing the behavior of a generic DTA, which (partially) answers the\nabove two questions. The framework contains three steps: 1. To obtain a\nsuitable ODE from a given DTA, we define a hierarchy of $O(s^r)$-resolution\nODEs of a DTA parameterized by the degree $r$, where $s$ is the step-size of\nthe DTA. We present a principal approach to construct the unique\n$O(s^r)$-resolution ODEs from a DTA; 2. To analyze the resulting ODE, we\npropose the $O(s^r)$-linear-convergence condition of a DTA with respect to an\nenergy function, under which the $O(s^r)$-resolution ODE converges linearly to\nan optimal solution; 3. To bridge the convergence properties of a DTA and its\ncorresponding ODEs, we define the properness of an energy function and show\nthat the linear convergence of the $O(s^r)$-resolution ODE with respect to a\nproper energy function can automatically guarantee the linear convergence of\nthe DTA. To better illustrate this machinery, we utilize it to study three\nclassic algorithms -- gradient descent ascent (GDA), proximal point method\n(PPM) and extra-gradient method (EGM) -- for solving the unconstrained minimax\nproblem $\\min_{x\\in\\RR^n} \\max_{y\\in \\RR^m} L(x,y)$.",

Some of these\ndecisions show bias and adversely affect certain social groups (e.g. those\ndefined by sex, race, age, marital status). Many prior works on bias mitigation\ntake the following form: change the data or learners in multiple ways, then see\nif any of that improves fairness. Perhaps a better approach is to postulate\nroot causes of bias and then applying some resolution strategy. This paper\npostulates that the root causes of bias are the prior decisions that affect-\n(a) what data was selected and (b) the labels assigned to those examples. Our\nFair-SMOTE algorithm removes biased labels; and rebalances internal\ndistributions such that based on sensitive attribute, examples are equal in\nboth positive and negative classes. On testing, it was seen that this method\nwas just as effective at reducing bias as prior approaches. Further, models\ngenerated via Fair-SMOTE achieve higher performance (measured in terms of\nrecall and F1) than other state-of-the-art fairness improvement algorithms.

This\nwork considers a large family of bandit problems where the unknown underlying\nreward function is non-concave, including the low-rank generalized linear\nbandit problems and two-layer neural network with polynomial activation bandit\nproblem. For the low-rank generalized linear bandit problem, we provide a\nminimax-optimal algorithm in the dimension, refuting both conjectures in\n[LMT21, JWWN19]. Our algorithms are based on a unified zeroth-order\noptimization paradigm that applies in great generality and attains optimal\nrates in several structured polynomial settings (in the dimension). We further\ndemonstrate the applicability of our algorithms in RL in the generative model\nsetting, resulting in improved sample complexity over prior approaches.\nFinally, we show that the standard optimistic algorithms (e.g., UCB) are\nsub-optimal by dimension factors. In the neural net setting (with polynomial\nactivation functions) with noiseless reward, we provide a bandit algorithm with\nsample complexity equal to the intrinsic algebraic dimension. Again, we show\nthat optimistic approaches have worse sample complexity, polynomial in the\nextrinsic dimension (which could be exponentially worse in the polynomial\ndegree).",

However, there are three challenges that need to be addressed to\nmake FL efficient: (i) execute on devices with limited computational\ncapabilities, (ii) account for stragglers due to computational heterogeneity of\ndevices, and (iii) adapt to the changing network bandwidths. This paper\npresents FedAdapt, an adaptive offloading FL framework to mitigate the\naforementioned challenges. FedAdapt accelerates local training in\ncomputationally constrained devices by leveraging layer offloading of deep\nneural networks (DNNs) to servers. Further, FedAdapt adopts reinforcement\nlearning-based optimization and clustering to adaptively identify which layers\nof the DNN should be offloaded for each individual device on to a server to\ntackle the challenges of computational heterogeneity and changing network\nbandwidth. Experimental studies are carried out on a lab-based testbed\ncomprising five IoT devices. By offloading a DNN from the device to the server\nFedAdapt reduces the training time of a typical IoT device by over half\ncompared to classic FL. The training time of extreme stragglers and the overall\ntraining time can be reduced by up to 57%. Furthermore, with changing network\nbandwidth, FedAdapt is demonstrated to reduce the training time by up to 40%\nwhen compared to classic FL, without sacrificing accuracy.

While\nthe deployment of pattern matching or machine learning in hotspot detection can\nhelp save significant simulation time, such methods typically demand for\nnon-trivial quality data to build the model, which most design houses are short\nof. Moreover, the design houses are also unwilling to directly share such data\nwith the other houses to build a unified model, which can be ineffective for\nthe design house with unique design patterns due to data insufficiency.

Unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) has been\nrecently developed to handle this domain shift problem. However, previous UDA\nmethods applied for sleep staging has two main limitations. First, they rely on\na totally shared model for the domain alignment, which may lose the\ndomain-specific information during feature extraction. Second, they only align\nthe source and target distributions globally without considering the class\ninformation in the target domain, which hinders the classification performance\nof the model. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework\nto tackle the domain shift problem in the unlabeled target domain. First, we\ndevelop unshared attention mechanisms to preserve the domain-specific features\nin the source and target domains. Second, we design a self-training strategy to\nalign the fine-grained class distributions for the source and target domains\nvia target domain pseudo labels.

          "description": "We propose a feature generator backbone composed of an ensemble of\nconvolutional neuralnetworks (CNNs) to improve the recently emerging Vision\nTransformer (ViT) models. We tackled the RSNA intracranial hemorrhage\nclassification problem, i.e., identifying various hemorrhage types from\ncomputed tomography (CT) slices. We show that by gradually stacking several\nfeature maps extracted using multiple Xception CNNs, we can develop a\nfeature-rich input for the ViT model. Our approach allowed the ViT model to pay\nattention to relevant features at multiple levels. Moreover, pretraining the n\nCNNs using various paradigms leads to a diverse feature set and further\nimproves the performance of the proposed n-CNN-ViT. We achieved a test accuracy\nof 98.04% with a weighted logarithmic loss value of 0.0708. The proposed\narchitecture is modular and scalable in both the number of CNNs used for\nfeature extraction and the size of the ViT.",

          "description": "Truly intelligent systems are expected to make critical decisions with\nincomplete and uncertain data. Active feature acquisition (AFA), where features\nare sequentially acquired to improve the prediction, is a step towards this\ngoal. However, current AFA models all deal with a small set of candidate\nfeatures and have difficulty scaling to a large feature space. Moreover, they\nare ignorant about the valid domains where they can predict confidently, thus\nthey can be vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. In order to remedy\nthese deficiencies and bring AFA models closer to practical use, we propose\nseveral techniques to advance the current AFA approaches. Our framework can\neasily handle a large number of features using a hierarchical acquisition\npolicy and is more robust to OOD inputs with the help of an OOD detector for\npartially observed data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our\nframework over strong baselines.",

          "description": "The process of aggregation is ubiquitous in almost all deep nets models. It\nfunctions as an important mechanism for consolidating deep features into a more\ncompact representation, whilst increasing robustness to overfitting and\nproviding spatial invariance in deep nets. In particular, the proximity of\nglobal aggregation layers to the output layers of DNNs mean that aggregated\nfeatures have a direct influence on the performance of a deep net. A better\nunderstanding of this relationship can be obtained using information theoretic\nmethods. However, this requires the knowledge of the distributions of the\nactivations of aggregation layers. To achieve this, we propose a novel\nmathematical formulation for analytically modelling the probability\ndistributions of output values of layers involved with deep feature\naggregation. An important outcome is our ability to analytically predict the\nKL-divergence of output nodes in a DNN. We also experimentally verify our\ntheoretical predictions against empirical observations across a range of\ndifferent classification tasks and datasets.",

          "description": "Human brain performs remarkably well in segregating a particular speaker from\ninterfering ones in a multi-speaker scenario. It has been recently shown that\nwe can quantitatively evaluate the segregation capability by modelling the\nrelationship between the speech signals present in an auditory scene and the\ncortical signals of the listener measured using electroencephalography (EEG).\nThis has opened up avenues to integrate neuro-feedback into hearing aids\nwhereby the device can infer user's attention and enhance the attended speaker.\nCommonly used algorithms to infer the auditory attention are based on linear\nsystems theory where the speech cues such as envelopes are mapped on to the EEG\nsignals. Here, we present a joint convolutional neural network (CNN) - long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) model to infer the auditory attention. Our joint\nCNN-LSTM model takes the EEG signals and the spectrogram of the multiple\nspeakers as inputs and classifies the attention to one of the speakers. We\nevaluated the reliability of our neural network using three different datasets\ncomprising of 61 subjects where, each subject undertook a dual-speaker\nexperiment. The three datasets analysed corresponded to speech stimuli\npresented in three different languages namely German, Danish and Dutch. Using\nthe proposed joint CNN-LSTM model, we obtained a median decoding accuracy of\n77.2% at a trial duration of three seconds. Furthermore, we evaluated the\namount of sparsity that our model can tolerate by means of magnitude pruning\nand found that the model can tolerate up to 50% sparsity without substantial\nloss of decoding accuracy.",

          "description": "Particle filtering is a popular method for inferring latent states in\nstochastic dynamical systems, whose theoretical properties have been well\nstudied in machine learning and statistics communities. In many control\nproblems, e.g., partially observed linear dynamical systems (POLDS), oftentimes\nthe inferred latent state is further used for planning at each step. This paper\ninitiates a rigorous study on the efficiency of particle filtering for\nsequential planning, and gives the first particle complexity bounds. Though\nerrors in past actions may affect the future, we are able to bound the number\nof particles needed so that the long-run reward of the policy based on particle\nfiltering is close to that based on exact inference. In particular, we show\nthat, in stable systems, polynomially many particles suffice. Key in our proof\nis a coupling of the ideal sequence based on the exact planning and the\nsequence generated by approximate planning based on particle filtering. We\nbelieve this technique can be useful in other sequential decision-making\nproblems.",

The learning purposes of our system are based on three distinct\nrepresentations: surface representation, structure representation, and texture\nrepresentation. The surface representation refers to the smooth surface of the\nimages. The structure representation relates to the sparse colour blocks and\ncompresses generic content. The texture representation shows the texture,\ncurves, and features in cartoon images. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\nframework decomposes the images into different representations and learns from\nthem to generate cartoon images. This decomposition makes the framework more\ncontrollable and flexible which allows users to make changes based on the\nrequired output. This approach overcomes any previous system in terms of\nmaintaining clarity, colours, textures, shapes of images yet showing the\ncharacteristics of cartoon images.",

          "description": "Adaptation of a classifier to new domains is one of the challenging problems\nin machine learning. This has been addressed using many deep and non-deep\nlearning based methods. Among the methodologies used, that of adversarial\nlearning is widely applied to solve many deep learning problems along with\ndomain adaptation. These methods are based on a discriminator that ensures\nsource and target distributions are close. However, here we suggest that rather\nthan using a point estimate obtaining by a single discriminator, it would be\nuseful if a distribution based on ensembles of discriminators could be used to\nbridge this gap. This could be achieved using multiple classifiers or using\ntraditional ensemble methods. In contrast, we suggest that a Monte Carlo\ndropout based ensemble discriminator could suffice to obtain the distribution\nbased discriminator. Specifically, we propose a curriculum based dropout\ndiscriminator that gradually increases the variance of the sample based\ndistribution and the corresponding reverse gradients are used to align the\nsource and target feature representations. An ensemble of discriminators helps\nthe model to learn the data distribution efficiently. It also provides a better\ngradient estimates to train the feature extractor. The detailed results and\nthorough ablation analysis show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art\nresults.",

Such methods are limited by image\nresolution due to which they fail to disambiguate structures in dense regions\nwhich appear commonly in forms. To mitigate this, we propose Form2Seq, a novel\nsequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) inspired framework for structure extraction\nusing text, with a specific focus on forms, which leverages relative spatial\narrangement of structures. We discuss two tasks; 1) Classification of low-level\nconstituent elements (TextBlock and empty fillable Widget) into ten types such\nas field captions, list items, and others; 2) Grouping lower-level elements\ninto higher-order constructs, such as Text Fields, ChoiceFields and\nChoiceGroups, used as information collection mechanism in forms. To achieve\nthis, we arrange the constituent elements linearly in natural reading order,\nfeed their spatial and textual representations to Seq2Seq framework, which\nsequentially outputs prediction of each element depending on the final task. We\nmodify Seq2Seq for grouping task and discuss improvements obtained through\ncascaded end-to-end training of two tasks versus training in isolation.\nExperimental results show the effectiveness of our text-based approach\nachieving an accuracy of 90% on classification task and an F1 of 75.82, 86.01,\n61.63 on groups discussed above respectively, outperforming segmentation\nbaselines.

          "description": "Massive deployment of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in high-stake applications\ngenerates a strong demand for explanations that are robust to noise and align\nwell with human intuition. Most existing methods generate explanations by\nidentifying a subgraph of an input graph that has a strong correlation with the\nprediction. These explanations are not robust to noise because independently\noptimizing the correlation for a single input can easily overfit noise.\nMoreover, they do not align well with human intuition because removing an\nidentified subgraph from an input graph does not necessarily change the\nprediction result. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate robust\ncounterfactual explanations on GNNs by explicitly modelling the common decision\nlogic of GNNs on similar input graphs. Our explanations are naturally robust to\nnoise because they are produced from the common decision boundaries of a GNN\nthat govern the predictions of many similar input graphs. The explanations also\nalign well with human intuition because removing the set of edges identified by\nan explanation from the input graph changes the prediction significantly.\nExhaustive experiments on many public datasets demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our method.",

If the\nunderlying model is solved on nonuniform meshes, arising from a finite element\nmethod typical for nonlinear inverse problems, interpolation and embeddings are\nneeded. To overcome this, we present a flexible framework to extend model-based\nlearning directly to nonuniform meshes, by interpreting the mesh as a graph and\nformulating our network architectures using graph convolutional neural\nnetworks. This gives rise to the proposed iterative Graph Convolutional\nNewton-type Method (GCNM), which includes the forward model in the solution of\nthe inverse problem, while all updates are directly computed by the network on\nthe problem specific mesh. We present results for Electrical Impedance\nTomography, a severely ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem that is frequently\nsolved via optimization-based methods, where the forward problem is solved by\nfinite element methods. Results for absolute EIT imaging are compared to\nstandard iterative methods as well as a graph residual network.

Similar to other graph-structured data, link prediction is one of the\nmost important tasks on multi-relational graphs and is often used for knowledge\ncompletion. When related graphs coexist, it is of great benefit to build a\nlarger graph via integrating the smaller ones. The integration requires\npredicting hidden relational connections between entities belonged to different\ngraphs (inter-domain link prediction).

In these problems, requests arrive\nsequentially during a finite horizon and, for each request, a decision maker\nneeds to choose an action that consumes a certain amount of resources and\ngenerates reward. The objective is to maximize cumulative rewards subject to a\nconstraint on the total consumption of resources. In this paper, we consider a\ndata-driven setting in which the reward and resource consumption of each\nrequest are generated using an input model that is unknown to the decision\nmaker.\n\nWe design a general class of algorithms that attain good performance in\nvarious inputs models without knowing which type of input they are facing. In\nparticular, our algorithms are asymptotically optimal under stochastic i.i.d.\ninput model as well as various non-stationary stochastic input models, and they\nattain an asymptotically optimal fixed competitive ratio when the input is\nadversarial. Our algorithms operate in the Lagrangian dual space: they maintain\na dual multiplier for each resource that is updated using online mirror\ndescent. By choosing the reference function accordingly, we recover dual\nsub-gradient descent and dual exponential weights algorithm. The resulting\nalgorithms are simple, fast, and have minimal requirements on the reward\nfunctions, consumption functions and the action space, in contrast to existing\nmethods for online allocation problems. We discuss applications to network\nrevenue management, online bidding in repeated auctions with budget\nconstraints, online proportional matching with high entropy, and personalized\nassortment optimization with limited inventories.",

          "description": "Two-dimensional array-based datasets are pervasive in a variety of domains.\nCurrent approaches for generative modeling have typically been limited to\nconventional image datasets and performed in the pixel domain which do not\nexplicitly capture the correlation between pixels. Additionally, these\napproaches do not extend to scientific and other applications where each\nelement value is continuous and is not limited to a fixed range. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel approach for generating two-dimensional datasets by moving\nthe computations to the space of representation bases and show its usefulness\nfor two different datasets, one from imaging and another from scientific\ncomputing. The proposed approach is general and can be applied to any dataset,\nrepresentation basis, or generative model. We provide a comprehensive\nperformance comparison of various combinations of generative models and\nrepresentation basis spaces. We also propose a new evaluation metric which\ncaptures the deficiency of generating images in pixel space.",

          "description": "Data-to-Text Generation (DTG) is a subfield of Natural Language Generation\naiming at transcribing structured data in natural language descriptions. The\nfield has been recently boosted by the use of neural-based generators which\nexhibit on one side great syntactic skills without the need of hand-crafted\npipelines; on the other side, the quality of the generated text reflects the\nquality of the training data, which in realistic settings only offer\nimperfectly aligned structure-text pairs. Consequently, state-of-art neural\nmodels include misleading statements - usually called hallucinations - in their\noutputs. The control of this phenomenon is today a major challenge for DTG, and\nis the problem addressed in the paper.\n\nPrevious work deal with this issue at the instance level: using an alignment\nscore for each table-reference pair. In contrast, we propose a finer-grained\napproach, arguing that hallucinations should rather be treated at the word\nlevel. Specifically, we propose a Multi-Branch Decoder which is able to\nleverage word-level labels to learn the relevant parts of each training\ninstance. These labels are obtained following a simple and efficient scoring\nprocedure based on co-occurrence analysis and dependency parsing. Extensive\nevaluations, via automated metrics and human judgment on the standard WikiBio\nbenchmark, show the accuracy of our alignment labels and the effectiveness of\nthe proposed Multi-Branch Decoder. Our model is able to reduce and control\nhallucinations, while keeping fluency and coherence in generated texts. Further\nexperiments on a degraded version of ToTTo show that our model could be\nsuccessfully used on very noisy settings.",

          "description": "We consider local planning in fixed-horizon MDPs with a generative model\nunder the assumption that the optimal value function lies close to the span of\na feature map. The generative model provides a local access to the MDP: The\nplanner can ask for random transitions from previously returned states and\narbitrary actions, and features are only accessible for states that are\nencountered in this process. As opposed to previous work (e.g. Lattimore et al.\n(2020)) where linear realizability of all policies was assumed, we consider the\nsignificantly relaxed assumption of a single linearly realizable\n(deterministic) policy. A recent lower bound by Weisz et al. (2020) established\nthat the related problem when the action-value function of the optimal policy\nis linearly realizable requires an exponential number of queries, either in $H$\n(the horizon of the MDP) or $d$ (the dimension of the feature mapping). Their\nconstruction crucially relies on having an exponentially large action set. In\ncontrast, in this work, we establish that poly$(H,d)$ planning is possible with\nstate value function realizability whenever the action set has a constant size.\nIn particular, we present the TensorPlan algorithm which uses\npoly$((dH/\\delta)^A)$ simulator queries to find a $\\delta$-optimal policy\nrelative to any deterministic policy for which the value function is linearly\nrealizable with some bounded parameter. This is the first algorithm to give a\npolynomial query complexity guarantee using only linear-realizability of a\nsingle competing value function. Whether the computation cost is similarly\nbounded remains an open question. We extend the upper bound to the\nnear-realizable case and to the infinite-horizon discounted setup. We also\npresent a lower bound in the infinite-horizon episodic setting: Planners that\nachieve constant suboptimality need exponentially many queries, either in $d$\nor the number of actions.",

          "description": "Boosting techniques and neural networks are particularly effective machine\nlearning methods for insurance pricing. Often in practice, there are\nnevertheless endless debates about the choice of the right loss function to be\nused to train the machine learning model, as well as about the appropriate\nmetric to assess the performances of competing models. Also, the sum of fitted\nvalues can depart from the observed totals to a large extent and this often\nconfuses actuarial analysts. The lack of balance inherent to training models by\nminimizing deviance outside the familiar GLM with canonical link setting has\nbeen empirically documented in W\\\"uthrich (2019, 2020) who attributes it to the\nearly stopping rule in gradient descent methods for model fitting. The present\npaper aims to further study this phenomenon when learning proceeds by\nminimizing Tweedie deviance. It is shown that minimizing deviance involves a\ntrade-off between the integral of weighted differences of lower partial moments\nand the bias measured on a specific scale. Autocalibration is then proposed as\na remedy. This new method to correct for bias adds an extra local GLM step to\nthe analysis. Theoretically, it is shown that it implements the autocalibration\nconcept in pure premium calculation and ensures that balance also holds on a\nlocal scale, not only at portfolio level as with existing bias-correction\ntechniques. The convex order appears to be the natural tool to compare\ncompeting models, putting a new light on the diagnostic graphs and associated\nmetrics proposed by Denuit et al. (2019).",

          "description": "Application of deep neural networks to medical imaging tasks has in some\nsense become commonplace. Still, a \"thorn in the side\" of the deep learning\nmovement is the argument that deep networks are prone to overfitting and are\nthus unable to generalize well when datasets are small (as is common in medical\nimaging tasks). One way to bolster confidence is to provide mathematical\nguarantees, or bounds, on network performance after training which explicitly\nquantify the possibility of overfitting. In this work, we explore recent\nadvances using the PAC-Bayesian framework to provide bounds on generalization\nerror for large (stochastic) networks. While previous efforts focus on\nclassification in larger natural image datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR-10), we\napply these techniques to both classification and segmentation in a smaller\nmedical imagining dataset: the ISIC 2018 challenge set.

          "description": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related dementia. It remains\na challenge to identify the individuals at risk of dementia for precise\nmanagement. Brain MRI offers a noninvasive biomarker to detect brain aging.\nPrevious evidence shows that the brain structural change detected by diffusion\nMRI is associated with dementia. Mounting studies has conceptualised the brain\nas a complex network, which has shown the utility of this approach in\ncharacterising various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, the\nstructural connectivity shows promise in dementia classification. The proposed\nBrainNetGAN is a generative adversarial network variant to augment the brain\nstructural connectivity matrices for binary dementia classification tasks.\nStructural connectivity matrices between separated brain regions are\nconstructed using tractography on diffusion MRI data. The BrainNetGAN model is\ntrained to generate fake brain connectivity matrices, which are expected to\nreflect latent distribution of the real brain network data. Finally, a\nconvolutional neural network classifier is proposed for binary dementia\nclassification. Numerical results show that the binary classification\nperformance in the testing set was improved using the BrainNetGAN augmented\ndataset. The proposed methodology allows quick synthesis of an arbitrary number\nof augmented connectivity matrices and can be easily transferred to similar\nclassification tasks.",

Data gravity, a fundamental concept in Fog Computing,\npoints towards decentralisation of computation for data analysis, as a viable\nalternative to address those concerns. Decentralising AI tasks on several\ncooperative devices means identifying the optimal set of locations or\nCollection Points (CP for short) to use, in the continuum between full\ncentralisation (i.e., all data on a single device) and full decentralisation\n(i.e., data on source locations). We propose an analytical framework able to\nfind the optimal operating point in this continuum, linking the accuracy of the\nlearning task with the corresponding network and computational cost for moving\ndata and running the distributed training at the CPs. We show through\nsimulations that the model accurately predicts the optimal trade-off, quite\noften an intermediate point between full centralisation and full\ndecentralisation, showing also a significant cost saving w.r.t. both of them.\nFinally, the analytical model admits closed-form or numeric solutions, making\nit not only a performance evaluation instrument but also a design tool to\nconfigure a given distributed learning task optimally before its deployment.",

          "description": "Predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) via reliable computational methods\nis an effective and efficient way to mitigate the enormous costs and time of\nthe drug discovery process. Structure-based drug similarities and\nsequence-based target protein similarities are the commonly used information\nfor DTI prediction. Among numerous computational methods, neighborhood-based\nchemogenomic approaches that leverage drug and target similarities to perform\npredictions directly are simple but promising ones. However, existing\nsimilarity-based methods need to be re-trained to predict interactions for any\nnew drugs or targets and cannot directly perform predictions for both new\ndrugs, new targets, and new drug-target pairs. Furthermore, a large amount of\nmissing (undetected) interactions in current DTI datasets hinders most DTI\nprediction methods. To address these issues, we propose a new method denoted as\nWeighted k-Nearest Neighbor with Interaction Recovery (WkNNIR). Not only can\nWkNNIR estimate interactions of any new drugs and/or new targets without any\nneed of re-training, but it can also recover missing interactions (false\nnegatives). In addition, WkNNIR exploits local imbalance to promote the\ninfluence of more reliable similarities on the interaction recovery and\nprediction processes. We also propose a series of ensemble methods that employ\ndiverse sampling strategies and could be coupled with WkNNIR as well as any\nother DTI prediction method to improve performance. Experimental results over\nfive benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in\npredicting drug-target interactions. Lastly, we confirm the practical\nprediction ability of proposed methods to discover reliable interactions that\nwere not reported in the original benchmark datasets.",

          "description": "Newton methods have fallen out of favor for modern optimization problems\n(e.g. deep learning) because of concerns about per-iteration computational\ncomplexity. In this setting highly subsampled first order methods are\npreferred. In this work we motivate the extension of Newton methods to the\nhighly stochastic regime, and argue for the use of the scalable low rank saddle\nfree Newton (LRSFN) method. In this setting, iterative updates are dominated by\nstochastic noise, and stability of the method is key. In stability analysis, we\ndemonstrate that stochastic errors for Newton methods can be greatly amplified\nby ill-conditioned matrix operators. The LRSFN algorithm mitigates this issue\nby the use of Levenberg-Marquardt damping, but generally second order methods\nwith stochastic Hessian and gradient information may need to take small steps,\nunlike in deterministic problems. Numerical results show that even under\nrestrictive step-length conditions, LRSFN can outperform popular first order\nmethods on nontrivial deep learning tasks in terms of generalizability for\nequivalent computational work.",

          "description": "Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) has been widely used to create lower order,\ncomputationally inexpensive representations of higher-order dynamical systems.\nUsing these representations, ROMs can efficiently model flow fields while using\nsignificantly lesser parameters. Conventional ROMs accomplish this by linearly\nprojecting higher-order manifolds to lower-dimensional space using\ndimensionality reduction techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition\n(POD). In this work, we develop a novel deep learning framework DL-ROM (Deep\nLearning - Reduced Order Modelling) to create a neural network capable of\nnon-linear projections to reduced order states. We then use the learned reduced\nstate to efficiently predict future time steps of the simulation using 3D\nAutoencoder and 3D U-Net based architectures. Our model DL-ROM is able to\ncreate highly accurate reconstructions from the learned ROM and is thus able to\nefficiently predict future time steps by temporally traversing in the learned\nreduced state. All of this is achieved without ground truth supervision or\nneeding to iteratively solve the expensive Navier-Stokes(NS) equations thereby\nresulting in massive computational savings. To test the effectiveness and\nperformance of our approach, we evaluate our implementation on five different\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets using reconstruction performance\nand computational runtime metrics. DL-ROM can reduce the computational runtimes\nof iterative solvers by nearly two orders of magnitude while maintaining an\nacceptable error threshold.",

          "description": "Randomized smoothing has recently emerged as an effective tool that enables\ncertification of deep neural network classifiers at scale. All prior art on\nrandomized smoothing has focused on isotropic $\\ell_p$ certification, which has\nthe advantage of yielding certificates that can be easily compared among\nisotropic methods via $\\ell_p$-norm radius. However, isotropic certification\nlimits the region that can be certified around an input to worst-case\nadversaries, \\ie it cannot reason about other \"close\", potentially large,\nconstant prediction safe regions. To alleviate this issue, (i) we theoretically\nextend the isotropic randomized smoothing $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ certificates to\ntheir generalized anisotropic counterparts following a simplified analysis.\nMoreover, (ii) we propose evaluation metrics allowing for the comparison of\ngeneral certificates - a certificate is superior to another if it certifies a\nsuperset region - with the quantification of each certificate through the\nvolume of the certified region. We introduce ANCER, a practical framework for\nobtaining anisotropic certificates for a given test set sample via volume\nmaximization. Our empirical results demonstrate that ANCER achieves\nstate-of-the-art $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ certified accuracy on both CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet at multiple radii, while certifying substantially larger regions in\nterms of volume, thus highlighting the benefits of moving away from isotropic\nanalysis.

Yet standard training methods for deep\nnetworks often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks\nerases knowledge of earlier tasks. While catastrophic forgetting labels the\nproblem, the theoretical reasons for interference between tasks remain unclear.\nHere, we attempt to narrow this gap between theory and practice by studying\ncontinual learning in the teacher-student setup. We extend previous analytical\nwork on two-layer networks in the teacher-student setup to multiple teachers.\nUsing each teacher to represent a different task, we investigate how the\nrelationship between teachers affects the amount of forgetting and transfer\nexhibited by the student when the task switches. In line with recent work, we\nfind that when tasks depend on similar features, intermediate task similarity\nleads to greatest forgetting. However, feature similarity is only one way in\nwhich tasks may be related. The teacher-student approach allows us to\ndisentangle task similarity at the level of readouts (hidden-to-output weights)\nand features (input-to-hidden weights). We find a complex interplay between\nboth types of similarity, initial transfer/forgetting rates, maximum\ntransfer/forgetting, and long-term transfer/forgetting. Together, these results\nhelp illuminate the diverse factors contributing to catastrophic forgetting.",

Further, these agents\nhave been demonstrated to be easily exploitable by adversarial road users\naiming to create collisions. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce\nAdversarial Mixture Density Networks (AMDN), which learns two distributions\nfrom separate datasets. The first is a distribution of safe actions learned\nfrom a dataset of naturalistic human driving. The second is a distribution\nrepresenting unsafe actions likely to lead to collision, learned from a dataset\nof collisions. During training, we leverage these two distributions to provide\nan additional loss based on the similarity of the two distributions. By\npenalising the safe action distribution based on its similarity to the unsafe\naction distribution when training on the collision dataset, a more robust and\nsafe control policy is obtained. We demonstrate the proposed AMDN approach in a\nvehicle following use-case, and evaluate under naturalistic and adversarial\ntesting environments.

The goal of the proxy\nis to allow a general \"downstream\" learner -- with minimal assumptions on their\nprediction task -- to be able to use the proxy to train a model that is fair\nwith respect to the true sensitive features. We show that obeying multiaccuracy\nconstraints with respect to the downstream model class suffices for this\npurpose, and provide sample- and oracle efficient-algorithms and generalization\nbounds for learning such proxies.

Surrogate modelling yields fast and accurate approximations of\ngravitational waves and neural networks have been used in the final step of\ninterpolating the coefficients of the surrogate model for arbitrary waveforms\noutside the training sample. We investigate the existence of underlying\nstructures in the empirical interpolation coefficients using autoencoders. We\ndemonstrate that when the coefficient space is compressed to only two\ndimensions, a spiral structure appears, wherein the spiral angle is linearly\nrelated to the mass ratio. Based on this finding, we design a spiral module\nwith learnable parameters, that is used as the first layer in a neural network,\nwhich learns to map the input space to the coefficients. The spiral module is\nevaluated on multiple neural network architectures and consistently achieves\nbetter speed-accuracy trade-off than baseline models. A thorough experimental\nstudy is conducted and the final result is a surrogate model which can evaluate\nmillions of input parameters in a single forward pass in under 1ms on a desktop\nGPU, while the mismatch between the corresponding generated waveforms and the\nground-truth waveforms is better than the compared baseline methods.

One fundamental question is: what types of compression work\nbetter for a given model? Or even better: can we improve by combining\ncompressions in a suitable way? We formulate this generally as a problem of\noptimizing the loss but where the weights are constrained to equal an additive\ncombination of separately compressed parts; and we give an algorithm to learn\nthe corresponding parts' parameters. Experimentally with deep neural nets, we\nobserve that 1) we can find significantly better models in the\nerror-compression space, indicating that different compression types have\ncomplementary benefits, and 2) the best type of combination depends exquisitely\non the type of neural net. For example, we can compress ResNets and AlexNet\nusing only 1 bit per weight without error degradation at the cost of adding a\nfew floating point weights.

Recent advances in predicting motion\npatterns often rely on machine learning techniques to extrapolate motion\npatterns from observed trajectories, with no mechanism to directly incorporate\nknown rules. We propose a novel framework, which combines probabilistic\nlearning and constrained trajectory optimisation. The learning component of our\nframework provides a distribution over future motion trajectories conditioned\non observed past coordinates. This distribution is then used as a prior to a\nconstrained optimisation problem which enforces chance constraints on the\ntrajectory distribution. This results in constraint-compliant trajectory\ndistributions which closely resemble the prior. In particular, we focus our\ninvestigation on collision constraints, such that extrapolated future\ntrajectory distributions conform to the environment structure. We empirically\ndemonstrate on real-world and simulated datasets the ability of our framework\nto learn complex probabilistic motion trajectories for motion data, while\ndirectly enforcing constraints to improve generalisability, producing more\nrobust and higher quality trajectory distributions.",

          "description": "Multiplex immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry benefit patients by\nallowing cancer pathologists to identify several proteins expressed on the\nsurface of cells, enabling cell classification, better understanding of the\ntumour micro-environment, more accurate diagnoses, prognoses, and tailored\nimmunotherapy based on the immune status of individual patients. However, they\nare expensive and time consuming processes which require complex staining and\nimaging techniques by expert technicians. Hoechst staining is much cheaper and\neasier to perform, but is not typically used in this case as it binds to DNA\nrather than to the proteins targeted by immunofluorescent techniques, and it\nwas not previously thought possible to differentiate cells expressing these\nproteins based only on DNA morphology. In this work we show otherwise, training\na deep convolutional neural network to identify cells expressing three proteins\n(T lymphocyte markers CD3 and CD8, and the B lymphocyte marker CD20) with\ngreater than 90% precision and recall, from Hoechst 33342 stained tissue only.\nOur model learns previously unknown morphological features associated with\nexpression of these proteins which can be used to accurately differentiate\nlymphocyte subtypes for use in key prognostic metrics such as assessment of\nimmune cell infiltration,and thereby predict and improve patient outcomes\nwithout the need for costly multiplex immunofluorescence.",

Upon receiving a test point, each of the classifiers outputs a predicted\nlabel and a confidence in its prediction for this particular test point. In\nthis paper, we address the question of whether we can determine the accuracy of\nthe ensemble. Surprisingly, even when classifiers are combined in the\nstatistically optimal way in this setting, the accuracy of the resulting\nensemble classifier cannot be computed from the accuracies of the individual\nclassifiers-as would be the case in the standard setting of confidence weighted\nmajority voting. We prove tight upper and lower bounds on the ensemble\naccuracy. We explicitly construct the individual classifiers that attain the\nupper and lower bounds: specialists and generalists. Our theoretical results\nhave very practical consequences: (1) If we use ensemble methods and have the\nchoice to construct our individual (independent) classifiers from scratch, then\nwe should aim for specialist classifiers rather than generalists. (2) Our\nbounds can be used to determine how many classifiers are at least required to\nachieve a desired ensemble accuracy.

          "description": "Deep learning practitioners often operate on a computational and monetary\nbudget. Thus, it is critical to design optimization algorithms that perform\nwell under any budget. The linear learning rate schedule is considered the best\nbudget-aware schedule, as it outperforms most other schedules in the low budget\nregime. On the other hand, learning rate schedules -- such as the\n\\texttt{30-60-90} step schedule -- are known to achieve high performance when\nthe model can be trained for many epochs. Yet, it is often not known a priori\nwhether one's budget will be large or small; thus, the optimal choice of\nlearning rate schedule is made on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we frame\nthe learning rate schedule selection problem as a combination of $i)$ selecting\na profile (i.e., the continuous function that models the learning rate\nschedule), and $ii)$ choosing a sampling rate (i.e., how frequently the\nlearning rate is updated/sampled from this profile). We propose a novel profile\nand sampling rate combination called the Reflected Exponential (REX) schedule,\nwhich we evaluate across seven different experimental settings with both SGD\nand Adam optimizers. REX outperforms the linear schedule in the low budget\nregime, while matching or exceeding the performance of several state-of-the-art\nlearning rate schedules (linear, step, exponential, cosine, step decay on\nplateau, and OneCycle) in both high and low budget regimes. Furthermore, REX\nrequires no added computation, storage, or hyperparameters.",

We describe the individual tones via a parametric model,\ntraining a dictionary to capture the relative amplitudes of the harmonics. The\nmodel parameters are predicted via a U-Net, which is a type of deep neural\nnetwork. The network is trained without ground truth information, based on the\ndifference between the model prediction and the individual STFT time frames.\nSince some of the model parameters do not yield a useful backpropagation\ngradient, we model them stochastically and employ the policy gradient instead.\nTo provide phase information and account for inaccuracies in the\ndictionary-based representation, we also let the network output a direct\nprediction, which we then use to resynthesize the audio signals for the\nindividual instruments. Due to the flexibility of the neural network,\ninharmonicity can be incorporated seamlessly and no preprocessing of the input\nspectra is required. Our algorithm yields high-quality separation results with\nparticularly low interference on a variety of different audio samples, both\nacoustic and synthetic, provided that the sample contains enough data for the\ntraining and that the spectral characteristics of the musical instruments are\nsufficiently stable to be approximated by the dictionary.",

          "description": "Learning from data that contain missing values represents a common phenomenon\nin many domains. Relatively few Bayesian Network structure learning algorithms\naccount for missing data, and those that do tend to rely on standard approaches\nthat assume missing data are missing at random, such as the\nExpectation-Maximisation algorithm. Because missing data are often systematic,\nthere is a need for more pragmatic methods that can effectively deal with data\nsets containing missing values not missing at random. The absence of approaches\nthat deal with systematic missing data impedes the application of BN structure\nlearning methods to real-world problems where missingness are not random. This\npaper describes three variants of greedy search structure learning that utilise\npairwise deletion and inverse probability weighting to maximally leverage the\nobserved data and to limit potential bias caused by missing values. The first\ntwo of the variants can be viewed as sub-versions of the third and best\nperforming variant, but are important in their own in illustrating the\nsuccessive improvements in learning accuracy. The empirical investigations show\nthat the proposed approach outperforms the commonly used and state-of-the-art\nStructural EM algorithm, both in terms of learning accuracy and efficiency, as\nwell as both when data are missing at random and not at random.",

          "description": "Localization and tracking of objects using data-driven methods is a popular\ntopic due to the complexity in characterizing the physics of wireless channel\npropagation models. In these modeling approaches, data needs to be gathered to\naccurately train models, at the same time that user's privacy is maintained. An\nappealing scheme to cooperatively achieve these goals is known as Federated\nLearning (FL). A challenge in FL schemes is the presence of non-independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) data, caused by unevenly exploration of\ndifferent areas. In this paper, we consider the use of recent FL schemes to\ntrain a set of personalized models that are then optimally fused through\nBayesian rules, which makes it appropriate in the context of indoor\nlocalization.",

          "description": "We previously established a large lung sound database, HF_Lung_V2 (Lung_V2).\nWe trained convolutional-bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-BiGRU)\nnetworks for detecting inhalation, exhalation, continuous adventitious sound\n(CAS) and discontinuous adventitious sound at the recording level on the basis\nof Lung_V2. However, the performance of CAS detection was poor due to many\nreasons, one of which is the highly diversified CAS patterns. To make the\noriginal CNN-BiGRU model learn the CAS patterns more effectively and not cause\ntoo much computing burden, three strategies involving minimal modifications of\nthe network architecture of the CNN layers were investigated: (1) making the\nCNN layers a bit deeper by using the residual blocks, (2) making the CNN layers\na bit wider by increasing the number of CNN kernels, and (3) separating the\nfeature input into multiple paths (the model was denoted by Multi-path\nCNN-BiGRU). The performance of CAS segment and event detection were evaluated.\nResults showed that improvement in CAS detection was observed among all the\nproposed architecture-modified models. The F1 score for CAS event detection of\nthe proposed models increased from 0.445 to 0.491-0.530, which was deemed\nsignificant. However, the Multi-path CNN-BiGRU model outperformed the other\nmodels in terms of the number of winning titles (five) in total nine evaluation\nmetrics. In addition, the Multi-path CNN-BiGRU model did not cause extra\ncomputing burden (0.97-fold inference time) compared to the original CNN-BiGRU\nmodel. Conclusively, the Multi-path CNN layers can efficiently improve the\neffectiveness of feature extraction and subsequently result in better CAS\ndetection.",

          "description": "Hybrid automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are typically sequentially\ntrained with CTC or LF-MMI criteria.

In this paper, by\ndecoupling the concepts of modeling units and label topologies and building\nproper numerator/denominator graphs accordingly, we establish a generalized\nframework for hybrid acoustic modeling (AM). In this framework, we show that\nLF-MMI is a powerful training criterion applicable to both limited-context and\nfull-context models, for wordpiece/mono-char/bi-char/chenone units, with both\nHMM/CTC topologies. From this framework, we propose three novel training\nschemes: chenone(ch)/wordpiece(wp)-CTC-bMMI, and wordpiece(wp)-HMM-bMMI with\ndifferent advantages in training performance, decoding efficiency and decoding\ntime-stamp accuracy. The advantages of different training schemes are evaluated\ncomprehensively on Librispeech, and wp-CTC-bMMI and ch-CTC-bMMI are evaluated\non two real world ASR tasks to show their effectiveness.

This is intractable for even moderately sized problems. While\nrecent work has addressed this intractability in the low-$D$ setting, the\nhigh-$N$, high-$D$ setting is still unexplored and of great value, particularly\nas machine learning problems increasingly become high dimensional. In this\npaper, we introduce methods to achieve fully scalable Gaussian process\nregression with derivatives using variational inference. Analogous to the use\nof inducing values to sparsify the labels of a training set, we introduce the\nconcept of inducing directional derivatives to sparsify the partial derivative\ninformation of a training set. This enables us to construct a variational\nposterior that incorporates derivative information but whose size depends\nneither on the full dataset size $N$ nor the full dimensionality $D$. We\ndemonstrate the full scalability of our approach on a variety of tasks, ranging\nfrom a high dimensional stellarator fusion regression task to training graph\nconvolutional neural networks on Pubmed using Bayesian optimization.\nSurprisingly, we find that our approach can improve regression performance even\nin settings where only label data is available.",

These functions are known as black-boxes, for example, estimating\nthe generalization error of a machine learning algorithm and computing its\nprediction time in terms of its hyper-parameters. Multi-objective Bayesian\noptimization (MOBO) is a set of methods that has been successfully applied for\nthe simultaneous optimization of black-boxes. Concretely, BO methods rely on a\nprobabilistic model of the objective functions, typically a Gaussian process.\nThis model generates a predictive distribution of the objectives. However, MOBO\nmethods have problems when the number of objectives in a multi-objective\noptimization problem are 3 or more, which is the many objective setting. In\nparticular, the BO process is more costly as more objectives are considered,\ncomputing the quality of the solution via the hyper-volume is also more costly\nand, most importantly, we have to evaluate every objective function, wasting\nexpensive computational, economic or other resources. However, as more\nobjectives are involved in the optimization problem, it is highly probable that\nsome of them are redundant and not add information about the problem solution.\nA measure that represents how similar are GP predictive distributions is\nproposed. We also propose a many objective Bayesian optimization algorithm that\nuses this metric to determine whether two objectives are redundant. The\nalgorithm stops evaluating one of them if the similarity is found, saving\nresources and not hurting the performance of the multi-objective BO algorithm.\nWe show empirical evidence in a set of toy, synthetic, benchmark and real\nexperiments that GPs predictive distributions of the effectiveness of the\nmetric and the algorithm.",

This is 2x-2.5x faster than our closest competitor.\nBoth optimizations represent the final evolutionary stages of years of\niteration on STDP and spike delivery inside \"Spice\" (/spaIk/), our state of the\nart SNN simulator.

          "description": "A key challenge for modern Bayesian statistics is how to perform scalable\ninference of posterior distributions. To address this challenge, variational\nBayes (VB) methods have emerged as a popular alternative to the classical\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. VB methods tend to be faster while\nachieving comparable predictive performance. However, there are few theoretical\nresults around VB. In this paper, we establish frequentist consistency and\nasymptotic normality of VB methods. Specifically, we connect VB methods to\npoint estimates based on variational approximations, called frequentist\nvariational approximations, and we use the connection to prove a variational\nBernstein-von Mises theorem. The theorem leverages the theoretical\ncharacterizations of frequentist variational approximations to understand\nasymptotic properties of VB. In summary, we prove that (1) the VB posterior\nconverges to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimizer of a normal distribution,\ncentered at the truth and (2) the corresponding variational expectation of the\nparameter is consistent and asymptotically normal. As applications of the\ntheorem, we derive asymptotic properties of VB posteriors in Bayesian mixture\nmodels, Bayesian generalized linear mixed models, and Bayesian stochastic block\nmodels. We conduct a simulation study to illustrate these theoretical results.",

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables cross-domain learning without\ntarget domain labels by transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain\nwhose distribution differs from the target. However, UDA is not always\nsuccessful and several accounts of \"negative transfer\" have been reported in\nthe literature. In this work, we prove a simple lower bound on the target\ndomain error that complements the existing upper bound. Our bound shows the\ninsufficiency of minimizing source domain error and marginal distribution\nmismatch for a guaranteed reduction in the target domain error, due to the\npossible increase of induced labeling function mismatch. This insufficiency is\nfurther illustrated through simple distributions for which the same UDA\napproach succeeds, fails, and may succeed or fail with an equal chance.\nMotivated from this, we propose novel data poisoning attacks to fool UDA\nmethods into learning representations that produce large target domain errors.\nWe evaluate the effect of these attacks on popular UDA methods using benchmark\ndatasets where they have been previously shown to be successful. Our results\nshow that poisoning can significantly decrease the target domain accuracy,\ndropping it to almost 0\\% in some cases, with the addition of only 10\\%\npoisoned data in the source domain. The failure of UDA methods demonstrates the\nlimitations of UDA at guaranteeing cross-domain generalization consistent with\nthe lower bound.

          "description": "Complex sensors like video cameras include tens of configurable parameters,\nwhich can be set by end-users to customize the sensors to specific application\nscenarios. Although parameter settings significantly affect the quality of the\nsensor output and the accuracy of insights derived from sensor data, most\nend-users use a fixed parameter setting because they lack the skill or\nunderstanding to appropriately configure these parameters. We propose CamTuner,\nwhich is a system to automatically, and dynamically adapt the complex sensor to\nchanging environments. CamTuner includes two key components. First, a bespoke\nanalytics quality estimator, which is a deep-learning model to automatically\nand continuously estimate the quality of insights from an analytics unit as the\nenvironment around a sensor change. Second, a reinforcement learning (RL)\nmodule, which reacts to the changes in quality, and automatically adjusts the\ncamera parameters to enhance the accuracy of insights. We improve the training\ntime of the RL module by an order of magnitude by designing virtual models to\nmimic essential behavior of the camera: we design virtual knobs that can be set\nto different values to mimic the effects of assigning different values to the\ncamera's configurable parameters, and we design a virtual camera model that\nmimics the output from a video camera at different times of the day. These\nvirtual models significantly accelerate training because (a) frame rates from a\nreal camera are limited to 25-30 fps while the virtual models enable processing\nat 300 fps, (b) we do not have to wait until the real camera sees different\nenvironments, which could take weeks or months, and (c) virtual knobs can be\nupdated instantly, while it can take 200-500 ms to change the camera parameter\nsettings. Our dynamic tuning approach results in up to 12% improvement in the\naccuracy of insights from several video analytics tasks.",

While\nlearning-based locomotion has made great advances using RL, most methods still\nrely on domain randomization for training blind agents that generalize to\nchallenging terrains. Our key insight is that proprioceptive states only offer\ncontact measurements for immediate reaction, whereas an agent equipped with\nvisual sensory observations can learn to proactively maneuver environments with\nobstacles and uneven terrain by anticipating changes in the environment many\nsteps ahead.

          "description": "Deep learning models can enable accurate and efficient disease diagnosis, but\nhave thus far been hampered by the data scarcity present in the medical world.\nAutomated diagnosis studies have been constrained by underpowered single-center\ndatasets, and although some results have shown promise, their generalizability\nto other institutions remains questionable as the data heterogeneity between\ninstitutions is not taken into account. By allowing models to be trained in a\ndistributed manner that preserves patients' privacy, federated learning\npromises to alleviate these issues, by enabling diligent multi-center studies.\nWe present the first federated learning study on the modality of cardiovascular\nmagnetic resonance (CMR) and use four centers derived from subsets of the M\\&M\nand ACDC datasets, focusing on the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n(HCM). We adapt a 3D-CNN network pretrained on action recognition and explore\ntwo different ways of incorporating shape prior information to the model, and\nfour different data augmentation set-ups, systematically analyzing their impact\non the different collaborative learning choices. We show that despite the small\nsize of data (180 subjects derived from four centers), the privacy preserving\nfederated learning achieves promising results that are competitive with\ntraditional centralized learning.

Research\narticles linked to PHM XAI, in English language, from 2015 to 2021 are selected\nfrom IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library and Scopus\ndatabases using PRISMA guidelines. Data was extracted from 35 selected articles\nand examined using MS. Excel. Several findings were synthesized. Firstly, while\nthe discipline is still young, the analysis indicates the growing acceptance of\nXAI in PHM domain. Secondly, XAI functions as a double edge sword, where it is\nassimilated as a tool to execute PHM tasks as well as a mean of explanation, in\nparticular in diagnostic and anomaly detection. There is thus a need for XAI in\nPHM. Thirdly, the review shows that PHM XAI papers produce either good or\nexcellent results in general, suggesting that PHM performance is unaffected by\nXAI. Fourthly, human role, explainability metrics and uncertainty management\nare areas requiring further attention by the PHM community. Adequate\nexplainability metrics to cater for PHM need are urgently needed. Finally, most\ncase study featured on the accepted articles are based on real, indicating that\navailable AI and XAI approaches are equipped to solve complex real-world\nchallenges, increasing the confidence of AI model adoption in the industry.\nThis work is funded by the Universiti Teknologi Petronas Foundation.",

          "description": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is quickly becoming the customary means for\nidentification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to its ability to obtain\nhigh resolution information about the genes and mechanisms that are causing\nresistance and driving pathogen mobility. By contrast, traditional phenotypic\n(antibiogram) testing cannot easily elucidate such information. Yet development\nof AMR prediction tools from genotype-phenotype data can be biased, since\nsampling is non-randomized. Sample provenience, period of collection, and\nspecies representation can confound the association of genetic traits with AMR.\nThus, prediction models can perform poorly on new data with sampling\ndistribution shifts. In this work -- under an explicit set of causal\nassumptions -- we evaluate the effectiveness of propensity-based rebalancing\nand confounding adjustment on AMR prediction using genotype-phenotype AMR data\nfrom the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC). We select bacterial\ngenotypes (encoded as k-mer signatures, i.e. DNA fragments of length k),\ncountry, year, species, and AMR phenotypes for the tetracycline drug class,\npreparing test data with recent genomes coming from a single country. We test\nboosted logistic regression (BLR) and random forests (RF) with/without\nbias-handling. On 10,936 instances, we find evidence of species, location and\nyear imbalance with respect to the AMR phenotype. The crude versus\nbias-adjusted change in effect of genetic signatures on AMR varies but only\nmoderately (selecting the top 20,000 out of 40+ million k-mers). The area under\nthe receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of the RF (0.95) is comparable to\nthat of BLR (0.94) on both out-of-bag samples from bootstrap and the external\ntest (n=1,085), where AUROCs do not decrease. We observe a 1%-5% gain in AUROC\nwith bias-handling compared to the sole use of genetic signatures. ...",

One novel aspect it allows is to infer hidden states through the\nimposition of constraints designed to achieve specific objectives, as\nillustrated through three examples: (1) the generation of adversarial-attack\nexamples, (2) the usage of a neural network as a black-box optimization method,\nand (3) the application of inference on continuous-action reinforcement\nlearning.

          "description": "To safely navigate unknown environments, robots must accurately perceive\ndynamic obstacles. Instead of directly measuring the scene depth with a LiDAR\nsensor, we explore the use of a much cheaper and higher resolution sensor:\nprogrammable light curtains. Light curtains are controllable depth sensors that\nsense only along a surface that a user selects. We use light curtains to\nestimate the safety envelope of a scene: a hypothetical surface that separates\nthe robot from all obstacles. We show that generating light curtains that sense\nrandom locations (from a particular distribution) can quickly discover the\nsafety envelope for scenes with unknown objects. Importantly, we produce\ntheoretical safety guarantees on the probability of detecting an obstacle using\nrandom curtains. We combine random curtains with a machine learning based model\nthat forecasts and tracks the motion of the safety envelope efficiently. Our\nmethod accurately estimates safety envelopes while providing probabilistic\nsafety guarantees that can be used to certify the efficacy of a robot\nperception system to detect and avoid dynamic obstacles. We evaluate our\napproach in a simulated urban driving environment and a real-world environment\nwith moving pedestrians using a light curtain device and show that we can\nestimate safety envelopes efficiently and effectively.

          "description": "Energy production using renewable sources exhibits inherent uncertainties due\nto their intermittent nature.

This\npaper presents a new dataset for solar and wind energy generation forecast in\nGreece and introduces a feature engineering pipeline that enriches the\ndimensional space of the dataset. In addition, we propose a novel method that\nutilizes the innovative Prophet model, an end-to-end forecasting tool that\nconsiders several kinds of nonlinear trends in decomposing the energy time\nseries before a tree-based ensemble provides short-term predictions. The\nperformance of the system is measured through representative evaluation\nmetrics, and by estimating the model's generalization under an industryprovided\nscheme of absolute error thresholds.

          "description": "The needs for precisely estimating a student's academic performance have been\nemphasized with an increasing amount of attention paid to Intelligent Tutoring\nSystem (ITS). However, since labels for academic performance, such as test\nscores, are collected from outside of ITS, obtaining the labels is costly,\nleading to label-scarcity problem which brings challenge in taking machine\nlearning approaches for academic performance prediction. To this end, inspired\nby the recent advancement of pre-training method in natural language processing\ncommunity, we propose DPA, a transfer learning framework with Discriminative\nPre-training tasks for Academic performance prediction. DPA pre-trains two\nmodels, a generator and a discriminator, and fine-tunes the discriminator on\nacademic performance prediction. In DPA's pre-training phase, a sequence of\ninteractions where some tokens are masked is provided to the generator which is\ntrained to reconstruct the original sequence. Then, the discriminator takes an\ninteraction sequence where the masked tokens are replaced by the generator's\noutputs, and is trained to predict the originalities of all tokens in the\nsequence. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art generative pre-training\nmethod, DPA is more sample efficient, leading to fast convergence to lower\nacademic performance prediction error. We conduct extensive experimental\nstudies on a real-world dataset obtained from a multi-platform ITS application\nand show that DPA outperforms the previous state-of-the-art generative\npre-training method with a reduction of 4.05% in mean absolute error and more\nrobust to increased label-scarcity.",

In\nthis paper, we describe a case-based reasoning approach to predicting stock\nmarket returns using only historical pricing data. We argue that one of the\nimpediments for case-based stock prediction has been the lack of a suitable\nsimilarity metric when it comes to identifying similar pricing histories as the\nbasis for a future prediction -- traditional Euclidean and correlation based\napproaches are not effective for a variety of reasons -- and in this regard, a\nkey contribution of this work is the development of a novel similarity metric\nfor comparing historical pricing data. We demonstrate the benefits of this\nmetric and the case-based approach in a real-world application in comparison to\na variety of conventional benchmarks.",

          "description": "There is a proliferation in the number of satellites launched each year,\nresulting in downlinking of terabytes of data each day. The data received by\nground stations is often unprocessed, making this an expensive process\nconsidering the large data sizes and that not all of the data is useful. This,\ncoupled with the increasing demand for real-time data processing, has led to a\ngrowing need for on-orbit processing solutions. In this work, we investigate\nthe performance of CNN-based object detectors on constrained devices by\napplying different image compression techniques to satellite data. We examine\nthe capabilities of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier;\nlow-power, high-performance computers, with integrated GPUs, small enough to\nfit on-board a nanosatellite. We take a closer look at object detection\nnetworks, including the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Region-based\nFully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) models that are pre-trained on DOTA - a\nLarge Scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images. The performance is\nmeasured in terms of execution time, memory consumption, and accuracy, and are\ncompared against a baseline containing a server with two powerful GPUs. The\nresults show that by applying image compression techniques, we are able to\nimprove the execution time and memory consumption, achieving a fully runnable\ndataset. A lossless compression technique achieves roughly a 10% reduction in\nexecution time and about a 3% reduction in memory consumption, with no impact\non the accuracy. While a lossy compression technique improves the execution\ntime by up to 144% and the memory consumption is reduced by as much as 97%.\nHowever, it has a significant impact on accuracy, varying depending on the\ncompression ratio. Thus the application and ratio of these compression\ntechniques may differ depending on the required level of accuracy for a\nparticular task.",

          "description": "Point clouds and RGB images are naturally complementary modalities for 3D\nvisual understanding - the former provides sparse but accurate locations of\npoints on objects, while the latter contains dense color and texture\ninformation. Despite this potential for close sensor fusion, many methods train\ntwo models in isolation and use simple feature concatenation to represent 3D\nsensor data. This separated training scheme results in potentially sub-optimal\nperformance and prevents 3D tasks from being used to benefit 2D tasks that are\noften useful on their own. To provide a more integrated approach, we propose a\nnovel Multi-Modality Task Cascade network (MTC-RCNN) that leverages 3D box\nproposals to improve 2D segmentation predictions, which are then used to\nfurther refine the 3D boxes. We show that including a 2D network between two\nstages of 3D modules significantly improves both 2D and 3D task performance.\nMoreover, to prevent the 3D module from over-relying on the overfitted 2D\npredictions, we propose a dual-head 2D segmentation training and inference\nscheme, allowing the 2nd 3D module to learn to interpret imperfect 2D\nsegmentation predictions.

Classical clustering techniques such as K-means, Gaussian mixture\nmodel and spectral clustering are central to many data-driven applications.\nHowever, recently unsupervised simultaneous feature learning and clustering\nusing neural networks also known as Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) has gained\nprominence. Pioneering works on deep feature clustering focus on defining\nrelevant clustering loss function and choosing the right neural network for\nextracting features. A central problem in all these cases is data sparsity\naccompanied by high intra-class and low inter-class variance, which\nsubsequently leads to poor clustering performance and erroneous candidate\nassignments. Towards this, we employ data augmentation techniques to improve\nthe density of the clusters, thus improving the overall performance. We train a\nvariant of Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) with augmented data to construct the\ninitial feature space as a novel model for deep clustering.

While autoregressive models are natural candidates for\ntime series imputation, score-based diffusion models have recently outperformed\nexisting counterparts including autoregressive models in many tasks such as\nimage generation and audio synthesis, and would be promising for time series\nimputation.

In addition,\ndeterministic imputation by CSDI reduces the error by 5-20% compared to the\nstate-of-the-art deterministic imputation methods.

Such behaviour can be caused by networks overfitting\neasy-to-learn, or statistically dominant, features while disregarding other\npotentially informative features. For example, indistinguishable differences in\nthe sharpness of the images from two different scanners can degrade the\nperformance of the network significantly. All neural networks intended for\nclinical practice need to be robust to variation in data caused by differences\nin imaging equipment, sample preparation and patient populations.\n\nTo address these challenges, we evaluate the utility of spectral decoupling\nas an implicit bias mitigation method. Spectral decoupling encourages the\nneural network to learn more features by simply regularising the networks'\nunnormalised prediction scores with an L2 penalty, thus having no added\ncomputational costs.\n\nWe show that spectral decoupling allows training neural networks on datasets\nwith strong spurious correlations. Networks trained without spectral decoupling\ndo not learn the original task and appear to make false predictions based on\nthe spurious correlations. Spectral decoupling also increases networks'\nrobustness for data distribution shifts. To validate our findings, we train\nnetworks with and without spectral decoupling to detect prostate cancer tissue\nslides and COVID-19 in chest radiographs. Networks trained with spectral\ndecoupling achieve substantially higher performance on all evaluation datasets.\n\nOur results show that spectral decoupling helps with generalisation issues\nassociated with neural networks.

A growing body of work has been exploring ways to\nenforce energy conservation in the learned dynamics by encoding Lagrangian or\nHamiltonian dynamics into the neural network architecture. These existing\napproaches are based on differential equations, which do not allow\ndiscontinuity in the states and thereby limit the class of systems one can\nlearn. However, in reality, most physical systems, such as legged robots and\nrobotic manipulators, involve contacts and collisions, which introduce\ndiscontinuities in the states. In this paper, we introduce a differentiable\ncontact model, which can capture contact mechanics: frictionless/frictional, as\nwell as elastic/inelastic. This model can also accommodate inequality\nconstraints, such as limits on the joint angles. The proposed contact model\nextends the scope of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian neural networks by allowing\nsimultaneous learning of contact and system properties. We demonstrate this\nframework on a series of challenging 2D and 3D physical systems with different\ncoefficients of restitution and friction.

          "description": "With the growing awareness to fairness in machine learning and the\nrealization of the central role that data representation has in data processing\ntasks, there is an obvious interest in notions of fair data representations.\nThe goal of such representations is that a model trained on data under the\nrepresentation (e.g., a classifier) will be guaranteed to respect some fairness\nconstraints.\n\nSuch representations are useful when they can be fixed for training models on\nvarious different tasks and also when they serve as data filtering between the\nraw data (known to the representation designer) and potentially malicious\nagents that use the data under the representation to learn predictive models\nand make decisions.\n\nA long list of recent research papers strive to provide tools for achieving\nthese goals.\n\nHowever, we prove that this is basically a futile effort. Roughly stated, we\nprove that no representation can guarantee the fairness of classifiers for\ndifferent tasks trained using it; even the basic goal of achieving\nlabel-independent Demographic Parity fairness fails once the marginal data\ndistribution shifts. More refined notions of fairness, like Odds Equality,\ncannot be guaranteed by a representation that does not take into account the\ntask specific labeling rule with respect to which such fairness will be\nevaluated (even if the marginal data distribution is known a priory).\nFurthermore, except for trivial cases, no representation can guarantee Odds\nEquality fairness for any two different tasks, while allowing accurate label\npredictions for both.\n\nWhile some of our conclusions are intuitive, we formulate (and prove) crisp\nstatements of such impossibilities, often contrasting impressions conveyed by\nmany recent works on fair representations.",

          "description": "Sum-of-norms clustering is a clustering formulation based on convex\noptimization that automatically induces hierarchy. Multiple algorithms have\nbeen proposed to solve the optimization problem: subgradient descent by Hocking\net al., ADMM and ADA by Chi and Lange, stochastic incremental algorithm by\nPanahi et al. and semismooth Newton-CG augmented Lagrangian method by Sun et\nal. All algorithms yield approximate solutions, even though an exact solution\nis demanded to determine the correct cluster assignment. The purpose of this\npaper is to close the gap between the output from existing algorithms and the\nexact solution to the optimization problem. We present a clustering test that\nidentifies and certifies the correct cluster assignment from an approximate\nsolution yielded by any primal-dual algorithm. Our certification validates\nclustering for both unit and multiplicative weights. The test may not succeed\nif the approximation is inaccurate. However, we show the correct cluster\nassignment is guaranteed to be certified by a primal-dual path following\nalgorithm after sufficiently many iterations, provided that the model parameter\n$\\lambda$ avoids a finite number of bad values. Numerical experiments are\nconducted on Gaussian mixture and half-moon data, which indicate that carefully\nchosen multiplicative weights increase the recovery power of sum-of-norms\nclustering.",

          "description": "In recent years, many incidents have been reported where machine learning\nmodels exhibited discrimination among people based on race, sex, age, etc.\nResearch has been conducted to measure and mitigate unfairness in machine\nlearning models. For a machine learning task, it is a common practice to build\na pipeline that includes an ordered set of data preprocessing stages followed\nby a classifier. However, most of the research on fairness has considered a\nsingle classifier based prediction task. What are the fairness impacts of the\npreprocessing stages in machine learning pipeline? Furthermore, studies showed\nthat often the root cause of unfairness is ingrained in the data itself, rather\nthan the model. But no research has been conducted to measure the unfairness\ncaused by a specific transformation made in the data preprocessing stage. In\nthis paper, we introduced the causal method of fairness to reason about the\nfairness impact of data preprocessing stages in ML pipeline. We leveraged\nexisting metrics to define the fairness measures of the stages. Then we\nconducted a detailed fairness evaluation of the preprocessing stages in 37\npipelines collected from three different sources. Our results show that certain\ndata transformers are causing the model to exhibit unfairness. We identified a\nnumber of fairness patterns in several categories of data transformers.\nFinally, we showed how the local fairness of a preprocessing stage composes in\nthe global fairness of the pipeline. We used the fairness composition to choose\nappropriate downstream transformer that mitigates unfairness in the machine\nlearning pipeline.",

          "description": "Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been increasingly applied to problems\nfrom several different areas. Despite their growing popularity, their\npredictive performance is usually affected by the values assigned to their\nhyperparameters (HPs). As consequence, researchers and practitioners face the\nchallenge of how to set these values. Many users have limited knowledge about\nML algorithms and the effect of their HP values and, therefore, do not take\nadvantage of suitable settings. They usually define the HP values by trial and\nerror, which is very subjective, not guaranteed to find good values and\ndependent on the user experience. Tuning techniques search for HP values able\nto maximize the predictive performance of induced models for a given dataset,\nbut have the drawback of a high computational cost. Thus, practitioners use\ndefault values suggested by the algorithm developer or by tools implementing\nthe algorithm. Although default values usually result in models with acceptable\npredictive performance, different implementations of the same algorithm can\nsuggest distinct default values. To maintain a balance between tuning and using\ndefault values, we propose a strategy to generate new optimized default values.\nOur approach is grounded on a small set of optimized values able to obtain\npredictive performance values better than default settings provided by popular\ntools. After performing a large experiment and a careful analysis of the\nresults, we concluded that our approach delivers better default values.\nBesides, it leads to competitive solutions when compared to tuned values,\nmaking it easier to use and having a lower cost. We also extracted simple rules\nto guide practitioners in deciding whether to use our new methodology or a HP\ntuning approach.",

          "description": "The high computation, memory, and power budgets of inferring convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) are major bottlenecks of model deployment to edge\ncomputing platforms, e.g., mobile devices and IoT. Moreover, training CNNs is\ntime and energy-intensive even on high-grade servers. Convolution layers and\nfully connected layers, because of their intense use of multiplications, are\nthe dominant contributor to this computation budget.\n\nWe propose to alleviate this problem by introducing two new operations:\nconvolutional shifts and fully-connected shifts which replace multiplications\nwith bitwise shift and sign flipping during both training and inference. During\ninference, both approaches require only 5 bits (or less) to represent the\nweights. This family of neural network architectures (that use convolutional\nshifts and fully connected shifts) is referred to as DeepShift models. We\npropose two methods to train DeepShift models: DeepShift-Q which trains regular\nweights constrained to powers of 2, and DeepShift-PS that trains the values of\nthe shifts and sign flips directly.\n\nVery close accuracy, and in some cases higher accuracy, to baselines are\nachieved. Converting pre-trained 32-bit floating-point baseline models of\nResNet18, ResNet50, VGG16, and GoogleNet to DeepShift and training them for 15\nto 30 epochs, resulted in Top-1/Top-5 accuracies higher than that of the\noriginal model.\n\nLast but not least, we implemented the convolutional shifts and fully\nconnected shift GPU kernels and showed a reduction in latency time of 25% when\ninferring ResNet18 compared to unoptimized multiplication-based GPU kernels.\nThe code can be found at https://github.com/mostafaelhoushi/DeepShift.",

For reinforcement learning (RL), curricula are especially\ninteresting, as the underlying optimization has a strong tendency to get stuck\nin local optima due to the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Recently, a\nnumber of approaches for an automatic generation of curricula for RL have been\nshown to increase performance while requiring less expert knowledge compared to\nmanually designed curricula. However, these approaches are seldomly\ninvestigated from a theoretical perspective, preventing a deeper understanding\nof their mechanics. In this paper, we present an approach for automated\ncurriculum generation in RL with a clear theoretical underpinning. More\nprecisely, we formalize the well-known self-paced learning paradigm as inducing\na distribution over training tasks, which trades off between task complexity\nand the objective to match a desired task distribution.

          "description": "A major goal of materials design is to find material structures with desired\nproperties and in a second step to find a processing path to reach one of these\nstructures. In this paper, we propose and investigate a deep reinforcement\nlearning approach for the optimization of processing paths. The goal is to find\noptimal processing paths in the material structure space that lead to\ntarget-structures, which have been identified beforehand to result in desired\nmaterial properties. There exists a target set containing one or multiple\ndifferent structures. Our proposed methods can find an optimal path from a\nstart structure to a single target structure, or optimize the processing paths\nto one of the equivalent target-structures in the set. In the latter case, the\nalgorithm learns during processing to simultaneously identify the best\nreachable target structure and the optimal path to it. The proposed methods\nbelong to the family of model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms. They\nare guided by structure representations as features of the process state and by\na reward signal, which is formulated based on a distance function in the\nstructure space. Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms learn through\ntrial and error while interacting with the process. Thereby, they are not\nrestricted to information from a priori sampled processing data and are able to\nadapt to the specific process. The optimization itself is model-free and does\nnot require any prior knowledge about the process itself. We instantiate and\nevaluate the proposed methods by optimizing paths of a generic metal forming\nprocess. We show the ability of both methods to find processing paths leading\nclose to target structures and the ability of the extended method to identify\ntarget-structures that can be reached effectively and efficiently and to focus\non these targets for sample efficient processing path optimization.",

          "description": "Inspired by BatchNorm, there has been an explosion of normalization layers\nfor deep neural networks (DNNs). However, these alternative normalization\nlayers have seen minimal use, partially due to a lack of guiding principles\nthat can help identify when these layers can serve as a replacement for\nBatchNorm. To address this problem, we take a theoretical approach,\ngeneralizing the known beneficial mechanisms of BatchNorm to several recently\nproposed normalization techniques. Our generalized theory leads to the\nfollowing set of principles: (i) similar to BatchNorm, activations-based\nnormalization layers can prevent exponential growth of activations in ResNets,\nbut parametric layers require explicit remedies; (ii) use of GroupNorm can\nensure informative forward propagation, with different samples being assigned\ndissimilar activations, but increasing group size results in increasingly\nindistinguishable activations for different samples, explaining slow\nconvergence speed in models with LayerNorm; (iii) small group sizes result in\nlarge gradient norm in earlier layers, hence explaining training instability\nissues in Instance Normalization and illustrating a speed-stability tradeoff in\nGroupNorm. Overall, our analysis reveals a unified set of mechanisms that\nunderpin the success of normalization methods in deep learning, providing us\nwith a compass to systematically explore the vast design space of DNN\nnormalization layers.",

          "description": "Adversarial robustness of deep neural networks has been actively\ninvestigated. However, most existing defense approaches are limited to a\nspecific type of adversarial perturbations. Specifically, they often fail to\noffer resistance to multiple attack types simultaneously, i.e., they lack\nmulti-perturbation robustness. Furthermore, compared to image recognition\nproblems, the adversarial robustness of video recognition models is relatively\nunexplored. While several studies have proposed how to generate adversarial\nvideos, only a handful of approaches about the defense strategies have been\npublished in the literature. In this paper, we propose one of the first defense\nstrategies against multiple types of adversarial videos for video recognition.\nThe proposed method, referred to as MultiBN, performs adversarial training on\nmultiple adversarial video types using multiple independent batch normalization\n(BN) layers with a learning-based BN selection module. With a multiple BN\nstructure, each BN brach is responsible for learning the distribution of a\nsingle perturbation type and thus provides more precise distribution\nestimations. This mechanism benefits dealing with multiple perturbation types.\nThe BN selection module detects the attack type of an input video and sends it\nto the corresponding BN branch, making MultiBN fully automatic and allow\nend-to-end training. Compared to present adversarial training approaches, the\nproposed MultiBN exhibits stronger multi-perturbation robustness against\ndifferent and even unforeseen adversarial video types, ranging from Lp-bounded\nattacks and physically realizable attacks. This holds true on different\ndatasets and target models. Moreover, we conduct an extensive analysis to study\nthe properties of the multiple BN structure.",

          "description": "Probabilistic finite mixture models are widely used for unsupervised\nclustering. These models can often be improved by adapting them to the topology\nof the data. For instance, in order to classify spatially adjacent data points\nsimilarly, it is common to introduce a Laplacian constraint on the posterior\nprobability that each data point belongs to a class. Alternatively, the mixing\nprobabilities can be treated as free parameters, while assuming Gauss-Markov or\nmore complex priors to regularize those mixing probabilities. However, these\napproaches are constrained by the shape of the prior and often lead to\ncomplicated or intractable inference. Here, we propose a new parametrization of\nthe Dirichlet distribution to flexibly regularize the mixing probabilities of\nover-parametrized mixture distributions. Using the Expectation-Maximization\nalgorithm, we show that our approach allows us to define any linear update rule\nfor the mixing probabilities, including spatial smoothing regularization as a\nspecial case. We then show that this flexible design can be extended to share\nclass information between multiple mixture models. We apply our algorithm to\nartificial and natural image segmentation tasks, and we provide quantitative\nand qualitative comparison of the performance of Gaussian and Student-t\nmixtures on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. We also demonstrate how to\npropagate class information across the layers of deep convolutional neural\nnetworks in a probabilistically optimal way, suggesting a new interpretation\nfor feedback signals in biological visual systems.

          "description": "This paper presents a new insight into improving the performance of\nStochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) by using Isolation kernel instead of\nGaussian kernel. Isolation kernel outperforms Gaussian kernel in two aspects.\nFirst, the use of Isolation kernel in t-SNE overcomes the drawback of\nmisrepresenting some structures in the data, which often occurs when Gaussian\nkernel is applied in t-SNE. This is because Gaussian kernel determines each\nlocal bandwidth based on one local point only, while Isolation kernel is\nderived directly from the data based on space partitioning. Second, the use of\nIsolation kernel yields a more efficient similarity computation because\ndata-dependent Isolation kernel has only one parameter that needs to be tuned.\nIn contrast, the use of data-independent Gaussian kernel increases the\ncomputational cost by determining n bandwidths for a dataset of n points. As\nthe root cause of these deficiencies in t-SNE is Gaussian kernel, we show that\nsimply replacing Gaussian kernel with Isolation kernel in t-SNE significantly\nimproves the quality of the final visualisation output (without creating\nmisrepresented structures) and removes one key obstacle that prevents t-SNE\nfrom processing large datasets. Moreover, Isolation kernel enables t-SNE to\ndeal with large-scale datasets in less runtime without trading off accuracy,\nunlike existing methods in speeding up t-SNE.",

We\ntake the first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based\ntechnique to automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual\nbasis. The method is implemented by generating an image of the street network\n(Colored Road Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and\nclassifying it using a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model\nachieves an overall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the\nworld are selected as the study areas with their road networks acquired from\nOpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through\nclustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent\npart of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: we apply\nour method in a case study of urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based\nregression model (LightGBM) is for the first time designated to establish the\nrelationship between morphological indices and vitality indicators.

We\naddress these deficiencies with M&Ms-VAE, a novel variational autoencoder for\nrecommendation and explanation that is based on multimodal modeling\nassumptions. We train the model under a weak supervision scheme to simulate\nboth fully and partially observed variables. Then, we leverage the\ngeneralization ability of a trained M&Ms-VAE model to embed the user preference\nand the critique separately. Our work's most important innovation is our\ncritiquing module, which is built upon and trained in a self-supervised manner\nwith a simple ranking objective. Experiments on four real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that among state-of-the-art models, our system is the first to\ndominate or match the performance in terms of recommendation, explanation, and\nmulti-step critiquing. Moreover, M&Ms-VAE processes the critiques up to 25.6x\nfaster than the best baselines. Finally, we show that our model infers coherent\njoint and cross generation, even under weak supervision, thanks to our\nmultimodal-based modeling and training scheme.",

          "description": "Effective molecular representation learning is of great importance to\nfacilitate molecular property prediction, which is a fundamental task for the\ndrug and material industry. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs)\nhave shown great promise in applying GNNs for molecular representation\nlearning. Moreover, a few recent studies have also demonstrated successful\napplications of self-supervised learning methods to pre-train the GNNs to\novercome the problem of insufficient labeled molecules. However, existing GNNs\nand pre-training strategies usually treat molecules as topological graph data\nwithout fully utilizing the molecular geometry information. Whereas, the\nthree-dimensional (3D) spatial structure of a molecule, a.k.a molecular\ngeometry, is one of the most critical factors for determining molecular\nphysical, chemical, and biological properties. To this end, we propose a novel\nGeometry Enhanced Molecular representation learning method (GEM) for Chemical\nRepresentation Learning (ChemRL). At first, we design a geometry-based GNN\narchitecture that simultaneously models atoms, bonds, and bond angles in a\nmolecule. To be specific, we devised double graphs for a molecule: The first\none encodes the atom-bond relations; The second one encodes bond-angle\nrelations. Moreover, on top of the devised GNN architecture, we propose several\nnovel geometry-level self-supervised learning strategies to learn spatial\nknowledge by utilizing the local and global molecular 3D structures. We compare\nChemRL-GEM with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on different\nmolecular benchmarks and exhibit that ChemRL-GEM can significantly outperform\nall baselines in both regression and classification tasks. For example, the\nexperimental results show an overall improvement of 8.8% on average compared to\nSOTA baselines on the regression tasks, demonstrating the superiority of the\nproposed method.",

By using both the stochastic\nLyapunov function and martingale estimation methods, we establish the strong\nconsistency of the estimation algorithm and provide the convergence rate, under\na signal condition which is considerably weaker than the traditional PE\ncondition and coincides with the weakest possible excitation known for the\nclassical least square algorithm of stochastic regression models.

          "description": "Meta-reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to train policies that quickly\nadapt to new tasks with orders of magnitude less data than standard RL, but\nthis fast adaptation often comes at the cost of greatly increasing the amount\nof reward supervision during meta-training time. Offline meta-RL removes the\nneed to continuously provide reward supervision because rewards must only be\nprovided once when the offline dataset is generated. In addition to the\nchallenges of offline RL, a unique distribution shift is present in meta RL:\nagents learn exploration strategies that can gather the experience needed to\nlearn a new task, and also learn adaptation strategies that work well when\npresented with the trajectories in the dataset, but the adaptation strategies\nare not adapted to the data distribution that the learned exploration\nstrategies collect. Unlike the online setting, the adaptation and exploration\nstrategies cannot effectively adapt to each other, resulting in poor\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid offline meta-RL algorithm,\nwhich uses offline data with rewards to meta-train an adaptive policy, and then\ncollects additional unsupervised online data, without any ground truth reward\nlabels, to bridge this distribution shift problem. Our method uses the offline\ndata to learn the distribution of reward functions, which is then sampled to\nself-supervise reward labels for the additional online data. By removing the\nneed to provide reward labels for the online experience, our approach can be\nmore practical to use in settings where reward supervision would otherwise be\nprovided manually. We compare our method to prior work on offline meta-RL on\nsimulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks and find that using\nadditional data and self-generated rewards significantly improves an agent's\nability to generalize.",

There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize\nfeature contributions, but their interpretability is limited to specific\npredictions made by black-box models.

In\nthe first scenario, local models are trained at the IoT devices and the F-APs\nupload the local model parameters to the CS. In the second scenario, local\nmodels are trained at the F-APs based on the collected data from the IoT\ndevices and the F-APs collaborate with the CS for updating the model\nparameters. Our objective is to minimize the overall energy-consumption of both\nscenarios subject to FL time constraint. Towards this goal, we devise a joint\noptimization of scheduling of IoT devices with the F-APs, transmit power\nallocation, computation frequency allocation at the devices and F-APs and\ndecouple it into two subproblems. In the first subproblem, we optimize the IoT\ndevice scheduling and power allocation, while in the second subproblem, we\noptimize the computation frequency allocation. For each scenario, we develop a\nconflict graph based solution to iteratively solve the two subproblems.\nSimulation results show that the proposed two schemes achieve a considerable\nperformance gain in terms of the energy consumption minimization. The presented\nsimulation results interestingly reveal that for a large number of IoT devices\nand large data sizes, it is more energy efficient to train the local models at\nthe IoT devices instead of the F-APs.",

This holds in particular for AI methods that solve sequence\nprocessing tasks, a primary application target for spike-based neuromorphic\nhardware. One difficulty is that DNNs for such tasks typically employ Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) units. Yet an efficient emulation of these units in\nspike-based hardware has been missing.

          "description": "Many areas of science make extensive use of computer simulators that\nimplicitly encode likelihood functions for complex systems. Classical\nstatistical methods are poorly suited for these so-called likelihood-free\ninference (LFI) settings, outside the asymptotic and low-dimensional regimes.\nAlthough new machine learning methods, such as normalizing flows, have\nrevolutionized the sample efficiency and capacity of LFI methods, it remains an\nopen question whether they produce reliable measures of uncertainty. In this\npaper, we present a statistical framework for LFI that unifies classical\nstatistics with modern machine learning to: (1) construct frequentist\nconfidence sets and hypothesis tests with finite-sample guarantees of nominal\ncoverage (type I error control) and power, and (2) provide rigorous diagnostics\nfor assessing empirical coverage over the entire parameter space. We refer to\nour framework as likelihood-free frequentist inference (LF2I). Any method that\nestimates a test statistic, such as the likelihood ratio, can be plugged into\nour framework to create powerful tests and confidence sets with correct\ncoverage. In this work, we specifically study two test statistics (ACORE and\nBFF), which, respectively, maximize versus integrate an odds function over the\nparameter space.

          "description": "Collaborative learning allows participants to jointly train a model without\ndata sharing. To update the model parameters, the central server broadcasts\nmodel parameters to the clients, and the clients send updating directions such\nas gradients to the server. While data do not leave a client device, the\ncommunicated gradients and parameters will leak a client's privacy. Attacks\nthat infer clients' privacy from gradients and parameters have been developed\nby prior work. Simple defenses such as dropout and differential privacy either\nfail to defend the attacks or seriously hurt test accuracy.\n\nWe propose a practical defense which we call Double-Blind Collaborative\nLearning (DBCL). The high-level idea is to apply random matrix sketching to the\nparameters (aka weights) and re-generate random sketching after each iteration.\nDBCL prevents clients from conducting gradient-based privacy inferences which\nare the most effective attacks. DBCL works because from the attacker's\nperspective, sketching is effectively random noise that outweighs the signal.\nNotably, DBCL does not much increase computation and communication costs and\ndoes not hurt test accuracy at all.",

          "description": "Nowadays, we are witnessing an increasing adoption of Deep Learning (DL)\nbased software systems in many industries. Designing a DL program requires\nconstructing a deep neural network (DNN) and then training it on a dataset.\nThis process requires that developers make multiple architectural (e.g., type,\nsize, number, and order of layers) and configuration (e.g., optimizer,\nregularization methods, and activation functions) choices that affect the\nquality of the DL models, and consequently software quality. An under-specified\nor poorly-designed DL model may train successfully but is likely to perform\npoorly when deployed in production. Design smells in DL programs are poor\ndesign and-or configuration decisions taken during the development of DL\ncomponents, that are likely to have a negative impact on the performance (i.e.,\nprediction accuracy) and then quality of DL based software systems. In this\npaper, we present a catalogue of 8 design smells for a popular DL architecture,\nnamely deep Feedforward Neural Networks which is widely employed in industrial\napplications. The design smells were identified through a review of the\nexisting literature on DL design and a manual inspection of 659 DL programs\nwith performance issues and design inefficiencies. The smells are specified by\ndescribing their context, consequences, and recommended refactorings. To\nprovide empirical evidence on the relevance and perceived impact of the\nproposed design smells, we conducted a survey with 81 DL developers. In\ngeneral, the developers perceived the proposed design smells as reflective of\ndesign or implementation problems, with agreement levels varying between 47\\%\nand 68\\%.",

This\nwork proposes a novel deep boosted hybrid learning-based malware classification\nframework and named as Deep boosted Feature Space-based Malware classification\n(DFS-MC). In the proposed framework, the discrimination power is enhanced by\nfusing the feature spaces of the best performing customized CNN architectures\nmodels and its discrimination by an SVM for classification. The discrimination\ncapacity of the proposed classification framework is assessed by comparing it\nagainst the standard customized CNNs. The customized CNN models are implemented\nin two ways: softmax classifier and deep hybrid learning-based malware\nclassification. In the hybrid learning, Deep features are extracted from\ncustomized CNN architectures and fed into the conventional machine learning\nclassifier to improve the classification performance. We also introduced the\nconcept of transfer learning in a customized CNN architecture based malware\nclassification framework through fine-tuning. The performance of the proposed\nmalware classification approaches are validated on the MalImg malware dataset\nusing the hold-out cross-validation technique. Experimental comparisons were\nconducted by employing innovative, customized CNN, trained from scratch and\nfine-tuning the customized CNN using transfer learning. The proposed\nclassification framework DFS-MC showed improved results, Accuracy: 98.61%,\nF-score: 0.96, Precision: 0.96, and Recall: 0.96.",

An anomaly can possibly manifest as a cluster as well. Each\npartitioned cluster is considered to be a new data set and is a candidate to\nexplore the most optimal algorithm and its number of partition splits until a\npredefined stopping criteria is met. The algorithms independently partition the\ndata set into clusters and the quality of the partitioning is assessed by an\nensemble of internal cluster validation indices. The 3EC algorithm presents the\nvalidation index scores from a choice of algorithms and its configuration of\npartitions and it is called the Tau Grid. 3EC chooses the most optimal score.\nThe 3EC algorithm owes its name to the two input ensembles of algorithms and\ninternal validation indices and an output ensemble of final clusters.\n\nQuality plays an important role in this clustering approach and it also acts\nas a stopping criteria from further partitioning. Quality is determined based\non the quality of the clusters provided by an algorithm and its optimal number\nof splits. The 3EC algorithm determines this from the score of the ensemble of\nvalidation indices. The user can configure the stopping criteria by providing\nquality thresholds for the score range of each of the validation indices and\nthe optimal size of the output cluster. The users can experiment with different\nsets of stopping criteria and choose the most 'sensible group' of quality\nclusters",

          "description": "Adversarial examples pose a threat to deep neural network models in a variety\nof scenarios, from settings where the adversary has complete knowledge of the\nmodel in a \"white box\" setting and to the opposite in a \"black box\" setting. In\nthis paper, we explore the use of output randomization as a defense against\nattacks in both the black box and white box models and propose two defenses. In\nthe first defense, we propose output randomization at test time to thwart\nfinite difference attacks in black box settings. Since this type of attack\nrelies on repeated queries to the model to estimate gradients, we investigate\nthe use of randomization to thwart such adversaries from successfully creating\nadversarial examples. We empirically show that this defense can limit the\nsuccess rate of a black box adversary using the Zeroth Order Optimization\nattack to 0%. Secondly, we propose output randomization training as a defense\nagainst white box adversaries. Unlike prior approaches that use randomization,\nour defense does not require its use at test time, eliminating the Backward\nPass Differentiable Approximation attack, which was shown to be effective\nagainst other randomization defenses. Additionally, this defense has low\noverhead and is easily implemented, allowing it to be used together with other\ndefenses across various model architectures. We evaluate output randomization\ntraining against the Projected Gradient Descent attacker and show that the\ndefense can reduce the PGD attack's success rate down to 12% when using\ncross-entropy loss.",

          "description": "In this paper, we propose a model-operator-data network (MOD-Net) for solving\nPDEs. A MOD-Net is driven by a model to solve PDEs based on operator\nrepresentation with regularization from data. In this work, we use a deep\nneural network to parameterize the Green's function. The empirical risk\nconsists of the mean square of the governing equation, boundary conditions, and\na few labels, which are numerically computed by traditional schemes on coarse\ngrid points with cheap computation cost. With only the labeled dataset or only\nthe model constraints, it is insufficient to accurately train a MOD-Net for\ncomplicate problems. Intuitively, the labeled dataset works as a regularization\nin addition to the model constraints. The MOD-Net is much efficient than\noriginal neural operator because the MOD-Net also uses the information of\ngoverning equation and the boundary conditions of the PDE rather than purely\nthe expensive labels. Since the MOD-Net learns the Green's function of a PDE,\nit solves a type of PDEs but not a specific case. We numerically show MOD-Net\nis very efficient in solving Poisson equation and one-dimensional Boltzmann\nequation. For non-linear PDEs, where the concept of the Green's function does\nnot apply, the non-linear MOD-Net can be similarly used as an ansatz for\nsolving non-linear PDEs.",

          "description": "The availability of large amounts of user-provided data has been key to the\nsuccess of machine learning for many real-world tasks. Recently, an increasing\nawareness has emerged that users should be given more control about how their\ndata is used. In particular, users should have the right to prohibit the use of\ntheir data for training machine learning systems, and to have it erased from\nalready trained systems. While several sample erasure methods have been\nproposed, all of them have drawbacks which have prevented them from gaining\nwidespread adoption. Most methods are either only applicable to very specific\nfamilies of models, sacrifice too much of the original model's accuracy, or\nthey have prohibitive memory or computational requirements. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient and effective algorithm, SSSE, for samples erasure, that\nis applicable to a wide class of machine learning models. From a second-order\nanalysis of the model's loss landscape we derive a closed-form update step of\nthe model parameters that only requires access to the data to be erased, not to\nthe original training set. Experiments on three datasets, CelebFaces attributes\n(CelebA), Animals with Attributes 2 (AwA2) and CIFAR10, show that in certain\ncases SSSE can erase samples almost as well as the optimal, yet impractical,\ngold standard of training a new model from scratch with only the permitted\ndata.",

          "description": "In existing deep learning methods, almost all loss functions assume that\nsample data values used to be predicted are the only correct ones. This\nassumption does not hold for laboratory test data. Test results are often\nwithin tolerable or imprecision ranges, with all values in the ranges\nacceptable. By considering imprecision samples, we propose an imprecision range\nloss (IR loss) method and incorporate it into Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)\nmodel for disease progress prediction. In this method, each sample in\nimprecision range space has a certain probability to be the real value,\nparticipating in the loss calculation. The loss is defined as the integral of\nthe error of each point in the impression range space. A sampling method for\nimprecision space is formulated. The continuous imprecision space is\ndiscretized, and a sequence of imprecise data sets are obtained, which is\nconvenient for gradient descent learning. A heuristic learning algorithm is\ndeveloped to learn the model parameters based on the imprecise data sets.\nExperimental results on real data show that the prediction method based on IR\nloss can provide more stable and consistent prediction result when test samples\nare generated from imprecision range.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have increased the accuracy of automatic segmentation,\nhowever, their accuracy depends on the availability of a large number of fully\nsegmented images. Methods to train deep neural networks using images for which\nsome, but not all, regions of interest are segmented are necessary to make\nbetter use of partially annotated datasets. In this paper, we propose the first\naxiomatic definition of label-set loss functions that are the loss functions\nthat can handle partially segmented images. We prove that there is one and only\none method to convert a classical loss function for fully segmented images into\na proper label-set loss function. Our theory also allows us to define the\nleaf-Dice loss, a label-set generalization of the Dice loss particularly suited\nfor partial supervision with only missing labels. Using the leaf-Dice loss, we\nset a new state of the art in partially supervised learning for fetal brain 3D\nMRI segmentation. We achieve a deep neural network able to segment white\nmatter, ventricles, cerebellum, extra-ventricular CSF, cortical gray matter,\ndeep gray matter, brainstem, and corpus callosum based on fetal brain 3D MRI of\nanatomically normal fetuses or with open spina bifida.

          "description": "In large studies involving multi protocol Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),\nit can occur to miss one or more sub-modalities for a given patient owing to\npoor quality (e.g. imaging artifacts), failed acquisitions, or hallway\ninterrupted imaging examinations. In some cases, certain protocols are\nunavailable due to limited scan time or to retrospectively harmonise the\nimaging protocols of two independent studies. Missing image modalities pose a\nchallenge to segmentation frameworks as complementary information contributed\nby the missing scans is then lost. In this paper, we propose a novel model,\nMulti-modal Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoder (MGP-VAE), to impute\none or more missing sub-modalities for a patient scan. MGP-VAE can leverage the\nGaussian Process (GP) prior on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to utilize the\nsubjects/patients and sub-modalities correlations. Instead of designing one\nnetwork for each possible subset of present sub-modalities or using frameworks\nto mix feature maps, missing data can be generated from a single model based on\nall the available samples. We show the applicability of MGP-VAE on brain tumor\nsegmentation where either, two, or three of four sub-modalities may be missing.\nOur experiments against competitive segmentation baselines with missing\nsub-modality on BraTS'19 dataset indicate the effectiveness of the MGP-VAE\nmodel for segmentation tasks.",

However, in practical\napplication scenarios, the imbalance of time-series fault is an urgent problem\nto be solved. From the perspective of Bayesian probability, this paper analyzes\nhow to improve the performance of imbalanced classification by adjusting the\ndistance between classes and the distribution within a class and proposes a\ntime-series fault diagnosis model based on deep metric learning. As a core of\ndeep metric learning, a novel quadruplet data pair design considering imbalance\nclass is proposed with reference to traditional deep metric learning. Based on\nsuch data pair, this paper proposes a quadruplet loss function which takes into\naccount the inter-class distance and the intra-class data distribution, and\npays special attention to imbalanced sample pairs. The reasonable combination\nof quadruplet loss and softmax loss function can reduce the impact of\nimbalance. Experiments on two open datasets are carried out to verify the\neffectiveness and robustness of the model. Experimental results show that the\nproposed method can effectively improve the performance of imbalanced\nclassification.",

We propose a successive\nrefinement based algorithm called Adaptive Contextual Bandit ({\\ttfamily ACB}),\nthat works in phases and successively eliminates model classes that are too\nsimple to fit the given instance. We prove that this algorithm is adaptive,\ni.e., the regret rate order-wise matches that of {\\ttfamily FALCON}, the\nstate-of-art contextual bandit algorithm of Levi et. al '20, that needs\nknowledge of the true model class. The price of not knowing the correct model\nclass is only an additive term contributing to the second order term in the\nregret bound. This cost possess the intuitive property that it becomes smaller\nas the model class becomes easier to identify, and vice-versa. We then show\nthat a much simpler explore-then-commit (ETC) style algorithm also obtains a\nregret rate of matching that of {\\ttfamily FALCON}, despite not knowing the\ntrue model class. However, the cost of model selection is higher in ETC as\nopposed to in {\\ttfamily ACB}, as expected.

          "description": "Face recognition approaches often rely on equal image resolution for\nverification faces on two images. However, in practical applications, those\nimage resolutions are usually not in the same range due to different image\ncapture mechanisms or sources. In this work, we first analyze the impact of\nimage resolutions on the face verification performance with a state-of-the-art\nface recognition model. For images, synthetically reduced to $5\\, \\times 5\\,\n\\mathrm{px}$ resolution, the verification performance drops from $99.23\\%$\nincreasingly down to almost $55\\%$. Especially, for cross-resolution image\npairs (one high- and one low-resolution image), the verification accuracy\ndecreases even further. We investigate this behavior more in-depth by looking\nat the feature distances for every 2-image test pair. To tackle this problem,\nwe propose the following two methods: 1) Train a state-of-the-art\nface-recognition model straightforward with $50\\%$ low-resolution images\ndirectly within each batch. \\\\ 2) Train a siamese-network structure and adding\na cosine distance feature loss between high- and low-resolution features.

          "description": "Modern Internet of Things solutions are used in a variety of different areas,\nranging from connected vehicles and healthcare to industrial applications. They\nrely on a large amount of interconnected sensors, which can lead to both\ntechnical and economical challenges. Virtual sensing techniques aim to reduce\nthe number of physical sensors in a system by using data from available\nmeasurements to estimate additional unknown quantities of interest. Successful\nmodel-based solutions include Kalman filters or the combination of finite\nelement models and modal analysis, while many data-driven methods rely on\nmachine learning algorithms. The presented hybrid virtual sensing approach\ncombines Long Short-Term Memory networks with frequency response function\nmodels in order to estimate the behavior of non-linear dynamic systems with\nmultiple input and output channels. Network training and prediction make use of\nshort signal subsequences, which are later recombined by applying a windowing\ntechnique. The frequency response function model acts as a baseline estimate\nwhich perfectly captures linear dynamic systems and is augmented by the\nnon-linear Long Short-Term Memory network following two different hybrid\nmodeling strategies. The approach is tested using a non-linear experimental\ndataset, which results from measurements of a three-component servo-hydraulic\nfatigue test bench. A variety of metrics in time and frequency domains, as well\nas fatigue strength under variable amplitudes are used to evaluate the\napproximation quality of the proposed method. In addition to virtual sensing,\nthe algorithm is also applied to a forward prediction task. Synthetic data are\nused in a separate study to estimate the prediction quality on datasets of\ndifferent size.",

The agent interacts with the environment over\nepisodes, with each episode having different context distributions; this\nresults in the `best expert' changing across episodes. Our goal is to develop\nan agent that tracks the best expert over episodes. We introduce the Empirical\nDivergence-based UCB (ED-UCB) algorithm in this setting where the agent does\nnot have any knowledge of the expert policies or changes in context\ndistributions.

If the expert policies are known\nto the agent a priori, then we can improve the regret to $\\tilde{O}(EN)$\nwithout requiring any bootstrapping. Our analysis also tightens pre-existing\nlogarithmic regret bounds to a problem-dependent constant in the non-episodic\nsetting when expert policies are known.

          "description": "Optimization is often cast as a deterministic problem, where the solution is\nfound through some iterative procedure such as gradient descent. However, when\ntraining neural networks the loss function changes over (iteration) time due to\nthe randomized selection of a subset of the samples. This randomization turns\nthe optimization problem into a stochastic one. We propose to consider the loss\nas a noisy observation with respect to some reference optimum. This\ninterpretation of the loss allows us to adopt Kalman filtering as an optimizer,\nas its recursive formulation is designed to estimate unknown parameters from\nnoisy measurements. Moreover, we show that the Kalman Filter dynamical model\nfor the evolution of the unknown parameters can be used to capture the gradient\ndynamics of advanced methods such as Momentum and Adam. We call this stochastic\noptimization method KaFiStO. KaFiStO is an easy to implement, scalable, and\nefficient method to train neural networks.

          "description": "The goal of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) is to build agents that can\nquickly learn new tasks by leveraging prior experience on related tasks.\nLearning a new task often requires both exploring to gather task-relevant\ninformation and exploiting this information to solve the task. In principle,\noptimal exploration and exploitation can be learned end-to-end by simply\nmaximizing task performance. However, such meta-RL approaches struggle with\nlocal optima due to a chicken-and-egg problem: learning to explore requires\ngood exploitation to gauge the exploration's utility, but learning to exploit\nrequires information gathered via exploration. Optimizing separate objectives\nfor exploration and exploitation can avoid this problem, but prior meta-RL\nexploration objectives yield suboptimal policies that gather information\nirrelevant to the task. We alleviate both concerns by constructing an\nexploitation objective that automatically identifies task-relevant information\nand an exploration objective to recover only this information. This avoids\nlocal optima in end-to-end training, without sacrificing optimal exploration.\nEmpirically, DREAM substantially outperforms existing approaches on complex\nmeta-RL problems, such as sparse-reward 3D visual navigation.

          "description": "Normalizing flows are a widely used class of latent-variable generative\nmodels with a tractable likelihood. Affine-coupling (Dinh et al, 2014-16)\nmodels are a particularly common type of normalizing flows, for which the\nJacobian of the latent-to-observable-variable transformation is triangular,\nallowing the likelihood to be computed in linear time. Despite the widespread\nusage of affine couplings, the special structure of the architecture makes\nunderstanding their representational power challenging. The question of\nuniversal approximation was only recently resolved by three parallel papers\n(Huang et al.,2020;Zhang et al.,2020;Koehler et al.,2020) -- who showed\nreasonably regular distributions can be approximated arbitrarily well using\naffine couplings -- albeit with networks with a nearly-singular Jacobian. As\nill-conditioned Jacobians are an obstacle for likelihood-based training, the\nfundamental question remains: which distributions can be approximated using\nwell-conditioned affine coupling flows?\n\nIn this paper, we show that any log-concave distribution can be approximated\nusing well-conditioned affine-coupling flows. In terms of proof techniques, we\nuncover and leverage deep connections between affine coupling architectures,\nunderdamped Langevin dynamics (a stochastic differential equation often used to\nsample from Gibbs measures) and H\\'enon maps (a structured dynamical system\nthat appears in the study of symplectic diffeomorphisms). Our results also\ninform the practice of training affine couplings: we approximate a padded\nversion of the input distribution with iid Gaussians -- a strategy which\nKoehler et al.(2020) empirically observed to result in better-conditioned\nflows, but had hitherto no theoretical grounding. Our proof can thus be seen as\nproviding theoretical evidence for the benefits of Gaussian padding when\ntraining normalizing flows.",

          "description": "We present SoundStream, a novel neural audio codec that can efficiently\ncompress speech, music and general audio at bitrates normally targeted by\nspeech-tailored codecs. SoundStream relies on a model architecture composed by\na fully convolutional encoder/decoder network and a residual vector quantizer,\nwhich are trained jointly end-to-end. Training leverages recent advances in\ntext-to-speech and speech enhancement, which combine adversarial and\nreconstruction losses to allow the generation of high-quality audio content\nfrom quantized embeddings. By training with structured dropout applied to\nquantizer layers, a single model can operate across variable bitrates from\n3kbps to 18kbps, with a negligible quality loss when compared with models\ntrained at fixed bitrates. In addition, the model is amenable to a low latency\nimplementation, which supports streamable inference and runs in real time on a\nsmartphone CPU. In subjective evaluations using audio at 24kHz sampling rate,\nSoundStream at 3kbps outperforms Opus at 12kbps and approaches EVS at 9.6kbps.\nMoreover, we are able to perform joint compression and enhancement either at\nthe encoder or at the decoder side with no additional latency, which we\ndemonstrate through background noise suppression for speech.",

Moreover, taking advantage of\nthe representation of PL as a random utility model, the proposed predictor\noffers a natural way to recover (shift-invariant) metric depth information from\nranking-only data provided at training time.

          "description": "Modeling of non-rigid object launching and manipulation is complex\nconsidering the wide range of dynamics affecting trajectory, many of which may\nbe unknown. Using physics models can be inaccurate because they cannot account\nfor unknown factors and the effects of the deformation of the object as it is\nlaunched; moreover, deriving force coefficients for these models is not\npossible without extensive experimental testing. Recently, advancements in\ndata-powered artificial intelligence methods have allowed learnable models and\nsystems to emerge. It is desirable to train a model for launch prediction on a\nrobot, as deep neural networks can account for immeasurable dynamics.

Through estimating force coefficients, the\naccepted physics models can be leveraged to produce adequate supplemental data\nto artificially increase the size of the training set, yielding improved neural\nnetworks. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for algorithmic\nestimation of force coefficients for non-rigid object launching, which can be\ngeneralized to other domains, in order to generate large datasets. We implement\na novel training algorithm and objective for our deep neural network to\naccurately model launch trajectory of non-rigid objects and predict whether\nthey will hit a series of targets.

However,\nlearning over graph data can raise privacy concerns when nodes represent people\nor human-related variables that involve sensitive or personal information.\nWhile numerous techniques have been proposed for privacy-preserving deep\nlearning over non-relational data, there is less work addressing the privacy\nissues pertained to applying deep learning algorithms on graphs. In this paper,\nwe study the problem of node data privacy, where graph nodes have potentially\nsensitive data that is kept private, but they could be beneficial for a central\nserver for training a GNN over the graph. To address this problem, we develop a\nprivacy-preserving, architecture-agnostic GNN learning algorithm with formal\nprivacy guarantees based on Local Differential Privacy (LDP). Specifically, we\npropose an LDP encoder and an unbiased rectifier, by which the server can\ncommunicate with the graph nodes to privately collect their data and\napproximate the GNN's first layer. To further reduce the effect of the injected\nnoise, we propose to prepend a simple graph convolution layer, called KProp,\nwhich is based on the multi-hop aggregation of the nodes' features acting as a\ndenoising mechanism. Finally, we propose a robust training framework, in which\nwe benefit from KProp's denoising capability to increase the accuracy of\ninference in the presence of noisy labels.

To allow for the automatic detection of faults in DRL\nprograms, we have defined a meta-model of DRL programs and developed DRLinter,\na model-based fault detection approach that leverages static analysis and graph\ntransformations. The execution flow of DRLinter consists in parsing a DRL\nprogram to generate a model conforming to our meta-model and applying detection\nrules on the model to identify faults occurrences.

One tool for\nuncertainty quantification that requires minimal assumptions is conformal\ninference, which can help create probabilistically valid prediction regions for\nblack box models. Classical conformal prediction only provides marginal\nvalidity, whereas in many situations locally valid prediction regions are\ndesirable. Deciding how best to partition the feature space X when applying\nlocalized conformal prediction is still an open question. We present MD-split+,\na practical local conformal approach that creates X partitions based on\nlocalized model performance of conditional density estimation models. Our\nmethod handles complex real-world data settings where such models may be\nmisspecified, and scales to high-dimensional inputs. We discuss how our local\npartitions philosophically align with expected behavior from an unattainable\nconditional conformal inference approach. We also empirically compare our\nmethod against other local conformal approaches.",

          "description": "Designing agents, capable of learning autonomously a wide range of skills is\ncritical in order to increase the scope of reinforcement learning. It will both\nincrease the diversity of learned skills and reduce the burden of manually\ndesigning reward functions for each skill. Self-supervised agents, setting\ntheir own goals, and trying to maximize the diversity of those goals have shown\ngreat promise towards this end. However, a currently known limitation of agents\ntrying to maximize the diversity of sampled goals is that they tend to get\nattracted to noise or more generally to parts of the environments that cannot\nbe controlled (distractors). When agents have access to predefined goal\nfeatures or expert knowledge, absolute Learning Progress (ALP) provides a way\nto distinguish between regions that can be controlled and those that cannot.\nHowever, those methods often fall short when the agents are only provided with\nraw sensory inputs such as images. In this work we extend those concepts to\nunsupervised image-based goal exploration. We propose a framework that allows\nagents to autonomously identify and ignore noisy distracting regions while\nsearching for novelty in the learnable regions to both improve overall\nperformance and avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our framework can be combined\nwith any state-of-the-art novelty seeking goal exploration approaches. We\nconstruct a rich 3D image based environment with distractors. Experiments on\nthis environment show that agents using our framework successfully identify\ninteresting regions of the environment, resulting in drastically improved\nperformances.

By thresholding small\nentries, these matrices are compressible to O(N log N) relevant entries, where\nN is the number of data points. This feature allows for the use of fill-in\nreducing reorderings to obtain a sparse factorization of the compressed\nmatrices.

          "description": "Regularization plays a vital role in machine learning optimization. One novel\nregularization method called flooding makes the training loss fluctuate around\nthe flooding level. It intends to make the model continue to random walk until\nit comes to a flat loss landscape to enhance generalization. However, the\nhyper-parameter flooding level of the flooding method fails to be selected\nproperly and uniformly. We propose a novel method called Jitter to improve it.\nJitter is essentially a kind of random loss function. Before training, we\nrandomly sample the Jitter Point from a specific probability distribution. The\nflooding level should be replaced by Jitter point to obtain a new target\nfunction and train the model accordingly. As Jitter point acting as a random\nfactor, we actually add some randomness to the loss function, which is\nconsistent with the fact that there exists innumerable random behaviors in the\nlearning process of the machine learning model and is supposed to make the\nmodel more robust. In addition, Jitter performs random walk randomly which\ndivides the loss curve into small intervals and then flipping them over,\nideally making the loss curve much flatter and enhancing generalization\nability. Moreover, Jitter can be a domain-, task-, and model-independent\nregularization method and train the model effectively after the training error\nreduces to zero. Our experimental results show that Jitter method can improve\nmodel performance more significantly than the previous flooding method and make\nthe test loss curve descend twice.",

          "description": "Data depth is a non parametric statistical tool that measures centrality of\nany element $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to (w.r.t.) a probability\ndistribution or a data set. It is a natural median-oriented extension of the\ncumulative distribution function (cdf) to the multivariate case. Consequently,\nits upper level sets -- the depth-trimmed regions -- give rise to a definition\nof multivariate quantiles. In this work, we propose two new pseudo-metrics\nbetween continuous probability measures based on data depth and its associated\ncentral regions. The first one is constructed as the Lp-distance between data\ndepth w.r.t. each distribution while the second one relies on the Hausdorff\ndistance between their quantile regions. It can further be seen as an original\nway to extend the one-dimensional formulae of the Wasserstein distance, which\ninvolves quantiles and cdfs, to the multivariate space. After discussing the\nproperties of these pseudo-metrics and providing conditions under which they\ndefine a distance, we highlight similarities with the Wasserstein distance.\nInterestingly, the derived non-asymptotic bounds show that in contrast to the\nWasserstein distance, the proposed pseudo-metrics do not suffer from the curse\nof dimensionality. Moreover, based on the support function of a convex body, we\npropose an efficient approximation possessing linear time complexity w.r.t. the\nsize of the data set and its dimension. The quality of this approximation as\nwell as the performance of the proposed approach are illustrated in\nexperiments. Furthermore, by construction the regions-based pseudo-metric\nappears to be robust w.r.t. both outliers and heavy tails, a behavior witnessed\nin the numerical experiments.",

          "description": "Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with noisy labels is a challenging\nproblem due to over-parameterization. DNNs tend to essentially fit on clean\nsamples at a higher rate in the initial stages, and later fit on the noisy\nsamples at a relatively lower rate. Thus, with a noisy dataset, the test\naccuracy increases initially and drops in the later stages. To find an early\nstopping point at the maximum obtainable test accuracy (MOTA), recent studies\nassume either that i) a clean validation set is available or ii) the noise\nratio is known, or, both. However, often a clean validation set is unavailable,\nand the noise estimation can be inaccurate. To overcome these issues, we\nprovide a novel training solution, free of these conditions. We analyze the\nrate of change of the training accuracy for different noise ratios under\ndifferent conditions to identify a training stop region. We further develop a\nheuristic algorithm based on a small-learning assumption to find a training\nstop point (TSP) at or close to MOTA. To the best of our knowledge, our method\nis the first to rely solely on the \\textit{training behavior}, while utilizing\nthe entire training set, to automatically find a TSP. We validated the\nrobustness of our algorithm (AutoTSP) through several experiments on CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100, and a real-world noisy dataset for different noise ratios, noise\ntypes, and architectures.",

          "description": "Recently there has been increased interest in semi-supervised classification\nin the presence of graphical information. A new class of learning models has\nemerged that relies, at its most basic level, on classifying the data after\nfirst applying a graph convolution. To understand the merits of this approach,\nwe study the classification of a mixture of Gaussians, where the data\ncorresponds to the node attributes of a stochastic block model. We show that\ngraph convolution extends the regime in which the data is linearly separable by\na factor of roughly $1/\\sqrt{D}$, where $D$ is the expected degree of a node,\nas compared to the mixture model data on its own. Furthermore, we find that the\nlinear classifier obtained by minimizing the cross-entropy loss after the graph\nconvolution generalizes to out-of-distribution data where the unseen data can\nhave different intra- and inter-class edge probabilities from the training\ndata.",

          "description": "Recommender systems rely on user behavior data like ratings and clicks to\nbuild personalization model. However, the collected data is observational\nrather than experimental, causing various biases in the data which\nsignificantly affect the learned model. Most existing work for recommendation\ndebiasing, such as the inverse propensity scoring and imputation approaches,\nfocuses on one or two specific biases, lacking the universal capacity that can\naccount for mixed or even unknown biases in the data.\n\nTowards this research gap, we first analyze the origin of biases from the\nperspective of \\textit{risk discrepancy} that represents the difference between\nthe expectation empirical risk and the true risk. Remarkably, we derive a\ngeneral learning framework that well summarizes most existing debiasing\nstrategies by specifying some parameters of the general framework. This\nprovides a valuable opportunity to develop a universal solution for debiasing,\ne.g., by learning the debiasing parameters from data. However, the training\ndata lacks important signal of how the data is biased and what the unbiased\ndata looks like. To move this idea forward, we propose \\textit{AotoDebias} that\nleverages another (small) set of uniform data to optimize the debiasing\nparameters by solving the bi-level optimization problem with meta-learning.\nThrough theoretical analyses, we derive the generalization bound for AutoDebias\nand prove its ability to acquire the appropriate debiasing strategy.

An efficient\nframework to tackle this problem is proposed. In particular, a notion termed\nmodality \"\\emph{usefulness}\", which takes a value of 1 or 0, is used for\nindicating whether the observation of this modality is useful or not. For $n$\nmodalities involved, $2^n$ combinations of their \"\\emph{usefulness}\" values\nexist. Each combination defines one hypothetical model of the true data\ngenerative process. Then the problem of concern is formalized as a task of\nnonlinear non-Gaussian state filtering under model uncertainty, which is\naddressed by a dynamic model averaging (DMA) based particle filter (PF)\nalgorithm. This DMA algorithm employs $2^n$ models, while all models share the\nsame state-transition function and a unique set of particle values. That makes\nthe computational complexity of this algorithm only slightly larger than a\nsingle model based PF algorithm, especially for scenarios in which $n$ is\nsmall.

          "description": "Trustworthy deployment of ML models requires a proper measure of uncertainty,\nespecially in safety-critical applications. We focus on uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) for classification problems via two avenues -- prediction\nsets using conformal prediction and calibration of probabilistic predictors by\npost-hoc binning -- since these possess distribution-free guarantees for i.i.d.\ndata. Two common ways of generalizing beyond the i.i.d. setting include\nhandling covariate and label shift. Within the context of distribution-free UQ,\nthe former has already received attention, but not the latter. It is known that\nlabel shift hurts prediction, and we first argue that it also hurts UQ, by\nshowing degradation in coverage and calibration. Piggybacking on recent\nprogress in addressing label shift (for better prediction), we examine the\nright way to achieve UQ by reweighting the aforementioned conformal and\ncalibration procedures whenever some unlabeled data from the target\ndistribution is available. We examine these techniques theoretically in a\ndistribution-free framework and demonstrate their excellent practical\nperformance.",

          "description": "A fundamental question in adversarial machine learning is whether a robust\nclassifier exists for a given task. A line of research has made progress\ntowards this goal by studying concentration of measure, but without considering\ndata labels. We argue that the standard concentration fails to fully\ncharacterize the intrinsic robustness of a classification problem, since it\nignores data labels which are essential to any classification task. Building on\na novel definition of label uncertainty, we empirically demonstrate that error\nregions induced by state-of-the-art models tend to have much higher label\nuncertainty compared with randomly-selected subsets. This observation motivates\nus to adapt a concentration estimation algorithm to account for label\nuncertainty, resulting in more accurate intrinsic robustness measures for\nbenchmark image classification problems. We further provide empirical evidence\nshowing that adding an abstain option for classifiers based on label\nuncertainty can help improve both the clean and robust accuracies of models.",

          "description": "Inherent in virtually every iterative machine learning algorithm is the\nproblem of hyper-parameter tuning, which includes three major design\nparameters: (a) the complexity of the model, e.g., the number of neurons in a\nneural network, (b) the initial conditions, which heavily affect the behavior\nof the algorithm, and (c) the dissimilarity measure used to quantify its\nperformance. We introduce an online prototype-based learning algorithm that can\nbe viewed as a progressively growing competitive-learning neural network\narchitecture for classification and clustering. The learning rule of the\nproposed approach is formulated as an online gradient-free stochastic\napproximation algorithm that solves a sequence of appropriately defined\noptimization problems, simulating an annealing process. The annealing nature of\nthe algorithm contributes to avoiding poor local minima, offers robustness with\nrespect to the initial conditions, and provides a means to progressively\nincrease the complexity of the learning model, through an intuitive bifurcation\nphenomenon. The proposed approach is interpretable, requires minimal\nhyper-parameter tuning, and allows online control over the\nperformance-complexity trade-off. Finally, we show that Bregman divergences\nappear naturally as a family of dissimilarity measures that play a central role\nin both the performance and the computational complexity of the learning\nalgorithm. Experimental results illustrate the properties and evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed learning algorithm.",

          "description": "We show that the sum of the implicit generator log-density $\\log p_g$ of a\nGAN with the logit score of the discriminator defines an energy function which\nyields the true data density when the generator is imperfect but the\ndiscriminator is optimal, thus making it possible to improve on the typical\ngenerator (with implicit density $p_g$). To make that practical, we show that\nsampling from this modified density can be achieved by sampling in latent space\naccording to an energy-based model induced by the sum of the latent prior\nlog-density and the discriminator output score. This can be achieved by running\na Langevin MCMC in latent space and then applying the generator function, which\nwe call Discriminator Driven Latent Sampling~(DDLS). We show that DDLS is\nhighly efficient compared to previous methods which work in the\nhigh-dimensional pixel space and can be applied to improve on previously\ntrained GANs of many types. We evaluate DDLS on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets qualitatively and quantitatively. On CIFAR-10, DDLS substantially\nimproves the Inception Score of an off-the-shelf pre-trained\nSN-GAN~\\citep{sngan} from $8.22$ to $9.09$ which is even comparable to the\nclass-conditional BigGAN~\\citep{biggan} model.

          "description": "Nowadays, we are witnessing an increasing demand in both corporates and\nacademia for exploiting Deep Learning (DL) to solve complex real-world\nproblems. A DL program encodes the network structure of a desirable DL model\nand the process by which the model learns from the training dataset. Like any\nsoftware, a DL program can be faulty, which implies substantial challenges of\nsoftware quality assurance, especially in safety-critical domains. It is\ntherefore crucial to equip DL development teams with efficient fault detection\ntechniques and tools. In this paper, we propose NeuraLint, a model-based fault\ndetection approach for DL programs, using meta-modelling and graph\ntransformations. First, we design a meta-model for DL programs that includes\ntheir base skeleton and fundamental properties. Then, we construct a\ngraph-based verification process that covers 23 rules defined on top of the\nmeta-model and implemented as graph transformations to detect faults and design\ninefficiencies in the generated models (i.e., instances of the meta-model).\nFirst, the proposed approach is evaluated by finding faults and design\ninefficiencies in 28 synthesized examples built from common problems reported\nin the literature. Then NeuraLint successfully finds 64 faults and design\ninefficiencies in 34 real-world DL programs extracted from Stack Overflow posts\nand GitHub repositories. The results show that NeuraLint effectively detects\nfaults and design issues in both synthesized and real-world examples with a\nrecall of 70.5 % and a precision of 100 %. Although the proposed meta-model is\ndesigned for feedforward neural networks, it can be extended to support other\nneural network architectures such as recurrent neural networks. Researchers can\nalso expand our set of verification rules to cover more types of issues in DL\nprograms.",

However, a key obstacle in the efficient implementation of DASGD\nis the issue of delays: when a computing node contributes a gradient update,\nthe global model parameter may have already been updated by other nodes several\ntimes over, thereby rendering this gradient information stale. These delays can\nquickly add up if the computational throughput of a node is saturated, so the\nconvergence of DASGD may be compromised in the presence of large delays. Our\nfirst contribution is that, by carefully tuning the algorithm's step-size,\nconvergence to the critical set is still achieved in mean square, even if the\ndelays grow unbounded at a polynomial rate. We also establish finer results in\na broad class of structured optimization problems (called variationally\ncoherent), where we show that DASGD converges to a global optimum with\nprobability $1$ under the same delay assumptions.

          "description": "A key feature of sequential decision making under uncertainty is a need to\nbalance between exploiting--choosing the best action according to the current\nknowledge, and exploring--obtaining information about values of other actions.\nThe multi-armed bandit problem, a classical task that captures this trade-off,\nserved as a vehicle in machine learning for developing bandit algorithms that\nproved to be useful in numerous industrial applications. The active inference\nframework, an approach to sequential decision making recently developed in\nneuroscience for understanding human and animal behaviour, is distinguished by\nits sophisticated strategy for resolving the exploration-exploitation\ntrade-off. This makes active inference an exciting alternative to already\nestablished bandit algorithms. Here we derive an efficient and scalable\napproximate active inference algorithm and compare it to two state-of-the-art\nbandit algorithms: Bayesian upper confidence bound and optimistic Thompson\nsampling. This comparison is done on two types of bandit problems: a stationary\nand a dynamic switching bandit. Our empirical evaluation shows that the active\ninference algorithm does not produce efficient long-term behaviour in\nstationary bandits. However, in the more challenging switching bandit problem\nactive inference performs substantially better than the two state-of-the-art\nbandit algorithms. The results open exciting venues for further research in\ntheoretical and applied machine learning, as well as lend additional\ncredibility to active inference as a general framework for studying human and\nanimal behaviour.",

          "description": "The proposed method re-frames traditional inverse problems of\nelectrocardiography into regression problems, constraining the solution space\nby decomposing signals with multidimensional Gaussian impulse basis functions.\nImpulse HSPs were generated with single Gaussian basis functions at discrete\nheart surface locations and projected to corresponding BSPs using a volume\nconductor torso model. Both BSP (inputs) and HSP (outputs) were mapped to\nregular 2D surface meshes and used to train a neural network. Predictive\ncapabilities of the network were tested with unseen synthetic and experimental\ndata. A dense full connected single hidden layer neural network was trained to\nmap body surface impulses to heart surface Gaussian basis functions for\nreconstructing HSP. Synthetic pulses moving across the heart surface were\npredicted from the neural network with root mean squared error of $9.1\\pm1.4$%.\nPredicted signals were robust to noise up to 20 dB and errors due to\ndisplacement and rotation of the heart within the torso were bounded and\npredictable. A shift of the heart 40 mm toward the spine resulted in a 4\\%\nincrease in signal feature localization error. The set of training impulse\nfunction data could be reduced and prediction error remained bounded. Recorded\nHSPs from in-vitro pig hearts were reliably decomposed using space-time\nGaussian basis functions. Predicted HSPs for left-ventricular pacing had a mean\nabsolute error of $10.4\\pm11.4$ ms. Other pacing scenarios were analyzed with\nsimilar success. Conclusion: Impulses from Gaussian basis functions are\npotentially an effective and robust way to train simple neural network data\nmodels for reconstructing HSPs from decomposed BSPs. The HSPs predicted by the\nneural network can be used to generate activation maps that non-invasively\nidentify features of cardiac electrical dysfunction and can guide subsequent\ntreatment options.",

          "description": "Attributed event sequences are commonly encountered in practice. A recent\nresearch line focuses on incorporating neural networks with the statistical\nmodel -- marked point processes, which is the conventional tool for dealing\nwith attributed event sequences. Neural marked point processes possess good\ninterpretability of probabilistic models as well as the representational power\nof neural networks. However, we find that performance of neural marked point\nprocesses is not always increasing as the network architecture becomes more\ncomplicated and larger, which is what we call the performance saturation\nphenomenon. This is due to the fact that the generalization error of neural\nmarked point processes is determined by both the network representational\nability and the model specification at the same time. Therefore we can draw two\nmajor conclusions: first, simple network structures can perform no worse than\ncomplicated ones for some cases; second, using a proper probabilistic\nassumption is as equally, if not more, important as improving the complexity of\nthe network. Based on this observation, we propose a simple graph-based network\nstructure called GCHP, which utilizes only graph convolutional layers, thus it\ncan be easily accelerated by the parallel mechanism. We directly consider the\ndistribution of interarrival times instead of imposing a specific assumption on\nthe conditional intensity function, and propose to use a likelihood ratio loss\nwith a moment matching mechanism for optimization and model selection.\nExperimental results show that GCHP can significantly reduce training time and\nthe likelihood ratio loss with interarrival time probability assumptions can\ngreatly improve the model performance.",

          "description": "Many real-world prediction tasks have outcome variables that have\ncharacteristic heavy-tail distributions. Examples include copies of books sold,\nauction prices of art pieces, demand for commodities in warehouses, etc. By\nlearning heavy-tailed distributions, \"big and rare\" instances (e.g., the\nbest-sellers) will have accurate predictions. Most existing approaches are not\ndedicated to learning heavy-tailed distribution; thus, they heavily\nunder-predict such instances. To tackle this problem, we introduce Learning to\nPlace (L2P), which exploits the pairwise relationships between instances for\nlearning. In its training phase, L2P learns a pairwise preference classifier:\nis instance A > instance B? In its placing phase, L2P obtains a prediction by\nplacing the new instance among the known instances. Based on its placement, the\nnew instance is then assigned a value for its outcome variable. Experiments on\nreal data show that L2P outperforms competing approaches in terms of accuracy\nand ability to reproduce heavy-tailed outcome distribution. In addition, L2P\nprovides an interpretable model by placing each predicted instance in relation\nto its comparable neighbors. Interpretable models are highly desirable when\nlives and treasure are at stake.",

We\nconsider RDPGs for which the latent positions are randomly sampled from an\nunknown $1$-dimensional submanifold of the latent space. In principle,\nrestricted inference, i.e., procedures that exploit the structure of the\nsubmanifold, should be more effective than unrestricted inference; however, it\nis not clear how to conduct restricted inference when the submanifold is\nunknown. We submit that techniques for manifold learning can be used to learn\nthe unknown submanifold well enough to realize benefit from restricted\ninference. To illustrate, we test $1$- and $2$-sample hypotheses about the\nFr\\'{e}chet means of small communities of vertices, using the complete set of\nvertices to infer latent structure. We propose test statistics that deploy the\nIsomap procedure for manifold learning, using shortest path distances on\nneighborhood graphs constructed from estimated latent positions to estimate arc\nlengths on the unknown $1$-dimensional submanifold. Unlike conventional\napplications of Isomap, the estimated latent positions do not lie on the\nsubmanifold of interest.

In this paper, we propose a self-supervised\ncollaborative filtering framework (SelfCF), that is specially designed for\nrecommender scenario with implicit feedback. The main idea of SelfCF is to\naugment the output embeddings generated by backbone networks, because it is\ninfeasible to augment raw input of user/item ids. We propose and study three\noutput perturbation techniques that can be applied to different types of\nbackbone networks including both traditional CF models and graph-based models.\nBy encapsulating two popular recommendation models into the framework, our\nexperiments on three datasets show that the best performance of our framework\nis comparable or better than the supervised counterpart. We also show that\nSelfCF can boost up the performance by up to 8.93\\% on average, compared with\nanother self-supervised framework as the baseline.

          "description": "Efficiently approximating local curvature information of the loss function is\na key tool for optimization and compression of deep neural networks. Yet, most\nexisting methods to approximate second-order information have high\ncomputational or storage costs, which can limit their practicality. In this\nwork, we investigate matrix-free, linear-time approaches for estimating\nInverse-Hessian Vector Products (IHVPs) for the case when the Hessian can be\napproximated as a sum of rank-one matrices, as in the classic approximation of\nthe Hessian by the empirical Fisher matrix. We propose two new algorithms as\npart of a framework called M-FAC: the first algorithm is tailored towards\nnetwork compression and can compute the IHVP for dimension $d$, if the Hessian\nis given as a sum of $m$ rank-one matrices, using $O(dm^2)$ precomputation,\n$O(dm)$ cost for computing the IHVP, and query cost $O(m)$ for any single\nelement of the inverse Hessian. The second algorithm targets an optimization\nsetting, where we wish to compute the product between the inverse Hessian,\nestimated over a sliding window of optimization steps, and a given gradient\ndirection, as required for preconditioned SGD. We give an algorithm with cost\n$O(dm + m^2)$ for computing the IHVP and $O(dm + m^3)$ for adding or removing\nany gradient from the sliding window. These two algorithms yield\nstate-of-the-art results for network pruning and optimization with lower\ncomputational overhead relative to existing second-order methods.\nImplementations are available at [10] and [18].",

          "description": "Channel capacity plays a crucial role in the development of modern\ncommunication systems as it represents the maximum rate at which information\ncan be reliably transmitted over a communication channel. Nevertheless, for the\nmajority of channels, finding a closed-form capacity expression remains an open\nchallenge. This is because it requires to carry out two formidable tasks a) the\ncomputation of the mutual information between the channel input and output, and\nb) its maximization with respect to the signal distribution at the channel\ninput. In this paper, we address both tasks. Inspired by implicit generative\nmodels, we propose a novel cooperative framework to automatically learn the\nchannel capacity, for any type of memory-less channel. In particular, we\nfirstly develop a new methodology to estimate the mutual information directly\nfrom a discriminator typically deployed to train adversarial networks, referred\nto as discriminative mutual information estimator (DIME). Secondly, we include\nthe discriminator in a cooperative channel capacity learning framework,\nreferred to as CORTICAL, where a discriminator learns to distinguish between\ndependent and independent channel input-output samples while a generator learns\nto produce the optimal channel input distribution for which the discriminator\nexhibits the best performance. Lastly, we prove that a particular choice of the\ncooperative value function solves the channel capacity estimation problem.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed method offers high accuracy.",

However,\nexisting works often fuse multiple views' representations or handle clustering\nin a common feature space, which may result in their entanglement especially\nfor visual representations. To address this issue, we present a novel VAE-based\nmulti-view clustering framework (Multi-VAE) by learning disentangled visual\nrepresentations. Concretely, we define a view-common variable and multiple\nview-peculiar variables in the generative model. The prior of view-common\nvariable obeys approximately discrete Gumbel Softmax distribution, which is\nintroduced to extract the common cluster factor of multiple views. Meanwhile,\nthe prior of view-peculiar variable follows continuous Gaussian distribution,\nwhich is used to represent each view's peculiar visual factors. By controlling\nthe mutual information capacity to disentangle the view-common and\nview-peculiar representations, continuous visual information of multiple views\ncan be separated so that their common discrete cluster information can be\neffectively mined.

This provides an interesting algorithmic\nview of $\\ell_2$ regularization, and is in contrast to the conventional view\nthat the $\\ell_2$ regularization solution path is similar to the gradient flow\nof the empirical loss.New path-following algorithms based on homotopy methods\nand numerical ODE solvers are proposed to numerically approximate the solution\npath. In particular, we consider respectively Newton method and gradient\ndescent method as the basis algorithm for the homotopy method, and establish\ntheir approximation error rates over the solution path.

The proposed approach uses double\nsigmoid loss function as described by Kulin Shah and Naresh Manwani in (\"Online\nActive Learning of Reject Option Classifiers\", AAAI, 2020), as a performance\nmeasure. We show that the double sigmoid loss is classification calibrated. We\nalso show that the excess risk of 0-d-1 loss is upper bounded by the excess\nrisk of double sigmoid loss. We derive the generalization error bounds for the\nproposed architecture for reject option classifiers. To show the effectiveness\nof the proposed approach, we experiment with several real world datasets. We\nobserve that the proposed approach not only performs comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art approaches, it is also robust against label noise.

          "description": "Gaussian process (GP) model based optimization is widely applied in\nsimulation and machine learning. In general, it first estimates a GP model\nbased on a few observations from the true response and then employs this model\nto guide the search, aiming to quickly locate the global optimum. Despite its\nsuccessful applications, it has several limitations that may hinder its broader\nusage. First, building an accurate GP model can be difficult and\ncomputationally expensive, especially when the response function is multi-modal\nor varies significantly over the design space. Second, even with an appropriate\nmodel, the search process can be trapped in suboptimal regions before moving to\nthe global optimum due to the excessive effort spent around the current best\nsolution. In this work, we adopt the Additive Global and Local GP (AGLGP) model\nin the optimization framework. The model is rooted in the inducing-points-based\nGP sparse approximations and is combined with independent local models in\ndifferent regions. With these properties, the AGLGP model is suitable for\nmulti-modal responses with relatively large data sizes. Based on this AGLGP\nmodel, we propose a Combined Global and Local search for Optimization (CGLO)\nalgorithm. It first divides the whole design space into disjoint local regions\nand identifies a promising region with the global model. Next, a local model in\nthe selected region is fit to guide detailed search within this region. The\nalgorithm then switches back to the global step when a good local solution is\nfound. The global and local natures of CGLO enable it to enjoy the benefits of\nboth global and local search to efficiently locate the global optimum.",

          "description": "In healthcare applications, predictive uncertainty has been used to assess\npredictive accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that predictive uncertainty\nestimated by the current methods does not highly correlate with prediction\nerror by decomposing the latter into random and systematic errors, and showing\nthat the former is equivalent to the variance of the random error. In addition,\nwe observe that current methods unnecessarily compromise performance by\nmodifying the model and training loss to estimate the target and uncertainty\njointly. We show that estimating them separately without modifications improves\nperformance. Following this, we propose a novel method that estimates the\ntarget labels and magnitude of the prediction error in two steps.

          "description": "Deepfakes pose growing challenges to the trust of information on the\nInternet. Thus, detecting deepfakes has attracted increasing attentions from\nboth academia and industry. State-of-the-art deepfake detection methods consist\nof two key components, i.e., face extractor and face classifier, which extract\nthe face region in an image and classify it to be real/fake, respectively.\nExisting studies mainly focused on improving the detection performance in\nnon-adversarial settings, leaving security of deepfake detection in adversarial\nsettings largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap. In\nparticular, we perform a systematic measurement study to understand the\nsecurity of the state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods in adversarial\nsettings. We use two large-scale public deepfakes data sources including\nFaceForensics++ and Facebook Deepfake Detection Challenge, where the deepfakes\nare fake face images; and we train state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods.\nThese detection methods can achieve 0.94--0.99 accuracies in non-adversarial\nsettings on these datasets. However, our measurement results uncover multiple\nsecurity limitations of the deepfake detection methods in adversarial settings.\nFirst, we find that an attacker can evade a face extractor, i.e., the face\nextractor fails to extract the correct face regions, via adding small Gaussian\nnoise to its deepfake images. Second, we find that a face classifier trained\nusing deepfakes generated by one method cannot detect deepfakes generated by\nanother method, i.e., an attacker can evade detection via generating deepfakes\nusing a new method. Third, we find that an attacker can leverage backdoor\nattacks developed by the adversarial machine learning community to evade a face\nclassifier. Our results highlight that deepfake detection should consider the\nadversarial nature of the problem.",

          "description": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between humans\nand machines by translating brain activity into control commands. EEG is one of\nthe most common sources of neural signals because of its inexpensive and\nnon-invasive nature. However, interpretation of EEG signals is non-trivial\nbecause EEG signals have a low spatial resolution and are often distorted with\nnoise and artifacts. Therefore, it is possible that meaningful patterns for\nclassifying EEG signals are deeply hidden. Nowadays, state-of-the-art\ndeep-learning algorithms have proven to be quite efficient in learning hidden,\nmeaningful patterns. However, the performance of the deep learning algorithms\ndepends upon the quality and the amount of the provided training data. Hence, a\nbetter input formation (feature extraction) technique and a generative model to\nproduce high-quality data can enable the deep learning algorithms to adapt high\ngeneralization quality. In this study, we proposed a novel input formation\n(feature extraction) method in conjunction with a novel deep learning based\ngenerative model to harness new training examples. The feature vectors are\nextracted using a modified Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) called\nanchored-STFT. Anchored-STFT, inspired by wavelet transform, tries to minimize\nthe tradeoff between time and frequency resolution. As a result, it extracts\nthe inputs (feature vectors) with better time and frequency resolution compared\nto the standard STFT. Secondly, we introduced a novel generative adversarial\ndata augmentation technique called gradient norm adversarial augmentation\n(GNAA) for generating more training data. Thirdly, we investigated the\nexistence and significance of adversarial inputs in EEG data. Our approach\nobtained the kappa value of 0.814 for BCI competition II dataset III and 0.755\nfor BCI competition IV dataset 2b for session-to-session transfer on test data.",

          "description": "There is significant interest in learning and optimizing a complex system\ncomposed of multiple sub-components, where these components may be agents or\nautonomous sensors. Among the rich literature on this topic, agent-based and\ndomain-specific simulations can capture complex dynamics and subgroup\ninteraction, but optimizing over such simulations can be computationally and\nalgorithmically challenging. Bayesian approaches, such as Gaussian processes\n(GPs), can be used to learn a computationally tractable approximation to the\nunderlying dynamics but typically neglect the detailed information about\nsubgroups in the complicated system. We attempt to find the best of both worlds\nby proposing the idea of decomposed feedback, which captures group-based\nheterogeneity and dynamics. We introduce a novel decomposed GP regression to\nincorporate the subgroup decomposed feedback. Our modified regression has\nprovably lower variance -- and thus a more accurate posterior -- compared to\nprevious approaches; it also allows us to introduce a decomposed GP-UCB\noptimization algorithm that leverages subgroup feedback. The Bayesian nature of\nour method makes the optimization algorithm trackable with a theoretical\nguarantee on convergence and no-regret property. To demonstrate the wide\napplicability of this work, we execute our algorithm on two disparate social\nproblems: infectious disease control in a heterogeneous population and\nallocation of distributed weather sensors.

          "description": "Partition of unity networks (POU-Nets) have been shown capable of realizing\nalgebraic convergence rates for regression and solution of PDEs, but require\nempirical tuning of training parameters. We enrich POU-Nets with a Gaussian\nnoise model to obtain a probabilistic generalization amenable to gradient-based\nminimization of a maximum likelihood loss. The resulting architecture provides\nspatial representations of both noiseless and noisy data as Gaussian mixtures\nwith closed form expressions for variance which provides an estimator of local\nerror. The training process yields remarkably sharp partitions of input space\nbased upon correlation of function values. This classification of training\npoints is amenable to a hierarchical refinement strategy that significantly\nimproves the localization of the regression, allowing for higher-order\npolynomial approximation to be utilized. The framework scales more favorably to\nlarge data sets as compared to Gaussian process regression and allows for\nspatially varying uncertainty, leveraging the expressive power of deep neural\nnetworks while bypassing expensive training associated with other probabilistic\ndeep learning methods. Compared to standard deep neural networks, the framework\ndemonstrates hp-convergence without the use of regularizers to tune the\nlocalization of partitions. We provide benchmarks quantifying performance in\nhigh/low-dimensions, demonstrating that convergence rates depend only on the\nlatent dimension of data within high-dimensional space. Finally, we introduce a\nnew open-source data set of PDE-based simulations of a semiconductor device and\nperform unsupervised extraction of a physically interpretable reduced-order\nbasis.",

These features are especially\nsignificant for multi-antenna wireless communications systems, which generate\nand handle massive data. Multiple antennas may provide multiplexing, diversity,\nor antenna gains that, respectively, improve the capacity, bit error rate, or\nthe signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. In practice, multi-antenna\ncognitive communications encounter challenges in terms of data complexity and\ndiversity, hardware complexity, and wireless channel dynamics. The DL-based\nsolutions tackle these problems at the various stages of communications\nprocessing such as channel estimation, hybrid beamforming, user localization,\nand sparse array design.

In this work, we present a study on training\ninstance selection in few-shot neural text generation. The selection decision\nis made based only on the unlabeled data so as to identify the most worthwhile\ndata points that should be annotated under some budget of labeling cost. Based\non the intuition that the few-shot training instances should be diverse and\nrepresentative of the entire data distribution, we propose a simple selection\nstrategy with K-means clustering.

These\ndatasets often suffer from severe class imbalance. As a result, networks often\noverfit and are unable to generalize to novel examples. Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) offer a novel method of synthetic data augmentation. In this\nwork, we evaluate the use of GAN- based data augmentation to artificially\nexpand the CheXpert dataset of chest radiographs. We compare performance to\ntraditional augmentation and find that GAN-based augmentation leads to higher\ndownstream performance for underrepresented classes. Furthermore, we see that\nthis result is pronounced in low data regimens.

          "description": "Deep learning is found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, its\nadversarial susceptibility in image caption generation is under-explored. We\nstudy adversarial examples for vision and language models, which typically\nadopt an encoder-decoder framework consisting of two major components: a\nConvolutional Neural Network (i.e., CNN) for image feature extraction and a\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) for caption generation. In particular, we\ninvestigate attacks on the visual encoder's hidden layer that is fed to the\nsubsequent recurrent network. The existing methods either attack the\nclassification layer of the visual encoder or they back-propagate the gradients\nfrom the language model. In contrast, we propose a GAN-based algorithm for\ncrafting adversarial examples for neural image captioning that mimics the\ninternal representation of the CNN such that the resulting deep features of the\ninput image enable a controlled incorrect caption generation through the\nrecurrent network. Our contribution provides new insights for understanding\nadversarial attacks on vision systems with language component. The proposed\nmethod employs two strategies for a comprehensive evaluation. The first\nexamines if a neural image captioning system can be misled to output targeted\nimage captions. The second analyzes the possibility of keywords into the\npredicted captions. Experiments show that our algorithm can craft effective\nadversarial images based on the CNN hidden layers to fool captioning framework.\nMoreover, we discover the proposed attack to be highly transferable.

The inferential challenge imposed by the causal hierarchy\nis that data is collected by an agent observing or intervening in a system\n(layers 1 and 2), while its goal may be to understand what would have happened\nhad it taken a different course of action, contrary to what factually ended up\nhappening (layer 3). While there exists a solid understanding of the conditions\nunder which cross-layer inferences are allowed from observations to\ninterventions, the results are somewhat scarcer when targeting counterfactual\nquantities. In this paper, we study the identification of nested\ncounterfactuals from an arbitrary combination of observations and experiments.\nSpecifically, building on a more explicit definition of nested counterfactuals,\nwe prove the counterfactual unnesting theorem (CUT), which allows one to map\narbitrary nested counterfactuals to unnested ones. For instance, applications\nin mediation and fairness analysis usually evoke notions of direct, indirect,\nand spurious effects, which naturally require nesting. Second, we introduce a\nsufficient and necessary graphical condition for counterfactual identification\nfrom an arbitrary combination of observational and experimental distributions.\nLastly, we develop an efficient and complete algorithm for identifying nested\ncounterfactuals; failure of the algorithm returning an expression for a query\nimplies it is not identifiable.",

          "description": "The label bias and selection bias are acknowledged as two reasons in data\nthat will hinder the fairness of machine-learning outcomes. The label bias\noccurs when the labeling decision is disturbed by sensitive features, while the\nselection bias occurs when subjective bias exists during the data sampling.\nEven worse, models trained on such data can inherit or even intensify the\ndiscrimination. Most algorithmic fairness approaches perform an empirical risk\nminimization with predefined fairness constraints, which tends to trade-off\naccuracy for fairness. However, such methods would achieve the desired fairness\nlevel with the sacrifice of the benefits (receive positive outcomes) for\nindividuals affected by the bias. Therefore, we propose a\nBias-TolerantFAirRegularizedLoss (B-FARL), which tries to regain the benefits\nusing data affected by label bias and selection bias. B-FARL takes the biased\ndata as input, calls a model that approximates the one trained with fair but\nlatent data, and thus prevents discrimination without constraints required. In\naddition, we show the effective components by decomposing B-FARL, and we\nutilize the meta-learning framework for the B-FARL optimization.

          "description": "Accurate building energy prediction is useful in various applications\nstarting from building energy automation and management to optimal storage\ncontrol. However, vulnerabilities should be considered when designing building\nenergy prediction models, as intelligent attackers can deliberately influence\nthe model performance using sophisticated attack models. These may consequently\ndegrade the prediction accuracy, which may affect the efficiency and\nperformance of the building energy management systems. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the impact of bi-level poisoning attacks on regression models of\nenergy usage obtained from household appliances. Furthermore, an effective\ncountermeasure against the poisoning attacks on the prediction model is\nproposed in this paper. Attacks and defenses are evaluated on a benchmark\ndataset. Experimental results show that an intelligent cyber-attacker can\npoison the prediction model to manipulate the decision. However, our proposed\nsolution successfully ensures defense against such poisoning attacks\neffectively compared to other benchmark techniques.",

          "description": "Multimodal brain networks characterize complex connectivities among different\nbrain regions from both structural and functional aspects and provide a new\nmeans for mental disease analysis. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have\nbecome a de facto model for analyzing graph-structured data. However, how to\nemploy GNNs to extract effective representations from brain networks in\nmultiple modalities remains rarely explored. Moreover, as brain networks\nprovide no initial node features, how to design informative node attributes and\nleverage edge weights for GNNs to learn is left unsolved. To this end, we\ndevelop a novel multiview GNN for multimodal brain networks. In particular, we\nregard each modality as a view for brain networks and employ contrastive\nlearning for multimodal fusion. Then, we propose a GNN model which takes\nadvantage of the message passing scheme by propagating messages based on degree\nstatistics and brain region connectivities. Extensive experiments on two\nreal-world disease datasets (HIV and Bipolar) demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.",

          "description": "To ensure protection of the intellectual property rights of DNN models,\nwatermarking techniques have been investigated to insert side-information into\nthe models without seriously degrading the performance of original task. One of\nthe threats for the DNN watermarking is the pruning attack such that less\nimportant neurons in the model are pruned to make it faster and more compact as\nwell as to remove the watermark. In this study, we investigate a channel coding\napproach to resist the pruning attack. As the channel model is completely\ndifferent from conventional models like digital images, it has been an open\nproblem what kind of encoding method is suitable for DNN watermarking. A novel\nencoding approach by using constant weight codes to immunize the effects of\npruning attacks is presented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy that introduces an encoding technique for DNN watermarking to make it\nrobust against pruning attacks.",

          "description": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is considered a potential framework to\nimprove many real-world autonomous systems; it has attracted the attention of\nmultiple and diverse fields. Nevertheless, the successful deployment in the\nreal world is a test most of DRL models still need to pass. In this work we\nfocus on this issue by reviewing and evaluating the research efforts from both\ndomain-agnostic and domain-specific communities. On one hand, we offer a\ncomprehensive summary of DRL challenges and summarize the different proposals\nto mitigate them; this helps identifying five gaps of domain-agnostic research.\nOn the other hand, from the domain-specific perspective, we discuss different\nsuccess stories and argue why other models might fail to be deployed. Finally,\nwe take up on ways to move forward accounting for both perspectives.",

          "description": "The success of software crowdsourcing depends on active and trustworthy pool\nof worker supply. The uncertainty of crowd workers' behaviors makes it\nchallenging to predict workers' success and plan accordingly. In a competitive\ncrowdsourcing marketplace, competition for success over shared tasks adds\nanother layer of uncertainty in crowd workers' decision-making process.\nPreliminary analysis on software worker behaviors reveals an alarming task\ndropping rate of 82.9%. These factors lead to the need for an automated\nrecommendation system for CSD workers to improve the visibility and\npredictability of their success in the competition. To that end, this paper\nproposes a collaborative recommendation system for crowd workers. The proposed\nrecommendation system method uses five input metrics based on workers'\ncollaboration history in the pool, workers' preferences in taking tasks in\nterms of monetary prize and duration, workers' specialty, and workers'\nproficiency. The proposed method then recommends the most suitable tasks for a\nworker to compete on based on workers' probability of success in the task.\nExperimental results on 260 active crowd workers demonstrate that just\nfollowing the top three success probabilities of task recommendations, workers\ncan achieve success up to 86%",

          "description": "Earlier studies have shown that classification accuracies of Bayesian\nnetworks (BNs) obtained by maximizing the conditional log likelihood (CLL) of a\nclass variable, given the feature variables, were higher than those obtained by\nmaximizing the marginal likelihood (ML). However, differences between the\nperformances of the two scores in the earlier studies may be attributed to the\nfact that they used approximate learning algorithms, not exact ones. This paper\ncompares the classification accuracies of BNs with approximate learning using\nCLL to those with exact learning using ML. The results demonstrate that the\nclassification accuracies of BNs obtained by maximizing the ML are higher than\nthose obtained by maximizing the CLL for large data. However, the results also\ndemonstrate that the classification accuracies of exact learning BNs using the\nML are much worse than those of other methods when the sample size is small and\nthe class variable has numerous parents. To resolve the problem, we propose an\nexact learning augmented naive Bayes classifier (ANB), which ensures a class\nvariable with no parents. The proposed method is guaranteed to asymptotically\nestimate the identical class posterior to that of the exactly learned BN.\nComparison experiments demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed\nmethod.",
