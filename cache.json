          "description": "We analyze bias in historical corpora as encoded in diachronic distributional\nsemantic models by focusing on two specific forms of bias, namely a political\n(i.e., anti-communism) and racist (i.e., antisemitism) one. For this, we use a\nnew corpus of German parliamentary proceedings, DeuPARL, spanning the period\n1867--2020. We complement this analysis of historical biases in diachronic word\nembeddings with a novel measure of bias on the basis of term co-occurrences and\ngraph-based label propagation. The results of our bias measurements align with\ncommonly perceived historical trends of antisemitic and anti-communist biases\nin German politics in different time periods, thus indicating the viability of\nanalyzing historical bias trends using semantic spaces induced from historical\ncorpora.",

          "description": "Question generation (QG) is a natural language generation task where a model\nis trained to ask questions corresponding to some input text. Most recent\napproaches frame QG as a sequence-to-sequence problem and rely on additional\nfeatures and mechanisms to increase performance; however, these often increase\nmodel complexity, and can rely on auxiliary data unavailable in practical use.\nA single Transformer-based unidirectional language model leveraging transfer\nlearning can be used to produce high quality questions while disposing of\nadditional task-specific complexity. Our QG model, finetuned from GPT-2 Small,\noutperforms several paragraph-level QG baselines on the SQuAD dataset by 0.95\nMETEOR points. Human evaluators rated questions as easy to answer, relevant to\ntheir context paragraph, and corresponding well to natural human speech. Also\nintroduced is a new set of baseline scores on the RACE dataset, which has not\npreviously been used for QG tasks. Further experimentation with varying model\ncapacities and datasets with non-identification type questions is recommended\nin order to further verify the robustness of pretrained Transformer-based LMs\nas question generators.",

In this paper we establish a\ndataset of 622K examples from 154K documents. We pretrain a large language\nmodel to serve as the foundation for autoregressive approaches to the task.

          "description": "Most previous methods for text data augmentation are limited to simple tasks\nand weak baselines. We explore data augmentation on hard tasks (i.e., few-shot\nnatural language understanding) and strong baselines (i.e., pretrained models\nwith over one billion parameters). Under this setting, we reproduced a large\nnumber of previous augmentation methods and found that these methods bring\nmarginal gains at best and sometimes degrade the performance much. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation method FlipDA that jointly\nuses a generative model and a classifier to generate label-flipped data.\nCentral to the idea of FlipDA is the discovery that generating label-flipped\ndata is more crucial to the performance than generating label-preserved data.\nExperiments show that FlipDA achieves a good tradeoff between effectiveness and\nrobustness---it substantially improves many tasks while not negatively\naffecting the others.",

          "description": "Benefiting from large-scale pre-training, we have witnessed significant\nperformance boost on the popular Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. Despite\nrapid progress, it remains unclear whether these state-of-the-art (SOTA) models\nare robust when encountering examples in the wild. To study this, we introduce\nAdversarial VQA, a new large-scale VQA benchmark, collected iteratively via an\nadversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop procedure. Through this new benchmark,\nwe discover several interesting findings. (i) Surprisingly, we find that during\ndataset collection, non-expert annotators can easily attack SOTA VQA models\nsuccessfully. (ii) Both large-scale pre-trained models and adversarial training\nmethods achieve far worse performance on the new benchmark than over standard\nVQA v2 dataset, revealing the fragility of these models while demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our adversarial dataset. (iii) When used for data\naugmentation, our dataset can effectively boost model performance on other\nrobust VQA benchmarks. We hope our Adversarial VQA dataset can shed new light\non robustness study in the community and serve as a valuable benchmark for\nfuture work.",

          "description": "Time is an important dimension in our physical world. Lots of facts can\nevolve with respect to time. For example, the U.S. President might change every\nfour years. Therefore, it is important to consider the time dimension and\nempower the existing QA models to reason over time. However, the existing QA\ndatasets contain rather few time-sensitive questions, hence not suitable for\ndiagnosing or benchmarking the model's temporal reasoning capability. In order\nto promote research in this direction, we propose to construct a time-sensitive\nQA dataset. The dataset is constructed by 1) mining time-evolving facts from\nWikiData and align them to their corresponding Wikipedia page, 2) employing\ncrowd workers to verify and calibrate these noisy facts, 3) generating\nquestion-answer pairs based on the annotated time-sensitive facts. Our dataset\nposes two novel challenges: 1) the model needs to understand both explicit and\nimplicit mention of time information in the long document, 2) the model needs\nto perform temporal reasoning like comparison, addition, subtraction. We\nevaluate different SoTA long-document QA systems like BigBird and FiD on our\ndataset. The best-performing model FiD can only achieve 46\\% accuracy, still\nfar behind the human performance of 87\\%. We demonstrate that these models are\nstill lacking the ability to perform robust temporal understanding and\nreasoning. Therefore, we believe that our dataset could serve as a benchmark to\nempower future studies in temporal reasoning.

          "description": "Creating abstractive summaries from meeting transcripts has proven to be\nchallenging due to the limited amount of labeled data available for training\nneural network models. Moreover, Transformer-based architectures have proven to\nbeat state-of-the-art models in summarizing news data. In this paper, we\nutilize a Transformer-based Pointer Generator Network to generate abstract\nsummaries for meeting transcripts. This model uses 2 LSTMs as an encoder and a\ndecoder, a Pointer network which copies words from the inputted text, and a\nGenerator network to produce out-of-vocabulary words (hence making the summary\nabstractive). Moreover, a coverage mechanism is used to avoid repetition of\nwords in the generated summary. First, we show that training the model on a\nnews summary dataset and using zero-shot learning to test it on the meeting\ndataset proves to produce better results than training it on the AMI meeting\ndataset. Second, we show that training this model first on out-of-domain data,\nsuch as the CNN-Dailymail dataset, followed by a fine-tuning stage on the AMI\nmeeting dataset is able to improve the performance of the model significantly.\nWe test our model on a testing set from the AMI dataset and report the ROUGE-2\nscore of the generated summary to compare with previous literature. We also\nreport the Factual score of our summaries since it is a better benchmark for\nabstractive summaries since the ROUGE-2 score is limited to measuring\nword-overlaps. We show that our improved model is able to improve on previous\nmodels by at least 5 ROUGE-2 scores, which is a substantial improvement. Also,\na qualitative analysis of the summaries generated by our model shows that these\nsummaries and human-readable and indeed capture most of the important\ninformation from the transcripts.",

This paper introduces a novel framework for joint analysis\nof AI-related policy documents and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)\nresearch papers. The collected documents are enriched with metadata and\ninterconnections, using various NLP methods combined with a methodology\ninspired by Institutional Grammar. Based on the information extracted from\ncollected documents, we showcase a series of analyses that help understand\ninteractions, similarities, and differences between documents at different\nstages of institutionalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork to use automatic language analysis tools to understand the dynamics\nbetween XI-ML methods and regulations. We believe that such a system\ncontributes to better cooperation between XAI researchers and AI policymakers.",

          "description": "Recent work building open-domain chatbots has demonstrated that increasing\nmodel size improves performance. On the other hand, latency and connectivity\nconsiderations dictate the move of digital assistants on the device. Giving a\ndigital assistant like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant the ability to discuss\njust about anything leads to the need for reducing the chatbot model size such\nthat it fits on the user's device. We demonstrate that low parameter models can\nsimultaneously retain their general knowledge conversational abilities while\nimproving in a specific domain. Additionally, we propose a generic framework\nthat accounts for variety in question types, tracks reference throughout\nmulti-turn conversations, and removes inconsistent and potentially toxic\nresponses. Our framework seamlessly transitions between chatting and performing\ntransactional tasks, which will ultimately make interactions with digital\nassistants more human-like. We evaluate our framework on 1 internal and 4\npublic benchmark datasets using both automatic (Perplexity) and human (SSA -\nSensibleness and Specificity Average) evaluation metrics and establish\ncomparable performance while reducing model parameters by 90%.",

          "description": "The advent of contextualised language models has brought gains in search\neffectiveness, not just when applied for re-ranking the output of classical\nweighting models such as BM25, but also when used directly for passage indexing\nand retrieval, a technique which is called dense retrieval. In the existing\nliterature in neural ranking, two dense retrieval families have become\napparent: single representation, where entire passages are represented by a\nsingle embedding (usually BERT's [CLS] token, as exemplified by the recent ANCE\napproach), or multiple representations, where each token in a passage is\nrepresented by its own embedding (as exemplified by the recent ColBERT\napproach). These two families have not been directly compared. However, because\nof the likely importance of dense retrieval moving forward, a clear\nunderstanding of their advantages and disadvantages is paramount. To this end,\nthis paper contributes a direct study on their comparative effectiveness,\nnoting situations where each method under/over performs w.r.t. each other, and\nw.r.t. a BM25 baseline. We observe that, while ANCE is more efficient than\nColBERT in terms of response time and memory usage, multiple representations\nare statistically more effective than the single representations for MAP and\nMRR@10. We also show that multiple representations obtain better improvements\nthan single representations for queries that are the hardest for BM25, as well\nas for definitional queries, and those with complex information needs.",

          "description": "Query expansion with pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) is a powerful approach\nto enhance the effectiveness in information retrieval. Recently, with the rapid\nadvance of deep learning techniques, neural text generation has achieved\npromising success in many natural language tasks. To leverage the strength of\ntext generation for information retrieval, in this article, we propose a novel\napproach which effectively integrates text generation models into PRF-based\nquery expansion. In particular, our approach generates augmented query terms\nvia neural text generation models conditioned on both the initial query and\npseudo-relevance feedback. Moreover, in order to train the generative model, we\nadopt the conditional generative adversarial nets (CGANs) and propose the\nPRF-CGAN method in which both the generator and the discriminator are\nconditioned on the pseudo-relevance feedback. We evaluate the performance of\nour approach on information retrieval tasks using two benchmark datasets. The\nexperimental results show that our approach achieves comparable performance or\noutperforms traditional query expansion methods on both the retrieval and\nreranking tasks.",

In this work, we propose to avoid\nmanual annotation and generate a large-scale training dataset for video\nquestion answering making use of automatic cross-modal supervision. We leverage\na question generation transformer trained on text data and use it to generate\nquestion-answer pairs from transcribed video narrations. Given narrated videos,\nwe then automatically generate the HowToVQA69M dataset with 69M\nvideo-question-answer triplets. To handle the open vocabulary of diverse\nanswers in this dataset, we propose a training procedure based on a contrastive\nloss between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer\ntransformer. We introduce the zero-shot VideoQA task and show excellent\nresults, in particular for rare answers. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method\nto significantly outperform the state of the art on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA,\nActivityNet-QA and How2QA.

          "description": "As speech-enabled devices such as smartphones and smart speakers become\nincreasingly ubiquitous, there is growing interest in building automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) systems that can run directly on-device; end-to-end (E2E)\nspeech recognition models such as recurrent neural network transducers and\ntheir variants have recently emerged as prime candidates for this task. Apart\nfrom being accurate and compact, such systems need to decode speech with low\nuser-perceived latency (UPL), producing words as soon as they are spoken. This\nwork examines the impact of various techniques - model architectures, training\ncriteria, decoding hyperparameters, and endpointer parameters - on UPL. Our\nanalyses suggest that measures of model size (parameters, input chunk sizes),\nor measures of computation (e.g., FLOPS, RTF) that reflect the model's ability\nto process input frames are not always strongly correlated with observed UPL.\nThus, conventional algorithmic latency measurements might be inadequate in\naccurately capturing latency observed when models are deployed on embedded\ndevices. Instead, we find that factors affecting token emission latency, and\nendpointing behavior have a larger impact on UPL. We achieve the best trade-off\nbetween latency and word error rate when performing ASR jointly with\nendpointing, while utilizing the recently proposed alignment regularization\nmechanism.",

          "description": "Rapid progress in natural language processing has led to its utilization in a\nvariety of industrial and enterprise settings, including in its use for\ninformation extraction, specifically named entity recognition and relation\nextraction, from documents such as engineering manuals and field maintenance\nreports. While named entity recognition is a well-studied problem, existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches require large labelled datasets which are hard to\nacquire for sensitive data such as maintenance records. Further, industrial\ndomain experts tend to distrust results from black box machine learning models,\nespecially when the extracted information is used in downstream predictive\nmaintenance analytics. We overcome these challenges by developing three\napproaches built on the foundation of domain expert knowledge captured in\ndictionaries and ontologies. We develop a syntactic and semantic rules-based\napproach and an approach leveraging a pre-trained language model, fine-tuned\nfor a question-answering task on top of our base dictionary lookup to extract\nentities of interest from maintenance records. We also develop a preliminary\nontology to represent and capture the semantics of maintenance records. Our\nevaluations on a real-world aviation maintenance records dataset show promising\nresults and help identify challenges specific to named entity recognition in\nthe context of noisy industrial data.",

          "description": "Moving towards human-like linguistic performance is often argued to require\ncompositional generalisation. Whether neural networks exhibit this ability is\ntypically studied using artificial languages, for which the compositionality of\ninput fragments can be guaranteed and their meanings algebraically composed.\nHowever, compositionality in natural language is vastly more complex than this\nrigid, arithmetics-like version of compositionality, and as such artificial\ncompositionality tests do not allow us to draw conclusions about how neural\nmodels deal with compositionality in more realistic scenarios. In this work, we\nre-instantiate three compositionality tests from the literature and reformulate\nthem for neural machine translation (NMT). The results highlight two main\nissues: the inconsistent behaviour of NMT models and their inability to\n(correctly) modulate between local and global processing. Aside from an\nempirical study, our work is a call to action: we should rethink the evaluation\nof compositionality in neural networks of natural language, where composing\nmeaning is not as straightforward as doing the math.",

          "description": "In the domain of Morphology, Inflection is a fundamental and important task\nthat gained a lot of traction in recent years, mostly via SIGMORPHON's\nshared-tasks. With average accuracy above 0.9 over the scores of all languages,\nthe task is considered mostly solved using relatively generic neural\nsequence-to-sequence models, even with little data provided. In this work, we\npropose to re-evaluate morphological inflection models by employing harder\ntrain-test splits that will challenge the generalization capacity of the\nmodels. In particular, as opposed to the na\\\"ive split-by-form, we propose a\nsplit-by-lemma method to challenge the performance on existing benchmarks. Our\nexperiments with the three top-ranked systems on the SIGMORPHON's 2020\nshared-task show that the lemma-split presents an average drop of 30 percentage\npoints in macro-average for the 90 languages included. The effect is most\nsignificant for low-resourced languages with a drop as high as 95 points, but\neven high-resourced languages lose about 10 points on average.

          "description": "Recently, several Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) approaches have been\ndevised to represent entities and relations in dense vector space and employed\nin downstream tasks such as link prediction. A few KGE techniques address\ninterpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations\n(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric\ninterpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in\nhigher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the\nability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,\nmodeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of\ninterpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to\nachieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional\nspace. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view\nthe relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding\nvector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in\nwhich we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE\nconsiders the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing\nexpressivity and interpretability. Our empirical results on four well-known\nbenchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance for the KG completion task.",

          "description": "Fine-tuned language models use greedy decoding to answer reading\ncomprehension questions with relative success. However, this approach does not\nensure that the answer is a span in the given passage, nor does it guarantee\nthat it is the most probable one. Does greedy decoding actually perform worse\nthan an algorithm that does adhere to these properties? To study the\nperformance and optimality of greedy decoding, we present exact-extract, a\ndecoding algorithm that efficiently finds the most probable answer span in the\ncontext. We compare the performance of T5 with both decoding algorithms on\nzero-shot and few-shot extractive question answering. When no training examples\nare available, exact-extract significantly outperforms greedy decoding.\nHowever, greedy decoding quickly converges towards the performance of\nexact-extract with the introduction of a few training examples, becoming more\nextractive and increasingly likelier to generate the most probable span as the\ntraining set grows. We also show that self-supervised training can bias the\nmodel towards extractive behavior, increasing performance in the zero-shot\nsetting without resorting to annotated examples. Overall, our results suggest\nthat pretrained language models are so good at adapting to extractive question\nanswering, that it is often enough to fine-tune on a small training set for the\ngreedy algorithm to emulate the optimal decoding strategy.",

In response,\nwe describe Bridger, a system for facilitating discovery of scholars and their\nwork, to explore design tradeoffs among relevant and novel recommendations. We\nconstruct a faceted representation of authors using information extracted from\ntheir papers and inferred personas.

In studies with\ncomputer science researchers, our approach substantially improves users'\nabilities to do so.

          "description": "Recently, pre-trained language models such as BERT have been applied to\ndocument ranking for information retrieval, which first pre-train a general\nlanguage model on an unlabeled large corpus and then conduct ranking-specific\nfine-tuning on expert-labeled relevance datasets. Ideally, an IR system would\nmodel relevance from a user-system dualism: the user's view and the system's\nview. User's view judges the relevance based on the activities of \"real users\"\nwhile the system's view focuses on the relevance signals from the system side,\ne.g., from the experts or algorithms, etc. Inspired by the user-system\nrelevance views and the success of pre-trained language models, in this paper\nwe propose a novel ranking framework called Pre-Rank that takes both user's\nview and system's view into consideration, under the pre-training and\nfine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, to model the user's view of relevance,\nPre-Rank pre-trains the initial query-document representations based on\nlarge-scale user activities data such as the click log. To model the system's\nview of relevance, Pre-Rank further fine-tunes the model on expert-labeled\nrelevance data. More importantly, the pre-trained representations, are\nfine-tuned together with handcrafted learning-to-rank features under a wide and\ndeep network architecture. In this way, Pre-Rank can model the relevance by\nincorporating the relevant knowledge and signals from both real search users\nand the IR experts. To verify the effectiveness of Pre-Rank, we showed two\nimplementations by using BERT and SetRank as the underlying ranking model,\nrespectively. Experimental results base on three publicly available benchmarks\nshowed that in both of the implementations, Pre-Rank can respectively\noutperform the underlying ranking models and achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances.",

However, little work has\ninvestigated attacks against decision making algorithms that use text\nembeddings, and their output is a ranking. In this paper, we focus on ranking\nalgorithms for recruitment process, that employ text embeddings for ranking\napplicants resumes when compared to a job description. We demonstrate both\nwhite box and black box attacks that identify text items, that based on their\nlocation in embedding space, have significant contribution in increasing the\nsimilarity score between a resume and a job description. The adversary then\nuses these text items to improve the ranking of their resume among others. We\ntested recruitment algorithms that use the similarity scores obtained from\nUniversal Sentence Encoder (USE) and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency\n(TF IDF) vectors. Our results show that in both adversarial settings, on\naverage the attacker is successful. We also found that attacks against TF IDF\nis more successful compared to USE.",

This has led to various attempts of compressing such models, but\nexisting methods have not considered the differences in the predictive power of\nvarious model components or in the generalizability of the compressed models.\nTo understand the connection between model compression and out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, we define the task of compressing language representation\nmodels such that they perform best in a domain adaptation setting.

Owing to sophisticated pre-training objectives and huge\nmodel parameters, large-scale PTMs can effectively capture knowledge from\nmassive labeled and unlabeled data. By storing knowledge into huge parameters\nand fine-tuning on specific tasks, the rich knowledge implicitly encoded in\nhuge parameters can benefit a variety of downstream tasks, which has been\nextensively demonstrated via experimental verification and empirical analysis.\nIt is now the consensus of the AI community to adopt PTMs as backbone for\ndownstream tasks rather than learning models from scratch. In this paper, we\ntake a deep look into the history of pre-training, especially its special\nrelation with transfer learning and self-supervised learning, to reveal the\ncrucial position of PTMs in the AI development spectrum. Further, we\ncomprehensively review the latest breakthroughs of PTMs. These breakthroughs\nare driven by the surge of computational power and the increasing availability\nof data, towards four important directions: designing effective architectures,\nutilizing rich contexts, improving computational efficiency, and conducting\ninterpretation and theoretical analysis.

          "description": "Medical imaging technologies, including computed tomography (CT) or chest\nX-Ray (CXR), are largely employed to facilitate the diagnosis of the COVID-19.\nSince manual report writing is usually too time-consuming, a more intelligent\nauxiliary medical system that could generate medical reports automatically and\nimmediately is urgently needed. In this article, we propose to use the medical\nvisual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the\nCOVID-19 scans and generate the medical report automatically based on the\ndetected lesion regions. To produce more accurate medical reports and minimize\nthe visual-and-linguistic differences, this model adopts an alternate learning\nstrategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.\nTo be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the\nknowledge from medical texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize\nthe acquired knowledge for professional medical sentences generations through\nobservations of medical images. In practice, for automatic medical report\ngeneration on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical\nfindings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital\nof Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun\nYat-sen University, Zhuhai, China. Besides, to alleviate the insufficiency of\nthe COVID-19 training samples, our model was first trained on the large-scale\nChinese CX-CHR dataset and then transferred to the COVID-19 CT dataset for\nfurther fine-tuning. The experimental results showed that Medical-VLBERT\nachieved state-of-the-art performances on terminology prediction and report\ngeneration with the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset and the CX-CHR dataset.

In clinical research studies, especially comparative\neffectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially\ncause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical\nanalyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies\nto examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured\nSBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much\nof the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language\nprocessing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from\nunstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system\nfocusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH\nconcepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract\nSBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the\ndifference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured\nEHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the\nInternational Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show\nthat the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of\n0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH\ninformation and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864\npatients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more\ndetailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only\ncaptured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical\nnarratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of\npatients' SBDoH factors.",

          "description": "Handwritten mathematical expressions (HMEs) contain ambiguities in their\ninterpretations, even for humans sometimes. Several math symbols are very\nsimilar in the writing style, such as dot and comma or 0, O, and o, which is a\nchallenge for HME recognition systems to handle without using contextual\ninformation. To address this problem, this paper presents a Transformer-based\nMath Language Model (TMLM). Based on the self-attention mechanism, the\nhigh-level representation of an input token in a sequence of tokens is computed\nby how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long\ndependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical\nexpression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of\napproximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the\nperplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e.,\nthe N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we\ncombine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition\nsystem using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates. The\nexpression rates on the testing sets of CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 were\nimproved by 2.97 and 0.83 percentage points, respectively.",

A DEMix\nlayer is a collection of expert feedforward networks, each specialized to a\ndomain, that makes the LM modular: experts can be mixed, added or removed after\ninitial training. Extensive experiments with autoregressive transformer LMs (up\nto 1.3B parameters) show that DEMix layers reduce test-time perplexity,\nincrease training efficiency, and enable rapid adaptation with little overhead.\nWe show that mixing experts during inference, using a parameter-free weighted\nensemble, allows the model to better generalize to heterogeneous or unseen\ndomains. We also show that experts can be added to iteratively incorporate new\ndomains without forgetting older ones, and that experts can be removed to\nrestrict access to unwanted domains, without additional training. Overall,\nthese results demonstrate benefits of explicitly conditioning on textual\ndomains during language modeling.",

          "description": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have become increasingly more\ncomplex and widespread. With recent developments in neural networks, a growing\nconcern is whether it is responsible to use these models. Concerns such as\nsafety and ethics can be partially addressed by providing explanations.\nFurthermore, when models do fail, providing explanations is paramount for\naccountability purposes. To this end, interpretability serves to provide these\nexplanations in terms that are understandable to humans. Central to what is\nunderstandable is how explanations are communicated. Therefore, this survey\nprovides a categorization of how recent interpretability methods communicate\nexplanations and discusses the methods in depth. Furthermore, the survey\nfocuses on post-hoc methods, which provide explanations after a model is\nlearned and generally model-agnostic. A common concern for this class of\nmethods is whether they accurately reflect the model. Hence, how these post-hoc\nmethods are evaluated is discussed throughout the paper.",

          "description": "Vision-and-language(V&L) models take image and text as input and learn to\ncapture the associations between them. Prior studies show that pre-trained V&L\nmodels can significantly improve the model performance for downstream tasks\nsuch as Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, V&L models are less effective\nwhen applied in the medical domain (e.g., on X-ray images and clinical notes)\ndue to the domain gap. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of applying\npre-trained V&L models in medical applications. In particular, we identify that\nthe visual representation in general V&L models is not suitable for processing\nmedical data. To overcome this limitation, we propose BERTHop, a\ntransformer-based model based on PixelHop++ and VisualBERT, for better\ncapturing the associations between the two modalities.

However, there are relatively lesser amounts of study that\nconverges on embracing positivity, reinforcing supportive and reassuring\ncontent in online forums. Consequently, we propose creating an English-Kannada\nHope speech dataset, KanHope and comparing several experiments to benchmark the\ndataset. The dataset consists of 6,176 user-generated comments in code mixed\nKannada scraped from YouTube and manually annotated as bearing hope speech or\nNot-hope speech. In addition, we introduce DC-BERT4HOPE, a dual-channel model\nthat uses the English translation of KanHope for additional training to promote\nhope speech detection. The approach achieves a weighted F1-score of 0.756,\nbettering other models. Henceforth, KanHope aims to instigate research in\nKannada while broadly promoting researchers to take a pragmatic approach\ntowards online content that encourages, positive, and supportive.",

          "description": "Understanding documents from their visual snapshots is an emerging problem\nthat requires both advanced computer vision and NLP methods. The recent advance\nin OCR enables the accurate recognition of text blocks, yet it is still\nchallenging to extract key information from documents due to the diversity of\ntheir layouts. Although recent studies on pre-trained language models show the\nimportance of incorporating layout information on this task, the conjugation of\ntexts and their layouts still follows the style of BERT optimized for\nunderstanding the 1D text. This implies there is room for further improvement\nconsidering the 2D nature of text layouts. This paper introduces a pre-trained\nlanguage model, BERT Relying On Spatiality (BROS), which effectively utilizes\nthe information included in individual text blocks and their layouts.\nSpecifically, BROS encodes spatial information by utilizing relative positions\nand learns spatial dependencies between OCR blocks with a novel area-masking\nstrategy. These two novel approaches lead to an efficient encoding of spatial\nlayout information highlighted by the robust performance of BROS under\nlow-resource environments. We also introduce a general-purpose parser that can\nbe combined with BROS to extract key information even when there is no order\ninformation between text blocks. BROS shows its superiority on four public\nbenchmarks---FUNSD, SROIE*, CORD, and SciTSR---and its robustness in practical\ncases where order information of text blocks is not available. Further\nexperiments with a varying number of training examples demonstrate the high\ntraining efficiency of our approach. Our code will be open to the public.",

          "description": "People convey information extremely effectively through spoken interaction\nusing multiple channels of information transmission: the lexical channel of\nwhat is said, and the non-lexical channel of how it is said. We propose\nstudying human perception of spoken communication as a means to better\nunderstand how information is encoded across these channels, focusing on the\nquestion 'What characteristics of communicative context affect listener's\nexpectations of speech?'. To investigate this, we present a novel behavioural\ntask testing whether listeners can discriminate between the true utterance in a\ndialogue and utterances sampled from other contexts with the same lexical\ncontent. We characterize how perception - and subsequent discriminative\ncapability - is affected by different degrees of additional contextual\ninformation across both the lexical and non-lexical channel of speech. Results\ndemonstrate that people can effectively discriminate between different prosodic\nrealisations, that non-lexical context is informative, and that this channel\nprovides more salient information than the lexical channel, highlighting the\nimportance of the non-lexical channel in spoken interaction.",

          "description": "Conventional Intent Detection (ID) models are usually trained offline, which\nrelies on a fixed dataset and a predefined set of intent classes. However, in\nreal-world applications, online systems usually involve continually emerging\nnew user intents, which pose a great challenge to the offline training\nparadigm. Recently, lifelong learning has received increasing attention and is\nconsidered to be the most promising solution to this challenge. In this paper,\nwe propose Lifelong Intent Detection (LID), which continually trains an ID\nmodel on new data to learn newly emerging intents while avoiding\ncatastrophically forgetting old data. Nevertheless, we find that existing\nlifelong learning methods usually suffer from a serious imbalance between old\nand new data in the LID task. Therefore, we propose a novel lifelong learning\nmethod, Multi-Strategy Rebalancing (MSR), which consists of cosine\nnormalization, hierarchical knowledge distillation, and inter-class margin loss\nto alleviate the multiple negative effects of the imbalance problem.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which\nsignificantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods\non the ATIS, SNIPS, HWU64, and CLINC150 benchmarks.",

The mode as well as other high probability\ntranslations found by beam search have been shown to often be inadequate in a\nnumber of ways. This prevents practitioners from improving translation quality\nthrough better search, as these idiosyncratic translations end up being\nselected by the decoding algorithm, a problem known as the beam search curse.\nRecently, a sampling-based approximation to minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding\nhas been proposed as an alternative decision rule for NMT that would likely not\nsuffer from the same problems. We analyse this approximation and establish that\nit has no equivalent to the beam search curse, i.e. better search always leads\nto better translations. We also design different approximations aimed at\ndecoupling the cost of exploration from the cost of robust estimation of\nexpected utility. This allows for exploration of much larger hypothesis spaces,\nwhich we show to be beneficial. We also show that it can be beneficial to make\nuse of strategies like beam search and nucleus sampling to construct hypothesis\nspaces efficiently.

          "description": "Multi-head attention, a collection of several attention mechanisms that\nindependently attend to different parts of the input, is the key ingredient in\nthe Transformer (Vaswaniet al., 2017). Recent work has shown, however, that a\nlarge proportion of the heads in a Transformer's multi-head attention mechanism\ncan be safely pruned away without significantly harming the performance of the\nmodel; such pruning leads to models that are noticeably smaller and faster in\npractice. Our work introduces a new head pruning technique that we term\ndifferentiable subset pruning. Intuitively, our method learns per-head\nimportance variables and then enforces a user-specified hard constraint on the\nnumber of unpruned heads. The importance variables are learned via stochastic\ngradient descent. We conduct experiments on natural language inference and\nmachine translation; we show that differentiable subset pruning performs\ncomparably or better than Voita et al. (2019) while offering the same exact\ncontrol over the number of heads as Michel et al. (2019).",

          "description": "Intelligent recommendation and reminder systems are the need of the\nfast-pacing life. Current intelligent systems such as Siri, Google Assistant,\nMicrosoft Cortona, etc., have limited capability. For example, if you want to\nwake up at 6 am because you have an upcoming trip, you have to set the alarm\nmanually. Besides, these systems do not recommend or remind what else to carry,\nsuch as carrying an umbrella during a likely rain. The present work proposes a\nsystem that takes an email as input and returns a recommendation-cumreminder\nlist. As a first step, we parse the emails, recognize the entities using named\nentity recognition (NER). In the second step, information retrieval over the\nweb is done to identify nearby places, climatic conditions, etc. Imperative\nsentences from the reviews of all places are extracted and passed to the object\nextraction module. The main challenge lies in extracting the objects (items) of\ninterest from the review. To solve it, a modified Machine Reading\nComprehension-NER (MRC-NER) model is trained to tag objects of interest by\nformulating annotation rules as a query. The objects so found are recommended\nto the user one day in advance. The final reminder list of objects is pruned by\nour proposed model for tracking objects kept during the \"packing activity.\"\nEventually, when the user leaves for the event/trip, an alert is sent\ncontaining the reminding list items. Our approach achieves superior performance\ncompared to several baselines by as much as 30% on recall and 10% on precision.",

          "description": "Recently, dense passage retrieval has become a mainstream approach to finding\nrelevant information in various natural language processing tasks. A number of\nstudies have been devoted to improving the widely adopted dual-encoder\narchitecture. However, most of the previous studies only consider query-centric\nsimilarity relation when learning the dual-encoder retriever. In order to\ncapture more comprehensive similarity relations, we propose a novel approach\nthat leverages both query-centric and PAssage-centric sImilarity Relations\n(called PAIR) for dense passage retrieval. To implement our approach, we make\nthree major technical contributions by introducing formal formulations of the\ntwo kinds of similarity relations, generating high-quality pseudo labeled data\nvia knowledge distillation, and designing an effective two-stage training\nprocedure that incorporates passage-centric similarity relation constraint.\nExtensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art models on both MSMARCO and Natural Questions datasets.",

          "description": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is a long-standing problem of recommender\nsystems. Many novel methods have been proposed, ranging from classical matrix\nfactorization to recent graph convolutional network-based approaches. After\nrecent fierce debates, researchers started to focus on linear graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs) with a layer combination, which show\nstate-of-the-art accuracy in many datasets. In this work, we extend them based\non neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), because the linear GCN\nconcept can be interpreted as a differential equation, and present the method\nof Learnable-Time ODE-based Collaborative Filtering (LT-OCF). The main novelty\nin our method is that after redesigning linear GCNs on top of the NODE regime,\ni) we learn the optimal architecture rather than relying on manually designed\nones, ii) we learn smooth ODE solutions that are considered suitable for CF,\nand iii) we test with various ODE solvers that internally build a diverse set\nof neural network connections. We also present a novel training method\nspecialized to our method. In our experiments with three benchmark datasets,\nGowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-Book, our method consistently shows better\naccuracy than existing methods, e.g., a recall of 0.0411 by LightGCN vs. 0.0442\nby LT-OCF and an NDCG of 0.0315 by LightGCN vs. 0.0341 by LT-OCF in\nAmazon-Book. One more important discovery in our experiments that is worth\nmentioning is that our best accuracy was achieved by dense connections rather\nthan linear connections.",

          "description": "The advent of contextualised language models has brought gains in search\neffectiveness, not just when applied for re-ranking the output of classical\nweighting models such as BM25, but also when used directly for passage indexing\nand retrieval, a technique which is called dense retrieval. In the existing\nliterature in neural ranking, two dense retrieval families have become\napparent: single representation, where entire passages are represented by a\nsingle embedding (usually BERT's [CLS] token, as exemplified by the recent ANCE\napproach), or multiple representations, where each token in a passage is\nrepresented by its own embedding (as exemplified by the recent ColBERT\napproach). These two families have not been directly compared. However, because\nof the likely importance of dense retrieval moving forward, a clear\nunderstanding of their advantages and disadvantages is paramount. To this end,\nthis paper contributes a direct study on their comparative effectiveness,\nnoting situations where each method under/over performs w.r.t. each other, and\nw.r.t. a BM25 baseline. We observe that, while ANCE is more efficient than\nColBERT in terms of response time and memory usage, multiple representations\nare statistically more effective than the single representations for MAP and\nMRR@10. We also show that multiple representations obtain better improvements\nthan single representations for queries that are the hardest for BM25, as well\nas for definitional queries, and those with complex information needs.",

          "description": "Modern E-commerce websites contain heterogeneous sources of information, such\nas numerical ratings, textual reviews and images.

However, most of the previous algorithms were\nonly utilizing the review information for explicit-feedback problem i.e. rating\nprediction, and when it comes to implicit-feedback ranking problem such as\ntop-N recommendation, the usage of review information has not been fully\nexplored.

We find that models utilizing only review\ninformation can not achieve better performances than vanilla implicit-feedback\nmatrix factorization method.

In this\narticle, LSA and CA are compared from a theoretical point of view and applied\nin both a toy example and an authorship attribution example. In text mining\ninterest goes out to the relationships among documents and terms: for example,\nwhat terms are more often used in what documents. However, the LSA solution\ndisplays a mix of marginal effects and these relationships. It appears that CA\nhas more attractive properties than LSA. One such property is that, in CA, the\neffect of the margins is effectively eliminated, so that the CA solution is\noptimally suited to focus on the relationships among documents and terms. Three\nmechanisms are distinguished to weight documents and terms, and a unifying\nframework is proposed that includes these three mechanisms and includes both CA\nand LSA as special cases. In the authorship attribution example, the national\nanthem of the Netherlands, the application of the discussed methods is\nillustrated.",

The key of\nrecommender systems is to predict how likely users will interact with items\nbased on their historical online behaviors, e.g., clicks, add-to-cart,\npurchases, etc. To exploit these user-item interactions, there are increasing\nefforts on considering the user-item interactions as a user-item bipartite\ngraph and then performing information propagation in the graph via Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs). Given the power of GNNs in graph representation learning,\nthese GNN-based recommendation methods have remarkably boosted the\nrecommendation performance. Despite their success, most existing GNN-based\nrecommender systems overlook the existence of interactions caused by unreliable\nbehaviors (e.g., random/bait clicks) and uniformly treat all the interactions,\nwhich can lead to sub-optimal and unstable performance. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the drawbacks (e.g., non-adaptive propagation and non-robustness)\nof existing GNN-based recommendation methods. To address these drawbacks, we\npropose the Graph Trend Networks for recommendations (GTN) with principled\ndesigns that can capture the adaptive reliability of the interactions.\nComprehensive experiments and ablation studies are presented to verify and\nunderstand the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

          "description": "The top search results matching a user query that are displayed on the first\npage are critical to the effectiveness and perception of a search system. A\nsearch ranking system typically orders the results by independent\nquery-document scores to produce a slate of search results. However, such\nunilateral scoring methods may fail to capture inter-document dependencies that\nusers are sensitive to, thus producing a sub-optimal slate. Further, in\npractice, many real-world applications such as e-commerce search require\nenforcing certain distributional criteria at the slate-level, due to business\nobjectives or long term user retention goals. Unilateral scoring of results\ndoes not explicitly support optimizing for such objectives with respect to a\nslate. Hence, solutions to the slate optimization problem must consider the\noptimal selection and order of the documents, along with adherence to\nslate-level distributional criteria. To that end, we propose a hybrid framework\nextended from traditional slate optimization to solve the conditional slate\noptimization problem. We introduce conditional sequential slate optimization\n(CSSO), which jointly learns to optimize for traditional ranking metrics as\nwell as prescribed distribution criteria of documents within the slate. The\nproposed method can be applied to practical real world problems such as\nenforcing diversity in e-commerce search results, mitigating bias in top\nresults and personalization of results.

          "description": "The purpose of the Session-Based Recommendation System is to predict the\nuser's next click according to the previous session sequence. The current\nstudies generally learn user preferences according to the transitions of items\nin the user's session sequence. However, other effective information in the\nsession sequence, such as user profiles, are largely ignored which may lead to\nthe model unable to learn the user's specific preferences. In this paper, we\npropose a heterogeneous graph neural network-based session recommendation\nmethod, named SR-HetGNN, which can learn session embeddings by heterogeneous\ngraph neural network (HetGNN), and capture the specific preferences of\nanonymous users. Specifically, SR-HetGNN first constructs heterogeneous graphs\ncontaining various types of nodes according to the session sequence, which can\ncapture the dependencies among items, users, and sessions. Second, HetGNN\ncaptures the complex transitions between items and learns the item embeddings\ncontaining user information. Finally, to consider the influence of users' long\nand short-term preferences, local and global session embeddings are combined\nwith the attentional network to obtain the final session embedding. SR-HetGNN\nis shown to be superior to the existing state-of-the-art session-based\nrecommendation methods through extensive experiments over two real large\ndatasets Diginetica and Tmall.",

          "description": "All learning algorithms for recommendations face inevitable and critical\ntrade-off between exploiting partial knowledge of a user's preferences for\nshort-term satisfaction and exploring additional user preferences for long-term\ncoverage. Although exploration is indispensable for long success of a\nrecommender system, the exploration has been considered as the risk to decrease\nuser satisfaction. The reason for the risk is that items chosen for exploration\nfrequently mismatch with the user's interests. To mitigate this risk,\nrecommender systems have mixed items chosen for exploration into a\nrecommendation list, disguising the items as recommendations to elicit feedback\non the items to discover the user's additional tastes. This mix-in approach has\nbeen widely used in many recommenders, but there is rare research, evaluating\nthe effectiveness of the mix-in approach or proposing a new approach for\neliciting user feedback without deceiving users. In this work, we aim to\npropose a new approach for feedback elicitation without any deception and\ncompare our approach to the conventional mix-in approach for evaluation. To\nthis end, we designed a recommender interface that reveals which items are for\nexploration and conducted a within-subject study with 94 MTurk workers. Our\nresults indicated that users left significantly more feedback on items chosen\nfor exploration with our interface. Besides, users evaluated that our new\ninterface is better than the conventional mix-in interface in terms of novelty,\ndiversity, transparency, trust, and satisfaction. Finally, path analysis show\nthat, in only our new interface, exploration caused to increase user-centric\nevaluation metrics. Our work paves the way for how to design an interface,\nwhich utilizes learning algorithm based on users' feedback signals, giving\nbetter user experience and gathering more feedback data.",

          "description": "Recently, pre-trained language models such as BERT have been applied to\ndocument ranking for information retrieval, which first pre-train a general\nlanguage model on an unlabeled large corpus and then conduct ranking-specific\nfine-tuning on expert-labeled relevance datasets. Ideally, an IR system would\nmodel relevance from a user-system dualism: the user's view and the system's\nview. User's view judges the relevance based on the activities of \"real users\"\nwhile the system's view focuses on the relevance signals from the system side,\ne.g., from the experts or algorithms, etc. Inspired by the user-system\nrelevance views and the success of pre-trained language models, in this paper\nwe propose a novel ranking framework called Pre-Rank that takes both user's\nview and system's view into consideration, under the pre-training and\nfine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, to model the user's view of relevance,\nPre-Rank pre-trains the initial query-document representations based on\nlarge-scale user activities data such as the click log. To model the system's\nview of relevance, Pre-Rank further fine-tunes the model on expert-labeled\nrelevance data. More importantly, the pre-trained representations, are\nfine-tuned together with handcrafted learning-to-rank features under a wide and\ndeep network architecture. In this way, Pre-Rank can model the relevance by\nincorporating the relevant knowledge and signals from both real search users\nand the IR experts. To verify the effectiveness of Pre-Rank, we showed two\nimplementations by using BERT and SetRank as the underlying ranking model,\nrespectively. Experimental results base on three publicly available benchmarks\nshowed that in both of the implementations, Pre-Rank can respectively\noutperform the underlying ranking models and achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances.",

          "description": "Recently, several Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) approaches have been\ndevised to represent entities and relations in dense vector space and employed\nin downstream tasks such as link prediction. A few KGE techniques address\ninterpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations\n(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric\ninterpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in\nhigher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the\nability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,\nmodeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of\ninterpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to\nachieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional\nspace. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view\nthe relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding\nvector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in\nwhich we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE\nconsiders the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing\nexpressivity and interpretability. Our empirical results on four well-known\nbenchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance for the KG completion task.",

In this paper, we study how to\nconstruct effective explainable product search by comparing model-agnostic\nexplanation paradigms with model-intrinsic paradigms and analyzing the\nimportant factors that determine the performance of product search\nexplanations. We propose an explainable product search model with\nmodel-intrinsic interpretability and conduct crowdsourcing to compare it with\nthe state-of-the-art explainable product search model with model-agnostic\ninterpretability. We observe that both paradigms have their own advantages and\nthe effectiveness of search explanations on different properties are affected\nby different factors. For example, explanation fidelity is more important for\nuser's overall satisfaction on the system while explanation novelty may be more\nuseful in attracting user purchases.

          "description": "Being light-weight and cost-effective, IR-based approaches for bug\nlocalization have shown promise in finding software bugs. However, the accuracy\nof these approaches heavily depends on their used bug reports. A significant\nnumber of bug reports contain only plain natural language texts. According to\nexisting studies, IR-based approaches cannot perform well when they use these\nbug reports as search queries. On the other hand, there is a piece of recent\nevidence that suggests that even these natural language-only reports contain\nenough good keywords that could help localize the bugs successfully. On one\nhand, these findings suggest that natural language-only bug reports might be a\nsufficient source for good query keywords. On the other hand, they cast serious\ndoubt on the query selection practices in the IR-based bug localization. In\nthis article, we attempted to clear the sky on this aspect by conducting an\nin-depth empirical study that critically examines the state-of-the-art query\nselection practices in IR-based bug localization. In particular, we use a\ndataset of 2,320 bug reports, employ ten existing approaches from the\nliterature, exploit the Genetic Algorithm-based approach to construct optimal,\nnear-optimal search queries from these bug reports, and then answer three\nresearch questions. We confirmed that the state-of-the-art query construction\napproaches are indeed not sufficient for constructing appropriate queries (for\nbug localization) from certain natural language-only bug reports although they\ncontain such queries. We also demonstrate that optimal queries and non-optimal\nqueries chosen from bug report texts are significantly different in terms of\nseveral keyword characteristics, which has led us to actionable insights.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate 27%--34% improvement in the performance of\nnon-optimal queries through the application of our actionable insights to them.",

Existing studies on unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) can\nbe generalized into two families-algorithms that attain unbiasedness with\nlogged data, offline learning, and algorithms that achieve unbiasedness by\nestimating unbiased parameters with real-time user interactions, namely online\nlearning. While there exist many algorithms from both families, there lacks a\nunified way to compare and benchmark them. As a result, it can be challenging\nfor researchers to choose the right technique for their problems or for people\nwho are new to the field to learn and understand existing algorithms. To solve\nthis problem, we introduced ULTRA, which is a flexible, extensible, and easily\nconfigure ULTR toolbox. Its key features include support for multiple ULTR\nalgorithms with configurable hyperparameters, a variety of built-in click\nmodels that can be used separately to simulate clicks, different ranking model\narchitecture and evaluation metrics, and simple learning to rank pipeline\ncreation. In this paper, we discuss the general framework of ULTR, briefly\ndescribe the algorithms in ULTRA, detailed the structure, and pipeline of the\ntoolbox. We experimented on all the algorithms supported by ultra and showed\nthat the toolbox performance is reasonable. Our toolbox is an important\nresource for researchers to conduct experiments on ULTR algorithms with\ndifferent configurations as well as testing their own algorithms with the\nsupported features.",

          "description": "Prediction over tabular data is an essential task in many data science\napplications such as recommender systems, online advertising, medical\ntreatment, etc. Tabular data is structured into rows and columns, with each row\nas a data sample and each column as a feature attribute. Both the columns and\nrows of the tabular data carry useful patterns that could improve the model\nprediction performance. However, most existing models focus on the cross-column\npatterns yet overlook the cross-row patterns as they deal with single samples\nindependently. In this work, we propose a general learning framework named\nRetrieval & Interaction Machine (RIM) that fully exploits both cross-row and\ncross-column patterns among tabular data. Specifically, RIM first leverages\nsearch engine techniques to efficiently retrieve useful rows of the table to\nassist the label prediction of the target row, then uses feature interaction\nnetworks to capture the cross-column patterns among the target row and the\nretrieved rows so as to make the final label prediction. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on 11 datasets of three important tasks, i.e., CTR prediction\n(classification), top-n recommendation (ranking) and rating prediction\n(regression). Experimental results show that RIM achieves significant\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art and various baselines, demonstrating the\nsuperiority and efficacy of RIM.",

          "description": "Recently, we have witnessed the bloom of neural ranking models in the\ninformation retrieval (IR) field. So far, much effort has been devoted to\ndeveloping effective neural ranking models that can generalize well on new\ndata. There has been less attention paid to the robustness perspective. Unlike\nthe effectiveness which is about the average performance of a system under\nnormal purpose, robustness cares more about the system performance in the worst\ncase or under malicious operations instead. When a new technique enters into\nthe real-world application, it is critical to know not only how it works in\naverage, but also how would it behave in abnormal situations. So we raise the\nquestion in this work: Are neural ranking models robust? To answer this\nquestion, firstly, we need to clarify what we refer to when we talk about the\nrobustness of ranking models in IR. We show that robustness is actually a\nmulti-dimensional concept and there are three ways to define it in IR: 1) The\nperformance variance under the independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.)\nsetting; 2) The out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability; and 3) The\ndefensive ability against adversarial operations. The latter two definitions\ncan be further specified into two different perspectives respectively, leading\nto 5 robustness tasks in total. Based on this taxonomy, we build corresponding\nbenchmark datasets, design empirical experiments, and systematically analyze\nthe robustness of several representative neural ranking models against\ntraditional probabilistic ranking models and learning-to-rank (LTR) models. The\nempirical results show that there is no simple answer to our question. While\nneural ranking models are less robust against other IR models in most cases,\nsome of them can still win 1 out of 5 tasks. This is the first comprehensive\nstudy on the robustness of neural ranking models.",

          "description": "Question Answering (QA), a popular and promising technique for intelligent\ninformation access, faces a dilemma about data as most other AI techniques. On\none hand, modern QA methods rely on deep learning models which are typically\ndata-hungry. Therefore, it is expected to collect and fuse all the available QA\ndatasets together in a common site for developing a powerful QA model. On the\nother hand, real-world QA datasets are typically distributed in the form of\nisolated islands belonging to different parties. Due to the increasing\nawareness of privacy security, it is almost impossible to integrate the data\nscattered around, or the cost is prohibited. A possible solution to this\ndilemma is a new approach known as federated learning, which is a\nprivacy-preserving machine learning technique over distributed datasets. In\nthis work, we propose to adopt federated learning for QA with the special\nconcern on the statistical heterogeneity of the QA data. Here the heterogeneity\nrefers to the fact that annotated QA data are typically with non-identical and\nindependent distribution (non-IID) and unbalanced sizes in practice.\nTraditional federated learning methods may sacrifice the accuracy of individual\nmodels under the heterogeneous situation. To tackle this problem, we propose a\nnovel Federated Matching framework for QA, named FedMatch, with a\nbackbone-patch architecture. The shared backbone is to distill the common\nknowledge of all the participants while the private patch is a compact and\nefficient module to retain the domain information for each participant. To\nfacilitate the evaluation, we build a benchmark collection based on several QA\ndatasets from different domains to simulate the heterogeneous situation in\npractice. Empirical studies demonstrate that our model can achieve significant\nimprovements against the baselines over all the datasets.",

          "description": "Recommendation for new users, also called user cold start, has been a\nwell-recognized challenge for online recommender systems. Most existing methods\nview the crux as the lack of initial data. However, in this paper, we argue\nthat there are neglected problems: 1) New users' behaviour follows much\ndifferent distributions from regular users. 2) Although personalized features\nare involved, heavily imbalanced samples prevent the model from balancing\nnew/regular user distributions, as if the personalized features are\noverwhelmed. We name the problem as the ``submergence\" of personalization. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a novel module: Personalized COld Start MOdules\n(POSO). Considering from a model architecture perspective, POSO personalizes\nexisting modules by introducing multiple user-group-specialized sub-modules.\nThen, it fuses their outputs by personalized gates, resulting in comprehensive\nrepresentations. In such way, POSO projects imbalanced features to even\nmodules. POSO can be flexibly integrated into many existing modules and\neffectively improves their performance with negligible computational overheads.\nThe proposed method shows remarkable advantage in industrial scenario. It has\nbeen deployed on the large-scale recommender system of Kwai, and improves new\nuser Watch Time by a large margin (+7.75%). Moreover, POSO can be further\ngeneralized to regular users, inactive users and returning users (+2%-3% on\nWatch Time), as well as item cold start (+3.8% on Watch Time). Its\neffectiveness has also been verified on public dataset (MovieLens 20M). We\nbelieve such practical experience can be well generalized to other scenarios.",

          "description": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is one of the core tasks in recommender\nsystems (RS). It predicts a personalized click probability for each user-item\npair. Recently, researchers have found that the performance of CTR model can be\nimproved greatly by taking user behavior sequence into consideration,\nespecially long-term user behavior sequence. The report on an e-commerce\nwebsite shows that 23\\% of users have more than 1000 clicks during the past 5\nmonths. Though there are numerous works focus on modeling sequential user\nbehaviors, few works can handle long-term user behavior sequence due to the\nstrict inference time constraint in real world system. Two-stage methods are\nproposed to push the limit for better performance. At the first stage, an\nauxiliary task is designed to retrieve the top-$k$ similar items from long-term\nuser behavior sequence. At the second stage, the classical attention mechanism\nis conducted between the candidate item and $k$ items selected in the first\nstage. However, information gap happens between retrieval stage and the main\nCTR task. This goal divergence can greatly diminishing the performance gain of\nlong-term user sequence. In this paper, inspired by Reformer, we propose a\nlocality-sensitive hashing (LSH) method called ETA (End-to-end Target\nAttention) which can greatly reduce the training and inference cost and make\nthe end-to-end training with long-term user behavior sequence possible. Both\noffline and online experiments confirm the effectiveness of our model. We\ndeploy ETA into a large-scale real world E-commerce system and achieve extra\n3.1\\% improvements on GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) compared to a two-stage\nlong user sequence CTR model.",

          "description": "User-item interactions in recommendations can be naturally de-noted as a\nuser-item bipartite graph. Given the success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in\ngraph representation learning, GNN-based C methods have been proposed to\nadvance recommender systems. These methods often make recommendations based on\nthe learned user and item embeddings. However, we found that they do not\nperform well wit sparse user-item graphs which are quite common in real-world\nrecommendations. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel perspective to\nbuild GNN-based CF methods for recommendations which leads to the proposed\nframework Localized Graph Collaborative Filtering (LGCF). One key advantage of\nLGCF is that it does not need to learn embeddings for each user and item, which\nis challenging in sparse scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, LGCF aims at encoding useful CF information into a localized\ngraph and making recommendations based on such graph. Extensive experiments on\nvarious datasets validate the effectiveness of LGCF especially in sparse\nscenarios. Furthermore, empirical results demonstrate that LGCF provides\ncomplementary information to the embedding-based CF model which can be utilized\nto boost recommendation performance.",

          "description": "We present a framework for learning multimodal representations from unlabeled\ndata using convolution-free Transformer architectures. Specifically, our\nVideo-Audio-Text Transformer (VATT) takes raw signals as inputs and extracts\nmultimodal representations that are rich enough to benefit a variety of\ndownstream tasks. We train VATT end-to-end from scratch using multimodal\ncontrastive losses and evaluate its performance by the downstream tasks of\nvideo action recognition, audio event classification, image classification, and\ntext-to-video retrieval. Furthermore, we study a modality-agnostic\nsingle-backbone Transformer by sharing weights among the three modalities. We\nshow that the convolution-free VATT outperforms state-of-the-art ConvNet-based\narchitectures in the downstream tasks. Especially, VATT's vision Transformer\nachieves the top-1 accuracy of 82.1% on Kinetics-400, 83.6% on Kinetics-600,and\n41.1% on Moments in Time, new records while avoiding supervised pre-training.\nTransferring to image classification leads to 78.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet\ncompared to 64.7% by training the same Transformer from scratch, showing the\ngeneralizability of our model despite the domain gap between videos and images.\nVATT's audio Transformer also sets a new record on waveform-based audio event\nrecognition by achieving the mAP of 39.4% on AudioSet without any supervised\npre-training.

However, such toxic information could also be\ncommunicated via multimodal content such as online memes. Therefore, detecting\nmultimodal hateful content has recently garnered much attention in academic and\nindustry research communities. This paper aims to contribute to this emerging\nresearch topic by proposing DisMultiHate, which is a novel framework that\nperformed the classification of multimodal hateful content. Specifically,\nDisMultiHate is designed to disentangle target entities in multimodal memes to\nimprove hateful content classification and explainability. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on two publicly available hateful and offensive memes datasets. Our\nexperiment results show that DisMultiHate is able to outperform\nstate-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal baselines in the hateful meme\nclassification task. Empirical case studies were also conducted to demonstrate\nDisMultiHate's ability to disentangle target entities in memes and ultimately\nshowcase DisMultiHate's explainability of the multimodal hateful content\nclassification task.",

          "description": "Computer-generated holographic (CGH) displays show great potential and are\nemerging as the next-generation displays for augmented and virtual reality, and\nautomotive heads-up displays. One of the critical problems harming the wide\nadoption of such displays is the presence of speckle noise inherent to\nholography, that compromises its quality by introducing perceptible artifacts.\nAlthough speckle noise suppression has been an active research area, the\nprevious works have not considered the perceptual characteristics of the Human\nVisual System (HVS), which receives the final displayed imagery. However, it is\nwell studied that the sensitivity of the HVS is not uniform across the visual\nfield, which has led to gaze-contingent rendering schemes for maximizing the\nperceptual quality in various computer-generated imagery. Inspired by this, we\npresent the first method that reduces the \"perceived speckle noise\" by\nintegrating foveal and peripheral vision characteristics of the HVS, along with\nthe retinal point spread function, into the phase hologram computation.\nSpecifically, we introduce the anatomical and statistical retinal receptor\ndistribution into our computational hologram optimization, which places a\nhigher priority on reducing the perceived foveal speckle noise while being\nadaptable to any individual's optical aberration on the retina. Our method\ndemonstrates superior perceptual quality on our emulated holographic display.\nOur evaluations with objective measurements and subjective studies demonstrate\na significant reduction of the human perceived noise.",

          "description": "Embodied conversational agents benefit from being able to accompany their\nspeech with gestures. Although many data-driven approaches to gesture\ngeneration have been proposed in recent years, it is still unclear whether such\nsystems can consistently generate gestures that convey meaning. We investigate\nwhich gesture properties (phase, category, and semantics) can be predicted from\nspeech text and/or audio using contemporary deep learning. In extensive\nexperiments, we show that gesture properties related to gesture meaning\n(semantics and category) are predictable from text features (time-aligned BERT\nembeddings) alone, but not from prosodic audio features, while rhythm-related\ngesture properties (phase) on the other hand can be predicted from either\naudio, text (with word-level timing information), or both. These results are\nencouraging as they indicate that it is possible to equip an embodied agent\nwith content-wise meaningful co-speech gestures using a machine-learning model.",

          "description": "The combination of the traditional convolutional network (i.e., an\nauto-encoder) and the graph convolutional network has attracted much attention\nin clustering, in which the auto-encoder extracts the node attribute feature\nand the graph convolutional network captures the topological graph feature.\nHowever, the existing works (i) lack a flexible combination mechanism to\nadaptively fuse those two kinds of features for learning the discriminative\nrepresentation and (ii) overlook the multi-scale information embedded at\ndifferent layers for subsequent cluster assignment, leading to inferior\nclustering results. To this end, we propose a novel deep clustering method\nnamed Attention-driven Graph Clustering Network (AGCN). Specifically, AGCN\nexploits a heterogeneity-wise fusion module to dynamically fuse the node\nattribute feature and the topological graph feature. Moreover, AGCN develops a\nscale-wise fusion module to adaptively aggregate the multi-scale features\nembedded at different layers. Based on a unified optimization framework, AGCN\ncan jointly perform feature learning and cluster assignment in an unsupervised\nfashion. Compared with the existing deep clustering methods, our method is more\nflexible and effective since it comprehensively considers the numerous and\ndiscriminative information embedded in the network and directly produces the\nclustering results. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results on commonly\nused benchmark datasets validate that our AGCN consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

While existing approaches can only fill\nin a short segment with a fixed number of notes, or a fixed time span between\nthe past and future contexts, our model can infill a variable number of notes\n(up to 128) for different time spans. We achieve so with three major technical\ncontributions. First, we adapt XLNet, an autoregressive model originally\nproposed for unsupervised model pre-training, to music score infilling. Second,\nwe propose a new, musically specialized positional encoding called relative bar\nencoding that better informs the model of notes' position within the past and\nfuture context. Third, to capitalize relative bar encoding, we perform\nlook-ahead onset prediction to predict the onset of a note one time step before\npredicting the other attributes of the note.

          "description": "Binaural audio gives the listener the feeling of being in the recording place\nand enhances the immersive experience if coupled with AR/VR.

In order to overcome\nthis drawback, prior works have tried to uplift the mono recorded audio to\nbinaural audio as a post processing step conditioning on the visual input. But\nall the prior approaches missed other most important information required for\nthe task, i.e. distance of different sound producing objects from the recording\nsetup.

          "description": "This paper proposes a novel model for recognizing images with composite\nattribute-object concepts, notably for composite concepts that are unseen\nduring model training. We aim to explore the three key properties required by\nthe task --- relation-aware, consistent, and decoupled --- to learn rich and\nrobust features for primitive concepts that compose attribute-object pairs. To\nthis end, we propose the Blocked Message Passing Network (BMP-Net). The model\nconsists of two modules. The concept module generates semantically meaningful\nfeatures for primitive concepts, whereas the visual module extracts visual\nfeatures for attributes and objects from input images. A message passing\nmechanism is used in the concept module to capture the relations between\nprimitive concepts. Furthermore, to prevent the model from being biased towards\nseen composite concepts and reduce the entanglement between attributes and\nobjects, we propose a blocking mechanism that equalizes the information\navailable to the model for both seen and unseen concepts. Extensive experiments\nand ablation studies on two benchmarks show the efficacy of the proposed model.",

Along with the mathematical model\nand the code, we also share with the community the traces that we gathered for\nour study, collected from freely available applications such as Minecraft VR,\nGoogle Earth VR, and Virus Popper.

Many video editing components are astonishingly hard to automate\nprimarily due to the lack of raw video materials. This paper focuses on a new\ntask for computational video editing, namely the task of raking cut\nplausibility. Our key idea is to leverage content that has already been edited\nto learn fine-grained audiovisual patterns that trigger cuts. To do this, we\nfirst collected a data source of more than 10K videos, from which we extract\nmore than 255K cuts. We devise a model that learns to discriminate between real\nand artificial cuts via contrastive learning. We set up a new task and a set of\nbaselines to benchmark video cut generation. We observe that our proposed model\noutperforms the baselines by large margins. To demonstrate our model in\nreal-world applications, we conduct human studies in a collection of unedited\nvideos. The results show that our model does a better job at cutting than\nrandom and alternative baselines.",

          "description": "Recent research has shown that non-additive image steganographic frameworks\neffectively improve security performance through adjusting distortion\ndistribution. However, as far as we know, all of the existing non-additive\nproposals are based on handcrafted policies, and can only be applied to a\nspecific image domain, which heavily prevent non-additive steganography from\nreleasing its full potentiality. In this paper, we propose an automatic\nnon-additive steganographic distortion learning framework called MCTSteg to\nremove the above restrictions. Guided by the reinforcement learning paradigm,\nwe combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and steganalyzer-based environmental\nmodel to build MCTSteg. MCTS makes sequential decisions to adjust distortion\ndistribution without human intervention. Our proposed environmental model is\nused to obtain feedbacks from each decision. Due to its self-learning\ncharacteristic and domain-independent reward function, MCTSteg has become the\nfirst reported universal non-additive steganographic framework which can work\nin both spatial and JPEG domains. Extensive experimental results show that\nMCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted\nfeature-based and deep-learning-based steganalyzers. In both spatial and JPEG\ndomains, the security performance of MCTSteg steadily outperforms the state of\nthe art by a clear margin under different scenarios.",

          "description": "A lifespan face synthesis (LFS) model aims to generate a set of\nphoto-realistic face images of a person's whole life, given only one snapshot\nas reference. The generated face image given a target age code is expected to\nbe age-sensitive reflected by bio-plausible transformations of shape and\ntexture, while being identity preserving. This is extremely challenging because\nthe shape and texture characteristics of a face undergo separate and highly\nnonlinear transformations w.r.t. age. Most recent LFS models are based on\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) whereby age code conditional\ntransformations are applied to a latent face representation. They benefit\ngreatly from the recent advancements of GANs. However, without explicitly\ndisentangling their latent representations into the texture, shape and identity\nfactors, they are fundamentally limited in modeling the nonlinear age-related\ntransformation on texture and shape whilst preserving identity. In this work, a\nnovel LFS model is proposed to disentangle the key face characteristics\nincluding shape, texture and identity so that the unique shape and texture age\ntransformations can be modeled effectively. This is achieved by extracting\nshape, texture and identity features separately from an encoder. Critically,\ntwo transformation modules, one conditional convolution based and the other\nchannel attention based, are designed for modeling the nonlinear shape and\ntexture feature transformations respectively. This is to accommodate their\nrather distinct aging processes and ensure that our synthesized images are both\nage-sensitive and identity preserving. Extensive experiments show that our LFS\nmodel is clearly superior to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

Specifically, when choosing the Chebyshev\ngraph filter, a unified formulation can be derived for explaining and analyzing\nthe existing nonlocal-based blocks (e.g., nonlocal block, nonlocal stage,\ndouble attention block). Furthermore, by concerning the property of spectral,\nwe propose an efficient and robust spectral nonlocal block, which can be more\nrobust and flexible to catch long-range dependencies when inserted into deep\nneural networks than the existing nonlocal blocks.

Unlike classical symbolic AI systems, neural networks are trained\nusing large data sets and their inner structure containing possibly billions of\nparameters does not lend itself to human interpretation. As a consequence, it\nis so far not feasible to provide broad guarantees for the correct behaviour of\nneural networks during operation if they process input data that significantly\ndiffer from those seen during training. However, many applications of AI\nsystems are security- or safety-critical, and hence require obtaining\nstatements on the robustness of the systems when facing unexpected events,\nwhether they occur naturally or are induced by an attacker in a targeted way.\nAs a step towards developing robust AI systems for such applications, this\npaper presents how the robustness of AI systems can be practically examined and\nwhich methods and metrics can be used to do so. The robustness testing\nmethodology is described and analysed for the example use case of traffic sign\nrecognition in autonomous driving.",

          "description": "Weakly-supervised learning (WSL) has recently triggered substantial interest\nas it mitigates the lack of pixel-wise annotations.\n\nGiven global image labels, WSL methods yield pixel-level predictions\n(segmentations), which enable to interpret class predictions. Despite their\nrecent success, mostly with natural images, such methods can face important\nchallenges when the foreground and background regions have similar visual cues,\nyielding high false-positive rates in segmentations, as is the case in\nchallenging histology images. WSL training is commonly driven by standard\nclassification losses, which implicitly maximize model confidence, and locate\nthe discriminative regions linked to classification decisions. Therefore, they\nlack mechanisms for modeling explicitly non-discriminative regions and reducing\nfalse-positive rates. We propose novel regularization terms, which enable the\nmodel to seek both non-discriminative and discriminative regions, while\ndiscouraging unbalanced segmentations. We introduce high uncertainty as a\ncriterion to localize non-discriminative regions that do not affect classifier\ndecision, and describe it with original Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence losses\nevaluating the deviation of posterior predictions from the uniform\ndistribution. Our KL terms encourage high uncertainty of the model when the\nlatter inputs the latent non-discriminative regions. Our loss integrates: (i) a\ncross-entropy seeking a foreground, where model confidence about class\nprediction is high; (ii) a KL regularizer seeking a background, where model\nuncertainty is high; and (iii) log-barrier terms discouraging unbalanced\nsegmentations. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies over the public\nGlaS colon cancer data and a Camelyon16 patch-based benchmark for breast cancer\nshow substantial improvements over state-of-the-art WSL methods, and confirm\nthe effect of our new regularizers.",

The injected dye can\ncause adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, anaphylactic shock, and even\ndeath. In contrast, color fundus imaging is a non-invasive technique used for\nphotographing the retina but does not have sufficient fidelity for capturing\nits vascular structure. The only non-invasive method for capturing retinal\nvasculature is optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCTA). However, OCTA\nequipment is quite expensive, and stable imaging is limited to small areas on\nthe retina. In this paper, we propose a novel conditional generative\nadversarial network (GAN) capable of simultaneously synthesizing FA images from\nfundus photographs while predicting retinal degeneration. The proposed system\nhas the benefit of addressing the problem of imaging retinal vasculature in a\nnon-invasive manner as well as predicting the existence of retinal\nabnormalities. We use a semi-supervised approach to train our GAN using\nmultiple weighted losses on different modalities of data.

          "description": "Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation enables to alleviate the need for\nlarge-scale pixel-wise annotations. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL)\nwith a combination of image-to-image translation shows great effectiveness in\nadaptive segmentation. The most common practice is to perform SSL along with\nimage translation to well align a single domain (the source or target).\nHowever, in this single-domain paradigm, unavoidable visual inconsistency\nraised by image translation may affect subsequent learning. In this paper,\nbased on the observation that domain adaptation frameworks performed in the\nsource and target domain are almost complementary in terms of image translation\nand SSL, we propose a novel dual path learning (DPL) framework to alleviate\nvisual inconsistency. Concretely, DPL contains two complementary and\ninteractive single-domain adaptation pipelines aligned in source and target\ndomain respectively. The inference of DPL is extremely simple, only one\nsegmentation model in the target domain is employed. Novel technologies such as\ndual path image translation and dual path adaptive segmentation are proposed to\nmake two paths promote each other in an interactive manner. Experiments on\nGTA5$\\rightarrow$Cityscapes and SYNTHIA$\\rightarrow$Cityscapes scenarios\ndemonstrate the superiority of our DPL model over the state-of-the-art methods.\nThe code and models are available at: \\url{https://github.com/royee182/DPL}",

To study this, we introduce\nAdversarial VQA, a new large-scale VQA benchmark, collected iteratively via an\nadversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop procedure.

          "description": "In this paper, we present an efficient and robust deep learning solution for\nnovel view synthesis of complex scenes. In our approach, a 3D scene is\nrepresented as a light field, i.e., a set of rays, each of which has a\ncorresponding color when reaching the image plane. For efficient novel view\nrendering, we adopt a 4D parameterization of the light field, where each ray is\ncharacterized by a 4D parameter. We then formulate the light field as a 4D\nfunction that maps 4D coordinates to corresponding color values. We train a\ndeep fully connected network to optimize this implicit function and memorize\nthe 3D scene. Then, the scene-specific model is used to synthesize novel views.\nDifferent from previous light field approaches which require dense view\nsampling to reliably render novel views, our method can render novel views by\nsampling rays and querying the color for each ray from the network directly,\nthus enabling high-quality light field rendering with a sparser set of training\nimages. Our method achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis results while\nmaintaining an interactive frame rate.",

          "description": "Monocular 3D object detection is an important task for autonomous driving\nconsidering its advantage of low cost. It is much more challenging than\nconventional 2D cases due to its inherent ill-posed property, which is mainly\nreflected in the lack of depth information. Recent progress on 2D detection\noffers opportunities to better solving this problem. However, it is non-trivial\nto make a general adapted 2D detector work in this 3D task. In this paper, we\nstudy this problem with a practice built on a fully convolutional single-stage\ndetector and propose a general framework FCOS3D. Specifically, we first\ntransform the commonly defined 7-DoF 3D targets to the image domain and\ndecouple them as 2D and 3D attributes. Then the objects are distributed to\ndifferent feature levels with consideration of their 2D scales and assigned\nonly according to the projected 3D-center for the training procedure.\nFurthermore, the center-ness is redefined with a 2D Gaussian distribution based\non the 3D-center to fit the 3D target formulation. All of these make this\nframework simple yet effective, getting rid of any 2D detection or 2D-3D\ncorrespondence priors. Our solution achieves 1st place out of all the\nvision-only methods in the nuScenes 3D detection challenge of NeurIPS 2020.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d.",

A new algorithm entitled an Early Exit Population Initialisation (EE-PI)\nfor Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) was developed to achieve both goals. The EE-PI\nreduces the total number of parameters in the search process by filtering the\nmodels with fewer parameters than the maximum threshold. It will look for a new\nmodel to replace those models with parameters more than the threshold. Thereby,\nreducing the number of parameters, memory usage for model storage and\nprocessing time while maintaining the same performance or accuracy. The search\ntime was reduced to 0.52 GPU day. This is a huge and significant achievement\ncompared to the NAS of 4 GPU days achieved using NSGA-Net, 3,150 GPU days by\nthe AmoebaNet model, and the 2,000 GPU days by the NASNet model.

          "description": "With the rise of Transformers as the standard for language processing, and\ntheir advancements in computer vision, along with their unprecedented size and\namounts of training data, many have come to believe that they are not suitable\nfor small sets of data. This trend leads to great concerns, including but not\nlimited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the\nexclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this\npaper, we dispel the myth that transformers are \"data hungry\" and therefore can\nonly be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the\nright size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with\nstate-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets, often with better accuracy and fewer\nparameters. Our model eliminates the requirement for class token and positional\nembeddings through a novel sequence pooling strategy and the use of\nconvolution/s. It is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as little as\n0.28M parameters while achieving good results. Our model can reach 98.00%\naccuracy when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is a significant\nimprovement over previous Transformer based models. It also outperforms many\nmodern CNN based approaches, such as ResNet, and even some recent NAS-based\napproaches, such as Proxyless-NAS. Our simple and compact design democratizes\ntransformers by making them accessible to those with limited computing\nresources and/or dealing with small datasets.

We train VATT end-to-end from scratch using multimodal\ncontrastive losses and evaluate its performance by the downstream tasks of\nvideo action recognition, audio event classification, image classification, and\ntext-to-video retrieval. Furthermore, we study a modality-agnostic\nsingle-backbone Transformer by sharing weights among the three modalities. We\nshow that the convolution-free VATT outperforms state-of-the-art ConvNet-based\narchitectures in the downstream tasks. Especially, VATT's vision Transformer\nachieves the top-1 accuracy of 82.1% on Kinetics-400, 83.6% on Kinetics-600,and\n41.1% on Moments in Time, new records while avoiding supervised pre-training.\nTransferring to image classification leads to 78.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet\ncompared to 64.7% by training the same Transformer from scratch, showing the\ngeneralizability of our model despite the domain gap between videos and images.\nVATT's audio Transformer also sets a new record on waveform-based audio event\nrecognition by achieving the mAP of 39.4% on AudioSet without any supervised\npre-training. VATT's source code is publicly available.",

          "description": "Probabilistic point cloud registration methods are becoming more popular\nbecause of their robustness. However, unlike point-to-plane variants of\niterative closest point (ICP) which incorporate local surface geometric\ninformation such as surface normals, most probabilistic methods (e.g., coherent\npoint drift (CPD)) ignore such information and build Gaussian mixture models\n(GMMs) with isotropic Gaussian covariances. This results in sphere-like GMM\ncomponents which only penalize the point-to-point distance between the two\npoint clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel method called CPD with Local\nSurface Geometry (LSG-CPD) for rigid point cloud registration. Our method\nadaptively adds different levels of point-to-plane penalization on top of the\npoint-to-point penalization based on the flatness of the local surface. This\nresults in GMM components with anisotropic covariances. We formulate point\ncloud registration as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and solve\nit with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E step, we\ndemonstrate that the computation can be recast into simple matrix manipulations\nand efficiently computed on a GPU. In the M step, we perform an unconstrained\noptimization on a matrix Lie group to efficiently update the rigid\ntransformation of the registration. The proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness on various\ndatasets captured with range scanners, RGBD cameras, and LiDARs. Also, it is\nsignificantly faster than modern implementations of CPD. The source code is\navailable at https://github.com/ChirikjianLab/LSG-CPD.git.",

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables a learning machine to adapt from\na labeled source domain to an unlabeled domain under the distribution shift.\nThanks to the strong representation ability of deep neural networks, recent\nremarkable achievements in UDA resort to learning domain-invariant features.\nIntuitively, the hope is that a good feature representation, together with the\nhypothesis learned from the source domain, can generalize well to the target\ndomain. However, the learning processes of domain-invariant features and source\nhypothesis inevitably involve domain-specific information that would degrade\nthe generalizability of UDA models on the target domain. In this paper,\nmotivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis that only partial parameters are\nessential for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are\nessential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in\nUDA. Such parameters are termed transferable parameters. In contrast, the other\nparameters tend to fit domain-specific details and often fail to generalize,\nwhich we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose\nTransferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect brought by\ndomain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the\nmemorization of domain-invariant information. Specifically, according to the\ndistribution discrepancy degree, we divide all parameters into transferable and\nuntransferable ones in each training iteration. We then perform separate\nupdates rules for the two types of parameters. Extensive experiments on image\nclassification and regression tasks (keypoint detection) show that TransPar\noutperforms prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments\ndemonstrate that TransPar can be integrated into the most popular deep UDA\nnetworks and be easily extended to handle any data distribution shift\nscenarios.",

The work\nreported in this paper builds on this project through the use of transfer\nlearning and data augmentation techniques to ameliorate classification\naccuracy. Starting with a convolutional neural network (CNN), a systematic\napproach is followed for selecting appropriate splitting ratios and for tuning\nmultiple training parameters including learning rate schedulers, layers\nfreezing, batch sizes and loss functions, in the context of the given scenario\nwhich requires classification of waste into different recycling types. Results\nare compared and contrasted using 10-fold cross validation and demonstrate that\nthe model developed achieves a 91.21% test accuracy. Subsequently, a range of\ndata augmentation techniques are then incorporated into this work including\nflipping, rotation, shearing, zooming, and brightness control. Results show\nthat these augmentation techniques further improve the test accuracy of the\nfinal model to 95.40%. Unlike other work reported in the field, this paper\nprovides full details regarding the training of the model.

          "description": "Geometry Projection is a powerful depth estimation method in monocular 3D\nobject detection. It estimates depth dependent on heights, which introduces\nmathematical priors into the deep model. But projection process also introduces\nthe error amplification problem, in which the error of the estimated height\nwill be amplified and reflected greatly at the output depth. This property\nleads to uncontrollable depth inferences and also damages the training\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose a Geometry Uncertainty Projection Network\n(GUP Net) to tackle the error amplification problem at both inference and\ntraining stages. Specifically, a GUP module is proposed to obtains the\ngeometry-guided uncertainty of the inferred depth, which not only provides high\nreliable confidence for each depth but also benefits depth learning.\nFurthermore, at the training stage, we propose a Hierarchical Task Learning\nstrategy to reduce the instability caused by error amplification. This learning\nalgorithm monitors the learning situation of each task by a proposed indicator\nand adaptively assigns the proper loss weights for different tasks according to\ntheir pre-tasks situation. Based on that, each task starts learning only when\nits pre-tasks are learned well, which can significantly improve the stability\nand efficiency of the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. The overall model can infer more reliable\nobject depth than existing methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art\nimage-based monocular 3D detectors by 3.74% and 4.7% AP40 of the car and\npedestrian categories on the KITTI benchmark.",

Because in\nthese scenarios the stakes are high, it is desirable for decision systems to\nnot only provide recommendations but supply transparent reasoning in support\nthereof. For learning-based systems, this can be achieved through an\ninterpretable design of the inference pipeline. Herein we describe an automated\nyet interpretable system for uveal melanoma subtyping with digital cytology\nimages from fine needle aspiration biopsies. Our method embeds every\nautomatically segmented cell of a candidate cytology image as a point in a 2D\nmanifold defined by many representative slides, which enables reasoning about\nthe cell-level composition of the tissue sample, paving the way for\ninterpretable subtyping of the biopsy. Finally, a rule-based slide-level\nclassification algorithm is trained on the partitions of the circularly\ndistorted 2D manifold. This process results in a simple rule set that is\nevaluated automatically but highly transparent for human verification. On our\nin house cytology dataset of 88 uveal melanoma patients, the proposed method\nachieves an accuracy of 87.5% that compares favorably to all competing\napproaches, including deep \"black box\" models.

          "description": "The recently-developed DETR approach applies the transformer encoder and\ndecoder architecture to object detection and achieves promising performance. In\nthis paper, we handle the critical issue, slow training convergence, and\npresent a conditional cross-attention mechanism for fast DETR training. Our\napproach is motivated by that the cross-attention in DETR relies highly on the\ncontent embeddings for localizing the four extremities and predicting the box,\nwhich increases the need for high-quality content embeddings and thus the\ntraining difficulty. Our approach, named conditional DETR, learns a conditional\nspatial query from the decoder embedding for decoder multi-head\ncross-attention. The benefit is that through the conditional spatial query,\neach cross-attention head is able to attend to a band containing a distinct\nregion, e.g., one object extremity or a region inside the object box. This\nnarrows down the spatial range for localizing the distinct regions for object\nclassification and box regression, thus relaxing the dependence on the content\nembeddings and easing the training. Empirical results show that conditional\nDETR converges 6.7x faster for the backbones R50 and R101 and 10x faster for\nstronger backbones DC5-R50 and DC5-R101.

          "description": "Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that\nrequires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing\nlearning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated\nmedical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust\nmedical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised\napproaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,\nand also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic\ninformation, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we\npresent SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly\nadvances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe\nan unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and\npredicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive\nobjective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach\nworks surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully\nsupervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can\nbe viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust\nto representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation\nby distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular\ndatasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT\ndataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of\nlabeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of\n90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to\nprevious best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion,\nshowing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream\ntasks, such as medical image synthesis and registration.",

          "description": "In recent years graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches have become a\npopular strategy for processing point cloud data, regularly achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks. To date, the research\ncommunity has primarily focused on improving model expressiveness, with\nsecondary thought given to how to design models that can run efficiently on\nresource constrained mobile devices including smartphones or mixed reality\nheadsets. In this work we make a step towards improving the efficiency of these\nmodels by making the observation that these GNN models are heavily limited by\nthe representational power of their first, feature extracting, layer. We find\nthat it is possible to radically simplify these models so long as the feature\nextraction layer is retained with minimal degradation to model performance;\nfurther, we discover that it is possible to improve performance overall on\nModelNet40 and S3DIS by improving the design of the feature extractor. Our\napproach reduces memory consumption by 20$\\times$ and latency by up to\n9.9$\\times$ for graph layers in models such as DGCNN; overall, we achieve\nspeed-ups of up to 4.5$\\times$ and peak memory reductions of 72.5%.",

          "description": "Pathology is practiced by visual inspection of histochemically stained\nslides. Most commonly, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is used in the\ndiagnostic workflow and it is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis. However,\nin many cases, especially for non-neoplastic diseases, additional \"special\nstains\" are used to provide different levels of contrast and color to tissue\ncomponents and allow pathologists to get a clearer diagnostic picture. In this\nstudy, we demonstrate the utility of supervised learning-based computational\nstain transformation from H&E to different special stains (Masson's Trichrome,\nperiodic acid-Schiff and Jones silver stain) using tissue sections from kidney\nneedle core biopsies. Based on evaluation by three renal pathologists, followed\nby adjudication by a fourth renal pathologist, we show that the generation of\nvirtual special stains from existing H&E images improves the diagnosis in\nseveral non-neoplastic kidney diseases sampled from 58 unique subjects. A\nsecond study performed by three pathologists found that the quality of the\nspecial stains generated by the stain transformation network was statistically\nequivalent to those generated through standard histochemical staining. As the\ntransformation of H&E images into special stains can be achieved within 1 min\nor less per patient core specimen slide, this stain-to-stain transformation\nframework can improve the quality of the preliminary diagnosis when additional\nspecial stains are needed, along with significant savings in time and cost,\nreducing the burden on healthcare system and patients.",

          "description": "Deep learning and convolutional neural networks allow achieving impressive\nperformance in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic\nsegmentation (SS). However, recent studies have shown evident weaknesses of\nsuch models against adversarial perturbations. In a real-world scenario\ninstead, like autonomous driving, more attention should be devoted to\nreal-world adversarial examples (RWAEs), which are physical objects (e.g.,\nbillboards and printable patches) optimized to be adversarial to the entire\nperception pipeline. This paper presents an in-depth evaluation of the\nrobustness of popular SS models by testing the effects of both digital and\nreal-world adversarial patches. These patches are crafted with powerful attacks\nenriched with a novel loss function. Firstly, an investigation on the\nCityscapes dataset is conducted by extending the Expectation Over\nTransformation (EOT) paradigm to cope with SS. Then, a novel attack\noptimization, called scene-specific attack, is proposed. Such an attack\nleverages the CARLA driving simulator to improve the transferability of the\nproposed EOT-based attack to a real 3D environment. Finally, a printed physical\nbillboard containing an adversarial patch was tested in an outdoor driving\nscenario to assess the feasibility of the studied attacks in the real world.\nExhaustive experiments revealed that the proposed attack formulations\noutperform previous work to craft both digital and real-world adversarial\npatches for SS. At the same time, the experimental results showed how these\nattacks are notably less effective in the real world, hence questioning the\npractical relevance of adversarial attacks to SS models for autonomous/assisted\ndriving.",

Large data bias, which is caused by the disparity\nratio between the small data scale and large navigation space, makes the VLN\ntask challenging. Previous works have proposed various data augmentation\nmethods to reduce data bias. However, these works do not explicitly reduce the\ndata bias across different house scenes. Therefore, the agent would overfit to\nthe seen scenes and achieve poor navigation performance in the unseen scenes.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose the Random Environmental Mixup (REM) method,\nwhich generates cross-connected house scenes as augmented data via mixuping\nenvironment. Specifically, we first select key viewpoints according to the room\nconnection graph for each scene. Then, we cross-connect the key views of\ndifferent scenes to construct augmented scenes. Finally, we generate augmented\ninstruction-path pairs in the cross-connected scenes. The experimental results\non benchmark datasets demonstrate that our augmentation data via REM help the\nagent reduce its performance gap between the seen and unseen environment and\nimprove the overall performance, making our model the best existing approach on\nthe standard VLN benchmark.",

          "description": "Existing GAN inversion methods are stuck in a paradox that the inverted codes\ncan either achieve high-fidelity reconstruction, or retain the editing\ncapability. Having only one of them clearly cannot realize real image editing.\nIn this paper, we resolve this paradox by introducing consecutive images (\\eg,\nvideo frames or the same person with different poses) into the inversion\nprocess. The rationale behind our solution is that the continuity of\nconsecutive images leads to inherent editable directions. This inborn property\nis used for two unique purposes: 1) regularizing the joint inversion process,\nsuch that each of the inverted code is semantically accessible from one of the\nother and fastened in a editable domain; 2) enforcing inter-image coherence,\nsuch that the fidelity of each inverted code can be maximized with the\ncomplement of other images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nalternative significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of\nreconstruction fidelity and editability on both the real image dataset and\nsynthesis dataset. Furthermore, our method provides the first support of\nvideo-based GAN inversion, and an interesting application of unsupervised\nsemantic transfer from consecutive images.

          "description": "Autonomous parking systems start with the detection of available parking\nslots. Parking slot detection performance has been dramatically improved by\ndeep learning techniques. Deep learning-based object detection methods can be\ncategorized into one-stage and two-stage approaches. Although it is well-known\nthat the two-stage approach outperforms the one-stage approach in general\nobject detection, they have performed similarly in parking slot detection so\nfar. We consider this is because the two-stage approach has not yet been\nadequately specialized for parking slot detection. Thus, this paper proposes a\nhighly specialized two-stage parking slot detector that uses region-specific\nmulti-scale feature extraction. In the first stage, the proposed method finds\nthe entrance of the parking slot as a region proposal by estimating its center,\nlength, and orientation. The second stage of this method designates specific\nregions that most contain the desired information and extracts features from\nthem. That is, features for the location and orientation are separately\nextracted from only the specific regions that most contain the locational and\norientational information. In addition, multi-resolution feature maps are\nutilized to increase both positioning and classification accuracies. A\nhigh-resolution feature map is used to extract detailed information (location\nand orientation), while another low-resolution feature map is used to extract\nsemantic information (type and occupancy). In experiments, the proposed method\nwas quantitatively evaluated with two large-scale public parking slot detection\ndatasets and outperformed previous methods, including both one-stage and\ntwo-stage approaches.",

          "description": "Image quality assessment (IQA) is an important research topic for\nunderstanding and improving visual experience. The current state-of-the-art IQA\nmethods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The performance of\nCNN-based models is often compromised by the fixed shape constraint in batch\ntraining. To accommodate this, the input images are usually resized and cropped\nto a fixed shape, causing image quality degradation. To address this, we design\na multi-scale image quality Transformer (MUSIQ) to process native resolution\nimages with varying sizes and aspect ratios. With a multi-scale image\nrepresentation, our proposed method can capture image quality at different\ngranularities. Furthermore, a novel hash-based 2D spatial embedding and a scale\nembedding is proposed to support the positional embedding in the multi-scale\nrepresentation.

          "description": "Robots in our daily surroundings are increasing day by day. Their usability\nand acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction\ncapability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the\nmost sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no\nspecific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it\nlargely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we\ninvestigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of\npeople is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as\nhuman beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we\ndo position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group\nactivity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality,\nfirst, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine\na position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation\ncan be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very\ndiverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we\nprovide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and\ngroup detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also\nput forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible\nconcerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on\nmethods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation\napproaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and\nlimitations in current literature along with possible future research\ndirections based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing\nmethods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and\nprovide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.",

          "description": "Deep Learning has celebrated resounding successes in many application areas\nof relevance to the Internet-of-Things, for example, computer vision and\nmachine listening. To fully harness the power of deep leaning for the IoT,\nthese technologies must ultimately be brought directly to the edge. The obvious\nchallenge is that deep learning techniques can only be implemented on strictly\nresource-constrained edge devices if the models are radically downsized. This\ntask relies on different model compression techniques, such as network pruning,\nquantization and the recent advancement of XNOR-Net. This paper examines the\nsuitability of these techniques for audio classification in microcontrollers.\nWe present an XNOR-Net for end-to-end raw audio classification and a\ncomprehensive empirical study comparing this approach with\npruning-and-quantization methods. We show that raw audio classification with\nXNOR yields comparable performance to regular full precision networks for small\nnumbers of classes while reducing memory requirements 32-fold and computation\nrequirements 58-fold. However, as the number of classes increases\nsignificantly, performance degrades and pruning-and-quantization based\ncompression techniques take over as the preferred technique being able to\nsatisfy the same space constraints but requiring about 8x more computation. We\nshow that these insights are consistent between raw audio classification and\nimage classification using standard benchmark sets.To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study applying XNOR to end-to-end audio\nclassification and evaluating it in the context of alternative techniques.

However, many existing methods, especially low-cost\nones, are difficult to achieve real-time and long-term object detection and\ntracking. Here, a non-imaging strategy is proposed, including two stages, to\nrealize fast-moving object detection and tracking in real-time and for the long\nterm: 1) a contour-moments-based method is proposed to optimize the Hadamard\npattern sequence. And then reconstructing projection curves of the object based\non single-pixel imaging technology. The projection curve, which including the\nobject location information, is reconstructed directly with the measurements\ncollected by a single-pixel detector; 2) The fastest changing position in the\nprojection curve can be obtained by solving first-order gradients. A gradient\ndifferential is used in two first-order gradients to calculate a differential\ncurve with the sudden change positions. Finally, we can obtain the boundary\ninformation of the fast-moving object. We experimentally demonstrate that our\napproach can achieve a temporal resolution of 105 frames per second at a 1.28%\nsampling rate by using a 22,000 Hz digital micro-mirror device. The detection\nand tracking algorithm of the proposed strategy is computationally efficient.\nCompared with the state-of-the-art methods, our approach can make the sampling\nrate lower.

          "description": "While deep neural networks have shown impressive performance in many tasks,\nthey are fragile to carefully designed adversarial attacks. We propose a novel\nadversarial training-based model by Attention Guided Knowledge Distillation and\nBi-directional Metric Learning (AGKD-BML). The attention knowledge is obtained\nfrom a weight-fixed model trained on a clean dataset, referred to as a teacher\nmodel, and transferred to a model that is under training on adversarial\nexamples (AEs), referred to as a student model. In this way, the student model\nis able to focus on the correct region, as well as correcting the intermediate\nfeatures corrupted by AEs to eventually improve the model accuracy. Moreover,\nto efficiently regularize the representation in feature space, we propose a\nbidirectional metric learning. Specifically, given a clean image, it is first\nattacked to its most confusing class to get the forward AE. A clean image in\nthe most confusing class is then randomly picked and attacked back to the\noriginal class to get the backward AE. A triplet loss is then used to shorten\nthe representation distance between original image and its AE, while enlarge\nthat between the forward and backward AEs. We conduct extensive adversarial\nrobustness experiments on two widely used datasets with different attacks. Our\nproposed AGKD-BML model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art\napproaches. The code of AGKD-BML will be available at:\nhttps://github.com/hongw579/AGKD-BML.",

          "description": "Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the change detection (CD) task to\nprovide not only the change locations but also the detailed semantic categories\n(before and after the observation intervals). This fine-grained change\ninformation is more useful in land-cover/land-use (LC/LU) applications. Recent\nstudies indicate that the SCD can be modeled through a triple-branch\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN), which contains two temporal branches and a\nchange branch. However, in this architecture, the connections between the\ntemporal branches and the change branch are weak. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel CNN architecture for the SCD, where the\ntemporal features are re-used and are deeply merged in the temporal branch.\nFurthermore, we elaborate on this architecture to model the bi-temporal\nsemantic correlations. The resulting Bi-temporal Semantic Reasoning Network\n(Bi-SRNet) contains two types of semantic reasoning blocks to reason both\nsingle-temporal and cross-temporal semantic correlations, as well as a novel\nloss function to improve the semantic consistency of change detection results.\nExperimental results on a benchmark dataset show that the proposed architecture\nobtains significant accuracy improvements over the existing approaches, while\nthe added designs in the Bi-SRNet further improves the segmentation of both\nsemantic categories and the changed areas.

          "description": "Real world traffic sign recognition is an important step towards building\nautonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to\nadversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and\ngenerate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based\nattack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of\nthese algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)\niteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast\nmoving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally\nwithout considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,\nthis paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world\nroad sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)\nwe leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip\nthose zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural\nperturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a\nsingle perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance\nof the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function\nthat can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real\nworld data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the\nattack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a\nquarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also\nprovides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.\nWe provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility:\nhttps://github.com/AdvAttack/RoadSignAttack.",

          "description": "The multi-modal salient object detection model based on RGB-D information has\nbetter robustness in the real world. However, it remains nontrivial to better\nadaptively balance effective multi-modal information in the feature fusion\nphase. In this letter, we propose a novel gated recoding network (GRNet) to\nevaluate the information validity of the two modes, and balance their\ninfluence. Our framework is divided into three phases: perception phase,\nrecoding mixing phase and feature integration phase. First, A perception\nencoder is adopted to extract multi-level single-modal features, which lays the\nfoundation for multi-modal semantic comparative analysis. Then, a\nmodal-adaptive gate unit (MGU) is proposed to suppress the invalid information\nand transfer the effective modal features to the recoding mixer and the hybrid\nbranch decoder. The recoding mixer is responsible for recoding and mixing the\nbalanced multi-modal information. Finally, the hybrid branch decoder completes\nthe multi-level feature integration under the guidance of an optional edge\nguidance stream (OEGS). Experiments and analysis on eight popular benchmarks\nverify that our framework performs favorably against 9 state-of-art methods.",

In order to improve the detection component, we\njointly define a class-to-class similarity based class representation and a\npractical score calibration mechanism.

          "description": "Vehicle tracking is an essential task in the multi-object tracking (MOT)\nfield. A distinct characteristic in vehicle tracking is that the trajectories\nof vehicles are fairly smooth in both the world coordinate and the image\ncoordinate. Hence, models that capture motion consistencies are of high\nnecessity. However, tracking with the standalone motion-based trackers is quite\nchallenging because targets could get lost easily due to limited information,\ndetection error and occlusion. Leveraging appearance information to assist\nobject re-identification could resolve this challenge to some extent. However,\ndoing so requires extra computation while appearance information is sensitive\nto occlusion as well. In this paper, we try to explore the significance of\nmotion patterns for vehicle tracking without appearance information. We propose\na novel approach that tackles the association issue for long-term tracking with\nthe exclusive fully-exploited motion information. We address the tracklet\nembedding issue with the proposed reconstruct-to-embed strategy based on deep\ngraph convolutional neural networks (GCN). Comprehensive experiments on the\nKITTI-car tracking dataset and UA-Detrac dataset show that the proposed method,\nthough without appearance information, could achieve competitive performance\nwith the state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers.

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the knowledge learnt\nfrom a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous work is\nmainly built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn\ndomain-invariant representations. With the recent exponential increase in\napplying Vision Transformer (ViT) to vision tasks, the capability of ViT in\nadapting cross-domain knowledge, however, remains unexplored in the literature.\nTo fill this gap, this paper first comprehensively investigates the\ntransferability of ViT on a variety of domain adaptation tasks. Surprisingly,\nViT demonstrates superior transferability over its CNNs-based counterparts with\na large margin, while the performance can be further improved by incorporating\nadversarial adaptation. Notwithstanding, directly using CNNs-based adaptation\nstrategies fails to take the advantage of ViT's intrinsic merits (e.g.,\nattention mechanism and sequential image representation) which play an\nimportant role in knowledge transfer. To remedy this, we propose an unified\nframework, namely Transferable Vision Transformer (TVT), to fully exploit the\ntransferability of ViT for domain adaptation. Specifically, we delicately\ndevise a novel and effective unit, which we term Transferability Adaption\nModule (TAM). By injecting learned transferabilities into attention blocks, TAM\ncompels ViT focus on both transferable and discriminative features. Besides, we\nleverage discriminative clustering to enhance feature diversity and separation\nwhich are undermined during adversarial domain alignment. To verify its\nversatility, we perform extensive studies of TVT on four benchmarks and the\nexperimental results demonstrate that TVT attains significant improvements\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art UDA methods.",

SVC-onGoing is based on the ICDAR 2021 Competition on\nOn-Line Signature Verification (SVC 2021), which has been extended to allow\nparticipants anytime. The goal of SVC-onGoing is to evaluate the limits of\non-line signature verification systems on popular scenarios (office/mobile) and\nwriting inputs (stylus/finger) through large-scale public databases. Three\ndifferent tasks are considered in the competition, simulating realistic\nscenarios as both random and skilled forgeries are simultaneously considered on\neach task. The results obtained in SVC-onGoing prove the high potential of deep\nlearning methods in comparison with traditional methods. In particular, the\nbest signature verification system has obtained Equal Error Rate (EER) values\nof 3.33% (Task 1), 7.41% (Task 2), and 6.04% (Task 3). Future studies in the\nfield should be oriented to improve the performance of signature verification\nsystems on the challenging mobile scenarios of SVC-onGoing in which several\nmobile devices and the finger are used during the signature acquisition.",

In this paper, we propose a Deep\nFactorization Machine model that combines the ability of DNNs to learn complex\nrelationships and the ease of interpretability of a linear model. The proposed\nmodel has three parts: (i) an embedding layer to deal with sparse categorical\ndata, (ii) a Factorization Machine to efficiently learn pairwise interactions,\nand (iii) a DNN to implicitly model higher order interactions. In our\nexperiments on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed model classifies cognitive normal, mild cognitive\nimpaired, and demented patients more accurately than competing models. In\naddition, we show that valuable knowledge about the interactions among\nbiomarkers can be obtained.",

In general,\ndistortion of the image content and lacking of details are two typical issues\nin the style transfer field. To this end, we design a novel framework employing\nthe U-Net structure to maintain the rich spatial clues, with a multi-layer\nfeature aggregation (MFA) method to simultaneously provide the details obtained\nby the shallow layers in the stylization processing. In particular, an encoder\nbased on the dense block and a decoder form a symmetrical structure of U-Net\nare jointly staked to realize an effective feature extraction and image\nreconstruction. Besides, a transfer module based on MFA and \"adaptive instance\nnormalization\" (AdaIN) is inserted in the skip connection positions to achieve\nthe stylization. Accordingly, the stylized image possesses the texture of a\nreal photo and preserves rich content details without introducing any mask or\npost-processing steps. The experimental results on public datasets demonstrate\nthat our method achieves a more faithful structural similarity with a lower\nstyle loss, reflecting the effectiveness and merit of our approach.",

          "description": "Self-supervised research improved greatly over the past half decade, with\nmuch of the growth being driven by objectives that are hard to quantitatively\ncompare. These techniques include colorization, cyclical consistency, and\nnoise-contrastive estimation from image patches. Consequently, the field has\nsettled on a handful of measurements that depend on linear probes to adjudicate\nwhich approaches are the best. Our first contribution is to show that this test\nis insufficient and that models which perform poorly (strongly) on linear\nclassification can perform strongly (weakly) on more involved tasks like\ntemporal activity localization. Our second contribution is to analyze the\ncapabilities of five different representations. And our third contribution is a\nmuch needed new dataset for temporal activity localization.",

          "description": "Multiview detection incorporates multiple camera views to deal with\nocclusions, and its central problem is multiview aggregation. Given feature map\nprojections from multiple views onto a common ground plane, the\nstate-of-the-art method addresses this problem via convolution, which applies\nthe same calculation regardless of object locations. However, such\ntranslation-invariant behaviors might not be the best choice, as object\nfeatures undergo various projection distortions according to their positions\nand cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel multiview detector, MVDeTr, that\nadopts a newly introduced shadow transformer to aggregate multiview\ninformation. Unlike convolutions, shadow transformer attends differently at\ndifferent positions and cameras to deal with various shadow-like distortions.\nWe propose an effective training scheme that includes a new view-coherent data\naugmentation method, which applies random augmentations while maintaining\nmultiview consistency.

          "description": "Video objection detection is a challenging task because isolated video frames\nmay encounter appearance deterioration, which introduces great confusion for\ndetection. One of the popular solutions is to exploit the temporal information\nand enhance per-frame representation through aggregating features from\nneighboring frames. Despite achieving improvements in detection, existing\nmethods focus on the selection of higher-level video frames for aggregation\nrather than modeling lower-level temporal relations to increase the feature\nrepresentation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel solution named\nTF-Blender,which includes three modules: 1) Temporal relation mod-els the\nrelations between the current frame and its neighboring frames to preserve\nspatial information. 2). Feature adjustment enriches the representation of\nevery neigh-boring feature map; 3) Feature blender combines outputs from the\nfirst two modules and produces stronger features for the later detection tasks.\nFor its simplicity, TF-Blender can be effortlessly plugged into any detection\nnetwork to improve detection behavior.

Outcomes published in this direction are\nfrequently claiming highly accurate detection under deep transfer learning.\nThis is leading medical technologists to believe that deep transfer learning is\nthe mainstream solution for the problem. However, our critical analysis of the\nliterature reveals an alarming performance disparity between different\npublished results. Hence, we conduct a systematic thorough investigation to\nanalyze the effectiveness of deep transfer learning for COVID-19 detection with\nCT images. Exploring 14 state-of-the-art visual models with over 200 model\ntraining sessions, we conclusively establish that the published literature is\nfrequently overestimating transfer learning performance for the problem, even\nin the prestigious scientific sources. The roots of overestimation trace back\nto inappropriate data curation. We also provide case studies that consider more\nrealistic scenarios, and establish transparent baselines for the problem.

          "description": "3D single object tracking is a key issue for autonomous following robot,\nwhere the robot should robustly track and accurately localize the target for\nefficient following. In this paper, we propose a 3D tracking method called\n3D-SiamRPN Network to track a single target object by using raw 3D point cloud\ndata. The proposed network consists of two subnetworks. The first subnetwork is\nfeature embedding subnetwork which is used for point cloud feature extraction\nand fusion. In this subnetwork, we first use PointNet++ to extract features of\npoint cloud from template and search branches. Then, to fuse the information of\nfeatures in the two branches and obtain their similarity, we propose two cross\ncorrelation modules, named Pointcloud-wise and Point-wise respectively. The\nsecond subnetwork is region proposal network(RPN), which is used to get the\nfinal 3D bounding box of the target object based on the fusion feature from\ncross correlation modules. In this subnetwork, we utilize the regression and\nclassification branches of a region proposal subnetwork to obtain proposals and\nscores, thus get the final 3D bounding box of the target object. Experimental\nresults on KITTI dataset show that our method has a competitive performance in\nboth Success and Precision compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and could\nrun in real-time at 20.8 FPS. Additionally, experimental results on H3D dataset\ndemonstrate that our method also has good generalization ability and could\nachieve good tracking performance in a new scene without re-training.",

          "description": "The physical and clinical constraints surrounding diffusion-weighted imaging\n(DWI) often limit the spatial resolution of the produced images to voxels up to\n8 times larger than those of T1w images. Thus, the detailed information\ncontained in T1w imagescould help in the synthesis of diffusion images in\nhigher resolution. However, the non-Euclidean nature of diffusion imaging\nhinders current deep generative models from synthesizing physically plausible\nimages. In this work, we propose the first Riemannian network architecture for\nthe direct generation of diffusion tensors (DT) and diffusion orientation\ndistribution functions (dODFs) from high-resolution T1w images. Our integration\nof the Log-Euclidean Metric into a learning objective guarantees, unlike\nstandard Euclidean networks, the mathematically-valid synthesis of diffusion.\nFurthermore, our approach improves the fractional anisotropy mean squared error\n(FA MSE) between the synthesized diffusion and the ground-truth by more than\n23% and the cosine similarity between principal directions by almost 5% when\ncompared to our baselines. We validate our generated diffusion by comparing the\nresulting tractograms to our expected real data. We observe similar fiber\nbundles with streamlines having less than 3% difference in length, less than 1%\ndifference in volume, and a visually close shape. While our method is able to\ngenerate high-resolution diffusion images from structural inputs in less than\n15 seconds, we acknowledge and discuss the limits of diffusion inference solely\nrelying on T1w images.

We design sanity checks to explore SROP variations when UI\nvariations are produced by variations in model input, model architecture and\ntraining stages. The variations of SROP is synchronizes with UI variations in\nvarious randomized and sufficiently trained model structures. Therefore, SROP\nvariations is an accurate and convenient sign of UI variations, which promotes\nthe explainability of data representations with respect to frequency-domain\nknowledge.",

One possible alternative is to use prediction scores of\na pre-trained network such as the max logits (i.e., maximum values among\nclasses before the final softmax layer) for detecting such objects.

However, two factors regarding the\ndiversity of augmented data are still missing: 1) the explicit definition (and\nthus measurement) of diversity and 2) the quantifiable relationship between\ndiversity and its regularization effects. To bridge this gap, we propose a\ndiversity measure called Variance Diversity and theoretically show that the\nregularization effect of data augmentation is promised by Variance Diversity.\nWe validate in experiments that the relative gain from automated data\naugmentation in test accuracy is highly correlated to Variance Diversity. An\nunsupervised sampling-based framework, \\textbf{DivAug}, is designed to directly\nmaximize Variance Diversity and hence strengthen the regularization effect.\nWithout requiring a separate search process, the performance gain from DivAug\nis comparable with the state-of-the-art method with better efficiency.\nMoreover, under the semi-supervised setting, our framework can further improve\nthe performance of semi-supervised learning algorithms compared to RandAugment,\nmaking it highly applicable to real-world problems, where labeled data is\nscarce.

          "description": "Domain adaptation (DA) paves the way for label annotation and dataset bias\nissues by the knowledge transfer from a label-rich source domain to a related\nbut unlabeled target domain. A mainstream of DA methods is to align the feature\ndistributions of the two domains. However, the majority of them focus on the\nentire image features where irrelevant semantic information, e.g., the messy\nbackground, is inevitably embedded. Enforcing feature alignments in such case\nwill negatively influence the correct matching of objects and consequently lead\nto the semantically negative transfer due to the confusion of irrelevant\nsemantics. To tackle this issue, we propose Semantic Concentration for Domain\nAdaptation (SCDA), which encourages the model to concentrate on the most\nprincipal features via the pair-wise adversarial alignment of prediction\ndistributions. Specifically, we train the classifier to class-wisely maximize\nthe prediction distribution divergence of each sample pair, which enables the\nmodel to find the region with large differences among the same class of\nsamples. Meanwhile, the feature extractor attempts to minimize that\ndiscrepancy, which suppresses the features of dissimilar regions among the same\nclass of samples and accentuates the features of principal parts.

However, most existing deep metric learning\nmethods match the images by comparing feature vectors, which ignores the\nspatial structure of images and thus lacks interpretability. In this paper, we\npresent a deep interpretable metric learning (DIML) method for more transparent\nembedding learning.

          "description": "Many self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been successful in learning\nsemantically meaningful visual representations by solving pretext tasks.\nHowever, prior work in SSL focuses on tasks like object recognition or\ndetection, which aim to learn object shapes and assume that the features should\nbe invariant to concepts like colors and textures. Thus, these SSL methods\nperform poorly on downstream tasks where these concepts provide critical\ninformation. In this paper, we present an SSL framework that enables us to\nlearn color and texture-aware features without requiring any labels during\ntraining. Our approach consists of three self-supervised tasks designed to\ncapture different concepts that are neglected in prior work that we can select\nfrom depending on the needs of our downstream tasks. Our tasks include learning\nto predict color histograms and discriminate shapeless local patches and\ntextures from each instance. We evaluate our approach on fashion compatibility\nusing Polyvore Outfits and In-Shop Clothing Retrieval using Deepfashion,\nimproving upon prior SSL methods by 9.5-16%, and even outperforming some\nsupervised approaches on Polyvore Outfits despite using no labels. We also show\nthat our approach can be used for transfer learning, demonstrating that we can\ntrain on one dataset while achieving high performance on a different dataset.",

          "description": "Anomaly detection methods require high-quality features. In recent years, the\nanomaly detection community has attempted to obtain better features using\nadvances in deep self-supervised feature learning. Surprisingly, a very\npromising direction, using pretrained deep features, has been mostly\noverlooked. In this paper, we first empirically establish the perhaps expected,\nbut unreported result, that combining pretrained features with simple anomaly\ndetection and segmentation methods convincingly outperforms, much more complex,\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n\nIn order to obtain further performance gains in anomaly detection, we adapt\npretrained features to the target distribution. Although transfer learning\nmethods are well established in multi-class classification problems, the\none-class classification (OCC) setting is not as well explored. It turns out\nthat naive adaptation methods, which typically work well in supervised\nlearning, often result in catastrophic collapse (feature deterioration) and\nreduce performance in OCC settings. A popular OCC method, DeepSVDD, advocates\nusing specialized architectures, but this limits the adaptation performance\ngain. We propose two methods for combating collapse: i) a variant of early\nstopping that dynamically learns the stopping iteration ii) elastic\nregularization inspired by continual learning. Our method, PANDA, outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art in the OCC, outlier exposure and anomaly segmentation\nsettings by large margins.",

We consider the case of a popular visual discovery\nproduct, where these representations are trained with multi-task learning, from\nuse-case specific visual understanding (e.g. skin tone classification) to\ngeneral representation learning for all visual content (e.g. embeddings for\nretrieval). In this work, we describe how we (1) generate a dataset with over a\nbillion images via large weakly-supervised pretraining to improve the\nperformance of these visual representations, and (2) leverage Transformers to\nreplace the traditional convolutional backbone, with insights into both system\nand performance improvements, especially at 1B+ image scale. To support this\nbackbone model, we detail a systematic approach to deriving weakly-supervised\nimage annotations from heterogenous text signals, demonstrating the benefits of\nclustering techniques to handle the long-tail distribution of image labels.\nThrough a comprehensive study of offline and online evaluation, we show that\nlarge-scale Transformer-based pretraining provides significant benefits to\nindustry computer vision applications.

          "description": "The combination of the traditional convolutional network (i.e., an\nauto-encoder) and the graph convolutional network has attracted much attention\nin clustering, in which the auto-encoder extracts the node attribute feature\nand the graph convolutional network captures the topological graph feature.\nHowever, the existing works (i) lack a flexible combination mechanism to\nadaptively fuse those two kinds of features for learning the discriminative\nrepresentation and (ii) overlook the multi-scale information embedded at\ndifferent layers for subsequent cluster assignment, leading to inferior\nclustering results. To this end, we propose a novel deep clustering method\nnamed Attention-driven Graph Clustering Network (AGCN). Specifically, AGCN\nexploits a heterogeneity-wise fusion module to dynamically fuse the node\nattribute feature and the topological graph feature. Moreover, AGCN develops a\nscale-wise fusion module to adaptively aggregate the multi-scale features\nembedded at different layers. Based on a unified optimization framework, AGCN\ncan jointly perform feature learning and cluster assignment in an unsupervised\nfashion. Compared with the existing deep clustering methods, our method is more\nflexible and effective since it comprehensively considers the numerous and\ndiscriminative information embedded in the network and directly produces the\nclustering results.

          "description": "The abundance and richness of Internet photos of landmarks and cities has led\nto significant progress in 3D vision over the past two decades, including\nautomated 3D reconstructions of the world's landmarks from tourist photos.\nHowever, a major source of information available for these 3D-augmented\ncollections---namely language, e.g., from image captions---has been virtually\nuntapped. In this work, we present WikiScenes, a new, large-scale dataset of\nlandmark photo collections that contains descriptive text in the form of\ncaptions and hierarchical category names. WikiScenes forms a new testbed for\nmultimodal reasoning involving images, text, and 3D geometry. We demonstrate\nthe utility of WikiScenes for learning semantic concepts over images and 3D\nmodels.

Even with significant progress in\nthe last few years, automatic gaze analysis still remains challenging due to\nthe individuality of eyes, eye-head interplay, occlusion, image quality, and\nillumination conditions. There are several open questions including what are\nthe important cues to interpret gaze direction in an unconstrained environment\nwithout prior knowledge and how to encode them in real-time. We review the\nprogress across a range of gaze analysis tasks and applications to shed light\non these fundamental questions; identify effective methods in gaze analysis and\nprovide possible future directions. We analyze recent gaze estimation and\nsegmentation methods, especially in the unsupervised and weakly supervised\ndomain, based on their advantages and reported evaluation metrics. Our analysis\nshows that the development of a robust and generic gaze analysis method still\nneeds to address real-world challenges such as unconstrained setup and learning\nwith less supervision.

          "description": "The lensless pinhole camera is perhaps the earliest and simplest form of an\nimaging system using only a pinhole-sized aperture in place of a lens. They can\ncapture an infinite depth-of-field and offer greater freedom from optical\ndistortion over their lens-based counterparts. However, the inherent\nlimitations of a pinhole system result in lower sharpness from blur caused by\noptical diffraction and higher noise levels due to low light throughput of the\nsmall aperture, requiring very long exposure times to capture well-exposed\nimages. In this paper, we explore an image restoration pipeline using deep\nlearning and domain-knowledge of the pinhole system to enhance the pinhole\nimage quality through a joint denoise and deblur approach. Our approach allows\nfor more practical exposure times for hand-held photography and provides higher\nimage quality, making it more suitable for daily photography compared to other\nlensless cameras while keeping size and cost low. This opens up the potential\nof pinhole cameras to be used in smaller devices, such as smartphones.",

          "description": "With the increasing popularity of deep learning on edge devices, compressing\nlarge neural networks to meet the hardware requirements of resource-constrained\ndevices became a significant research direction. Numerous compression\nmethodologies are currently being used to reduce the memory sizes and energy\nconsumption of neural networks. Knowledge distillation (KD) is among such\nmethodologies and it functions by using data samples to transfer the knowledge\ncaptured by a large model (teacher) to a smaller one(student). However, due to\nvarious reasons, the original training data might not be accessible at the\ncompression stage. Therefore, data-free model compression is an ongoing\nresearch problem that has been addressed by various works. In this paper, we\npoint out that catastrophic forgetting is a problem that can potentially be\nobserved in existing data-free distillation methods. Moreover, the sample\ngeneration strategies in some of these methods could result in a mismatch\nbetween the synthetic and real data distributions. To prevent such problems, we\npropose a data-free KD framework that maintains a dynamic collection of\ngenerated samples over time. Additionally, we add the constraint of matching\nthe real data distribution in sample generation strategies that target maximum\ninformation gain. Our experiments demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy\nof the student models obtained via KD when compared with state-of-the-art\napproaches on the SVHN, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.",

We hypothesize that a generative model for scene graphs might be able\nto learn the underlying semantic structure of real-world scenes more\neffectively than images, and hence, generate realistic novel scenes in the form\nof scene graphs. In this work, we explore a new task for the unconditional\ngeneration of semantic scene graphs. We develop a deep auto-regressive model\ncalled SceneGraphGen which can directly learn the probability distribution over\nlabelled and directed graphs using a hierarchical recurrent architecture. The\nmodel takes a seed object as input and generates a scene graph in a sequence of\nsteps, each step generating an object node, followed by a sequence of\nrelationship edges connecting to the previous nodes. We show that the scene\ngraphs generated by SceneGraphGen are diverse and follow the semantic patterns\nof real-world scenes.

          "description": "We train embodied neural networks to plan and navigate unseen complex 3D\nenvironments, emphasising real-world deployment. Rather than requiring prior\nknowledge of the agent or environment, the planner learns to model the state\ntransitions and rewards. To avoid the potentially hazardous trial-and-error of\nreinforcement learning, we focus on differentiable planners such as Value\nIteration Networks (VIN), which are trained offline from safe expert\ndemonstrations. Although they work well in small simulations, we address two\nmajor limitations that hinder their deployment. First, we observed that current\ndifferentiable planners struggle to plan long-term in environments with a high\nbranching complexity. While they should ideally learn to assign low rewards to\nobstacles to avoid collisions, we posit that the constraints imposed on the\nnetwork are not strong enough to guarantee the network to learn sufficiently\nlarge penalties for every possible collision. We thus impose a structural\nconstraint on the value iteration, which explicitly learns to model any\nimpossible actions. Secondly, we extend the model to work with a limited\nperspective camera under translation and rotation, which is crucial for real\nrobot deployment. Many VIN-like planners assume a 360 degrees or overhead view\nwithout rotation. In contrast, our method uses a memory-efficient lattice map\nto aggregate CNN embeddings of partial observations, and models the rotational\ndynamics explicitly using a 3D state-space grid (translation and rotation). Our\nproposals significantly improve semantic navigation and exploration on several\n2D and 3D environments, succeeding in settings that are otherwise challenging\nfor this class of methods. As far as we know, we are the first to successfully\nperform differentiable planning on the difficult Active Vision Dataset,\nconsisting of real images captured from a robot.",

The paradigm here is that each agent runs visual-inertial\nodomety independently onboard in order to ensure its autonomy, while sharing\nmap information with the COVINS server back-end running on a powerful local PC\nor a remote cloud server. The server back-end establishes an accurate\ncollaborative global estimate from the contributed data, refining the joint\nestimate by means of place recognition, global optimization and removal of\nredundant data, in order to ensure an accurate, but also efficient SLAM\nprocess.

          "description": "Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is a widely researched tool for\nneural architecture search, due to its promising results for image\nclassification. The main benefit of DARTS is the effectiveness achieved through\nthe weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture\nsearch. In this work, we investigate DARTS in a systematic case study of\ninverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a\ncontrolled manner. Although we demonstrate that the success of DARTS can be\nextended from image classification to reconstruction, our experiments yield\nthree fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DARTS-based methods: First,\nthe results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final\nperformance is highly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And\nthird, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training\ndoes not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. Thus, we\nconclude the necessity to 1) report the results of any DARTS-based methods from\nseveral runs along with its underlying performance statistics, 2) show the\ncorrelation of the training and final architecture performance, and 3)\ncarefully consider if the computational efficiency of DARTS outweighs the costs\nof hyperparameter optimization and multiple runs.",

To tackle such a severely ill-posed problem, we propose\na physically-interpretable, compact, efficient, and end-to-end learning-based\nframework, namely AGD-Net. Precisely, by taking advantage of the imaging\nprocess, we first formulate the problem explicitly based on the classic\ngradient descent algorithm. Then, we design a lightweight neural network with a\nmulti-stage architecture to mimic the formed amended gradient descent process,\nin which efficient convolution and novel spectral zero-mean normalization are\nproposed to effectively extract spatial-spectral features for regressing an\ninitialization, a basic gradient, and an incremental gradient. Besides, based\non the approximate low-rank property of HS images, we propose a novel rank loss\nto promote the similarity between the global structures of reconstructed and\nground-truth HS images, which is optimized with our singular value weighting\nstrategy during training. Moreover, AGD-Net, a single network after one-time\ntraining, is flexible to handle the reconstruction with various spectral\nresponse functions.

Although regularization is\ntypically understood from an overfitting perspective, we highlight its role in\nmaking the network more adaptive and enabling it to escape more easily from\nweights that generalize poorly. To provide such a capability, we propose a\nmethod called Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization (LAWN), that can be\nstacked onto any gradient-based optimizer. LAWN controls the logits by\nconstraining the weight norms of layers in the final homogeneous sub-network.\nEmpirically, we show that the resulting LAWN variant of the optimizer makes a\ndeep network more adaptive to finding minimas with superior generalization\nperformance on large-scale image classification and recommender systems. While\nLAWN is particularly impressive in improving Adam, it greatly improves all\noptimizers when used with large batch sizes",

          "description": "Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization (WSTAL) aims to localize\nactions in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels. Currently, most\nstate-of-the-art WSTAL methods follow a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline:\nproducing snippet-level predictions first and then aggregating to the\nvideo-level prediction. However, we argue that existing methods have overlooked\ntwo important drawbacks: 1) inadequate use of motion information and 2) the\nincompatibility of prevailing cross-entropy training loss. In this paper, we\nanalyze that the motion cues behind the optical flow features are complementary\ninformative. Inspired by this, we propose to build a context-dependent motion\nprior, termed as motionness. Specifically, a motion graph is introduced to\nmodel motionness based on the local motion carrier (e.g., optical flow). In\naddition, to highlight more informative video snippets, a motion-guided loss is\nproposed to modulate the network training conditioned on motionness scores.\nExtensive ablation studies confirm that motionness efficaciously models\naction-of-interest, and the motion-guided loss leads to more accurate results.\nBesides, our motion-guided loss is a plug-and-play loss function and is\napplicable with existing WSTAL methods. Without loss of generality, based on\nthe standard MIL pipeline, our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance\non three challenging benchmarks, including THUMOS'14, ActivityNet v1.2 and\nv1.3.",

While there exist\ndifferent alternatives for tackling this problem, it is found that they are\neither equipped with heavy networks to fuse RGB and depth information or\nempirically ineffective to process millions of pseudo-LiDAR points. With\nin-depth examination, we realize that these limitations are rooted in\ninaccurate object localization.

          "description": "To accommodate rapid changes in the real world, the cognition system of\nhumans is capable of continually learning concepts. On the contrary,\nconventional deep learning models lack this capability of preserving previously\nlearned knowledge. When a neural network is fine-tuned to learn new tasks, its\nperformance on previously trained tasks will significantly deteriorate. Many\nrecent works on incremental object detection tackle this problem by introducing\nadvanced regularization. Although these methods have shown promising results,\nthe benefits are often short-lived after the first incremental step. Under\nmulti-step incremental learning, the trade-off between old knowledge preserving\nand new task learning becomes progressively more severe. Thus, the performance\nof regularization-based incremental object detectors gradually decays for\nsubsequent learning steps. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this performance\ndecay on multi-step incremental detection tasks by proposing a dilatable\nincremental object detector (DIODE). For the task-shared parameters, our method\nadaptively penalizes the changes of important weights for previous tasks. At\nthe same time, the structure of the model is dilated or expanded by a limited\nnumber of task-specific parameters to promote new task learning. Extensive\nexperiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets demonstrate substantial\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art methods. Notably, compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods, our method achieves up to 6.0% performance\nimprovement by increasing the number of parameters by just 1.2% for each newly\nlearned task.",

          "description": "With the availability of many datasets tailored for autonomous driving in\nreal-world urban scenes, semantic segmentation for urban driving scenes\nachieves significant progress. However, semantic segmentation for off-road,\nunstructured environments is not widely studied. Directly applying existing\nsegmentation networks often results in performance degradation as they cannot\novercome intrinsic problems in such environments, such as illumination changes.\nIn this paper, a built-in memory module for semantic segmentation is proposed\nto overcome these problems. The memory module stores significant\nrepresentations of training images as memory items. In addition to the encoder\nembedding like items together, the proposed memory module is specifically\ndesigned to cluster together instances of the same class even when there are\nsignificant variances in embedded features. Therefore, it makes segmentation\nnetworks better deal with unexpected illumination changes. A triplet loss is\nused in training to minimize redundancy in storing discriminative\nrepresentations of the memory module. The proposed memory module is general so\nthat it can be adopted in a variety of networks. We conduct experiments on the\nRobot Unstructured Ground Driving (RUGD) dataset and RELLIS dataset, which are\ncollected from off-road, unstructured natural environments. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed memory module improves the performance of\nexisting segmentation networks and contributes to capturing unclear objects\nover various off-road, unstructured natural scenes with equivalent\ncomputational cost and network parameters. As the proposed method can be\nintegrated into compact networks, it presents a viable approach for\nresource-limited small autonomous platforms.",

          "description": "In clinical practice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with multiple\ncontrasts is usually acquired in a single study to assess different properties\nof the same region of interest in human body. The whole acquisition process can\nbe accelerated by having one or more modalities under-sampled in the k-space.\nRecent researches demonstrate that, considering the redundancy between\ndifferent contrasts or modalities, a target MRI modality under-sampled in the\nk-space can be better reconstructed with the helps from a fully-sampled\nsequence (i.e., the reference modality). It implies that, in the same study of\nthe same subject, multiple sequences can be utilized together toward the\npurpose of highly efficient multi-modal reconstruction. However, we find that\nmulti-modal reconstruction can be negatively affected by subtle spatial\nmisalignment between different sequences, which is actually common in clinical\npractice. In this paper, we integrate the spatial alignment network with\nreconstruction, to improve the quality of the reconstructed target modality.\nSpecifically, the spatial alignment network estimates the spatial misalignment\nbetween the fully-sampled reference and the under-sampled target images, and\nwarps the reference image accordingly. Then, the aligned fully-sampled\nreference image joins the under-sampled target image in the reconstruction\nnetwork, to produce the high-quality target image. Considering the contrast\ndifference between the target and the reference, we particularly design the\ncross-modality-synthesis-based registration loss, in combination with the\nreconstruction loss, to jointly train the spatial alignment network and the\nreconstruction network. Our experiments on both clinical MRI and multi-coil\nk-space raw data demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our spatial\nalignment network.

          "description": "Brain aging, and more specifically the difference between the chronological\nand the biological age of a person, may be a promising biomarker for\nidentifying neurodegenerative diseases. For this purpose accurate prediction is\nimportant but the localisation of the areas that play a significant role in the\nprediction is also crucial, in order to gain clinicians' trust and reassurance\nabout the performance of a prediction model. Most interpretability methods are\nfocused on classification tasks and cannot be directly transferred to\nregression tasks. In this study, we focus on the task of brain age regression\nfrom 3D brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) images using a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork, termed prediction model. We interpret its predictions by extracting\nimportance maps, which discover the parts of the brain that are the most\nimportant for brain age. In order to do so, we assume that voxels that are not\nuseful for the regression are resilient to noise addition. We implement a noise\nmodel which aims to add as much noise as possible to the input without harming\nthe performance of the prediction model. We average the importance maps of the\nsubjects and end up with a population-based importance map, which displays the\nregions of the brain that are influential for the task. We test our method on\n13,750 3D brain MR images from the UK Biobank, and our findings are consistent\nwith the existing neuropathology literature, highlighting that the hippocampus\nand the ventricles are the most relevant regions for brain aging.",

The\nquery expression in referring segmentation typically indicates the target\nobject by describing its relationship with others. Therefore, to find the\ntarget one among all instances in the image, the model must have a holistic\nunderstanding of the whole image. To achieve this, we reformulate referring\nsegmentation as a direct attention problem: finding the region in the image\nwhere the query language expression is most attended to. We introduce\ntransformer and multi-head attention to build a network with an encoder-decoder\nattention mechanism architecture that \"queries\" the given image with the\nlanguage expression. Furthermore, we propose a Query Generation Module, which\nproduces multiple sets of queries with different attention weights that\nrepresent the diversified comprehensions of the language expression from\ndifferent aspects. At the same time, to find the best way from these\ndiversified comprehensions based on visual clues, we further propose a Query\nBalance Module to adaptively select the output features of these queries for a\nbetter mask generation.

In lung nodule classification, for example,\nmany works report results on the publicly available LIDC dataset. In theory,\nthis should allow a direct comparison of the performance of proposed methods\nand assess the impact of individual contributions. When analyzing seven recent\nworks, however, we find that each employs a different data selection process,\nleading to largely varying total number of samples and ratios between benign\nand malignant cases. As each subset will have different characteristics with\nvarying difficulty for classification, a direct comparison between the proposed\nmethods is thus not always possible, nor fair. We study the particular effect\nof truthing when aggregating labels from multiple experts. We show that\nspecific choices can have severe impact on the data distribution where it may\nbe possible to achieve superior performance on one sample distribution but not\non another. While we show that we can further improve on the state-of-the-art\non one sample selection, we also find that on a more challenging sample\nselection, on the same database, the more advanced models underperform with\nrespect to very simple baseline methods, highlighting that the selected data\ndistribution may play an even more important role than the model architecture.\nThis raises concerns about the validity of claimed methodological\ncontributions.

While the mainstream technique seeks to completely filter\nout the OOD samples for semi-supervised learning (SSL), we propose a novel\ntraining mechanism that could effectively exploit the presence of OOD data for\nenhanced feature learning while avoiding its adverse impact on the SSL. We\nachieve this goal by first introducing a warm-up training that leverages all\nthe unlabeled data, including both the in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples.\nSpecifically, we perform a pretext task that enforces our feature extractor to\nobtain a high-level semantic understanding of the training images, leading to\nmore discriminative features that can benefit the downstream tasks. Since the\nOOD samples are inevitably detrimental to SSL, we propose a novel cross-modal\nmatching strategy to detect OOD samples.

With this as the goal, we find that conventional two-stage\nmethods mainly suffer from positioning positive interactive human-object pairs,\nwhile one-stage methods are challenging to make an appropriate trade-off on\nmulti-task learning, i.e., object detection, and interaction classification.\nTherefore, a core problem is how to take the essence and discard the dregs from\nthe conventional two types of methods. To this end, we propose a novel\none-stage framework with disentangling human-object detection and interaction\nclassification in a cascade manner. In detail, we first design a human-object\npair generator based on a state-of-the-art one-stage HOI detector by removing\nthe interaction classification module or head and then design a relatively\nisolated interaction classifier to classify each human-object pair. Two cascade\ndecoders in our proposed framework can focus on one specific task, detection or\ninteraction classification. In terms of the specific implementation, we adopt a\ntransformer-based HOI detector as our base model.

Automated\nplankton imaging offers a promising way forward to monitor plankton communities\nwith high frequency and accuracy in real-time. Yet, manual annotation of\nmillions of images proposes a serious challenge to taxonomists. Deep learning\nclassifiers have been successfully applied in various fields and provided\nencouraging results when used to categorize marine plankton images. Here, we\npresent a set of deep learning models developed for the identification of lake\nplankton, and study several strategies to obtain optimal performances,which\nlead to operational prescriptions for users. To this aim, we annotated into 35\nclasses over 17900 images of zooplankton and large phytoplankton colonies,\ndetected in Lake Greifensee (Switzerland) with the Dual Scripps Plankton\nCamera. Our best models were based on transfer learning and ensembling, which\nclassified plankton images with 98% accuracy and 93% F1 score. When tested on\nfreely available plankton datasets produced by other automated imaging tools\n(ZooScan, FlowCytobot and ISIIS), our models performed better than previously\nused models.

          "description": "While state-of-the-art 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) achieve very\ngood results on action recognition datasets, they are computationally very\nexpensive and require many GFLOPs. While the GFLOPs of a 3D CNN can be\ndecreased by reducing the temporal feature resolution within the network, there\nis no setting that is optimal for all input clips. In this work, we therefore\nintroduce a differentiable Similarity Guided Sampling (SGS) module, which can\nbe plugged into any existing 3D CNN architecture. SGS empowers 3D CNNs by\nlearning the similarity of temporal features and grouping similar features\ntogether. As a result, the temporal feature resolution is not anymore static\nbut it varies for each input video clip. By integrating SGS as an additional\nlayer within current 3D CNNs, we can convert them into much more efficient 3D\nCNNs with adaptive temporal feature resolutions (ATFR). Our evaluations show\nthat the proposed module improves the state-of-the-art by reducing the\ncomputational cost (GFLOPs) by half while preserving or even improving the\naccuracy. We evaluate our module by adding it to multiple state-of-the-art 3D\nCNNs on various datasets such as Kinetics-600, Kinetics-400, mini-Kinetics,\nSomething-Something V2, UCF101, and HMDB51.",

          "description": "Text-based image retrieval has seen considerable progress in recent years.\nHowever, the performance of existing methods suffers in real life since the\nuser is likely to provide an incomplete description of an image, which often\nleads to results filled with false positives that fit the incomplete\ndescription. In this work, we introduce the partial-query problem and\nextensively analyze its influence on text-based image retrieval. Previous\ninteractive methods tackle the problem by passively receiving users' feedback\nto supplement the incomplete query iteratively, which is time-consuming and\nrequires heavy user effort. Instead, we propose a novel retrieval framework\nthat conducts the interactive process in an Ask-and-Confirm fashion, where AI\nactively searches for discriminative details missing in the current query, and\nusers only need to confirm AI's proposal. Specifically, we propose an\nobject-based interaction to make the interactive retrieval more user-friendly\nand present a reinforcement-learning-based policy to search for discriminative\nobjects. Furthermore, since fully-supervised training is often infeasible due\nto the difficulty of obtaining human-machine dialog data, we present a\nweakly-supervised training strategy that needs no human-annotated dialogs other\nthan a text-image dataset.

          "description": "Successful continual learning of new knowledge would enable intelligent\nsystems to recognize more and more classes of objects. However, current\nintelligent systems often fail to correctly recognize previously learned\nclasses of objects when updated to learn new classes. It is widely believed\nthat such downgraded performance is solely due to the catastrophic forgetting\nof previously learned knowledge. In this study, we argue that the class\nconfusion phenomena may also play a role in downgrading the classification\nperformance during continual learning, i.e., the high similarity between new\nclasses and any previously learned classes would also cause the classifier to\nmake mistakes in recognizing these old classes, even if the knowledge of these\nold classes is not forgotten. To alleviate the class confusion issue, we\npropose a discriminative distillation strategy to help the classify well learn\nthe discriminative features between confusing classes during continual\nlearning.

Its simplicity and effectiveness\nhave led to wide applications in the explanation of visual predictions and\nweakly-supervised localization tasks. However, CAM has its own shortcomings.\nThe computation of attribution maps relies on ad-hoc calibration steps that are\nnot part of the training computational graph, making it difficult for us to\nunderstand the real meaning of the attribution values. In this paper, we\nimprove CAM by explicitly incorporating a latent variable encoding the location\nof the cue for recognition in the formulation, thereby subsuming the\nattribution map into the training computational graph. The resulting model,\nclass activation latent mapping, or CALM, is trained with the\nexpectation-maximization algorithm.

          "description": "Although using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as backbones achieves\ngreat successes in computer vision, this work investigates a simple backbone\nnetwork useful for many dense prediction tasks without convolutions. Unlike the\nrecently-proposed Transformer model (e.g., ViT) that is specially designed for\nimage classification, we propose Pyramid Vision Transformer~(PVT), which\novercomes the difficulties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction\ntasks. PVT has several merits compared to prior arts. (1) Different from ViT\nthat typically has low-resolution outputs and high computational and memory\ncost, PVT can be not only trained on dense partitions of the image to achieve\nhigh output resolution, which is important for dense predictions but also using\na progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce computations of large feature maps.\n(2) PVT inherits the advantages from both CNN and Transformer, making it a\nunified backbone in various vision tasks without convolutions by simply\nreplacing CNN backbones. (3) We validate PVT by conducting extensive\nexperiments, showing that it boosts the performance of many downstream tasks,\ne.g., object detection, semantic, and instance segmentation. For example, with\na comparable number of parameters, RetinaNet+PVT achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO\ndataset, surpassing RetinNet+ResNet50 (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute AP.

The hierarchical design has\ntwo advantages: First, the memory demand for training on high-resolution images\nis amortized among subvolumes. Furthermore, anchoring the high-resolution\nsubvolumes to a single low-resolution image ensures anatomical consistency\nbetween subvolumes. During inference, our model can directly generate full\nhigh-resolution images. We also incorporate an encoder with a similar\nhierarchical structure into the model to extract features from the images.\nExperiments on 3D thorax CT and brain MRI demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms state of the art in image generation.

          "description": "In this paper, we propose an attention pyramid method for person\nre-identification. Unlike conventional attention-based methods which only learn\na global attention map, our attention pyramid exploits the attention regions in\na multi-scale manner because human attention varies with different scales. Our\nattention pyramid imitates the process of human visual perception which tends\nto notice the foreground person over the cluttered background, and further\nfocus on the specific color of the shirt with close observation. Specifically,\nwe describe our attention pyramid by a \"split-attend-merge-stack\" principle. We\nfirst split the features into multiple local parts and learn the corresponding\nattentions. Then, we merge local attentions and stack these merged attentions\nwith the residual connection as an attention pyramid. The proposed attention\npyramid is a lightweight plug-and-play module that can be applied to\noff-the-shelf models. We implement our attention pyramid method in two\ndifferent attention mechanisms including channel-wise attention and spatial\nattention. We evaluate our method on four largescale person re-identification\nbenchmarks including Market-1501, DukeMTMC, CUHK03, and MSMT17. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin with limited computational cost.",

In this paper, we take a step\ntowards that long-term goal -- we extract highly localized actionable\ninformation related to elementary actions such as pushing or pulling for\narticulated objects with movable parts. For example, given a drawer, our\nnetwork predicts that applying a pulling force on the handle opens the drawer.\nWe propose, discuss, and evaluate novel network architectures that given image\nand depth data, predict the set of actions possible at each pixel, and the\nregions over articulated parts that are likely to move under the force.

          "description": "Deep networks for Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) have achieved promising\nperformance recently and it is of great importance to further understand the\ninterpretability of these networks. Existing methods attempt to provide posthoc\nexplanations by investigating visual cues, which may not explore the internal\nrepresentations learned by deep networks. In this paper, we find that some\nhidden units of the network are selective to certain ranges of depth, and thus\nsuch behavior can be served as a way to interpret the internal representations.\nBased on our observations, we quantify the interpretability of a deep MDE\nnetwork by the depth selectivity of its hidden units. Moreover, we then propose\na method to train interpretable MDE deep networks without changing their\noriginal architectures, by assigning a depth range for each unit to select.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method is able to enhance the\ninterpretability of deep MDE networks by largely improving the depth\nselectivity of their units, while not harming or even improving the depth\nestimation accuracy. We further provide a comprehensive analysis to show the\nreliability of selective units, the applicability of our method on different\nlayers, models, and datasets, and a demonstration on analysis of model error.\nSource code and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/youzunzhi/InterpretableMDE .",

          "description": "Tracking multiple objects individually differs from tracking groups of\nrelated objects. When an object is a part of the group, its trajectory depends\non the trajectories of the other group members. Most of the current\nstate-of-the-art trackers follow the approach of tracking each object\nindependently, with the mechanism to handle the overlapping trajectories where\nnecessary. Such an approach does not take inter-object relations into account,\nwhich may cause unreliable tracking for the members of the groups, especially\nin crowded scenarios, where individual cues become unreliable due to\nocclusions. To overcome these limitations and to extend such trackers to\ncrowded scenes, we propose a plug-in Relation Encoding Module (REM). REM\nencodes relations between tracked objects by running a message passing over a\ncorresponding spatio-temporal graph, computing relation embeddings for the\ntracked objects. Our experiments on MOT17 and MOT20 demonstrate that the\nbaseline tracker improves its results after a simple extension with REM. The\nproposed module allows for tracking severely or even fully occluded objects by\nutilizing relational cues.",

          "description": "Abstract reasoning, i.e., inferring complicated patterns from given\nobservations, is a central building block of artificial general intelligence.\nWhile humans find the answer by either eliminating wrong candidates or first\nconstructing the answer, prior deep neural network (DNN)-based methods focus on\nthe former discriminative approach. This paper aims to design a framework for\nthe latter approach and bridge the gap between artificial and human\nintelligence. To this end, we propose logic-guided generation (LoGe), a novel\ngenerative DNN framework that reduces abstract reasoning as an optimization\nproblem in propositional logic. LoGe is composed of three steps: extract\npropositional variables from images, reason the answer variables with a logic\nlayer, and reconstruct the answer image from the variables. We demonstrate that\nLoGe outperforms the black box DNN frameworks for generative abstract reasoning\nunder the RAVEN benchmark, i.e., reconstructing answers based on capturing\ncorrect rules of various attributes from observations.",

Although ReID is developing at a considerably rapid pace,\nthere is currently no processing method for the ReID task in multiple\nscenarios. However, such processing method is required in real life scenarios,\nsuch as those involving security. In the present study, a new ReID scenario was\nexplored, which differs in terms of perspective, background, and pose(walking\nor cycling). Obviously, ordinary ReID processing methods cannot effectively\nhandle such a scenario, with the introduction of image datasets being the\noptimal solution, in addition to being considerably expensive.\n\nTo solve the aforementioned problem, a simple and effective method to\ngenerate images in several new scenarios was proposed, which is names the Copy\nand Paste method based on Pose(CPP). The CPP method is based on key point\ndetection, using copy as paste, to composite a new semantic image dataset in\ntwo different semantic image datasets. As an example, pedestrains and bicycles\ncan be used to generate several images that show the same person riding on\ndifferent bicycles. The CPP method is suitable for ReID tasks in new scenarios\nand outperforms the traditional methods when applied to the original datasets\nin original ReID tasks. To be specific, the CPP method can also perform better\nin terms of generalization for third-party public dataset.

          "description": "To train accurate deep object detectors under the extreme\nforeground-background imbalance, heuristic sampling methods are always\nnecessary, which either re-sample a subset of all training samples (hard\nsampling methods, \\eg biased sampling, OHEM), or use all training samples but\nre-weight them discriminatively (soft sampling methods, \\eg Focal Loss, GHM).\nIn this paper, we challenge the necessity of such hard/soft sampling methods\nfor training accurate deep object detectors. While previous studies have shown\nthat training detectors without heuristic sampling methods would significantly\ndegrade accuracy, we reveal that this degradation comes from an unreasonable\nclassification gradient magnitude caused by the imbalance, rather than a lack\nof re-sampling/re-weighting. Motivated by our discovery, we propose a simple\nyet effective \\emph{Sampling-Free} mechanism to achieve a reasonable\nclassification gradient magnitude by initialization and loss scaling.

          "description": "In recent years, computer vision algorithms have become more and more\npowerful, which enabled technologies such as autonomous driving to evolve with\nrapid pace. However, current algorithms mainly share one limitation: They rely\non directly visible objects. This is a major drawback compared to human\nbehavior, where indirect visual cues caused by the actual object (e.g.,\nshadows) are already used intuitively to retrieve information or anticipate\noccurring objects. While driving at night, this performance deficit becomes\neven more obvious: Humans already process the light artifacts caused by\noncoming vehicles to assume their future appearance, whereas current object\ndetection systems rely on the oncoming vehicle's direct visibility. Based on\nprevious work in this subject, we present with this paper a complete system\ncapable of solving the task to providently detect oncoming vehicles at\nnighttime based on their caused light artifacts. For that, we outline the full\nalgorithm architecture ranging from the detection of light artifacts in the\nimage space, localizing the objects in the three-dimensional space, and\nverifying the objects over time. To demonstrate the applicability, we deploy\nthe system in a test vehicle and use the information of providently detected\nvehicles to control the glare-free high beam system proactively. Using this\nexperimental setting, we quantify the time benefit that the provident vehicle\ndetection system provides compared to an in-production computer vision system.\nAdditionally, the glare-free high beam use case provides a real-time and\nreal-world visualization interface of the detection results. With this\ncontribution, we want to put awareness on the unconventional sensing task of\nprovident object detection and further close the performance gap between human\nbehavior and computer vision algorithms in order to bring autonomous and\nautomated driving a step forward.",

          "description": "Synthetic X-ray images are simulated X-ray images projected from CT data.\nHigh-quality synthetic X-ray images can facilitate various applications such as\nsurgical image guidance systems and VR training simulations. However, it is\ndifficult to produce high-quality arbitrary view synthetic X-ray images in\nreal-time due to different CT slice thickness, high computational cost, and the\ncomplexity of algorithms. Our goal is to generate high-resolution synthetic\nX-ray images in real-time by upsampling low-resolution images with deep\nlearning-based super-resolution methods. Reference-based Super Resolution\n(RefSR) has been well studied in recent years and has shown higher performance\nthan traditional Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). It can produce fine\ndetails by utilizing the reference image but still inevitably generates some\nartifacts and noise. In this paper, we introduce frequency domain loss as a\nconstraint to further improve the quality of the RefSR results with fine\ndetails and without obvious artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first paper utilizing the frequency domain for the loss functions in the\nfield of super-resolution. We achieved good results in evaluating our method on\nboth synthetic and real X-ray image datasets.",

          "description": "Existing blind image super-resolution (SR) methods mostly assume blur kernels\nare spatially invariant across the whole image. However, such an assumption is\nrarely applicable for real images whose blur kernels are usually spatially\nvariant due to factors such as object motion and out-of-focus. Hence, existing\nblind SR methods would inevitably give rise to poor performance in real\napplications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a mutual affine\nnetwork (MANet) for spatially variant kernel estimation. Specifically, MANet\nhas two distinctive features. First, it has a moderate receptive field so as to\nkeep the locality of degradation. Second, it involves a new mutual affine\nconvolution (MAConv) layer that enhances feature expressiveness without\nincreasing receptive field, model size and computation burden. This is made\npossible through exploiting channel interdependence, which applies each channel\nsplit with an affine transformation module whose input are the rest channel\nsplits. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real images show that the\nproposed MANet not only performs favorably for both spatially variant and\ninvariant kernel estimation, but also leads to state-of-the-art blind SR\nperformance when combined with non-blind SR methods.",

          "description": "Vision transformers have attracted much attention from computer vision\nresearchers as they are not restricted to the spatial inductive bias of\nConvNets. However, although Transformer-based backbones have achieved much\nprogress on ImageNet classification, it is still unclear whether the learned\nrepresentations are as transferable as or even more transferable than ConvNets'\nfeatures. To address this point, we systematically investigate the transfer\nlearning ability of ConvNets and vision transformers in 15 single-task and\nmulti-task performance evaluations. Given the strong correlation between the\nperformance of pre-trained models and transfer learning, we include 2 residual\nConvNets (i.e., R-101x3 and R-152x4) and 3 Transformer-based visual backbones\n(i.e., ViT-B, ViT-L and Swin-B), which have close error rates on ImageNet, that\nindicate similar transfer learning performance on downstream datasets.\n\nWe observe consistent advantages of Transformer-based backbones on 13\ndownstream tasks (out of 15), including but not limited to fine-grained\nclassification, scene recognition (classification, segmentation and depth\nestimation), open-domain classification, face recognition, etc. More\nspecifically, we find that two ViT models heavily rely on whole network\nfine-tuning to achieve performance gains while Swin Transformer does not have\nsuch a requirement. Moreover, vision transformers behave more robustly in\nmulti-task learning, i.e., bringing more improvements when managing mutually\nbeneficial tasks and reducing performance losses when tackling irrelevant\ntasks. We hope our discoveries can facilitate the exploration and exploitation\nof vision transformers in the future.",

It\nis a challenging task that has several real-world applications in\nhuman-computer interaction, image-text reference resolution, and video-text\nreference resolution. In the last years, several works have addressed this\nproblem with heavy and complex models that try to capture visual-textual\ndependencies better than before. These models are typically constituted by two\nmain components that focus on how to learn useful multi-modal features for\ngrounding and how to improve the predicted bounding box of the visual mention,\nrespectively. Finding the right learning balance between these two sub-tasks is\nnot easy, and the current models are not necessarily optimal with respect to\nthis issue. In this work, we propose a model that, although using a simple\nmulti-modal feature fusion component, is able to achieve a higher accuracy than\nstate-of-the-art models thanks to the adoption of a more effective loss\nfunction, based on the classes probabilities, that reach, in the considered\ndatasets, a better learning balance between the two sub-tasks mentioned above.",

          "description": "Normalizing flows have recently demonstrated promising results for low-level\nvision tasks. For image super-resolution (SR), it learns to predict diverse\nphoto-realistic high-resolution (HR) images from the low-resolution (LR) image\nrather than learning a deterministic mapping. For image rescaling, it achieves\nhigh accuracy by jointly modelling the downscaling and upscaling processes.\nWhile existing approaches employ specialized techniques for these two tasks, we\nset out to unify them in a single formulation. In this paper, we propose the\nhierarchical conditional flow (HCFlow) as a unified framework for image SR and\nimage rescaling. More specifically, HCFlow learns a bijective mapping between\nHR and LR image pairs by modelling the distribution of the LR image and the\nrest high-frequency component simultaneously. In particular, the high-frequency\ncomponent is conditional on the LR image in a hierarchical manner. To further\nenhance the performance, other losses such as perceptual loss and GAN loss are\ncombined with the commonly used negative log-likelihood loss in training.\nExtensive experiments on general image SR, face image SR and image rescaling\nhave demonstrated that the proposed HCFlow achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.",

          "description": "Medical images, especially volumetric images, are of high resolution and\noften exceed the capacity of standard desktop GPUs. As a result, most deep\nlearning-based medical image analysis tasks require the input images to be\ndownsampled, often substantially, before these can be fed to a neural network.\nHowever, downsampling can lead to a loss of image quality, which is undesirable\nespecially in reconstruction tasks, where the fine geometric details need to be\npreserved. In this paper, we propose that high-resolution images can be\nreconstructed in a coarse-to-fine fashion, where a deep learning algorithm is\nonly responsible for generating a coarse representation of the image, which\nconsumes moderate GPU memory. For producing the high-resolution outcome, we\npropose two novel methods: learned voxel rearrangement of the coarse output and\nhierarchical image synthesis. Compared to the coarse output, the\nhigh-resolution counterpart allows for smooth surface triangulation, which can\nbe 3D-printed in the highest possible quality. Experiments of this paper are\ncarried out on the dataset of AutoImplant 2021\n(https://autoimplant2021.grand-challenge.org/), a MICCAI challenge on cranial\nimplant design.

          "description": "Virtual 3D try-on can provide an intuitive and realistic view for online\nshopping and has a huge potential commercial value. However, existing 3D\nvirtual try-on methods mainly rely on annotated 3D human shapes and garment\ntemplates, which hinders their applications in practical scenarios. 2D virtual\ntry-on approaches provide a faster alternative to manipulate clothed humans,\nbut lack the rich and realistic 3D representation. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Monocular-to-3D Virtual Try-On Network (M3D-VTON) that builds on the\nmerits of both 2D and 3D approaches. By integrating 2D information efficiently\nand learning a mapping that lifts the 2D representation to 3D, we make the\nfirst attempt to reconstruct a 3D try-on mesh only taking the target clothing\nand a person image as inputs. The proposed M3D-VTON includes three modules: 1)\nThe Monocular Prediction Module (MPM) that estimates an initial full-body depth\nmap and accomplishes 2D clothes-person alignment through a novel two-stage\nwarping procedure; 2) The Depth Refinement Module (DRM) that refines the\ninitial body depth to produce more detailed pleat and face characteristics; 3)\nThe Texture Fusion Module (TFM) that fuses the warped clothing with the\nnon-target body part to refine the results. We also construct a high-quality\nsynthesized Monocular-to-3D virtual try-on dataset, in which each person image\nis associated with a front and a back depth map. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed M3D-VTON can manipulate and reconstruct the 3D\nhuman body wearing the given clothing with compelling details and is more\nefficient than other 3D approaches.",

          "description": "Medical imaging technologies, including computed tomography (CT) or chest\nX-Ray (CXR), are largely employed to facilitate the diagnosis of the COVID-19.\nSince manual report writing is usually too time-consuming, a more intelligent\nauxiliary medical system that could generate medical reports automatically and\nimmediately is urgently needed. In this article, we propose to use the medical\nvisual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the\nCOVID-19 scans and generate the medical report automatically based on the\ndetected lesion regions. To produce more accurate medical reports and minimize\nthe visual-and-linguistic differences, this model adopts an alternate learning\nstrategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.\nTo be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the\nknowledge from medical texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize\nthe acquired knowledge for professional medical sentences generations through\nobservations of medical images. In practice, for automatic medical report\ngeneration on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical\nfindings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital\nof Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun\nYat-sen University, Zhuhai, China. Besides, to alleviate the insufficiency of\nthe COVID-19 training samples, our model was first trained on the large-scale\nChinese CX-CHR dataset and then transferred to the COVID-19 CT dataset for\nfurther fine-tuning. The experimental results showed that Medical-VLBERT\nachieved state-of-the-art performances on terminology prediction and report\ngeneration with the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset and the CX-CHR dataset.

          "description": "Background: Cervical cancer seriously affects the health of the female\nreproductive system. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) emerges as a\nnon-invasive, high-resolution imaging technology for cervical disease\ndetection. However, OCT image annotation is knowledge-intensive and\ntime-consuming, which impedes the training process of deep-learning-based\nclassification models. Objective: This study aims to develop a computer-aided\ndiagnosis (CADx) approach to classifying in-vivo cervical OCT images based on\nself-supervised learning. Methods: Besides high-level semantic features\nextracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed CADx approach\nleverages unlabeled cervical OCT images' texture features learned by\ncontrastive texture learning. We conducted ten-fold cross-validation on the OCT\nimage dataset from a multi-center clinical study on 733 patients from China.\nResults: In a binary classification task for detecting high-risk diseases,\nincluding high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and cervical\ncancer, our method achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.9798 Plus\nor Minus 0.0157 with a sensitivity of 91.17 Plus or Minus 4.99% and a\nspecificity of 93.96 Plus or Minus 4.72% for OCT image patches; also, it\noutperformed two out of four medical experts on the test set. Furthermore, our\nmethod achieved a 91.53% sensitivity and 97.37% specificity on an external\nvalidation dataset containing 287 3D OCT volumes from 118 Chinese patients in a\nnew hospital using a cross-shaped threshold voting strategy. Conclusion: The\nproposed contrastive-learning-based CADx method outperformed the end-to-end CNN\nmodels and provided better interpretability based on texture features, which\nholds great potential to be used in the clinical protocol of \"see-and-treat.\"",

          "description": "Many camera sensors use a dual-pixel (DP) design that operates as a\nrudimentary light field providing two sub-aperture views of a scene in a single\ncapture. The DP sensor was developed to improve how cameras perform autofocus.\nSince the DP sensor's introduction, researchers have found additional uses for\nthe DP data, such as depth estimation, reflection removal, and defocus\ndeblurring. We are interested in the latter task of defocus deblurring. In\nparticular, we propose a single-image deblurring network that incorporates the\ntwo sub-aperture views into a multi-task framework. Specifically, we show that\njointly learning to predict the two DP views from a single blurry input image\nimproves the network's ability to learn to deblur the image. Our experiments\nshow this multi-task strategy achieves +1dB PSNR improvement over\nstate-of-the-art defocus deblurring methods. In addition, our multi-task\nframework allows accurate DP-view synthesis (e.g., ~ 39dB PSNR) from the single\ninput image. These high-quality DP views can be used for other DP-based\napplications, such as reflection removal. As part of this effort, we have\ncaptured a new dataset of 7,059 high-quality images to support our training for\nthe DP-view synthesis task.

          "description": "Deep hashing has been widely applied to large-scale image retrieval by\nencoding high-dimensional data points into binary codes for efficient\nretrieval. Compared with pairwise/triplet similarity based hash learning,\ncentral similarity based hashing can more efficiently capture the global data\ndistribution. For multi-label image retrieval, however, previous methods only\nuse multiple hash centers with equal weights to generate one centroid as the\nlearning target, which ignores the relationship between the weights of hash\ncenters and the proportion of instance regions in the image. To address the\nabove issue, we propose a two-step alternative optimization approach,\nInstance-weighted Central Similarity (ICS), to automatically learn the center\nweight corresponding to a hash code. Firstly, we apply the maximum entropy\nregularizer to prevent one hash center from dominating the loss function, and\ncompute the center weights via projection gradient descent. Secondly, we update\nneural network parameters by standard back-propagation with fixed center\nweights. More importantly, the learned center weights can well reflect the\nproportion of foreground instances in the image. Our method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on the image retrieval benchmarks, and especially\nimproves the mAP by 1.6%-6.4% on the MS COCO dataset.",

          "description": "More than 90\\% of colorectal cancer is gradually transformed from colorectal\npolyps. In clinical practice, precise polyp segmentation provides important\ninformation in the early detection of colorectal cancer. Therefore, automatic\npolyp segmentation techniques are of great importance for both patients and\ndoctors. Most existing methods are based on U-shape structure and use\nelement-wise addition or concatenation to fuse different level features\nprogressively in decoder. However, both the two operations easily generate\nplenty of redundant information, which will weaken the complementarity between\ndifferent level features, resulting in inaccurate localization and blurred\nedges of polyps. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-scale\nsubtraction network (MSNet) to segment polyp from colonoscopy image.\nSpecifically, we first design a subtraction unit (SU) to produce the difference\nfeatures between adjacent levels in encoder. Then, we pyramidally equip the SUs\nat different levels with varying receptive fields, thereby obtaining rich\nmulti-scale difference information. In addition, we build a training-free\nnetwork \"LossNet\" to comprehensively supervise the polyp-aware features from\nbottom layer to top layer, which drives the MSNet to capture the detailed and\nstructural cues simultaneously. Extensive experiments on five benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our MSNet performs favorably against most\nstate-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics. Furthermore, MSNet\nruns at a real-time speed of $\\sim$70fps when processing a $352 \\times 352$\nimage.

Recently, a new problem of\ngenerating cloned or synthesized human voice of a person is emerging. AI-based\ndeep learning models can synthesize any person's voice requiring just a few\nseconds of audio. With the emerging threat of impersonation attacks using\ndeepfake videos and audios, new deepfake detectors are need that focuses on\nboth, video and audio. Detecting deepfakes is a challenging task and\nresearchers have made numerous attempts and proposed several deepfake detection\nmethods. To develop a good deepfake detector, a handsome amount of good quality\ndataset is needed that captures the real world scenarios. Many researchers have\ncontributed in this cause and provided several deepfake dataset, self generated\nand in-the-wild. However, almost all of these datasets either contains deepfake\nvideos or audio. Moreover, the recent deepfake datasets proposed by researchers\nhave racial bias issues. Hence, there is a crucial need of a good deepfake\nvideo and audio deepfake dataset. To fill this gap, we propose a novel\nAudio-Video Deepfake dataset (FakeAVCeleb) that not only contains deepfake\nvideos but respective synthesized cloned audios as well. We generated our\ndataset using recent most popular deepfake generation methods and the videos\nand audios are perfectly lip-synced with each other. To generate a more\nrealistic dataset, we selected real YouTube videos of celebrities having four\nracial backgrounds (Caucasian, Black, East Asian and South Asian) to counter\nthe racial bias issue.

Conventional methods typically\nstack sub-networks with multi-scale input images and gradually improve\nsharpness of images from the bottom sub-network to the top sub-network,\nyielding inevitably high computational costs. Toward a fast and accurate\ndeblurring network design, we revisit the coarse-to-fine strategy and present a\nmulti-input multi-output U-net (MIMO-UNet). The MIMO-UNet has three distinct\nfeatures.

          "description": "Existing efforts on Just noticeable difference (JND) estimation mainly\ndedicate to modeling the visibility masking effects of different factors in\nspatial and frequency domains, and then fusing them into an overall JND\nestimate. However, the overall visibility masking effect can be related with\nmore contributing factors beyond those have been considered in the literature\nand it is also insufficiently accurate to formulate the masking effect even for\nan individual factor. Moreover, the potential interactions among different\nmasking effects are also difficult to be characterized with a simple fusion\nmodel. In this work, we turn to a dramatically different way to address these\nproblems with a top-down design philosophy. Instead of formulating and fusing\nmultiple masking effects in a bottom-up way, the proposed JND estimation model\ndirectly generates a critical perceptual lossless (CPL) image from a top-down\nperspective and calculates the difference map between the original image and\nthe CPL image as the final JND map. Given an input image, an adaptively\ncritical point (perceptual lossless threshold), defined as the minimum number\nof spectral components in Karhunen-Lo\\'{e}ve Transform (KLT) used for\nperceptual lossless image reconstruction, is derived by exploiting the\nconvergence characteristics of KLT coefficient energy. Then, the CPL image can\nbe reconstructed via inverse KLT according to the derived critical point.\nFinally, the difference map between the original image and the CPL image is\ncalculated as the JND map. The performance of the proposed JND model is\nevaluated with two applications including JND-guided noise injection and\nJND-guided image compression. Experimental results have demonstrated that our\nproposed JND model can achieve better performance than several latest JND\nmodels.",

          "description": "Few-shot learning aims to recognize novel classes with few examples.\nPre-training based methods effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a\nfeature extractor and then fine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based\nmeta-learning. However, results show that the fine-tuning step makes marginal\nimprovements. In this paper, 1) we figure out the reason, i.e., in the\npre-trained feature space, the base classes already form compact clusters while\nnovel classes spread as groups with large variances, which implies that\nfine-tuning feature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning\nfeature extractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes.\nConsequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based meta-learning\nframework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge (i.e.,\nclass-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative features\nfor seen attributes as priors. Second, a part/attribute transfer network is\ndesigned to learn to infer the representative features for unseen attributes as\nsupplementary priors. Finally, a prototype completion network is devised to\nlearn to complete prototypes with these priors. Moreover, to avoid the\nprototype completion error, we further develop a Gaussian based prototype\nfusion strategy that fuses the mean-based and completed prototypes by\nexploiting the unlabeled samples. Extensive experiments show that our method:\n(i) obtains more accurate prototypes; (ii) achieves superior performance on\nboth inductive and transductive FSL settings.",

However, for each scenario, it is required to\nfirst collect enough data and then train such a domain adaptive re-id model,\nthus restricting their practical application.

In this\nwork, we propose a large-scale Visible-Event benchmark (termed VisEvent) due to\nthe lack of a realistic and scaled dataset for this task. Our dataset consists\nof 820 video pairs captured under low illumination, high speed, and background\nclutter scenarios, and it is divided into a training and a testing subset, each\nof which contains 500 and 320 videos, respectively. Based on VisEvent, we\ntransform the event flows into event images and construct more than 30 baseline\nmethods by extending current single-modality trackers into dual-modality\nversions. More importantly, we further build a simple but effective tracking\nalgorithm by proposing a cross-modality transformer, to achieve more effective\nfeature fusion between visible and event data. Extensive experiments on the\nproposed VisEvent dataset, and two simulated datasets (i.e., OTB-DVS and\nVOT-DVS), validated the effectiveness of our model. The dataset and source code\nwill be available at our project page:\n\\url{https://sites.google.com/view/viseventtrack/}.",

          "description": "Universal adversarial attacks, which hinder most deep neural network (DNN)\ntasks using only a small single perturbation called a universal adversarial\nperturbation (UAP), is a realistic security threat to the practical application\nof a DNN. In particular, such attacks cause serious problems in medical\nimaging. Given that computer-based systems are generally operated under a\nblack-box condition in which only queries on inputs are allowed and outputs are\naccessible, the impact of UAPs seems to be limited because well-used algorithms\nfor generating UAPs are limited to a white-box condition in which adversaries\ncan access the model weights and loss gradients. Nevertheless, we demonstrate\nthat UAPs are easily generatable using a relatively small dataset under\nblack-box conditions. In particular, we propose a method for generating UAPs\nusing a simple hill-climbing search based only on DNN outputs and demonstrate\nthe validity of the proposed method using representative DNN-based medical\nimage classifications. Black-box UAPs can be used to conduct both non-targeted\nand targeted attacks. Overall, the black-box UAPs showed high attack success\nrates (40% to 90%), although some of them had relatively low success rates\nbecause the method only utilizes limited information to generate UAPs. The\nvulnerability of black-box UAPs was observed in several model architectures.\nThe results indicate that adversaries can also generate UAPs through a simple\nprocedure under the black-box condition to foil or control DNN-based medical\nimage diagnoses, and that UAPs are a more realistic security threat.",

Firstly, unlike existing multimodal methods that necessitate\nindividual encoders for different modalities, we verify that multimodal\nfeatures can be learnt within a shared single network by merely maintaining\nmodality-specific batch normalization layers in the encoder, which also enables\nimplicit fusion via joint feature representation learning. Secondly, we propose\na bidirectional multi-layer fusion scheme, where multimodal features can be\nexploited progressively. To take advantage of such scheme, we introduce two\nasymmetric fusion operations including channel shuffle and pixel shift, which\nlearn different fused features with respect to different fusion directions.\nThese two operations are parameter-free and strengthen the multimodal feature\ninteractions across channels as well as enhance the spatial feature\ndiscrimination within channels.

To overcome the real-world limitations of data collection,\nsimulating tactile response in a virtual environment comes as a desirable\ndirection of robotic research. In this paper, we propose Elastic Interaction of\nParticles (EIP) for tactile simulation. Most existing works model the tactile\nsensor as a rigid multi-body, which is incapable of reflecting the elastic\nproperty of the tactile sensor as well as characterizing the fine-grained\nphysical interaction between the two objects. By contrast, EIP models the\ntactile sensor as a group of coordinated particles, and the elastic property is\napplied to regulate the deformation of particles during contact. With the\ntactile simulation by EIP, we further propose a tactile-visual perception\nnetwork that enables information fusion between tactile data and visual images.\nThe perception network is based on a global-to-local fusion mechanism where\nmulti-scale tactile features are aggregated to the corresponding local region\nof the visual modality with the guidance of tactile positions and directions.\nThe fusion method exhibits superiority regarding the 3D geometric\nreconstruction task.",

Several math symbols are very\nsimilar in the writing style, such as dot and comma or 0, O, and o, which is a\nchallenge for HME recognition systems to handle without using contextual\ninformation. To address this problem, this paper presents a Transformer-based\nMath Language Model (TMLM). Based on the self-attention mechanism, the\nhigh-level representation of an input token in a sequence of tokens is computed\nby how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long\ndependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical\nexpression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of\napproximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the\nperplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e.,\nthe N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we\ncombine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition\nsystem using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates. The\nexpression rates on the testing sets of CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 were\nimproved by 2.97 and 0.83 percentage points, respectively.",

          "description": "Face recognition (FR) has made extraordinary progress owing to the\nadvancement of deep convolutional neural networks. However, demographic bias\namong different racial cohorts still challenges the practical face recognition\nsystem. The race factor has been proven to be a dilemma for fair FR (FFR) as\nthe subject-related specific attributes induce the classification bias whilst\ncarrying some useful cues for FR. To mitigate racial bias and meantime preserve\nrobust FR, we abstract face identity-related representation as a signal\ndenoising problem and propose a progressive cross transformer (PCT) method for\nfair face recognition. Originating from the signal decomposition theory, we\nattempt to decouple face representation into i) identity-related components and\nii) noisy/identity-unrelated components induced by race. As an extension of\nsignal subspace decomposition, we formulate face decoupling as a generalized\nfunctional expression model to cross-predict face identity and race\ninformation. The face expression model is further concretized by designing dual\ncross-transformers to distill identity-related components and suppress racial\nnoises. In order to refine face representation, we take a progressive face\ndecoupling way to learn identity/race-specific transformations, so that\nidentity-unrelated components induced by race could be better disentangled. We\nevaluate the proposed PCT on the public fair face recognition benchmarks (BFW,\nRFW) and verify that PCT is capable of mitigating bias in face recognition\nwhile achieving state-of-the-art FR performance.

We validate the proposed MRI acceleration\nparadigm on three classical medical datasets, demonstrating a noticeable\nimprovement of the target metrics at the high acceleration factors (for the\nsegmentation problem at $\\times$16 acceleration, we report up to 12%\nimprovement in Dice score over the other undersampling patterns).",

          "description": "Perceiving obstacles and avoiding collisions is fundamental to the safe\noperation of a robot system, particularly when the robot must operate in highly\ndynamic human environments. Proximity detection using on-robot sensors can be\nused to avoid or mitigate impending collisions. However, existing proximity\nsensing methods are orientation and placement dependent, resulting in blind\nspots even with large numbers of sensors. In this paper, we introduce the\nphenomenon of the Leaky Surface Wave (LSW), a novel sensing modality, and\npresent AuraSense, a proximity detection system using the LSW. AuraSense is the\nfirst system to realize no-dead-spot proximity sensing for robot arms. It\nrequires only a single pair of piezoelectric transducers, and can easily be\napplied to off-the-shelf robots with minimal modifications. We further\nintroduce a set of signal processing techniques and a lightweight neural\nnetwork to address the unique challenges in using the LSW for proximity\nsensing. Finally, we demonstrate a prototype system consisting of a single\npiezoelectric element pair on a robot manipulator, which validates our design.\nWe conducted several micro benchmark experiments and performed more than 2000\non-robot proximity detection trials with various potential robot arm materials,\ncolliding objects, approach patterns, and robot movement patterns. AuraSense\nachieves 100% and 95.3% true positive proximity detection rates when the arm\napproaches static and mobile obstacles respectively, with a true negative rate\nover 99%, showing the real-world viability of this system.",

But the problem\nwith binaural audio recording is that it requires a specialized setup which is\nnot possible to fabricate within handheld devices as compared to traditional\nmono audio that can be recorded with a single microphone. In order to overcome\nthis drawback, prior works have tried to uplift the mono recorded audio to\nbinaural audio as a post processing step conditioning on the visual input. But\nall the prior approaches missed other most important information required for\nthe task, i.e. distance of different sound producing objects from the recording\nsetup. In this work, we argue that the depth map of the scene can act as a\nproxy for encoding distance information of objects in the scene and show that\nadding depth features along with image features improves the performance both\nqualitatively and quantitatively.

Our\nanalyses reveal that pruning structures (filters and/or layers) from\nconvolutional networks increase not only generalization but also robustness to\nadversarial images (natural images with content modified). Such achievements\nare possible since pruning reduces network capacity and provides\nregularization, which have been proven effective tools against adversarial\nimages. In contrast to promising defense mechanisms that require training with\nadversarial images and careful regularization, we show that pruning obtains\ncompetitive results considering only natural images (e.g., the standard and\nlow-cost training).

To resolve this issue, we propose SnowflakeNet with Snowflake\nPoint Deconvolution (SPD) to generate the complete point clouds.

The locally compact and structured point cloud generated by SPD is\nable to precisely capture the structure characteristic of 3D shape in local\npatches, which enables the network to predict highly detailed geometries, such\nas smooth regions, sharp edges and corners.

          "description": "We introduce the problem of multi-camera trajectory forecasting (MCTF), which\ninvolves predicting the trajectory of a moving object across a network of\ncameras. While multi-camera setups are widespread for applications such as\nsurveillance and traffic monitoring, existing trajectory forecasting methods\ntypically focus on single-camera trajectory forecasting (SCTF), limiting their\nuse for such applications. Furthermore, using a single camera limits the\nfield-of-view available, making long-term trajectory forecasting impossible. We\naddress these shortcomings of SCTF by developing an MCTF framework that\nsimultaneously uses all estimated relative object locations from several\nviewpoints and predicts the object's future location in all possible\nviewpoints. Our framework follows a Which-When-Where approach that predicts in\nwhich camera(s) the objects appear and when and where within the camera views\nthey appear. To this end, we propose the concept of trajectory tensors: a new\ntechnique to encode trajectories across multiple camera views and the\nassociated uncertainties. We develop several encoder-decoder MCTF models for\ntrajectory tensors and present extensive experiments on our own database\n(comprising 600 hours of video data from 15 camera views) created particularly\nfor the MCTF task. Results show that our trajectory tensor models outperform\ncoordinate trajectory-based MCTF models and existing SCTF methods adapted for\nMCTF.

          "description": "This paper proposes a novel model for recognizing images with composite\nattribute-object concepts, notably for composite concepts that are unseen\nduring model training. We aim to explore the three key properties required by\nthe task --- relation-aware, consistent, and decoupled --- to learn rich and\nrobust features for primitive concepts that compose attribute-object pairs. To\nthis end, we propose the Blocked Message Passing Network (BMP-Net). The model\nconsists of two modules. The concept module generates semantically meaningful\nfeatures for primitive concepts, whereas the visual module extracts visual\nfeatures for attributes and objects from input images. A message passing\nmechanism is used in the concept module to capture the relations between\nprimitive concepts. Furthermore, to prevent the model from being biased towards\nseen composite concepts and reduce the entanglement between attributes and\nobjects, we propose a blocking mechanism that equalizes the information\navailable to the model for both seen and unseen concepts. Extensive experiments\nand ablation studies on two benchmarks show the efficacy of the proposed model.",

Despite progress in machine learning and computer\nvision that allows for advanced gesture recognition, an integrated collection\nof such open-source methods and a user-customisable approach to utilising them\nin a low-cost solution for touchless interaction in existing software is still\nmissing. In this paper, we introduce the MotionInput v2.0 application. This\napplication utilises published open-source libraries and additional gesture\ndefinitions developed to take the video stream from a standard RGB webcam as\ninput. It then maps human motion gestures to input operations for existing\napplications and games. The user can choose their own preferred way of\ninteracting from a series of motion types, including single and bi-modal hand\ngesturing, full-body repetitive or extremities-based exercises, head and facial\nmovements, eye tracking, and combinations of the above. We also introduce a\nseries of bespoke gesture recognition classifications as DirectInput triggers,\nincluding gestures for idle states, auto calibration, depth capture from a 2D\nRGB webcam stream and tracking of facial motions such as mouth motions,\nwinking, and head direction with rotation. Three use case areas assisted the\ndevelopment of the modules: creativity software, office and clinical software,\nand gaming software. A collection of open-source libraries has been integrated\nand provide a layer of modular gesture mapping on top of existing mouse and\nkeyboard controls in Windows via DirectX. With ease of access to webcams\nintegrated into most laptops and desktop computers, touchless computing becomes\nmore available with MotionInput v2.0, in a federated and locally processed\nmethod.",

Incrementally learning\nthese OOD objects with few annotations is an ideal way to enlarge the knowledge\nbase of the deep learning models. In this paper, we propose an open world\nsemantic segmentation system that includes two modules: (1) an open-set\nsemantic segmentation module to detect both in-distribution and OOD objects.\n(2) an incremental few-shot learning module to gradually incorporate those OOD\nobjects into its existing knowledge base. This open world semantic segmentation\nsystem behaves like a human being, which is able to identify OOD objects and\ngradually learn them with corresponding supervision. We adopt the Deep Metric\nLearning Network (DMLNet) with contrastive clustering to implement open-set\nsemantic segmentation. Compared to other open-set semantic segmentation\nmethods, our DMLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging\nopen-set semantic segmentation datasets without using additional data or\ngenerative models.

However,\ndue to the common occlusion in LiDAR scans, it is non-trivial to conduct\naccurate feature comparisons on severe sparse and incomplete shapes. In this\nwork, we exploit the ground truth bounding box given in the first frame as a\nstrong cue to enhance the feature description of the target object, enabling a\nmore accurate feature comparison in a simple yet effective way. In particular,\nwe first propose the BoxCloud, an informative and robust representation, to\ndepict an object using the point-to-box relation. We further design an\nefficient box-aware feature fusion module, which leverages the aforementioned\nBoxCloud for reliable feature matching and embedding. Integrating the proposed\ngeneral components into an existing model P2B, we construct a superior\nbox-aware tracker (BAT). Experiments confirm that our proposed BAT outperforms\nthe previous state-of-the-art by a large margin on both KITTI and NuScenes\nbenchmarks, achieving a 12.8% improvement in terms of precision while running\n~20% faster.",

          "description": "Background and Aim: Recently, deep learning using convolutional neural\nnetwork has been used successfully to classify the images of breast cells\naccurately. However, the accuracy of manual classification of those\nhistopathological images is comparatively low. This research aims to increase\nthe accuracy of the classification of breast cancer images by utilizing a\nPatch-Based Classifier (PBC) along with deep learning architecture.\nMethodology: The proposed system consists of a Deep Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (DCNN) that helps in enhancing and increasing the accuracy of the\nclassification process. This is done by the use of the Patch-based Classifier\n(PBC). CNN has completely different layers where images are first fed through\nconvolutional layers using hyperbolic tangent function together with the\nmax-pooling layer, drop out layers, and SoftMax function for classification.\nFurther, the output obtained is fed to a patch-based classifier that consists\nof patch-wise classification output followed by majority voting. Results: The\nresults are obtained throughout the classification stage for breast cancer\nimages that are collected from breast-histology datasets. The proposed solution\nimproves the accuracy of classification whether or not the images had normal,\nbenign, in-situ, or invasive carcinoma from 87% to 94% with a decrease in\nprocessing time from 0.45 s to 0.2s on average. Conclusion: The proposed\nsolution focused on increasing the accuracy of classifying cancer in the breast\nby enhancing the image contrast and reducing the vanishing gradient. Finally,\nthis solution for the implementation of the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram\nEqualization (CLAHE) technique and modified tangent function helps in\nincreasing the accuracy.",

Observing this, we propose a novel task, along\nwith a new dataset: Trope Understanding in Movies and Animations (TrUMAn),\nintending to evaluate and develop learning systems beyond visual signals.\nTropes are frequently used storytelling devices for creative works.

          "description": "Attribute-based person search is the task of finding person images that are\nbest matched with a set of text attributes given as query. The main challenge\nof this task is the large modality gap between attributes and images. To reduce\nthe gap, we present a new loss for learning cross-modal embeddings in the\ncontext of attribute-based person search. We regard a set of attributes as a\ncategory of people sharing the same traits. In a joint embedding space of the\ntwo modalities, our loss pulls images close to their person categories for\nmodality alignment. More importantly, it pushes apart a pair of person\ncategories by a margin determined adaptively by their semantic distance, where\nthe distance metric is learned end-to-end so that the loss considers importance\nof each attribute when relating person categories. Our loss guided by the\nadaptive semantic margin leads to more discriminative and semantically\nwell-arranged distributions of person images. As a consequence, it enables a\nsimple embedding model to achieve state-of-the-art records on public benchmarks\nwithout bells and whistles.",

          "description": "Researchers often spend weeks sifting through decades of unlabeled satellite\nimagery(on NASA Worldview) in order to develop datasets on which they can start\nconducting research. We developed an interactive, scalable and fast image\nsimilarity search engine (which can take one or more images as the query image)\nthat automatically sifts through the unlabeled dataset reducing dataset\ngeneration time from weeks to minutes. In this work, we describe key components\nof the end to end pipeline. Our similarity search system was created to be able\nto identify similar images from a potentially petabyte scale database that are\nsimilar to an input image, and for this we had to break down each query image\ninto its features, which were generated by a classification layer stripped CNN\ntrained in a supervised manner. To store and search these features efficiently,\nwe had to make several scalability improvements. To improve the speed, reduce\nthe storage, and shrink memory requirements for embedding search, we add a\nfully connected layer to our CNN make all images into a 128 length vector\nbefore entering the classification layers. This helped us compress the size of\nour image features from 2048 (for ResNet, which was initially tried as our\nfeaturizer) to 128 for our new custom model. Additionally, we utilize existing\napproximate nearest neighbor search libraries to significantly speed up\nembedding search. Our system currently searches over our entire database of\nimages at 5 seconds per query on a single virtual machine in the cloud. In the\nfuture, we would like to incorporate a SimCLR based featurizing model which\ncould be trained without any labelling by a human (since the classification\naspect of the model is irrelevant to this use case).",

          "description": "Deep learning models achieve strong performance for radiology image\nclassification, but their practical application is bottlenecked by the need for\nlarge labeled training datasets. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches\nleverage small labeled datasets alongside larger unlabeled datasets and offer\npotential for reducing labeling cost. In this work, we introduce NoTeacher, a\nnovel consistency-based SSL framework which incorporates probabilistic\ngraphical models. Unlike Mean Teacher which maintains a teacher network updated\nvia a temporal ensemble, NoTeacher employs two independent networks, thereby\neliminating the need for a teacher network. We demonstrate how NoTeacher can be\ncustomized to handle a range of challenges in radiology image classification.\nSpecifically, we describe adaptations for scenarios with 2D and 3D inputs, uni\nand multi-label classification, and class distribution mismatch between labeled\nand unlabeled portions of the training data. In realistic empirical evaluations\non three public benchmark datasets spanning the workhorse modalities of\nradiology (X-Ray, CT, MRI), we show that NoTeacher achieves over 90-95% of the\nfully supervised AUROC with less than 5-15% labeling budget.

A large-scale food logo\ndataset is urgently needed for developing advanced food logo detection\nalgorithms. However, there are no available food logo datasets with food brand\ninformation. To support efforts towards food logo detection, we introduce the\ndataset FoodLogoDet-1500, a new large-scale publicly available food logo\ndataset, which has 1,500 categories, about 100,000 images and about 150,000\nmanually annotated food logo objects. We describe the collection and annotation\nprocess of FoodLogoDet-1500, analyze its scale and diversity, and compare it\nwith other logo datasets. To the best of our knowledge, FoodLogoDet-1500 is the\nfirst largest publicly available high-quality dataset for food logo detection.\nThe challenge of food logo detection lies in the large-scale categories and\nsimilarities between food logo categories. For that, we propose a novel food\nlogo detection method Multi-scale Feature Decoupling Network (MFDNet), which\ndecouples classification and regression into two branches and focuses on the\nclassification branch to solve the problem of distinguishing multiple food logo\ncategories. Specifically, we introduce the feature offset module, which\nutilizes the deformation-learning for optimal classification offset and can\neffectively obtain the most representative features of classification in\ndetection. In addition, we adopt a balanced feature pyramid in MFDNet, which\npays attention to global information, balances the multi-scale feature maps,\nand enhances feature extraction capability. Comprehensive experiments on\nFoodLogoDet-1500 and other two benchmark logo datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. The FoodLogoDet-1500 can be found at this\nhttps URL.",

          "description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming medicine and showing promise in\nimproving clinical diagnosis. In breast cancer screening, several recent\nstudies show that AI has the potential to improve radiologists' accuracy,\nsubsequently helping in early cancer diagnosis and reducing unnecessary workup.\nAs the number of proposed models and their complexity grows, it is becoming\nincreasingly difficult to re-implement them in order to reproduce the results\nand to compare different approaches. To enable reproducibility of research in\nthis application area and to enable comparison between different methods, we\nrelease a meta-repository containing deep learning models for classification of\nscreening mammograms. This meta-repository creates a framework that enables the\nevaluation of machine learning models on any private or public screening\nmammography data set. At its inception, our meta-repository contains five\nstate-of-the-art models with open-source implementations and cross-platform\ncompatibility. We compare their performance on five international data sets:\ntwo private New York University breast cancer screening data sets as well as\nthree public (DDSM, INbreast and Chinese Mammography Database) data sets. Our\nframework has a flexible design that can be generalized to other medical image\nanalysis tasks. The meta-repository is available at\nhttps://www.github.com/nyukat/mammography_metarepository.",

          "description": "Development of deep learning systems for biomedical segmentation often\nrequires access to expert-driven, manually annotated datasets. If more than a\nsingle expert is involved in the annotation of the same images, then the\ninter-expert agreement is not necessarily perfect, and no single expert\nannotation can precisely capture the so-called ground truth of the regions of\ninterest on all images. Also, it is not trivial to generate a reference\nestimate using annotations from multiple experts. Here we present a deep neural\nnetwork, defined as U-Net-and-a-half, which can simultaneously learn from\nannotations performed by multiple experts on the same set of images.\nU-Net-and-a-half contains a convolutional encoder to generate features from the\ninput images, multiple decoders that allow simultaneous learning from image\nmasks obtained from annotations that were independently generated by multiple\nexperts, and a shared low-dimensional feature space. To demonstrate the\napplicability of our framework, we used two distinct datasets from digital\npathology and radiology, respectively. Specifically, we trained two separate\nmodels using pathologist-driven annotations of glomeruli on whole slide images\nof human kidney biopsies (10 patients), and radiologist-driven annotations of\nlumen cross-sections of human arteriovenous fistulae obtained from\nintravascular ultrasound images (10 patients), respectively. The models based\non U-Net-and-a-half exceeded the performance of the traditional U-Net models\ntrained on single expert annotations alone, thus expanding the scope of\nmultitask learning in the context of biomedical image segmentation.",

The proposed natural\nnumerical network is applied to open important environmental and nature\nconservation task, the automated identification of protected habitats by using\nsatellite images. In the natural numerical network, the forward diffusion\ncauses the movement of points in a feature space toward each other. The\nopposite effect, keeping the points away from each other, is caused by backward\ndiffusion. This yields the desired classification. The natural numerical\nnetwork contains a few parameters that are optimized in the learning phase of\nthe method.

While most studies deploy\ncross-entropy as the loss function in such tasks, a growing number of\napproaches have turned to a family of contrastive learning-based losses. Even\nthough performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are\nregularly used for the evaluation of CNN classifiers, the features that these\nclassifiers actually learn are rarely identified and their effect on the\nclassification performance on out-of-distribution test samples is\ninsufficiently explored. In this paper, motivated by the real-world task of\nlung nodule classification, we investigate the features that a CNN learns when\ntrained and tested on different distributions of a synthetic dataset with\ncontrolled modes of variation. We show that different loss functions lead to\ndifferent features being learned and consequently affect the generalization\nability of the classifier on unseen data.

In this paper, we\npresent R4Dyn, a novel set of techniques to use cost-efficient radar data on\ntop of a self-supervised depth estimation framework. In particular, we show how\nradar can be used during training as weak supervision signal, as well as an\nextra input to enhance the estimation robustness at inference time. Since\nautomotive radars are readily available, this allows to collect training data\nfrom a variety of existing vehicles. Moreover, by filtering and expanding the\nsignal to make it compatible with learning-based approaches, we address radar\ninherent issues, such as noise and sparsity. With R4Dyn we are able to overcome\na major limitation of self-supervised depth estimation, i.e. the prediction of\ntraffic participants. We substantially improve the estimation on dynamic\nobjects, such as cars by 37% on the challenging nuScenes dataset, hence\ndemonstrating that radar is a valuable additional sensor for monocular depth\nestimation in autonomous vehicles.

Moreover, by\nsparsely substituting or inserting a few adversarial gait silhouettes, the\nproposed method ensures its imperceptibility and achieves a high attack success\nrate.

The unsupervised open domain\nadaption for generating realistic photos from a hand-drawn sketch is\nchallenging as there is no such sketch of that class for training data. The\nabsence of learning supervision and the huge domain gap between both the\nfreehand drawing and picture domains make it hard. We present an approach that\nlearns both sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation to synthesise the\nmissing freehand drawings from pictures.

To address this problem, we offer a simple but effective open-domain\nsampling and optimization method that tricks the generator into considering\nfalse drawings as genuine.

          "description": "Automatically generating videos in which synthesized speech is synchronized\nwith lip movements in a talking head has great potential in many human-computer\ninteraction scenarios. In this paper, we present an automatic method to\ngenerate synchronized speech and talking-head videos on the basis of text and a\nsingle face image of an arbitrary person as input. In contrast to previous\ntext-driven talking head generation methods, which can only synthesize the\nvoice of a specific person, the proposed method is capable of synthesizing\nspeech for any person that is inaccessible in the training stage. Specifically,\nthe proposed method decomposes the generation of synchronized speech and\ntalking head videos into two stages, i.e., a text-to-speech (TTS) stage and a\nspeech-driven talking head generation stage. The proposed TTS module is a\nface-conditioned multi-speaker TTS model that gets the speaker identity\ninformation from face images instead of speech, which allows us to synthesize a\npersonalized voice on the basis of the input face image. To generate the\ntalking head videos from the face images, a facial landmark-based method that\ncan predict both lip movements and head rotations is proposed. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate\nsynchronized speech and talking head videos for arbitrary persons and\nnon-persons.

          "description": "The neuroimage analysis community has neglected the automated segmentation of\nthe olfactory bulb (OB) despite its crucial role in olfactory function. The\nlack of an automatic processing method for the OB can be explained by its\nchallenging properties. Nonetheless, recent advances in MRI acquisition\ntechniques and resolution have allowed raters to generate more reliable manual\nannotations. Furthermore, the high accuracy of deep learning methods for\nsolving semantic segmentation problems provides us with an option to reliably\nassess even small structures. In this work, we introduce a novel, fast, and\nfully automated deep learning pipeline to accurately segment OB tissue on\nsub-millimeter T2-weighted (T2w) whole-brain MR images. To this end, we\ndesigned a three-stage pipeline: (1) Localization of a region containing both\nOBs using FastSurferCNN, (2) Segmentation of OB tissue within the localized\nregion through four independent AttFastSurferCNN - a novel deep learning\narchitecture with a self-attention mechanism to improve modeling of contextual\ninformation, and (3) Ensemble of the predicted label maps. The OB pipeline\nexhibits high performance in terms of boundary delineation, OB localization,\nand volume estimation across a wide range of ages in 203 participants of the\nRhineland Study. Moreover, it also generalizes to scans of an independent\ndataset never encountered during training, the Human Connectome Project (HCP),\nwith different acquisition parameters and demographics, evaluated in 30 cases\nat the native 0.7mm HCP resolution, and the default 0.8mm pipeline resolution.\nWe extensively validated our pipeline not only with respect to segmentation\naccuracy but also to known OB volume effects, where it can sensitively\nreplicate age effects.",

In the majority of existing\nwork, geometric model estimation problems such as homography estimation and\npiece-wise planar reconstruction (PPR) are usually solved by standard (greedy)\nRANSAC separately and sequentially. However, setting the inlier-outlier\nthreshold is difficult in absence of information about the scene (i.e. the\nscale). In this work, we revisit these problems and argue that two mentioned\ngeometric models (homographies/3D planes) can be solved by minimizing an energy\nfunction that exploits the spatial coherence, i.e. with graph-cut optimization,\nwhich also tackles the practical issue when the output of a trained CNN is\ninaccurate.

          "description": "Separating and labeling each instance of a nucleus (instance-aware\nsegmentation) is the key challenge in segmenting single cell nuclei on\nfluorescence microscopy images. Deep Neural Networks can learn the implicit\ntransformation of a nuclear image into a probability map indicating the class\nmembership of each pixel (nucleus or background), but the use of\npost-processing steps to turn the probability map into a labeled object mask is\nerror-prone. This especially accounts for nuclear images of tissue sections and\nnuclear images across varying tissue preparations. In this work, we aim to\nevaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to\nsegment nuclei in fluorescence images of various tissue origins and sample\npreparation types without post-processing. We compare architectures that\noperate on pixel to pixel translation and an architecture that operates on\nobject detection and subsequent locally applied segmentation. In addition, we\npropose a novel strategy to create artificial images to extend the training\nset. We evaluate the influence of ground truth annotation quality, image scale\nand segmentation complexity on segmentation performance. Results show that\nthree out of four deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net with ResNet34\nbackbone, Mask R-CNN) can segment fluorescent nuclear images on most of the\nsample preparation types and tissue origins with satisfactory segmentation\nperformance. Mask R-CNN, an architecture designed to address instance aware\nsegmentation tasks, outperforms other architectures. Equal nuclear mean size,\nconsistent nuclear annotations and the use of artificially generated images\nresult in overall acceptable precision and recall across different tissues and\nsample preparation types.",

First, we learn\nto synthesize an initial estimate for a 3D scene, constructed by retrieving a\ntop-k set of volumetric chunks from the scene database.

However, as far as we know, all of the existing non-additive\nproposals are based on handcrafted policies, and can only be applied to a\nspecific image domain, which heavily prevent non-additive steganography from\nreleasing its full potentiality. In this paper, we propose an automatic\nnon-additive steganographic distortion learning framework called MCTSteg to\nremove the above restrictions. Guided by the reinforcement learning paradigm,\nwe combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and steganalyzer-based environmental\nmodel to build MCTSteg. MCTS makes sequential decisions to adjust distortion\ndistribution without human intervention. Our proposed environmental model is\nused to obtain feedbacks from each decision. Due to its self-learning\ncharacteristic and domain-independent reward function, MCTSteg has become the\nfirst reported universal non-additive steganographic framework which can work\nin both spatial and JPEG domains. Extensive experimental results show that\nMCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted\nfeature-based and deep-learning-based steganalyzers. In both spatial and JPEG\ndomains, the security performance of MCTSteg steadily outperforms the state of\nthe art by a clear margin under different scenarios.",

The negative examples in previous methods are\nrandomly sampled from the patches of different positions in the source image,\nwhich are not effective to push the positive examples close to the query\nexamples. To address this issue, we present instance-wise hard Negative Example\nGeneration for Contrastive learning in Unpaired image-to-image\nTranslation~(NEGCUT). Specifically, we train a generator to produce negative\nexamples online. The generator is novel from two perspectives: 1) it is\ninstance-wise which means that the generated examples are based on the input\nimage, and 2) it can generate hard negative examples since it is trained with\nan adversarial loss. With the generator, the performance of unpaired\nimage-to-image translation is significantly improved.

          "description": "Finding tampered regions in images is a hot research topic in machine\nlearning and computer vision. Although many image manipulation location\nalgorithms have been proposed, most of them only focus on the RGB images with\ndifferent color spaces, and the frequency information that contains the\npotential tampering clues is often ignored. In this work, a novel end-to-end\ntwo-stream boundary-aware network (abbreviated as TBNet) is proposed for\ngeneric image manipulation localization in which the RGB stream, the frequency\nstream, and the boundary artifact location are explored in a unified framework.\nSpecifically, we first design an adaptive frequency selection module (AFS) to\nadaptively select the appropriate frequency to mine inconsistent statistics and\neliminate the interference of redundant statistics. Then, an adaptive\ncross-attention fusion module (ACF) is proposed to adaptively fuse the RGB\nfeature and the frequency feature. Finally, the boundary artifact location\nnetwork (BAL) is designed to locate the boundary artifacts for which the\nparameters are jointly updated by the outputs of the ACF, and its results are\nfurther fed into the decoder. Thus, the parameters of the RGB stream, the\nfrequency stream, and the boundary artifact location network are jointly\noptimized, and their latent complementary relationships are fully mined.

In this work, we propose a general\nmultimodal fusion framework FusionPainting to fuse the 2D RGB image and 3D\npoint clouds at a semantic level for boosting the 3D object detection task.\nEspecially, the FusionPainting framework consists of three main modules: a\nmulti-modal semantic segmentation module, an adaptive attention-based semantic\nfusion module, and a 3D object detector. First, semantic information is\nobtained for 2D images and 3D Lidar point clouds based on 2D and 3D\nsegmentation approaches. Then the segmentation results from different sensors\nare adaptively fused based on the proposed attention-based semantic fusion\nmodule. Finally, the point clouds painted with the fused semantic label are\nsent to the 3D detector for obtaining the 3D objection results. The\neffectiveness of the proposed framework has been verified on the large-scale\nnuScenes detection benchmark by comparing it with three different baselines.\nThe experimental results show that the fusion strategy can significantly\nimprove the detection performance compared to the methods using only point\nclouds, and the methods using point clouds only painted with 2D segmentation\ninformation.

          "description": "Recent vision-language (VL) studies have shown remarkable progress by\nlearning generic representations from massive image-text pairs with transformer\nmodels and then fine-tuning on downstream VL tasks. While existing research has\nbeen focused on achieving high accuracy with large pre-trained models, building\na lightweight model is of great value in practice but is less explored. In this\npaper, we propose a smaller and faster VL model, MiniVLM, which can be\nfinetuned with good performance on various downstream tasks like its larger\ncounterpart. MiniVLM consists of two modules, a vision feature extractor and a\ntransformer-based vision-language fusion module. We design a Two-stage\nEfficient feature Extractor (TEE), inspired by the one-stage EfficientDet\nnetwork, to significantly reduce the time cost of visual feature extraction by\n$95\\%$, compared to a baseline model. We adopt the MiniLM structure to reduce\nthe computation cost of the transformer module after comparing different\ncompact BERT models. In addition, we improve the MiniVLM pre-training by adding\n$7M$ Open Images data, which are pseudo-labeled by a state-of-the-art\ncaptioning model. We also pre-train with high-quality image tags obtained from\na strong tagging model to enhance cross-modality alignment. The large models\nare used offline without adding any overhead in fine-tuning and inference. With\nthe above design choices, our MiniVLM reduces the model size by $73\\%$ and the\ninference time cost by $94\\%$ while being able to retain $94-97\\%$ of the\naccuracy on multiple VL tasks. We hope that MiniVLM helps ease the use of the\nstate-of-the-art VL research for on-the-edge applications.",

C5 is a hypernetwork-like extension of the\nconvolutional color constancy (CCC) approach: C5 learns to generate the weights\nof a CCC model that is then evaluated on the input image, with the CCC weights\ndynamically adapted to different input content. Unlike prior cross-camera color\nconstancy models, which are usually designed to be agnostic to the spectral\nproperties of test-set images from unobserved cameras, C5 approaches this\nproblem through the lens of transductive inference: additional unlabeled images\nare provided as input to the model at test time, which allows the model to\ncalibrate itself to the spectral properties of the test-set camera during\ninference. C5 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for cross-camera color\nconstancy on several datasets, is fast to evaluate (~7 and ~90 ms per image on\na GPU or CPU, respectively), and requires little memory (~2 MB), and, thus, is\na practical solution to the problem of calibration-free automatic white balance\nfor mobile photography.",

          "description": "Key for solving fine-grained image categorization is finding discriminate and\nlocal regions that correspond to subtle visual traits. Great strides have been\nmade, with complex networks designed specifically to learn part-level\ndiscriminate feature representations. In this paper, we show it is possible to\ncultivate subtle details without the need for overly complicated network\ndesigns or training mechanisms -- a single loss is all it takes. The main trick\nlies with how we delve into individual feature channels early on, as opposed to\nthe convention of starting from a consolidated feature map. The proposed loss\nfunction, termed as mutual-channel loss (MC-Loss), consists of two\nchannel-specific components: a discriminality component and a diversity\ncomponent. The discriminality component forces all feature channels belonging\nto the same class to be discriminative, through a novel channel-wise attention\nmechanism. The diversity component additionally constraints channels so that\nthey become mutually exclusive on spatial-wise. The end result is therefore a\nset of feature channels that each reflects different locally discriminative\nregions for a specific class. The MC-Loss can be trained end-to-end, without\nthe need for any bounding-box/part annotations, and yields highly\ndiscriminative regions during inference. Experimental results show our MC-Loss\nwhen implemented on top of common base networks can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on all four fine-grained categorization datasets (CUB-Birds,\nFGVC-Aircraft, Flowers-102, and Stanford-Cars). Ablative studies further\ndemonstrate the superiority of MC-Loss when compared with other recently\nproposed general-purpose losses for visual classification, on two different\nbase networks.

          "description": "Compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have witnessed exceptional\nimprovements in performance in recent years. However, they still fail to\nprovide the same predictive power as CNNs with a large number of parameters.\nThe diverse and even abundant features captured by the layers is an important\ncharacteristic of these successful CNNs. However, differences in this\ncharacteristic between large CNNs and their compact counterparts have rarely\nbeen investigated. In compact CNNs, due to the limited number of parameters,\nabundant features are unlikely to be obtained, and feature diversity becomes an\nessential characteristic. Diverse features present in the activation maps\nderived from a data point during model inference may indicate the presence of a\nset of unique descriptors necessary to distinguish between objects of different\nclasses. In contrast, data points with low feature diversity may not provide a\nsufficient amount of unique descriptors to make a valid prediction; we refer to\nthem as random predictions. Random predictions can negatively impact the\noptimization process and harm the final performance. This paper proposes\naddressing the problem raised by random predictions by reshaping the standard\ncross-entropy to make it biased toward data points with a limited number of\nunique descriptive features. Our novel Bias Loss focuses the training on a set\nof valuable data points and prevents the vast number of samples with poor\nlearning features from misleading the optimization process. Furthermore, to\nshow the importance of diversity, we present a family of SkipNet models whose\narchitectures are brought to boost the number of unique descriptors in the last\nlayers. Our Skipnet-M can achieve 1% higher classification accuracy than\nMobileNetV3 Large.",

The proposed\nquality assessment framework is grounded on the prior models of natural image\nstatistical behaviors and rooted in the view that the perceptually meaningful\nfeatures could be well exploited to characterize the visual quality. Herein,\nthe PR features from the distorted images are learned by a mutual learning\nscheme with the pristine reference as the supervision, and the discriminative\ncharacteristics of PR features are further ensured with the triplet\nconstraints. Given a distorted image for quality inference, the feature level\ndisentanglement is performed with an invertible neural layer for final quality\nprediction, leading to the PR and the corresponding distortion features for\ncomparison. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated on four\npopular IQA databases, and superior performance on cross-database evaluation\nalso reveals the high generalization capability of our method. The\nimplementation of our method is publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/Baoliang93/FPR.",

Advances on CNN architectures\nhave focused mainly on designing convolutional blocks of the feature\nextractors, but less on the classifiers that exploit extracted features. In\nthis work, we propose Split-and-Share Module (SSM),a classifier that splits a\ngiven feature into parts, which are partially shared by multiple\nsub-classifiers. Our intuition is that the more the features are shared, the\nmore common they will become, and SSM can encourage such structural\ncharacteristics in the split features. SSM can be easily integrated into any\narchitecture without bells and whistles. We have extensively validated the\nefficacy of SSM on ImageNet-1K classification task, andSSM has shown consistent\nand significant improvements over baseline architectures.

          "description": "Visual perception of a person is easily influenced by many factors such as\ncamera parameters, pose and viewpoint variations. These variations make person\nRe-Identification (ReID) a challenging problem. Nevertheless, human attributes\nusually stand as robust visual properties to such variations. In this paper, we\npropose a new method to leverage features from human attributes for person\nReID. Our model uses a tensor to non-linearly fuse identity and attribute\nfeatures, and then forces the parameters of the tensor in the loss function to\ngenerate discriminative fused features for ReID. Since tensor-based methods\nusually contain a large number of parameters, training all of these parameters\nbecomes very slow, and the chance of overfitting increases as well. To address\nthis issue, we propose two new techniques based on Structural Sparsity Learning\n(SSL) and Tensor Decomposition (TD) methods to create an accurate and stable\nlearning problem. We conducted experiments on several standard pedestrian\ndatasets, and experimental results indicate that our tensor-based approach\nsignificantly improves person ReID baselines and also outperforms state of the\nart methods.",

Facial image datasets\nare usually annotated by some commonly used attributes (e.g., gender), while\nlabels for the other attributes (e.g., big nose) are limited which causes their\nprediction challenging. To address this problem, we use a new Multi-Task\nLearning (MTL) paradigm in which a facial attribute predictor uses the\nknowledge of other related attributes to obtain a better generalization\nperformance. Here, we leverage MLT paradigm in two problem settings. First, it\nis assumed that the structure of the tasks (e.g., grouping pattern of facial\nattributes) is known as a prior knowledge, and parameters of the tasks (i.e.,\npredictors) within the same group are represented by a linear combination of a\nlimited number of underlying basis tasks. Here, a sparsity constraint on the\ncoefficients of this linear combination is also considered such that each task\nis represented in a more structured and simpler manner. Second, it is assumed\nthat the structure of the tasks is unknown, and then structure and parameters\nof the tasks are learned jointly by using a Laplacian regularization framework.\nOur MTL methods are compared with competing methods for facial attribute\nprediction to show its effectiveness.",

          "description": "Anatomical structures such as the hippocampus, liver, and bones can be\nanalyzed as orientable, closed surfaces. This permits the computation of\nvolume, surface area, mean curvature, Gaussian curvature, and the\nEuler-Poincar\\'e characteristic as well as comparison of these morphometrics\nbetween structures of different topology. The structures are commonly\nrepresented implicitly in curve evolution problems as the zero level set of an\nembedding. Practically, binary images of anatomical structures are embedded\nusing a signed distance transform. However, quantization prevents the accurate\ncomputation of curvatures, leading to considerable errors in morphometry. This\npaper presents a fast, simple embedding procedure for accurate local\nmorphometry as the zero crossing of the Gaussian blurred binary image. The\nproposed method was validated based on the femur and fourth lumbar vertebrae of\n50 clinical computed tomography datasets. The results show that the signed\ndistance transform leads to large quantization errors in the computed local\ncurvature. Global validation of morphometry using regression and Bland-Altman\nanalysis revealed that the coefficient of determination for the average mean\ncurvature is improved from 93.8% with the signed distance transform to 100%\nwith the proposed method. For the surface area, the proportional bias is\nimproved from -5.0% for the signed distance transform to +0.6% for the proposed\nmethod. The Euler-Poincar\\'e characteristic is improved from unusable in the\nsigned distance transform to 98% accuracy for the proposed method. The proposed\nmethod enables an improved local and global evaluation of curvature for\npurposes of morphometry on closed, implicit surfaces.",

Single task vision networks extract information only based\non some aspects of the scene. In multi-task learning (MTL), on the other hand,\nthese single tasks are jointly learned, thereby providing an opportunity for\ntasks to share information and obtain a more comprehensive understanding. To\nthis end, we develop UniNet, a unified scene understanding network that\naccurately and efficiently infers vital vision tasks including object\ndetection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, monocular depth\nestimation, and monocular instance depth prediction. As these tasks look at\ndifferent semantic and geometric information, they can either complement or\nconflict with each other. Therefore, understanding inter-task relationships can\nprovide useful cues to enable complementary information sharing. We evaluate\nthe task relationships in UniNet through the lens of adversarial attacks based\non the notion that they can exploit learned biases and task interactions in the\nneural network. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset, using\nuntargeted and targeted attacks reveal that semantic tasks strongly interact\namongst themselves, and the same holds for geometric tasks.

          "description": "Multimodal IR, spanning text corpus, knowledge graph and images, called\noutside knowledge visual question answering (OKVQA), is of much recent\ninterest. However, the popular data set has serious limitations. A surprisingly\nlarge fraction of queries do not assess the ability to integrate cross-modal\ninformation. Instead, some are independent of the image, some depend on\nspeculation, some require OCR or are otherwise answerable from the image alone.\nTo add to the above limitations, frequency-based guessing is very effective\nbecause of (unintended) widespread answer overlaps between the train and test\nfolds. Overall, it is hard to determine when state-of-the-art systems exploit\nthese weaknesses rather than really infer the answers, because they are opaque\nand their 'reasoning' process is uninterpretable. An equally important\nlimitation is that the dataset is designed for the quantitative assessment only\nof the end-to-end answer retrieval task, with no provision for assessing the\ncorrect(semantic) interpretation of the input query. In response, we identify a\nkey structural idiom in OKVQA ,viz., S3 (select, substitute and search), and\nbuild a new data set and challenge around it. Specifically, the questioner\nidentifies an entity in the image and asks a question involving that entity\nwhich can be answered only by consulting a knowledge graph or corpus passage\nmentioning the entity. Our challenge consists of (i)OKVQAS3, a subset of OKVQA\nannotated based on the structural idiom and (ii)S3VQA, a new dataset built from\nscratch. We also present a neural but structurally transparent OKVQA system,\nS3, that explicitly addresses our challenge dataset, and outperforms recent\ncompetitive baselines.",

Specifically, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is introduced to\nconstrain the posterior class probability consistency between full-net and\nsub-nets, and self-attention distillation on the same resolution feature of\ndifferent depth is addressed to drive more abundant feature representations of\nsub-nets. Thus, we can obtain multiple high-accuracy sub-nets simultaneously in\na DDNN via the online knowledge distillation in each training iteration without\nextra computation cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet\ndatasets demonstrate that sub-nets in DDNN with EKD training achieve better\nperformance than individually training networks while preserving the original\nperformance of full-nets.",

However, unique challenges are proposed by\nUI-specific characteristics, such as how to effectively leverage multimodal UI\nfeatures that involve image, text, and structural metadata and how to achieve\ngood performance when high-quality labeled data is unavailable. To address such\nchallenges we introduce UIBert, a transformer-based joint image-text model\ntrained through novel pre-training tasks on large-scale unlabeled UI data to\nlearn generic feature representations for a UI and its components. Our key\nintuition is that the heterogeneous features in a UI are self-aligned, i.e.,\nthe image and text features of UI components, are predictive of each other. We\npropose five pretraining tasks utilizing this self-alignment among different\nfeatures of a UI component and across various components in the same UI. We\nevaluate our method on nine real-world downstream UI tasks where UIBert\noutperforms strong multimodal baselines by up to 9.26% accuracy.",

Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) techniques have\nshown promising results in classifying ultrasound images of the breast into\nbenign or malignant. However, CNN inference acts as a black-box model, and as\nsuch, its decision-making is not interpretable. Therefore, increasing effort\nhas been dedicated to explaining this process, most notably through GRAD-CAM\nand other techniques that provide visual explanations into inner workings of\nCNNs. In addition to interpretation, these methods provide clinically important\ninformation, such as identifying the location for biopsy or treatment. In this\nwork, we analyze how adversarial assaults that are practically undetectable may\nbe devised to alter these importance maps dramatically. Furthermore, we will\nshow that this change in the importance maps can come with or without altering\nthe classification result, rendering them even harder to detect. As such, care\nmust be taken when using these importance maps to shed light on the inner\nworkings of deep learning.

We then show that for complex\nreal-world scenes from the LLFF dataset, iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating\nthe camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional training\ndata for NeRF.

So\nfar, this concept was mostly used to generate images for a single scenario. As\neach scenario requires a new model, this type of generation seems contradictory\nto the adaptability of cells in nature. To address this contradiction, we\nintroduce a concept using different initial environments as input while using a\nsingle Neural Cellular Automata to produce several outputs. Additionally, we\nintroduce GANCA, a novel algorithm that combines Neural Cellular Automata with\nGenerative Adversarial Networks, allowing for more generalization through\nadversarial training. The experiments show that a single model is capable of\nlearning several images when presented with different inputs, and that the\nadversarially trained model improves drastically on out-of-distribution data\ncompared to a supervised trained model.",

          "description": "Predicting the movement trajectories of multiple classes of road users in\nreal-world scenarios is a challenging task due to the diverse trajectory\npatterns. While recent works of pedestrian trajectory prediction successfully\nmodelled the influence of surrounding neighbours based on the relative\ndistances, they are ineffective on multi-class trajectory prediction. This is\nbecause they ignore the impact of the implicit correlations between different\ntypes of road users on the trajectory to be predicted - for example, a nearby\npedestrian has a different level of influence from a nearby car. In this paper,\nwe propose to introduce class information into a graph convolutional neural\nnetwork to better predict the trajectory of an individual. We embed the class\nlabels of the surrounding objects into the label adjacency matrix (LAM), which\nis combined with the velocity-based adjacency matrix (VAM) comprised of the\nobjects' velocity, thereby generating a semantics-guided graph adjacency (SAM).\nSAM effectively models semantic information with trainable parameters to\nautomatically learn the embedded label features that will contribute to the\nfixed velocity-based trajectory. Such information of spatial and temporal\ndependencies is passed to a graph convolutional and temporal convolutional\nnetwork to estimate the predicted trajectory distributions. We further propose\nnew metrics, known as Average2 Displacement Error (aADE) and Average Final\nDisplacement Error (aFDE), that assess network accuracy more accurately. We\ncall our framework Semantics-STGCNN. It consistently shows superior performance\nto the state-of-the-arts in existing and the newly proposed metrics.",

          "description": "Person reidentification (ReID) is a very hot research topic in machine\nlearning and computer vision, and many person ReID approaches have been\nproposed; however, most of these methods assume that the same person has the\nsame clothes within a short time interval, and thus their visual appearance\nmust be similar. However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person\nhas a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they\nalso often take different personal belongings with them. When the existing\nperson ReID methods are applied in this type of case, almost all of them fail.\nTo date, only a few works have focused on the cloth-changing person ReID task,\nbut since it is very difficult to extract generalized and robust features for\nrepresenting people with different clothes, their performances need to be\nimproved. Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve\nthese issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding\nalgorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual\nsemantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and\nthe generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively\nsolve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a\nperson with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme\n(MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth\ndesensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of\nthe approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level\nhuman attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of\npose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially\nsemantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic\ninformation that is used to align the human attributes.",

Directly applying vanilla object detector to defect detection task can\nachieve promising results, while there still exists challenging issues that\nhave not been solved. The first issue is the texture shift which means a\ntrained defect detector model will be easily affected by unseen texture, and\nthe second issue is partial visual confusion which indicates that a partial\ndefect box is visually similar with a complete box. To tackle these two\nproblems, we propose a Reference-based Defect Detection Network (RDDN).\nSpecifically, we introduce template reference and context reference to against\nthose two problems, respectively. Template reference can reduce the texture\nshift from image, feature or region levels, and encourage the detectors to\nfocus more on the defective area as a result. We can use either well-aligned\ntemplate images or the outputs of a pseudo template generator as template\nreferences in this work, and they are jointly trained with detectors by the\nsupervision of normal samples. To solve the partial visual confusion issue, we\npropose to leverage the carried context information of context reference, which\nis the concentric bigger box of each region proposal, to perform more accurate\nregion classification and regression.

          "description": "The performance of many medical image analysis tasks are strongly associated\nwith image data quality. When developing modern deep learning algorithms,\nrather than relying on subjective (human-based) image quality assessment (IQA),\ntask amenability potentially provides an objective measure of task-specific\nimage quality. To predict task amenability, an IQA agent is trained using\nreinforcement learning (RL) with a simultaneously optimised task predictor,\nsuch as a classification or segmentation neural network. In this work, we\ndevelop transfer learning or adaptation strategies to increase the adaptability\nof both the IQA agent and the task predictor so that they are less dependent on\nhigh-quality, expert-labelled training data. The proposed transfer learning\nstrategy re-formulates the original RL problem for task amenability in a\nmeta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework. The resulting algorithm\nfacilitates efficient adaptation of the agent to different definitions of image\nquality, each with its own Markov decision process environment including\ndifferent images, labels and an adaptable task predictor. Our work demonstrates\nthat the IQA agents pre-trained on non-expert task labels can be adapted to\npredict task amenability as defined by expert task labels, using only a small\nset of expert labels. Using 6644 clinical ultrasound images from 249 prostate\ncancer patients, our results for image classification and segmentation tasks\nshow that the proposed IQA method can be adapted using data with as few as\nrespective 19.7% and 29.6% expert-reviewed consensus labels and still achieve\ncomparable IQA and task performance, which would otherwise require a training\ndataset with 100% expert labels.",

Existing universal style transfer methods successfully\ndeliver arbitrary styles to original images either in an artistic or a\nphoto-realistic way. However, the range of 'arbitrary style' defined by\nexisting works is bounded in the particular domain due to their structural\nlimitation. Specifically, the degrees of content preservation and stylization\nare established according to a predefined target domain. As a result, both\nphoto-realistic and artistic models have difficulty in performing the desired\nstyle transfer for the other domain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nunified architecture, Domain-aware Style Transfer Networks (DSTN) that transfer\nnot only the style but also the property of domain (i.e., domainness) from a\ngiven reference image. To this end, we design a novel domainness indicator that\ncaptures the domainness value from the texture and structural features of\nreference images. Moreover, we introduce a unified framework with domain-aware\nskip connection to adaptively transfer the stroke and palette to the input\ncontents guided by the domainness indicator.

Thus, there is\nstill a possibility to build a non-convolutional inductive bias into the\narchitecture itself, and we built in an inductive bias using two simple ideas.\nA way is to divide the token-mixing block vertically and horizontally. Another\nway is to make spatial correlations denser among some channels of token-mixing.\nWith this approach, we were able to improve the accuracy of the MLP-Mixer while\nreducing its parameters and computational complexity. Compared to other\nMLP-based models, the proposed model, named RaftMLP has a good balance of\ncomputational complexity, the number of parameters, and actual memory usage. In\naddition, our work indicates that MLP-based models have the potential to\nreplace CNNs by adopting inductive bias.

          "description": "Human observers engage in selective information uptake when classifying\nvisual patterns. The same is true of deep neural networks, which currently\nconstitute the best performing artificial vision systems. Our goal is to\nexamine the congruence, or lack thereof, in the information-gathering\nstrategies of the two systems. We have operationalized our investigation as a\ncharacter recognition task. We have used eye-tracking to assay the spatial\ndistribution of information hotspots for humans via fixation maps and an\nactivation mapping technique for obtaining analogous distributions for deep\nnetworks through visualization maps. Qualitative comparison between\nvisualization maps and fixation maps reveals an interesting correlate of\ncongruence. The deep learning model considered similar regions in character,\nwhich humans have fixated in the case of correctly classified characters. On\nthe other hand, when the focused regions are different for humans and deep\nnets, the characters are typically misclassified by the latter. Hence, we\npropose to use the visual fixation maps obtained from the eye-tracking\nexperiment as a supervisory input to align the model's focus on relevant\ncharacter regions. We find that such supervision improves the model's\nperformance significantly and does not require any additional parameters.

We also exploit the frequency modality as complementary\ninformation for improved detection results and capture the local contextual\nincoherence to enhance boundary consistency. Then a top-down refinement network\nis proposed to hierarchically restore features at different levels and generate\ncontents that are semantically consistent with the unmasked face regions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art blind and non-blind face inpainting methods qualitatively and\nquantitatively.",

          "description": "Differentiable Neural Architecture Search is one of the most popular Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS) methods for its search efficiency and simplicity,\naccomplished by jointly optimizing the model weight and architecture parameters\nin a weight-sharing supernet via gradient-based algorithms. At the end of the\nsearch phase, the operations with the largest architecture parameters will be\nselected to form the final architecture, with the implicit assumption that the\nvalues of architecture parameters reflect the operation strength. While much\nhas been discussed about the supernet's optimization, the architecture\nselection process has received little attention. We provide empirical and\ntheoretical analysis to show that the magnitude of architecture parameters does\nnot necessarily indicate how much the operation contributes to the supernet's\nperformance. We propose an alternative perturbation-based architecture\nselection that directly measures each operation's influence on the supernet. We\nre-evaluate several differentiable NAS methods with the proposed architecture\nselection and find that it is able to extract significantly improved\narchitectures from the underlying supernets consistently. Furthermore, we find\nthat several failure modes of DARTS can be greatly alleviated with the proposed\nselection method, indicating that much of the poor generalization observed in\nDARTS can be attributed to the failure of magnitude-based architecture\nselection rather than entirely the optimization of its supernet.",

DR, an eye\nillness caused by diabetes, can lead to blindness if it is not identified and\ntreated in its early stages. Unfortunately, diagnosis of DR requires medically\ntrained professionals, but Bangladesh has limited specialists in comparison to\nits population. Moreover, the screening process is often expensive, prohibiting\nmany from receiving timely and proper diagnosis. To address the problem, we\nintroduce a deep learning algorithm which screens for different stages of DR.\nWe use a state-of-the-art CNN architecture to diagnose patients based on\nretinal fundus imagery. This paper is an experimental evaluation of the\nalgorithm we developed for DR diagnosis and screening specifically for\nBangladeshi patients. We perform this validation study using separate pools of\nretinal image data of real patients from a hospital and field studies in\nBangladesh. Our results show that the algorithm is effective at screening\nBangladeshi eyes even when trained on a public dataset which is out of domain,\nand can accurately determine the stage of DR as well, achieving an overall\naccuracy of 92.27\\% and 93.02\\% on two validation sets of Bangladeshi eyes. The\nresults confirm the ability of the algorithm to be used in real clinical\nsettings and applications due to its high accuracy and classwise metrics.

          "description": "Accumulated clinical studies show that microbes living in humans interact\nclosely with human hosts, and get involved in modulating drug efficacy and drug\ntoxicity. Microbes have become novel targets for the development of\nantibacterial agents. Therefore, screening of microbe-drug associations can\nbenefit greatly drug research and development. With the increase of microbial\ngenomic and pharmacological datasets, we are greatly motivated to develop an\neffective computational method to identify new microbe-drug associations. In\nthis paper, we proposed a novel method, Graph2MDA, to predict microbe-drug\nassociations by using variational graph autoencoder (VGAE). We constructed\nmulti-modal attributed graphs based on multiple features of microbes and drugs,\nsuch as molecular structures, microbe genetic sequences, and function\nannotations. Taking as input the multi-modal attribute graphs, VGAE was trained\nto learn the informative and interpretable latent representations of each node\nand the whole graph, and then a deep neural network classifier was used to\npredict microbe-drug associations. The hyperparameter analysis and model\nablation studies showed the sensitivity and robustness of our model. We\nevaluated our method on three independent datasets and the experimental results\nshowed that our proposed method outperformed six existing state-of-the-art\nmethods. We also explored the meaningness of the learned latent representations\nof drugs and found that the drugs show obvious clustering patterns that are\nsignificantly consistent with drug ATC classification. Moreover, we conducted\ncase studies on two microbes and two drugs and found 75\\%-95\\% predicted\nassociations have been reported in PubMed literature. Our extensive performance\nevaluations validated the effectiveness of our proposed method.\\",

          "description": "Various iterative reconstruction algorithms for inverse problems can be\nunfolded as neural networks. Empirically, this approach has often led to\nimproved results, but theoretical guarantees are still scarce. While some\nprogress on generalization properties of neural networks have been made, great\nchallenges remain. In this chapter, we discuss and combine these topics to\npresent a generalization error analysis for a class of neural networks suitable\nfor sparse reconstruction from few linear measurements. The hypothesis class\nconsidered is inspired by the classical iterative soft-thresholding algorithm\n(ISTA). The neural networks in this class are obtained by unfolding iterations\nof ISTA and learning some of the weights. Based on training samples, we aim at\nlearning the optimal network parameters via empirical risk minimization and\nthereby the optimal network that reconstructs signals from their compressive\nlinear measurements. In particular, we may learn a sparsity basis that is\nshared by all of the iterations/layers and thereby obtain a new approach for\ndictionary learning. For this class of networks, we present a generalization\nbound, which is based on bounding the Rademacher complexity of hypothesis\nclasses consisting of such deep networks via Dudley's integral. Remarkably,\nunder realistic conditions, the generalization error scales only\nlogarithmically in the number of layers, and at most linear in number of\nmeasurements.",

          "description": "Radiomics is an active area of research in medical image analysis, the low\nreproducibility of radiomics has limited its applicability to clinical\npractice. This issue is especially prominent when radiomic features are\ncalculated from noisy images, such as low dose computed tomography (CT) scans.\nIn this article, we investigate the possibility of improving the\nreproducibility of radiomic features calculated on noisy CTs by using\ngenerative models for denoising.One traditional denoising method - non-local\nmeans - and two generative models - encoder-decoder networks (EDN) and\nconditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) - were selected as the test\nmodels. We added noise to the sinograms of full dose CTs to mimic low dose CTs\nwith two different levels of noise: low-noise CT and high-noise CT. Models were\ntrained on high-noise CTs and used to denoise low-noise CTs without\nre-training. We also test the performance of our model in real data, using\ndataset of same-day repeat low dose CTs to assess the reproducibility of\nradiomic features in denoised images. The EDN and the CGAN improved the\nconcordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of radiomic features for low-noise\nimages from 0.87 to 0.92 and for high-noise images from 0.68 to 0.92\nrespectively. Moreover, the EDN and the CGAN improved the test-retest\nreliability of radiomic features (mean CCC increased from 0.89 to 0.94) based\non real low dose CTs. The results show that denoising using EDN and CGANs can\nimprove the reproducibility of radiomic features calculated on noisy CTs.\nMoreover, images with different noise levels can be denoised to improve the\nreproducibility using these models without re-training, as long as the noise\nintensity is equal or lower than that in high-noise CTs. To the authors'\nknowledge, this is the first effort to improve the reproducibility of radiomic\nfeatures calculated on low dose CT scans.",

We address these two challenges by combining\nstructured inference and targeted learning. In terms of structure, we factorize\nthe joint distribution into risk, confounding, instrumental, and miscellaneous\nfactors, and in terms of targeted learning, we apply a regularizer derived from\nthe influence curve in order to reduce residual bias.

          "description": "The goals of this research were to search for Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) architectures, suitable for an on-device processor with limited computing\nresources, performing at substantially lower Network Architecture Search (NAS)\ncosts. A new algorithm entitled an Early Exit Population Initialisation (EE-PI)\nfor Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) was developed to achieve both goals. The EE-PI\nreduces the total number of parameters in the search process by filtering the\nmodels with fewer parameters than the maximum threshold. It will look for a new\nmodel to replace those models with parameters more than the threshold. Thereby,\nreducing the number of parameters, memory usage for model storage and\nprocessing time while maintaining the same performance or accuracy. The search\ntime was reduced to 0.52 GPU day. This is a huge and significant achievement\ncompared to the NAS of 4 GPU days achieved using NSGA-Net, 3,150 GPU days by\nthe AmoebaNet model, and the 2,000 GPU days by the NASNet model. As well, Early\nExit Evolutionary Algorithm networks (EEEA-Nets) yield network architectures\nwith minimal error and computational cost suitable for a given dataset as a\nclass of network algorithms. Using EEEA-Net on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImageNet datasets, our experiments showed that EEEA-Net achieved the lowest\nerror rate among state-of-the-art NAS models, with 2.46% for CIFAR-10, 15.02%\nfor CIFAR-100, and 23.8% for ImageNet dataset. Further, we implemented this\nimage recognition architecture for other tasks, such as object detection,\nsemantic segmentation, and keypoint detection tasks, and, in our experiments,\nEEEA-Net-C2 outperformed MobileNet-V3 on all of these various tasks.

Inspired by the recent success\nof unsupervised contrastive learning, we aim to learn graph-level\nrepresentation in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we propose a novel\nunsupervised graph learning paradigm called Iterative Graph Self-Distillation\n(IGSD) which iteratively performs the teacher-student distillation with graph\naugmentations. Different from conventional knowledge distillation, IGSD\nconstructs the teacher with an exponential moving average of the student model\nand distills the knowledge of itself. The intuition behind IGSD is to predict\nthe teacher network representation of the graph pairs under different augmented\nviews. As a natural extension, we also apply IGSD to semi-supervised scenarios\nby jointly regularizing the network with both supervised and unsupervised\ncontrastive loss. Finally, we show that finetuning the IGSD-trained models with\nself-training can further improve the graph representation power.

Here, we develop clustering\nmethodology through a model-based approach using the marginal density for the\nobserved values, assuming a finite mixture model of multivariate $t$\ndistributions. We compare our approximate algorithm to the corresponding full\nexpectation-maximization (EM) approach that considers the missing values in the\nincomplete data set and makes a missing at random (MAR) assumption, as well as\ncase deletion and imputation methods. Since only the observed values are\nutilized, our approach is computationally more efficient than imputation or\nfull EM. Simulation studies demonstrate that our approach has favorable\nrecovery of the true cluster partition compared to case deletion and imputation\nunder various missingness mechanisms, and is at least competitive with the full\nEM approach, even when MAR assumptions are violated. Our methodology is\ndemonstrated on a problem of clustering gamma-ray bursts and is implemented at\nhttps://github.com/emilygoren/MixtClust.",

          "description": "Motivated by the success of masked language modeling~(MLM) in pre-training\nnatural language processing models, we propose w2v-BERT that explores MLM for\nself-supervised speech representation learning. w2v-BERT is a framework that\ncombines contrastive learning and MLM, where the former trains the model to\ndiscretize input continuous speech signals into a finite set of discriminative\nspeech tokens, and the latter trains the model to learn contextualized speech\nrepresentations via solving a masked prediction task consuming the discretized\ntokens. In contrast to existing MLM-based speech pre-training frameworks such\nas HuBERT, which relies on an iterative re-clustering and re-training process,\nor vq-wav2vec, which concatenates two separately trained modules, w2v-BERT can\nbe optimized in an end-to-end fashion by solving the two self-supervised\ntasks~(the contrastive task and MLM) simultaneously. Our experiments show that\nw2v-BERT achieves competitive results compared to current state-of-the-art\npre-trained models on the LibriSpeech benchmarks when using the Libri-Light~60k\ncorpus as the unsupervised data. In particular, when compared to published\nmodels such as conformer-based wav2vec~2.0 and HuBERT, our model shows~5\\%\nto~10\\% relative WER reduction on the test-clean and test-other subsets.

          "description": "With the rise of Transformers as the standard for language processing, and\ntheir advancements in computer vision, along with their unprecedented size and\namounts of training data, many have come to believe that they are not suitable\nfor small sets of data. This trend leads to great concerns, including but not\nlimited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the\nexclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this\npaper, we dispel the myth that transformers are \"data hungry\" and therefore can\nonly be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the\nright size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with\nstate-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets, often with better accuracy and fewer\nparameters. Our model eliminates the requirement for class token and positional\nembeddings through a novel sequence pooling strategy and the use of\nconvolution/s. It is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as little as\n0.28M parameters while achieving good results. Our model can reach 98.00%\naccuracy when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is a significant\nimprovement over previous Transformer based models. It also outperforms many\nmodern CNN based approaches, such as ResNet, and even some recent NAS-based\napproaches, such as Proxyless-NAS. Our simple and compact design democratizes\ntransformers by making them accessible to those with limited computing\nresources and/or dealing with small datasets. Our method also works on larger\ndatasets, such as ImageNet (82.71% accuracy with 29% parameters of ViT), and\nNLP tasks as well.

The main motivation behind is that the complexity of Maximum\nA-Posteriori (MAP) detection grows exponentially with system dimensions.\nInstead of using DNNs, essentially being a black-box, we take a slightly\ndifferent approach and introduce a probabilistic Continuous relaxation of\ndisCrete variables to MAP detection. Enabling close approximation and\ncontinuous optimization, we derive an iterative detection algorithm: Concrete\nMAP Detection (CMD). Furthermore, extending CMD by the idea of deep unfolding\ninto CMDNet, we allow for (online) optimization of a small number of parameters\nto different working points while limiting complexity. In contrast to recent\nDNN-based approaches, we select the optimization criterion and output of CMDNet\nbased on information theory and are thus able to learn approximate\nprobabilities of the individual optimal detector. This is crucial for soft\ndecoding in today's communication systems.

This unification allows us\nto compare different algorithms with ease, to refine previous convergence\nresults and to uncover new algorithmic variants.

          "description": "Many machine learning systems are vulnerable to small perturbations made to\ninputs either at test time or at training time. This has received much recent\ninterest on the empirical front due to applications where reliability and\nsecurity are critical. However, theoretical understanding of algorithms that\nare robust to adversarial perturbations is limited.\n\nIn this work we focus on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a ubiquitous\nalgorithmic primitive in machine learning. We formulate a natural robust\nvariant of PCA where the goal is to find a low dimensional subspace to\nrepresent the given data with minimum projection error, that is in addition\nrobust to small perturbations measured in $\\ell_q$ norm (say $q=\\infty$).\nUnlike PCA which is solvable in polynomial time, our formulation is\ncomputationally intractable to optimize as it captures a variant of the\nwell-studied sparse PCA objective as a special case. We show the following\nresults:\n\n-Polynomial time algorithm that is constant factor competitive in the\nworst-case with respect to the best subspace, in terms of the projection error\nand the robustness criterion.\n\n-We show that our algorithmic techniques can also be made robust to\nadversarial training-time perturbations, in addition to yielding\nrepresentations that are robust to adversarial perturbations at test time.\nSpecifically, we design algorithms for a strong notion of training-time\nperturbations, where every point is adversarially perturbed up to a specified\namount.\n\n-We illustrate the broad applicability of our algorithmic techniques in\naddressing robustness to adversarial perturbations, both at training time and\ntest time. In particular, our adversarially robust PCA primitive leads to\ncomputationally efficient and robust algorithms for both unsupervised and\nsupervised learning problems such as clustering and learning adversarially\nrobust classifiers.",

An important problem in the theory of\ndeep neural networks is expressivity; that is, we want to understand the\nfunctions that are computable by a given network. We study real infinitely\ndifferentiable (smooth) hierarchical functions implemented by feedforward\nneural networks via composing simpler functions in two cases:\n\n1) each constituent function of the composition has fewer inputs than the\nresulting function;\n\n2) constituent functions are in the more specific yet prevalent form of a\nnon-linear univariate function (e.g. tanh) applied to a linear multivariate\nfunction.\n\nWe establish that in each of these regimes there exist non-trivial algebraic\npartial differential equations (PDEs), which are satisfied by the computed\nfunctions. These PDEs are purely in terms of the partial derivatives and are\ndependent only on the topology of the network. For compositions of polynomial\nfunctions, the algebraic PDEs yield non-trivial equations (of degrees dependent\nonly on the architecture) in the ambient polynomial space that are satisfied on\nthe associated functional varieties. Conversely, we conjecture that such PDE\nconstraints, once accompanied by appropriate non-singularity conditions and\nperhaps certain inequalities involving partial derivatives, guarantee that the\nsmooth function under consideration can be represented by the network. The\nconjecture is verified in numerous examples including the case of tree\narchitectures which are of neuroscientific interest.

          "description": "In reacting flow systems, thermoacoustic instability characterized by high\namplitude pressure fluctuations, is driven by a positive coupling between the\nunsteady heat release rate and the acoustic field of the combustor. When the\nunderlying flow is turbulent, as a control parameter of the system is varied\nand the system approach thermoacoustic instability, the acoustic pressure\noscillations synchronize with heat release rate oscillations. Consequently,\nduring the onset of thermoacoustic instability in turbulent combustors, the\nsystem dynamics transition from chaotic oscillations to periodic oscillations\nvia a state of intermittency. Thermoacoustic systems are traditionally modeled\nby coupling the model for the unsteady heat source and the acoustic subsystem,\neach estimated independently. The response of the unsteady heat source, the\nflame, to acoustic fluctuations are characterized by introducing external\nunsteady forcing. This necessitates a powerful excitation module to obtain the\nnonlinear response of the flame to acoustic perturbations. Instead of\ncharacterizing individual subsystems, we introduce a neural ordinary\ndifferential equation (neural ODE) framework to model the thermoacoustic system\nas a whole. The neural ODE model for the thermoacoustic system uses time series\nof the heat release rate and the pressure fluctuations, measured simultaneously\nwithout introducing any external perturbations, to model their coupled\ninteraction.

          "description": "Over the past decade, the advent of cybercrime has accelarated the research\non cybersecurity. However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls\nshort. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation\ndatasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them.\nThis is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to\nclassify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can\nlearn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large\nsets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially\nselected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of\ninterest. These approaches choose speci?fic unlabeled instances by a query\nfunction that are expected to improve overall classi?cation performance. The\nresulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the\nlabeled set.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it\ndetermines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it\nis to enhance classi?cation. These properties are the uncertainty score and\nanomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the\nmodel to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly\nselected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query\nstrategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL\nmethods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions.\nWe show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently\nobtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only\nanomalies or a ?fixed combination of the two.",

          "description": "Tree-based algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosted trees\ncontinue to be among the most popular and powerful machine learning models used\nacross multiple disciplines. The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact\nof a feature in tree based models is to measure the \\textit{node-wise reduction\nof a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii)\nis known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)\nprovide \\textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following\nthe decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model\nto each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a\npotential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.\nThe by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)\nvalues appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more\nexpensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations\ncomputed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification\nproblems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current\nresearchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and\ncorrelations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to\nvery similar rankings and interpretations. Analogous conclusions hold for the\nfidelity of using global feature importance scores as a proxy for the\npredictive power associated with each feature.",

          "description": "Intelligent recommendation and reminder systems are the need of the\nfast-pacing life. Current intelligent systems such as Siri, Google Assistant,\nMicrosoft Cortona, etc., have limited capability. For example, if you want to\nwake up at 6 am because you have an upcoming trip, you have to set the alarm\nmanually. Besides, these systems do not recommend or remind what else to carry,\nsuch as carrying an umbrella during a likely rain. The present work proposes a\nsystem that takes an email as input and returns a recommendation-cumreminder\nlist. As a first step, we parse the emails, recognize the entities using named\nentity recognition (NER). In the second step, information retrieval over the\nweb is done to identify nearby places, climatic conditions, etc. Imperative\nsentences from the reviews of all places are extracted and passed to the object\nextraction module. The main challenge lies in extracting the objects (items) of\ninterest from the review. To solve it, a modified Machine Reading\nComprehension-NER (MRC-NER) model is trained to tag objects of interest by\nformulating annotation rules as a query. The objects so found are recommended\nto the user one day in advance. The final reminder list of objects is pruned by\nour proposed model for tracking objects kept during the \"packing activity.\"\nEventually, when the user leaves for the event/trip, an alert is sent\ncontaining the reminding list items. Our approach achieves superior performance\ncompared to several baselines by as much as 30% on recall and 10% on precision.",

          "description": "Real world traffic sign recognition is an important step towards building\nautonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to\nadversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and\ngenerate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based\nattack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of\nthese algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)\niteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast\nmoving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally\nwithout considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,\nthis paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world\nroad sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)\nwe leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip\nthose zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural\nperturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a\nsingle perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance\nof the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function\nthat can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real\nworld data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the\nattack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a\nquarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also\nprovides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.\nWe provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility:\nhttps://github.com/AdvAttack/RoadSignAttack.",

          "description": "Robots in our daily surroundings are increasing day by day. Their usability\nand acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction\ncapability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the\nmost sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no\nspecific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it\nlargely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we\ninvestigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of\npeople is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as\nhuman beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we\ndo position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group\nactivity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality,\nfirst, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine\na position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation\ncan be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very\ndiverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we\nprovide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and\ngroup detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also\nput forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible\nconcerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on\nmethods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation\napproaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and\nlimitations in current literature along with possible future research\ndirections based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing\nmethods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and\nprovide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.",

          "description": "Pathology is practiced by visual inspection of histochemically stained\nslides. Most commonly, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is used in the\ndiagnostic workflow and it is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis. However,\nin many cases, especially for non-neoplastic diseases, additional \"special\nstains\" are used to provide different levels of contrast and color to tissue\ncomponents and allow pathologists to get a clearer diagnostic picture. In this\nstudy, we demonstrate the utility of supervised learning-based computational\nstain transformation from H&E to different special stains (Masson's Trichrome,\nperiodic acid-Schiff and Jones silver stain) using tissue sections from kidney\nneedle core biopsies. Based on evaluation by three renal pathologists, followed\nby adjudication by a fourth renal pathologist, we show that the generation of\nvirtual special stains from existing H&E images improves the diagnosis in\nseveral non-neoplastic kidney diseases sampled from 58 unique subjects. A\nsecond study performed by three pathologists found that the quality of the\nspecial stains generated by the stain transformation network was statistically\nequivalent to those generated through standard histochemical staining. As the\ntransformation of H&E images into special stains can be achieved within 1 min\nor less per patient core specimen slide, this stain-to-stain transformation\nframework can improve the quality of the preliminary diagnosis when additional\nspecial stains are needed, along with significant savings in time and cost,\nreducing the burden on healthcare system and patients.",

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables a learning machine to adapt from\na labeled source domain to an unlabeled domain under the distribution shift.\nThanks to the strong representation ability of deep neural networks, recent\nremarkable achievements in UDA resort to learning domain-invariant features.\nIntuitively, the hope is that a good feature representation, together with the\nhypothesis learned from the source domain, can generalize well to the target\ndomain. However, the learning processes of domain-invariant features and source\nhypothesis inevitably involve domain-specific information that would degrade\nthe generalizability of UDA models on the target domain. In this paper,\nmotivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis that only partial parameters are\nessential for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are\nessential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in\nUDA. Such parameters are termed transferable parameters. In contrast, the other\nparameters tend to fit domain-specific details and often fail to generalize,\nwhich we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose\nTransferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect brought by\ndomain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the\nmemorization of domain-invariant information. Specifically, according to the\ndistribution discrepancy degree, we divide all parameters into transferable and\nuntransferable ones in each training iteration. We then perform separate\nupdates rules for the two types of parameters. Extensive experiments on image\nclassification and regression tasks (keypoint detection) show that TransPar\noutperforms prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments\ndemonstrate that TransPar can be integrated into the most popular deep UDA\nnetworks and be easily extended to handle any data distribution shift\nscenarios.",

The proposed\nmodel has three parts: (i) an embedding layer to deal with sparse categorical\ndata, (ii) a Factorization Machine to efficiently learn pairwise interactions,\nand (iii) a DNN to implicitly model higher order interactions. In our\nexperiments on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed model classifies cognitive normal, mild cognitive\nimpaired, and demented patients more accurately than competing models. In\naddition, we show that valuable knowledge about the interactions among\nbiomarkers can be obtained.",

          "description": "Acoustic scene classification (ASC) has been approached in the last years\nusing deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks or\nrecurrent neural networks. Many state-of-the-art solutions are based on image\nclassification frameworks and, as such, a 2D representation of the audio signal\nis considered for training these networks. Finding the most suitable audio\nrepresentation is still a research area of interest. In this paper, different\nlog-Mel representations and combinations are analyzed. Experiments show that\nthe best results are obtained using the harmonic and percussive components plus\nthe difference between left and right stereo channels, (L-R). On the other\nhand, it is a common strategy to ensemble different models in order to increase\nthe final accuracy. Even though averaging different model predictions is a\ncommon choice, an exhaustive analysis of different ensemble techniques has not\nbeen presented in ASC problems. In this paper, geometric and arithmetic mean\nplus the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator are studied as aggregation\noperators for the output of the different models of the ensemble. Finally, the\nwork carried out in this paper is highly oriented towards real-time\nimplementations. In this context, as the number of applications for audio\nclassification on edge devices is increasing exponentially, we also analyze\ndifferent network depths and efficient solutions for aggregating ensemble\npredictions.",

          "description": "Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that\nrequires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing\nlearning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated\nmedical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust\nmedical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised\napproaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,\nand also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic\ninformation, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we\npresent SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly\nadvances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe\nan unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and\npredicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive\nobjective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach\nworks surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully\nsupervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can\nbe viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust\nto representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation\nby distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular\ndatasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT\ndataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of\nlabeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of\n90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to\nprevious best results.

Therefore, it is critical to\nestablish computational trustworthy decision-making mechanisms enhanced by\ninterpretability-aware strategies. To this end, we propose a Trustworthy\nDecision-Making (TDM) framework, which integrates symbolic planning into\nsequential decision-making. The framework learns interpretable subtasks that\nresult in a complex, higher-level composite task that can be formally evaluated\nusing the proposed trust metric. TDM enables the subtask-level interpretability\nby design and converges to an optimal symbolic plan from the learned subtasks.\nMoreover, a TDM-based algorithm is introduced to demonstrate the unification of\nsymbolic planning with other sequential-decision making algorithms, reaping the\nbenefits of both.

          "description": "A key challenge in scaling Gaussian Process (GP) regression to massive\ndatasets is that exact inference requires computation with a dense n x n kernel\nmatrix, where n is the number of data points. Significant work focuses on\napproximating the kernel matrix via interpolation using a smaller set of m\ninducing points. Structured kernel interpolation (SKI) is among the most\nscalable methods: by placing inducing points on a dense grid and using\nstructured matrix algebra, SKI achieves per-iteration time of O(n + m log m)\nfor approximate inference. This linear scaling in n enables inference for very\nlarge data sets; however the cost is per-iteration, which remains a limitation\nfor extremely large n. We show that the SKI per-iteration time can be reduced\nto O(m log m) after a single O(n) time precomputation step by reframing SKI as\nsolving a natural Bayesian linear regression problem with a fixed set of m\ncompact basis functions. With per-iteration complexity independent of the\ndataset size n for a fixed grid, our method scales to truly massive data sets.\nWe demonstrate speedups in practice for a wide range of m and n and apply the\nmethod to GP inference on a three-dimensional weather radar dataset with over\n100 million points.",

          "description": "Weakly-supervised learning (WSL) has recently triggered substantial interest\nas it mitigates the lack of pixel-wise annotations.\n\nGiven global image labels, WSL methods yield pixel-level predictions\n(segmentations), which enable to interpret class predictions. Despite their\nrecent success, mostly with natural images, such methods can face important\nchallenges when the foreground and background regions have similar visual cues,\nyielding high false-positive rates in segmentations, as is the case in\nchallenging histology images. WSL training is commonly driven by standard\nclassification losses, which implicitly maximize model confidence, and locate\nthe discriminative regions linked to classification decisions. Therefore, they\nlack mechanisms for modeling explicitly non-discriminative regions and reducing\nfalse-positive rates. We propose novel regularization terms, which enable the\nmodel to seek both non-discriminative and discriminative regions, while\ndiscouraging unbalanced segmentations. We introduce high uncertainty as a\ncriterion to localize non-discriminative regions that do not affect classifier\ndecision, and describe it with original Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence losses\nevaluating the deviation of posterior predictions from the uniform\ndistribution. Our KL terms encourage high uncertainty of the model when the\nlatter inputs the latent non-discriminative regions. Our loss integrates: (i) a\ncross-entropy seeking a foreground, where model confidence about class\nprediction is high; (ii) a KL regularizer seeking a background, where model\nuncertainty is high; and (iii) log-barrier terms discouraging unbalanced\nsegmentations. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies over the public\nGlaS colon cancer data and a Camelyon16 patch-based benchmark for breast cancer\nshow substantial improvements over state-of-the-art WSL methods, and confirm\nthe effect of our new regularizers.",

From the proposed\nBLS algorithm 1, we deduce the proposed ridge inverse, which can be obtained\nfrom the generalized inverse in [7] by just change one matrix in the equation\nto compute the newly added sub-matrix. We also modify the proposed algorithm 1\ninto the proposed algorithm 2, which is equivalent to the existing BLS\nalgorithm [7] in terms of numerical computations. The proposed algorithms 1 and\n2 can reduce the computational complexity, since usually the Hermitian matrix\nin the ridge inverse is smaller than the ridge inverse. With respect to the\nexisting BLS algorithm, the proposed algorithms 1 and 2 usually require about\n13 and 2 3 of complexities, respectively, while in numerical experiments they\nachieve the speedups (in each additional training time) of 2.40 - 2.91 and 1.36\n- 1.60, respectively.

The existing BLS assumes the ridge parameter lamda->0, since it is\nbased on the generalized inverse with the ridge regression approximation.

In this paper, we propose a novel latent\nfactor model called COMET (COnvolutional diMEnsion inTeraction), which\nsimultaneously model the high-order interaction patterns among historical\ninteractions and embedding dimensions. To be specific, COMET stacks the\nembeddings of historical interactions horizontally at first, which results in\ntwo \"embedding maps\". In this way, internal interactions and dimensional\ninteractions can be exploited by convolutional neural networks with kernels of\ndifferent sizes simultaneously. A fully-connected multi-layer perceptron is\nthen applied to obtain two interaction vectors. Lastly, the representations of\nusers and items are enriched by the learnt interaction vectors, which can\nfurther be used to produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments and\nablation studies on various public implicit feedback datasets clearly\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and the rationality of our proposed method.",

          "description": "Mining dense subgraphs where vertices connect closely with each other is a\ncommon task when analyzing graphs. A very popular notion in subgraph analysis\nis core decomposition. Recently, Esfahani et al. presented a probabilistic core\ndecomposition algorithm based on graph peeling and Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\nthat is capable of handling very large graphs. Their proposed peeling algorithm\n(PA) starts from the lowest degree vertices and recursively deletes these\nvertices, assigning core numbers, and updating the degree of neighbour vertices\nuntil it reached the maximum core. However, in many applications, particularly\nin biology, more valuable information can be obtained from dense\nsub-communities and we are not interested in small cores where vertices do not\ninteract much with others. To make the previous PA focus more on dense\nsubgraphs, we propose a multi-stage graph peeling algorithm (M-PA) that has a\ntwo-stage data screening procedure added before the previous PA. After removing\nvertices from the graph based on the user-defined thresholds, we can reduce the\ngraph complexity largely and without affecting the vertices in subgraphs that\nwe are interested in. We show that M-PA is more efficient than the previous PA\nand with the properly set filtering threshold, can produce very similar if not\nidentical dense subgraphs to the previous PA (in terms of graph density and\nclustering coefficient).",

Moreover, Transformer-based architectures have proven to\nbeat state-of-the-art models in summarizing news data. In this paper, we\nutilize a Transformer-based Pointer Generator Network to generate abstract\nsummaries for meeting transcripts. This model uses 2 LSTMs as an encoder and a\ndecoder, a Pointer network which copies words from the inputted text, and a\nGenerator network to produce out-of-vocabulary words (hence making the summary\nabstractive). Moreover, a coverage mechanism is used to avoid repetition of\nwords in the generated summary. First, we show that training the model on a\nnews summary dataset and using zero-shot learning to test it on the meeting\ndataset proves to produce better results than training it on the AMI meeting\ndataset. Second, we show that training this model first on out-of-domain data,\nsuch as the CNN-Dailymail dataset, followed by a fine-tuning stage on the AMI\nmeeting dataset is able to improve the performance of the model significantly.\nWe test our model on a testing set from the AMI dataset and report the ROUGE-2\nscore of the generated summary to compare with previous literature. We also\nreport the Factual score of our summaries since it is a better benchmark for\nabstractive summaries since the ROUGE-2 score is limited to measuring\nword-overlaps. We show that our improved model is able to improve on previous\nmodels by at least 5 ROUGE-2 scores, which is a substantial improvement.

Physics-informed learning has\nrecently emerged to learn physics for accurate prediction, but they often lack\na mechanism to leverage localized spatial and temporal correlation or rely on\nhard-coded physics parameters. In this paper, we advocate a physics-coupled\nneural network model to learn parameters governing the physics of the system,\nand further couple the learned physics to assist the learning of recurring\ndynamics. A spatio-temporal physics-coupled neural network (ST-PCNN) model is\nproposed to achieve three goals: (1) learning the underlying physics\nparameters, (2) transition of local information between spatio-temporal\nregions, and (3) forecasting future values for the dynamical system. The\nphysics-coupled learning ensures that the proposed model can be tremendously\nimproved by using learned physics parameters, and can achieve good long-range\nforecasting (e.g., more than 30-steps). Experiments, using simulated and\nfield-collected ocean current data, validate that ST-PCNN outperforms existing\nphysics-informed models.",

We show that we can\nestimate human posture solely from the trajectory of the interacting robot. We\npropose DULA, a differentiable ergonomics model, and use it in gradient-free\npostural optimization for physical human-robot interaction tasks such as\nco-manipulation and teleoperation.

          "description": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a flexible and powerful framework that is\nsuitable for computationally expensive simulation-based applications and\nguarantees statistical convergence to the global optimum. While remaining as\none of the most popular optimization methods, its capability is hindered by the\nsize of data, the dimensionality of the considered problem, and the nature of\nsequential optimization. These scalability issues are intertwined with each\nother and must be tackled simultaneously. In this work, we propose the\nScalable$^3$-BO framework, which employs sparse GP as the underlying surrogate\nmodel to scope with Big Data and is equipped with a random embedding to\nefficiently optimize high-dimensional problems with low effective\ndimensionality. The Scalable$^3$-BO framework is further leveraged with\nasynchronous parallelization feature, which fully exploits the computational\nresource on HPC within a computational budget. As a result, the proposed\nScalable$^3$-BO framework is scalable in three independent perspectives: with\nrespect to data size, dimensionality, and computational resource on HPC. The\ngoal of this work is to push the frontiers of BO beyond its well-known\nscalability issues and minimize the wall-clock waiting time for optimizing\nhigh-dimensional computationally expensive applications. We demonstrate the\ncapability of Scalable$^3$-BO with 1 million data points, 10,000-dimensional\nproblems, with 20 concurrent workers in an HPC environment.",

          "description": "Recent works have demonstrated great success in training high-capacity\nautoregressive language models (GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3) on a huge amount of\nunlabeled text corpus for text generation. Despite showing great results, this\ngenerates two training efficiency challenges. First, training large corpora can\nbe extremely timing consuming, and how to present training samples to the model\nto improve the token-wise convergence speed remains a challenging and open\nquestion. Second, many of these large models have to be trained with hundreds\nor even thousands of processors using data-parallelism with a very large batch\nsize. Despite of its better compute efficiency, it has been observed that\nlarge-batch training often runs into training instability issue or converges to\nsolutions with bad generalization performance. To overcome these two\nchallenges, we present a study of a curriculum learning based approach, which\nhelps improves the pre-training convergence speed of autoregressive models.\nMore importantly, we find that curriculum learning, as a regularization method,\nexerts a gradient variance reduction effect and enables to train autoregressive\nmodels with much larger batch sizes and learning rates without training\ninstability, further improving the training speed. Our evaluations demonstrate\nthat curriculum learning enables training GPT-2 models (with up to 1.5B\nparameters) with 8x larger batch size and 4x larger learning rate, whereas the\nbaseline approach struggles with training divergence. To achieve the same\nvalidation perplexity targets during pre-training, curriculum learning reduces\nthe required number of tokens and wall clock time by up to 59% and 54%,\nrespectively. To achieve the same or better zero-shot WikiText-103/LAMBADA\nevaluation results at the end of pre-training, curriculum learning reduces the\nrequired number of tokens and wall clock time by up to 13% and 61%,\nrespectively.",

          "description": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is a long-standing problem of recommender\nsystems. Many novel methods have been proposed, ranging from classical matrix\nfactorization to recent graph convolutional network-based approaches. After\nrecent fierce debates, researchers started to focus on linear graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs) with a layer combination, which show\nstate-of-the-art accuracy in many datasets. In this work, we extend them based\non neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), because the linear GCN\nconcept can be interpreted as a differential equation, and present the method\nof Learnable-Time ODE-based Collaborative Filtering (LT-OCF). The main novelty\nin our method is that after redesigning linear GCNs on top of the NODE regime,\ni) we learn the optimal architecture rather than relying on manually designed\nones, ii) we learn smooth ODE solutions that are considered suitable for CF,\nand iii) we test with various ODE solvers that internally build a diverse set\nof neural network connections. We also present a novel training method\nspecialized to our method. In our experiments with three benchmark datasets,\nGowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-Book, our method consistently shows better\naccuracy than existing methods, e.g., a recall of 0.0411 by LightGCN vs. 0.0442\nby LT-OCF and an NDCG of 0.0315 by LightGCN vs. 0.0341 by LT-OCF in\nAmazon-Book.

          "description": "This paper aims at addressing the problem of substantial performance\ndegradation at extremely low computational cost (e.g. 5M FLOPs on ImageNet\nclassification). We found that two factors, sparse connectivity and dynamic\nactivation function, are effective to improve the accuracy. The former avoids\nthe significant reduction of network width, while the latter mitigates the\ndetriment of reduction in network depth. Technically, we propose\nmicro-factorized convolution, which factorizes a convolution matrix into low\nrank matrices, to integrate sparse connectivity into convolution. We also\npresent a new dynamic activation function, named Dynamic Shift Max, to improve\nthe non-linearity via maxing out multiple dynamic fusions between an input\nfeature map and its circular channel shift. Building upon these two new\noperators, we arrive at a family of networks, named MicroNet, that achieves\nsignificant performance gains over the state of the art in the low FLOP regime.\nFor instance, under the constraint of 12M FLOPs, MicroNet achieves 59.4\\% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet classification, outperforming MobileNetV3 by 9.6\\%.

          "description": "Accurate terminology translation is crucial for ensuring the practicality and\nreliability of neural machine translation (NMT) systems. To address this,\nlexically constrained NMT explores various methods to ensure pre-specified\nwords and phrases appear in the translation output. However, in many cases,\nthose methods are studied on general domain corpora, where the terms are mostly\nuni- and bi-grams (>98%). In this paper, we instead tackle a more challenging\nsetup consisting of domain-specific corpora with much longer n-gram and highly\nspecialized terms. Inspired by the recent success of masked span prediction\nmodels, we propose a simple and effective training strategy that achieves\nconsistent improvements on both terminology and sentence-level translation for\nthree domain-specific corpora in two language pairs.",

This substantive approach enables more fruitful\ntheorizing about the role of algorithms in combatting oppression. The\ndistinction between formal and substantive algorithmic fairness is exemplified\nby each approach's responses to the \"impossibility of fairness\" (an\nincompatibility between mathematical definitions of algorithmic fairness).\nWhile the formal approach requires us to accept the \"impossibility of fairness\"\nas a harsh limit on efforts to enhance equality, the substantive approach\nallows us to escape the \"impossibility of fairness\" by suggesting reforms that\nare not subject to this false dilemma and that are better equipped to\nameliorate conditions of social oppression.",

          "description": "Multiplex networks have become increasingly more prevalent in many fields,\nand have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling the complexity of real\nnetworks. There is a critical need for developing inference models for\nmultiplex networks that can take into account potential dependencies across\ndifferent layers, particularly when the aim is community detection. We add to a\nlimited literature by proposing a novel and efficient Bayesian model for\ncommunity detection in multiplex networks. A key feature of our approach is the\nability to model varying communities at different network layers. In contrast,\nmany existing models assume the same communities for all layers. Moreover, our\nmodel automatically picks up the necessary number of communities at each layer\n(as validated by real data examples). This is appealing, since deciding the\nnumber of communities is a challenging aspect of community detection, and\nespecially so in the multiplex setting, if one allows the communities to change\nacross layers. Borrowing ideas from hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we use a\nhierarchical Dirichlet prior to model community labels across layers, allowing\ndependency in their structure. Given the community labels, a stochastic block\nmodel (SBM) is assumed for each layer. We develop an efficient slice sampler\nfor sampling the posterior distribution of the community labels as well as the\nlink probabilities between communities. In doing so, we address some unique\nchallenges posed by coupling the complex likelihood of SBM with the\nhierarchical nature of the prior on the labels. An extensive empirical\nvalidation is performed on simulated and real data, demonstrating the superior\nperformance of the model over single-layer alternatives, as well as the ability\nto uncover interesting structures in real networks.",

In this paper, we first empirically establish the perhaps expected,\nbut unreported result, that combining pretrained features with simple anomaly\ndetection and segmentation methods convincingly outperforms, much more complex,\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n\nIn order to obtain further performance gains in anomaly detection, we adapt\npretrained features to the target distribution. Although transfer learning\nmethods are well established in multi-class classification problems, the\none-class classification (OCC) setting is not as well explored. It turns out\nthat naive adaptation methods, which typically work well in supervised\nlearning, often result in catastrophic collapse (feature deterioration) and\nreduce performance in OCC settings. A popular OCC method, DeepSVDD, advocates\nusing specialized architectures, but this limits the adaptation performance\ngain. We propose two methods for combating collapse: i) a variant of early\nstopping that dynamically learns the stopping iteration ii) elastic\nregularization inspired by continual learning.

By contrast, existing methods that\nlearn articulation models from raw observations typically only predict point\nestimates of the model parameters, which are insufficient to guarantee the safe\nmanipulation of articulated objects. Our core contributions include a novel\nrepresentation for distributions over rigid body transformations and\narticulation model parameters based on screw theory, von Mises-Fisher\ndistributions, and Stiefel manifolds. Combining these concepts allows for an\nefficient, mathematically sound representation that implicitly satisfies the\nconstraints that rigid body transformations and articulations must adhere to.\nLeveraging this representation, we introduce a novel deep learning based\napproach, DUST-net, that performs category-independent articulation model\nestimation while also providing model uncertainties. We evaluate our approach\non several benchmarking datasets and real-world objects and compare its\nperformance with two current state-of-the-art methods.

This\npaper shows that the dynamic and orthogonal AE based weight compression\ntechnique could serve as an advantageous alternative (or an add-on) in a large\nscale FL, as it not only achieves compression ratios ranging from 500x to 1720x\nand beyond, but can also be modified based on the accuracy requirements,\ncomputational capacity, and other requirements of the given FL setup.",

Although exploration is indispensable for long success of a\nrecommender system, the exploration has been considered as the risk to decrease\nuser satisfaction. The reason for the risk is that items chosen for exploration\nfrequently mismatch with the user's interests. To mitigate this risk,\nrecommender systems have mixed items chosen for exploration into a\nrecommendation list, disguising the items as recommendations to elicit feedback\non the items to discover the user's additional tastes. This mix-in approach has\nbeen widely used in many recommenders, but there is rare research, evaluating\nthe effectiveness of the mix-in approach or proposing a new approach for\neliciting user feedback without deceiving users. In this work, we aim to\npropose a new approach for feedback elicitation without any deception and\ncompare our approach to the conventional mix-in approach for evaluation. To\nthis end, we designed a recommender interface that reveals which items are for\nexploration and conducted a within-subject study with 94 MTurk workers. Our\nresults indicated that users left significantly more feedback on items chosen\nfor exploration with our interface. Besides, users evaluated that our new\ninterface is better than the conventional mix-in interface in terms of novelty,\ndiversity, transparency, trust, and satisfaction. Finally, path analysis show\nthat, in only our new interface, exploration caused to increase user-centric\nevaluation metrics.

          "description": "Embodied conversational agents benefit from being able to accompany their\nspeech with gestures. Although many data-driven approaches to gesture\ngeneration have been proposed in recent years, it is still unclear whether such\nsystems can consistently generate gestures that convey meaning. We investigate\nwhich gesture properties (phase, category, and semantics) can be predicted from\nspeech text and/or audio using contemporary deep learning. In extensive\nexperiments, we show that gesture properties related to gesture meaning\n(semantics and category) are predictable from text features (time-aligned BERT\nembeddings) alone, but not from prosodic audio features, while rhythm-related\ngesture properties (phase) on the other hand can be predicted from either\naudio, text (with word-level timing information), or both. These results are\nencouraging as they indicate that it is possible to equip an embodied agent\nwith content-wise meaningful co-speech gestures using a machine-learning model.",

          "description": "Proper initialization is crucial to the optimization and the generalization\nof neural networks. However, most existing neural recommendation systems\ninitialize the user and item embeddings randomly. In this work, we propose a\nnew initialization scheme for user and item embeddings called Laplacian\nEigenmaps with Popularity-based Regularization for Isolated Data (LEPORID).\nLEPORID endows the embeddings with information regarding multi-scale\nneighborhood structures on the data manifold and performs adaptive\nregularization to compensate for high embedding variance on the tail of the\ndata distribution. Exploiting matrix sparsity, LEPORID embeddings can be\ncomputed efficiently. We evaluate LEPORID in a wide range of neural\nrecommendation models. In contrast to the recent surprising finding that the\nsimple K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) method often outperforms neural recommendation\nsystems, we show that existing neural systems initialized with LEPORID often\nperform on par or better than KNN. To maximize the effects of the\ninitialization, we propose the Dual-Loss Residual Recommendation (DLR2)\nnetwork, which, when initialized with LEPORID, substantially outperforms both\ntraditional and state-of-the-art neural recommender systems.",

We propose\na robust adaptive control algorithm that explicitly incorporates such\nnon-asymptotic uncertainties into the control design. The algorithm has three\ncomponents: (1) a least-squares nominal model estimator; (2) a bootstrap\nresampling method that quantifies non-asymptotic variance of the nominal model\nestimate; and (3) a non-conventional robust control design method using an\noptimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with multiplicative noise. A key\nadvantage of the proposed approach is that the system identification and robust\ncontrol design procedures both use stochastic uncertainty representations, so\nthat the actual inherent statistical estimation uncertainty directly aligns\nwith the uncertainty the robust controller is being designed against.

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) play an increasingly important role in various\ncomputer systems. In order to create these networks, engineers typically\nspecify a desired topology, and then use an automated training algorithm to\nselect the network's weights. While training algorithms have been studied\nextensively and are well understood, the selection of topology remains a form\nof art, and can often result in networks that are unnecessarily large - and\nconsequently are incompatible with end devices that have limited memory,\nbattery or computational power. Here, we propose to address this challenge by\nharnessing recent advances in DNN verification. We present a framework and a\nmethodology for discovering redundancies in DNNs - i.e., for finding neurons\nthat are not needed, and can be removed in order to reduce the size of the DNN.\nBy using sound verification techniques, we can formally guarantee that our\nsimplified network is equivalent to the original, either completely, or up to a\nprescribed tolerance.

In this work\nwe address such limitations by introducing DDGC, a fast generative multi-finger\ngrasp sampling method that can generate high quality grasps in cluttered scenes\nfrom a single RGB-D image. DDGC is built as a network that encodes scene\ninformation to produce coarse-to-fine collision-free grasp poses and\nconfigurations. We experimentally benchmark DDGC against the\nsimulated-annealing planner in GraspIt! on 1200 simulated cluttered scenes and\n7 real world scenes. The results show that DDGC outperforms the baseline on\nsynthesizing high-quality grasps and removing clutter while being 5 times\nfaster.

          "description": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), despite its popularity and\nempirical success, suffers from the curse of dimensionality. This paper builds\nthe mathematical framework to approximate cooperative MARL by a mean-field\ncontrol (MFC) approach, and shows that the approximation error is of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$. By establishing an appropriate form of the\ndynamic programming principle for both the value function and the Q function,\nit proposes a model-free kernel-based Q-learning algorithm (MFC-K-Q), which is\nshown to have a linear convergence rate for the MFC problem, the first of its\nkind in the MARL literature. It further establishes that the convergence rate\nand the sample complexity of MFC-K-Q are independent of the number of agents\n$N$, which provides an $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$ approximation to the\nMARL problem with $N$ agents in the learning environment. Empirical studies for\nthe network traffic congestion problem demonstrate that MFC-K-Q outperforms\nexisting MARL algorithms when $N$ is large, for instance when $N>50$.",

          "description": "The physical and clinical constraints surrounding diffusion-weighted imaging\n(DWI) often limit the spatial resolution of the produced images to voxels up to\n8 times larger than those of T1w images. Thus, the detailed information\ncontained in T1w imagescould help in the synthesis of diffusion images in\nhigher resolution. However, the non-Euclidean nature of diffusion imaging\nhinders current deep generative models from synthesizing physically plausible\nimages. In this work, we propose the first Riemannian network architecture for\nthe direct generation of diffusion tensors (DT) and diffusion orientation\ndistribution functions (dODFs) from high-resolution T1w images. Our integration\nof the Log-Euclidean Metric into a learning objective guarantees, unlike\nstandard Euclidean networks, the mathematically-valid synthesis of diffusion.\nFurthermore, our approach improves the fractional anisotropy mean squared error\n(FA MSE) between the synthesized diffusion and the ground-truth by more than\n23% and the cosine similarity between principal directions by almost 5% when\ncompared to our baselines. We validate our generated diffusion by comparing the\nresulting tractograms to our expected real data. We observe similar fiber\nbundles with streamlines having less than 3% difference in length, less than 1%\ndifference in volume, and a visually close shape. While our method is able to\ngenerate high-resolution diffusion images from structural inputs in less than\n15 seconds, we acknowledge and discuss the limits of diffusion inference solely\nrelying on T1w images. Our results nonetheless suggest a relationship between\nthe high-level geometry of the brain and the overall white matter architecture.",

          "description": "Deep learning accelerators efficiently train over vast and growing amounts of\ndata, placing a newfound burden on commodity networks and storage devices. A\ncommon approach to conserve bandwidth involves resizing or compressing data\nprior to training. We introduce Progressive Compressed Records (PCRs), a data\nformat that uses compression to reduce the overhead of fetching and\ntransporting data, effectively reducing the training time required to achieve a\ntarget accuracy. PCRs deviate from previous storage formats by combining\nprogressive compression with an efficient storage layout to view a single\ndataset at multiple fidelities---all without adding to the total dataset size.\nWe implement PCRs and evaluate them on a range of datasets, training tasks, and\nhardware architectures. Our work shows that: (i) the amount of compression a\ndataset can tolerate exceeds 50% of the original encoding for many DL training\ntasks; (ii) it is possible to automatically and efficiently select appropriate\ncompression levels for a given task; and (iii) PCRs enable tasks to readily\naccess compressed data at runtime---utilizing as little as half the training\nbandwidth and thus potentially doubling training speed.",

In this paper, we propose a\ncouple of mechanisms providing extended DP with a different metric: angular\ndistance (or cosine distance). Our mechanisms are based on locality sensitive\nhashing (LSH), which can be applied to the angular distance and work well for\npersonal data in a high-dimensional space. We theoretically analyze the privacy\nproperties of our mechanisms, and prove extended DP for input data by taking\ninto account that LSH preserves the original metric only approximately.

          "description": "We train embodied neural networks to plan and navigate unseen complex 3D\nenvironments, emphasising real-world deployment. Rather than requiring prior\nknowledge of the agent or environment, the planner learns to model the state\ntransitions and rewards. To avoid the potentially hazardous trial-and-error of\nreinforcement learning, we focus on differentiable planners such as Value\nIteration Networks (VIN), which are trained offline from safe expert\ndemonstrations. Although they work well in small simulations, we address two\nmajor limitations that hinder their deployment. First, we observed that current\ndifferentiable planners struggle to plan long-term in environments with a high\nbranching complexity. While they should ideally learn to assign low rewards to\nobstacles to avoid collisions, we posit that the constraints imposed on the\nnetwork are not strong enough to guarantee the network to learn sufficiently\nlarge penalties for every possible collision. We thus impose a structural\nconstraint on the value iteration, which explicitly learns to model any\nimpossible actions. Secondly, we extend the model to work with a limited\nperspective camera under translation and rotation, which is crucial for real\nrobot deployment. Many VIN-like planners assume a 360 degrees or overhead view\nwithout rotation. In contrast, our method uses a memory-efficient lattice map\nto aggregate CNN embeddings of partial observations, and models the rotational\ndynamics explicitly using a 3D state-space grid (translation and rotation). Our\nproposals significantly improve semantic navigation and exploration on several\n2D and 3D environments, succeeding in settings that are otherwise challenging\nfor this class of methods.

The present work gives a philosophical approach to\nclearly define anomalies and to develop an algorithm for their efficient\ndetection with minimal user intervention. Inspired by the Gestalt School of\nPsychology and the Helmholtz principle of human perception, the idea is to\nassume anomalies are observations that are unexpected to occur with respect to\ncertain groupings made by the majority of the data. Thus, under appropriate\nrandom variable modelling anomalies are directly found in a set of data under a\nuniform and independent random assumption of the distribution of constituent\nelements of the observations; anomalies correspond to those observations where\nthe expectation of occurrence of the elements in a given view is $<1$. Starting\nfrom fundamental principles of human perception an unsupervised anomaly\ndetection algorithm is developed that is simple, real-time and parameter-free.\nExperiments suggest it as the prime choice for univariate data and it shows\npromising performance on the detection of global anomalies in multivariate\ndata.",

          "description": "Useful information (UI) is an elusive concept in neural networks. A\nquantitative measurement of UI is absent, despite the variations of UI can be\nrecognized by prior knowledge. The communication bandwidth of feature maps\ndecreases after downscaling operations, but UI flows smoothly after training\ndue to lower Nyquist frequency. Inspired by the low-Nyqusit-frequency nature of\nUI, we propose the use of spectral roll-off points (SROPs) to estimate UI on\nvariations. The computation of an SROP is extended from a 1-D signal to a 2-D\nimage by the required rotation invariance in image classification tasks. SROP\nstatistics across feature maps are implemented as layer-wise useful information\nestimates. We design sanity checks to explore SROP variations when UI\nvariations are produced by variations in model input, model architecture and\ntraining stages. The variations of SROP is synchronizes with UI variations in\nvarious randomized and sufficiently trained model structures. Therefore, SROP\nvariations is an accurate and convenient sign of UI variations, which promotes\nthe explainability of data representations with respect to frequency-domain\nknowledge.",

          "description": "A central challenge in the computational modeling of neural dynamics is the\ntrade-off between accuracy and simplicity. At the level of individual neurons,\nnonlinear dynamics are both experimentally established and essential for\nneuronal functioning. An implicit assumption has thus formed that an accurate\ncomputational model of whole-brain dynamics must also be highly nonlinear,\nwhereas linear models may provide a first-order approximation. Here, we provide\na rigorous and data-driven investigation of this hypothesis at the level of\nwhole-brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and macroscopic field potential\ndynamics by leveraging the theory of system identification. Using functional\nMRI (fMRI) and intracranial EEG (iEEG), we model the resting state activity of\n700 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 122 subjects from the\nRestoring Active Memory (RAM) project using state-of-the-art linear and\nnonlinear model families. We assess relative model fit using predictive power,\ncomputational complexity, and the extent of residual dynamics unexplained by\nthe model. Contrary to our expectations, linear auto-regressive models achieve\nthe best measures across all three metrics, eliminating the trade-off between\naccuracy and simplicity. To understand and explain this linearity, we highlight\nfour properties of macroscopic neurodynamics which can counteract or mask\nmicroscopic nonlinear dynamics: averaging over space, averaging over time,\nobservation noise, and limited data samples. Whereas the latter two are\ntechnological limitations and can improve in the future, the former two are\ninherent to aggregated macroscopic brain activity. Our results, together with\nthe unparalleled interpretability of linear models, can greatly facilitate our\nunderstanding of macroscopic neural dynamics and the principled design of\nmodel-based interventions for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

In this work, we propose to avoid\nmanual annotation and generate a large-scale training dataset for video\nquestion answering making use of automatic cross-modal supervision. We leverage\na question generation transformer trained on text data and use it to generate\nquestion-answer pairs from transcribed video narrations. Given narrated videos,\nwe then automatically generate the HowToVQA69M dataset with 69M\nvideo-question-answer triplets. To handle the open vocabulary of diverse\nanswers in this dataset, we propose a training procedure based on a contrastive\nloss between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer\ntransformer. We introduce the zero-shot VideoQA task and show excellent\nresults, in particular for rare answers. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method\nto significantly outperform the state of the art on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA,\nActivityNet-QA and How2QA.

In this article, inspired by\nhuman communication, we propose a novel stochastic model of System 1\nsemantics-native communication (SNC) for generic tasks, where a speaker has an\nintention of referring to an entity, extracts the semantics, and communicates\nits symbolic representation to a target listener. To further reach its full\npotential, we additionally infuse contextual reasoning into SNC such that the\nspeaker locally and iteratively self-communicates with a virtual agent built on\nthe physical listener's unique way of coding its semantics, i.e., communication\ncontext. The resultant System 2 SNC allows the speaker to extract the most\neffective semantics for its listener. Leveraging the proposed stochastic model,\nwe show that the reliability of System 2 SNC increases with the number of\nmeaningful concepts, and derive the expected semantic representation (SR) bit\nlength which quantifies the extracted effective semantics. It is also shown\nthat System 2 SNC significantly reduces the SR length without compromising\ncommunication reliability.",

A surprising result from recent knowledge distillation (KD) literature\nis that random, untrained, and equally structured teacher networks can also\nvastly improve generalization performance. It raises the possibility of\nexistence of undiscovered assumptions useful for generalization on an uncertain\nregion. In this paper, we shed light on the assumptions by analyzing decision\nboundaries and confidence distributions of both simple and KD-based\ngeneralization methods. Assuming that a decision boundary exists to represent\nthe most general tendency of distinction on an input sample space (i.e., the\nsimplest hypothesis), we show the various limitations of methods when using the\nhypothesis. To resolve these limitations, we propose matured dumb teacher based\nKD, conservatively transferring the hypothesis for generalization of the\nstudent without massive destruction of trained information. In practical\nexperiments on feed-forward and convolution neural networks for image\nclassification tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, the proposed\nmethod shows stable improvement to the best test performance in the grid search\nof hyperparameters.

          "description": "Machine learning (ML) solutions are prevalent. However, many challenges exist\nin making these solutions business-grade. One major challenge is to ensure that\nthe ML solution provides its expected business value. In order to do that, one\nhas to bridge the gap between the way ML model performance is measured and the\nsolution requirements. In previous work (Barash et al, \"Bridging the gap...\")\nwe demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing feature models in bridging this\ngap. Whereas ML performance metrics, such as the accuracy or F1-score of a\nclassifier, typically measure the average ML performance, feature models shed\nlight on explainable data slices that are too far from that average, and\ntherefore might indicate unsatisfied requirements. For example, the overall\naccuracy of a bank text terms classifier may be very high, say $98\\% \\pm 2\\%$,\nyet it might perform poorly for terms that include short descriptions and\noriginate from commercial accounts. A business requirement, which may be\nimplicit in the training data, may be to perform well regardless of the type of\naccount and length of the description. Therefore, the under-performing data\nslice that includes short descriptions and commercial accounts suggests\npoorly-met requirements. In this paper we show the feasibility of automatically\nextracting feature models that result in explainable data slices over which the\nML solution under-performs. Our novel technique, IBM FreaAI aka FreaAI,\nextracts such slices from structured ML test data or any other labeled data. We\ndemonstrate that FreaAI can automatically produce explainable and\nstatistically-significant data slices over seven open datasets.",

          "description": "One of the difficulties of conversion rate (CVR) prediction is that the\nconversions can delay and take place long after the clicks. The delayed\nfeedback poses a challenge: fresh data are beneficial to continuous training\nbut may not have complete label information at the time they are ingested into\nthe training pipeline. To balance model freshness and label certainty, previous\nmethods set a short waiting window or even do not wait for the conversion\nsignal. If conversion happens outside the waiting window, this sample will be\nduplicated and ingested into the training pipeline with a positive label.\nHowever, these methods have some issues. First, they assume the observed\nfeature distribution remains the same as the actual distribution. But this\nassumption does not hold due to the ingestion of duplicated samples. Second,\nthe certainty of the conversion action only comes from the positives. But the\npositives are scarce as conversions are sparse in commercial systems. These\nissues induce bias during the modeling of delayed feedback. In this paper, we\npropose DElayed FEedback modeling with Real negatives (DEFER) method to address\nthese issues. The proposed method ingests real negative samples into the\ntraining pipeline. The ingestion of real negatives ensures the observed feature\ndistribution is equivalent to the actual distribution, thus reducing the bias.\nThe ingestion of real negatives also brings more certainty information of the\nconversion. To correct the distribution shift, DEFER employs importance\nsampling to weigh the loss function. Experimental results on industrial\ndatasets validate the superiority of DEFER. DEFER have been deployed in the\ndisplay advertising system of Alibaba, obtaining over 6.0% improvement on CVR\nin several scenarios. The code and data in this paper are now open-sourced\n{https://github.com/gusuperstar/defer.git}.",

We provide a flexible definition of a\nmodel feature vector associated to a space-time signal, along with two\nalgorithms which illustrate ways in which these features can be combined with\nlinear regression. We apply these algorithms in several numerical experiments\ndesigned to learn solutions to PDEs with a given forcing and boundary data.

          "description": "The pre-trained model (PTM) is revolutionizing Artificial intelligence (AI)\ntechnology. It learns a model with general language features on the vast text\nand then fine-tunes the model using a task-specific dataset. Unfortunately, PTM\ntraining requires prohibitively expensive computing devices, especially\nfine-tuning, which is still a game for a small proportion of people in the AI\ncommunity. Enabling PTMs training on low-quality devices, PatrickStar now makes\nPTM accessible to everyone.\n\nPatrickStar reduces memory requirements of computing platforms by using the\nCPU-GPU heterogeneous memory space to store model data, consisting of\nparameters, gradients, and optimizer states. We observe that the GPU memory\navailable for model data changes regularly, in a tide-like pattern, decreasing\nand increasing iteratively. However, the existing heterogeneous training works\ndo not take advantage of this pattern. Instead, they statically partition the\nmodel data among CPU and GPU, leading to both memory waste and memory abuse. In\ncontrast, PatrickStar manages model data in chunks, which are dynamically\ndistributed in heterogeneous memory spaces. Chunks consist of stateful tensors\nwhich run as finite state machines during training. Guided by the runtime\nmemory statistics collected in a warm-up iteration, chunks are orchestrated\nefficiently in heterogeneous memory and generate lower CPU-GPU data\ntransmission volume. Symbiosis with the Zero Redundancy Optimizer, PatrickStar\nscales to multiple GPUs using data parallelism, with the lowest communication\nbandwidth requirements and more efficient bandwidth utilization. Experimental\nresults show PatrickStar trains a 12 billion parameters GPT model, 2x larger\nthan the STOA work, on an 8-V100 and 240GB CPU memory node, and is also more\nefficient on the same model size.",

          "description": "With the increasing popularity of deep learning on edge devices, compressing\nlarge neural networks to meet the hardware requirements of resource-constrained\ndevices became a significant research direction. Numerous compression\nmethodologies are currently being used to reduce the memory sizes and energy\nconsumption of neural networks. Knowledge distillation (KD) is among such\nmethodologies and it functions by using data samples to transfer the knowledge\ncaptured by a large model (teacher) to a smaller one(student). However, due to\nvarious reasons, the original training data might not be accessible at the\ncompression stage. Therefore, data-free model compression is an ongoing\nresearch problem that has been addressed by various works. In this paper, we\npoint out that catastrophic forgetting is a problem that can potentially be\nobserved in existing data-free distillation methods. Moreover, the sample\ngeneration strategies in some of these methods could result in a mismatch\nbetween the synthetic and real data distributions. To prevent such problems, we\npropose a data-free KD framework that maintains a dynamic collection of\ngenerated samples over time. Additionally, we add the constraint of matching\nthe real data distribution in sample generation strategies that target maximum\ninformation gain. Our experiments demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy\nof the student models obtained via KD when compared with state-of-the-art\napproaches on the SVHN, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.",

          "description": "Recently, several Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) approaches have been\ndevised to represent entities and relations in dense vector space and employed\nin downstream tasks such as link prediction. A few KGE techniques address\ninterpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations\n(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric\ninterpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in\nhigher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the\nability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,\nmodeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of\ninterpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to\nachieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional\nspace. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view\nthe relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding\nvector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in\nwhich we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE\nconsiders the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing\nexpressivity and interpretability. Our empirical results on four well-known\nbenchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance for the KG completion task.",

          "description": "How do the neural networks distinguish two images? It is of critical\nimportance to understand the matching mechanism of deep models for developing\nreliable intelligent systems for many risky visual applications such as\nsurveillance and access control. However, most existing deep metric learning\nmethods match the images by comparing feature vectors, which ignores the\nspatial structure of images and thus lacks interpretability. In this paper, we\npresent a deep interpretable metric learning (DIML) method for more transparent\nembedding learning. Unlike conventional metric learning methods based on\nfeature vector comparison, we propose a structural matching strategy that\nexplicitly aligns the spatial embeddings by computing an optimal matching flow\nbetween feature maps of the two images. Our method enables deep models to learn\nmetrics in a more human-friendly way, where the similarity of two images can be\ndecomposed to several part-wise similarities and their contributions to the\noverall similarity. Our method is model-agnostic, which can be applied to\noff-the-shelf backbone networks and metric learning methods. We evaluate our\nmethod on three major benchmarks of deep metric learning including CUB200-2011,\nCars196, and Stanford Online Products, and achieve substantial improvements\nover popular metric learning methods with better interpretability.

          "description": "Large-scale pretraining of visual representations has led to state-of-the-art\nperformance on a range of benchmark computer vision tasks, yet the benefits of\nthese techniques at extreme scale in complex production systems has been\nrelatively unexplored. We consider the case of a popular visual discovery\nproduct, where these representations are trained with multi-task learning, from\nuse-case specific visual understanding (e.g. skin tone classification) to\ngeneral representation learning for all visual content (e.g. embeddings for\nretrieval). In this work, we describe how we (1) generate a dataset with over a\nbillion images via large weakly-supervised pretraining to improve the\nperformance of these visual representations, and (2) leverage Transformers to\nreplace the traditional convolutional backbone, with insights into both system\nand performance improvements, especially at 1B+ image scale. To support this\nbackbone model, we detail a systematic approach to deriving weakly-supervised\nimage annotations from heterogenous text signals, demonstrating the benefits of\nclustering techniques to handle the long-tail distribution of image labels.\nThrough a comprehensive study of offline and online evaluation, we show that\nlarge-scale Transformer-based pretraining provides significant benefits to\nindustry computer vision applications. The model is deployed in a production\nvisual shopping system, with 36% improvement in top-1 relevance and 23%\nimprovement in click-through volume. We conduct extensive experiments to better\nunderstand the empirical relationships between Transformer-based architectures,\ndataset scale, and the performance of production vision systems.",

          "description": "Spectral clustering (SC) is one of the most popular clustering methods and\noften outperforms traditional clustering methods. SC uses the eigenvectors of a\nLaplacian matrix calculated from a similarity matrix of a dataset. SC has\nserious drawbacks: the significant increases in the time complexity derived\nfrom the computation of eigenvectors and the memory space complexity to store\nthe similarity matrix. To address the issues, I develop a new approximate\nspectral clustering using the network generated by growing neural gas (GNG),\ncalled ASC with GNG in this study. ASC with GNG uses not only reference vectors\nfor vector quantization but also the topology of the network for extraction of\nthe topological relationship between data points in a dataset. ASC with GNG\ncalculates the similarity matrix from both the reference vectors and the\ntopology of the network generated by GNG. Using the network generated from a\ndataset by GNG, ASC with GNG achieves to reduce the computational and space\ncomplexities and improve clustering quality. In this study, I demonstrate that\nASC with GNG effectively reduces the computational time. Moreover, this study\nshows that ASC with GNG provides equal to or better clustering performance than\nSC.",

In this paper, we propose a new\nplatform and pipeline, DexMV (Dex Manipulation from Videos), for imitation\nlearning to bridge the gap between computer vision and robot learning. We\ndesign a platform with: (i) a simulation system for complex dexterous\nmanipulation tasks with a multi-finger robot hand and (ii) a computer vision\nsystem to record large-scale demonstrations of a human hand conducting the same\ntasks. In our new pipeline, we extract 3D hand and object poses from the\nvideos, and convert them to robot demonstrations via motion retargeting. We\nthen apply and compare multiple imitation learning algorithms with the\ndemonstrations. We show that the demonstrations can indeed improve robot\nlearning by a large margin and solve the complex tasks which reinforcement\nlearning alone cannot solve.

          "description": "The property of conformal predictors to guarantee the required accuracy rate\nmakes this framework attractive in various practical applications. However,\nthis property is achieved at a price of reduction in precision. In the case of\nconformal classification, the systems can output multiple class labels instead\nof one. It is also known from the literature, that the choice of nonconformity\nfunction has a major impact on the efficiency of conformal classifiers.\nRecently, it was shown that different model-agnostic nonconformity functions\nresult in conformal classifiers with different characteristics. For a Neural\nNetwork-based conformal classifier, the inverse probability (or hinge loss)\nallows minimizing the average number of predicted labels, and margin results in\na larger fraction of singleton predictions. In this work, we aim to further\nextend this study. We perform an experimental evaluation using 8 different\nclassification algorithms and discuss when the previously observed relationship\nholds or not. Additionally, we propose a successful method to combine the\nproperties of these two nonconformity functions. The experimental evaluation is\ndone using 11 real and 5 synthetic datasets.",

          "description": "Spatio-temporal forecasting is of great importance in a wide range of\ndynamical systems applications from atmospheric science, to recent COVID-19\nspread modeling. These applications rely on accurate predictions of\nspatio-temporal structured data reflecting real-world phenomena. A stunning\ncharacteristic is that the dynamical system is not only driven by some physics\nlaws but also impacted by the localized factor in spatial and temporal regions.\nOne of the major challenges is to infer the underlying causes, which generate\nthe perceived data stream and propagate the involved causal dynamics through\nthe distributed observing units. Another challenge is that the success of\nmachine learning based predictive models requires massive annotated data for\nmodel training. However, the acquisition of high-quality annotated data is\nobjectively manual and tedious as it needs a considerable amount of human\nintervention, making it infeasible in fields that require high levels of\nexpertise. To tackle these challenges, we advocate a spatio-temporal\nphysics-coupled neural networks (ST-PCNN) model to learn the underlying physics\nof the dynamical system and further couple the learned physics to assist the\nlearning of the recurring dynamics. To deal with data-acquisition constraints,\nan active learning mechanism with Kriging for actively acquiring the most\ninformative data is proposed for ST-PCNN training in a partially observable\nenvironment. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets exhibit\nthat the proposed ST-PCNN with active learning converges to near optimal\naccuracy with substantially fewer instances.",

However,\nestimating the optimal model for any given number of components is an NP-hard\nproblem, and estimating the number of components is in some respects an even\nharder problem. Findings: In R, a popular package called mclust addresses both\nof these problems. However, Python has lacked such a package. We therefore\nintroduce AutoGMM, a Python algorithm for automatic Gaussian mixture modeling,\nand its hierarchical version, HGMM. AutoGMM builds upon scikit-learn's\nAgglomerativeClustering and GaussianMixture classes, with certain modifications\nto make the results more stable. Empirically, on several different\napplications, AutoGMM performs approximately as well as mclust, and sometimes\nbetter.

          "description": "Over-parameterized deep networks trained using gradient-based optimizers are\na popular choice for solving classification and ranking problems. Without\nappropriately tuned $\\ell_2$ regularization or weight decay, such networks have\nthe tendency to make output scores (logits) and network weights large, causing\ntraining loss to become too small and the network to lose its adaptivity\n(ability to move around) in the parameter space. Although regularization is\ntypically understood from an overfitting perspective, we highlight its role in\nmaking the network more adaptive and enabling it to escape more easily from\nweights that generalize poorly. To provide such a capability, we propose a\nmethod called Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization (LAWN), that can be\nstacked onto any gradient-based optimizer. LAWN controls the logits by\nconstraining the weight norms of layers in the final homogeneous sub-network.\nEmpirically, we show that the resulting LAWN variant of the optimizer makes a\ndeep network more adaptive to finding minimas with superior generalization\nperformance on large-scale image classification and recommender systems. While\nLAWN is particularly impressive in improving Adam, it greatly improves all\noptimizers when used with large batch sizes",

The functional perspective\ndistinguishes between a policy's functional representation (what are its\nsufficient statistics) and its parameterization (how are these statistics\nrepresented) and naturally results in computationally efficient off-policy\nupdates. For simple policy parameterizations, the FMA-PG framework ensures that\nthe optimal policy is a fixed point of the updates. It also allows us to handle\ncomplex policy parameterizations (e.g., neural networks) while guaranteeing\npolicy improvement. Our framework unifies several PG methods and opens the way\nfor designing sample-efficient variants of existing methods. Moreover, it\nrecovers important implementation heuristics (e.g., using forward vs reverse KL\ndivergence) in a principled way. With a softmax functional representation,\nFMA-PG results in a variant of TRPO with additional desirable properties.

We investigate the effectiveness of our method,\nwhich is based on the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm, in the\nmedical scenario, where the use of sparse labeling and few-shot can alleviate\nthe cost of producing new annotated datasets. Our method uses sparse labels in\nthe meta-training and dense labels in the meta-test, thus making the model\nlearn to predict dense labels from sparse ones. We conducted experiments with\nfour Chest X-Ray datasets to evaluate two types of annotations (grid and\npoints). The results show that our method is the most suitable when the target\ndomain highly differs from source domains, achieving Jaccard scores comparable\nto dense labels, using less than 2% of the pixels of an image with labels in\nfew-shot scenarios.",

A\nsearch ranking system typically orders the results by independent\nquery-document scores to produce a slate of search results. However, such\nunilateral scoring methods may fail to capture inter-document dependencies that\nusers are sensitive to, thus producing a sub-optimal slate.

Hence, solutions to the slate optimization problem must consider the\noptimal selection and order of the documents, along with adherence to\nslate-level distributional criteria.

We introduce conditional sequential slate optimization\n(CSSO), which jointly learns to optimize for traditional ranking metrics as\nwell as prescribed distribution criteria of documents within the slate. The\nproposed method can be applied to practical real world problems such as\nenforcing diversity in e-commerce search results, mitigating bias in top\nresults and personalization of results.

          "description": "Recently, some studies have shown that text classification tasks are\nvulnerable to poisoning and evasion attacks. However, little work has\ninvestigated attacks against decision making algorithms that use text\nembeddings, and their output is a ranking. In this paper, we focus on ranking\nalgorithms for recruitment process, that employ text embeddings for ranking\napplicants resumes when compared to a job description. We demonstrate both\nwhite box and black box attacks that identify text items, that based on their\nlocation in embedding space, have significant contribution in increasing the\nsimilarity score between a resume and a job description. The adversary then\nuses these text items to improve the ranking of their resume among others. We\ntested recruitment algorithms that use the similarity scores obtained from\nUniversal Sentence Encoder (USE) and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency\n(TF IDF) vectors. Our results show that in both adversarial settings, on\naverage the attacker is successful. We also found that attacks against TF IDF\nis more successful compared to USE.",

          "description": "To ensure robust and reliable classification results, OoD\n(out-of-distribution) indicators based on deep generative models are proposed\nrecently and are shown to work well on small datasets. In this paper, we\nconduct the first large collection of benchmarks (containing 92 dataset pairs,\nwhich is 1 order of magnitude larger than previous ones) for existing OoD\nindicators and observe that none perform well. We thus advocate that a large\ncollection of benchmarks is mandatory for evaluating OoD indicators. We propose\na novel theoretical framework, DOI, for divergence-based Out-of-Distribution\nindicators (instead of traditional likelihood-based) in deep generative models.\nFollowing this framework, we further propose a simple and effective OoD\ndetection algorithm: Single-shot Fine-tune. It significantly outperforms past\nworks by 5~8 in AUROC, and its performance is close to optimal. In recent, the\nlikelihood criterion is shown to be ineffective in detecting OoD. Single-shot\nFine-tune proposes a novel fine-tune criterion to detect OoD, by whether the\nlikelihood of the testing sample is improved after fine-tuning a well-trained\nmodel on it. Fine-tune criterion is a clear and easy-following criterion, which\nwill lead the OoD domain into a new stage.",

The main benefit of DARTS is the effectiveness achieved through\nthe weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture\nsearch. In this work, we investigate DARTS in a systematic case study of\ninverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a\ncontrolled manner. Although we demonstrate that the success of DARTS can be\nextended from image classification to reconstruction, our experiments yield\nthree fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DARTS-based methods: First,\nthe results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final\nperformance is highly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And\nthird, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training\ndoes not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. Thus, we\nconclude the necessity to 1) report the results of any DARTS-based methods from\nseveral runs along with its underlying performance statistics, 2) show the\ncorrelation of the training and final architecture performance, and 3)\ncarefully consider if the computational efficiency of DARTS outweighs the costs\nof hyperparameter optimization and multiple runs.",

We propose an\nalgorithm named confident Monte Carlo least square policy iteration (Confident\nMC-LSPI) for this setting. Under the assumption that the Q-functions of all\ndeterministic policies are linear in known features of the state-action pairs,\nwe show that our algorithm has polynomial query and computational complexities\nin the dimension of the features, the effective planning horizon and the\ntargeted sub-optimality, while these complexities are independent of the size\nof the state space.

The key of\nrecommender systems is to predict how likely users will interact with items\nbased on their historical online behaviors, e.g., clicks, add-to-cart,\npurchases, etc. To exploit these user-item interactions, there are increasing\nefforts on considering the user-item interactions as a user-item bipartite\ngraph and then performing information propagation in the graph via Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs). Given the power of GNNs in graph representation learning,\nthese GNN-based recommendation methods have remarkably boosted the\nrecommendation performance. Despite their success, most existing GNN-based\nrecommender systems overlook the existence of interactions caused by unreliable\nbehaviors (e.g., random/bait clicks) and uniformly treat all the interactions,\nwhich can lead to sub-optimal and unstable performance. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the drawbacks (e.g., non-adaptive propagation and non-robustness)\nof existing GNN-based recommendation methods. To address these drawbacks, we\npropose the Graph Trend Networks for recommendations (GTN) with principled\ndesigns that can capture the adaptive reliability of the interactions.\nComprehensive experiments and ablation studies are presented to verify and\nunderstand the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

          "description": "For the problem of task-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL), an agent first\ncollects samples from an unknown environment without the supervision of reward\nsignals, then is revealed with a reward and is asked to compute a corresponding\nnear-optimal policy. Existing approaches mainly concern the worst-case\nscenarios, in which no structural information of the reward/transition-dynamics\nis utilized. Therefore the best sample upper bound is\n$\\propto\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\epsilon^2)$, where $\\epsilon>0$ is the\ntarget accuracy of the obtained policy, and can be overly pessimistic. To\ntackle this issue, we provide an efficient algorithm that utilizes a gap\nparameter, $\\rho>0$, to reduce the amount of exploration. In particular, for an\nunknown finite-horizon Markov decision process, the algorithm takes only\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} (1/\\epsilon \\cdot (H^3SA / \\rho + H^4 S^2 A) )$\nepisodes of exploration, and is able to obtain an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy for\na post-revealed reward with sub-optimality gap at least $\\rho$, where $S$ is\nthe number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $H$ is the length of\nthe horizon, obtaining a nearly \\emph{quadratic saving} in terms of $\\epsilon$.\nWe show that, information-theoretically, this bound is nearly tight for $\\rho <\n\\Theta(1/(HS))$ and $H>1$. We further show that\n$\\propto\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1)$ sample bound is possible for $H=1$ (i.e.,\nmulti-armed bandit) or with a sampling simulator, establishing a stark\nseparation between those settings and the RL setting.",

In this paper, we consider an important dynamic car-hailing\nproblem, namely \\textit{maximum revenue vehicle dispatching} (MRVD), in which\nrider requests dynamically arrive and drivers need to serve as many riders as\npossible such that the entire revenue of the platform is maximized. We prove\nthat the MRVD problem is NP-hard and intractable. In addition, the dynamic\ncar-hailing platforms have no information of the future riders, which makes the\nproblem even harder. To handle the MRVD problem, we propose a queueing-based\nvehicle dispatching framework, which first uses existing machine learning\nalgorithms to predict the future vehicle demand of each region, then estimates\nthe idle time periods of drivers through a queueing model for each region. With\nthe information of the predicted vehicle demands and estimated idle time\nperiods of drivers, we propose two batch-based vehicle dispatching algorithms\nto efficiently assign suitable drivers to riders such that the expected overall\nrevenue of the platform is maximized during each batch processing.

          "description": "In the past decade, contextual bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms\nhave been successfully used in various interactive learning systems such as\nonline advertising, recommender systems, and dynamic pricing. However, they\nhave yet to be widely adopted in high-stakes application domains, such as\nhealthcare. One reason may be that existing approaches assume that the\nunderlying mechanisms are static in the sense that they do not change over\ndifferent environments. In many real world systems, however, the mechanisms are\nsubject to shifts across environments which may invalidate the static\nenvironment assumption. In this paper, we tackle the problem of environmental\nshifts under the framework of offline contextual bandits. We view the\nenvironmental shift problem through the lens of causality and propose\nmulti-environment contextual bandits that allow for changes in the underlying\nmechanisms. We adopt the concept of invariance from the causality literature\nand introduce the notion of policy invariance.

          "description": "Persistence diagrams have been widely used to quantify the underlying\nfeatures of filtered topological spaces in data visualization. In many\napplications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however,\ncomputing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost.\nIn this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a\nbinary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast\ncomputation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning\nprocess. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into\nbinary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training\nof this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from\nsynthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is\ndirectly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the\nmodel. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better\nmaintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other\nvectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to\nthe problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of\nour approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of\nour approach on a dataset with 10k persistence diagrams, which is not possible\nwith current techniques. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that\nour method is significantly faster with the potential of less memory usage,\nwhile retaining comparable or better quality comparisons.",

A control\nvariate is applied by subtracting a baseline function from the state-action\nvalue estimates. Then the variance-reduced policy gradient presumably leads to\nhigher learning efficiency. Recent research on control variates with deep\nneural net policies mainly focuses on scalar-valued baseline functions. The\neffect of vector-valued baselines is under-explored. This paper investigates\nvariance reduction with coordinate-wise and layer-wise control variates\nconstructed from vector-valued baselines for neural net policies. We present\nexperimental evidence suggesting that lower variance can be obtained with such\nbaselines than with the conventional scalar-valued baseline. We demonstrate how\nto equip the popular Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with these\nnew control variates.

          "description": "Medical images, especially volumetric images, are of high resolution and\noften exceed the capacity of standard desktop GPUs. As a result, most deep\nlearning-based medical image analysis tasks require the input images to be\ndownsampled, often substantially, before these can be fed to a neural network.\nHowever, downsampling can lead to a loss of image quality, which is undesirable\nespecially in reconstruction tasks, where the fine geometric details need to be\npreserved. In this paper, we propose that high-resolution images can be\nreconstructed in a coarse-to-fine fashion, where a deep learning algorithm is\nonly responsible for generating a coarse representation of the image, which\nconsumes moderate GPU memory. For producing the high-resolution outcome, we\npropose two novel methods: learned voxel rearrangement of the coarse output and\nhierarchical image synthesis. Compared to the coarse output, the\nhigh-resolution counterpart allows for smooth surface triangulation, which can\nbe 3D-printed in the highest possible quality.

The so-called input forgetting property is identified as the\nkey hypothesis that guarantees the existence and uniqueness (up to system\nisomorphisms) of canonical realizations for causal and time-invariant\ninput/output systems with semi-infinite inputs.

However, the accuracy\nof these approaches heavily depends on their used bug reports. A significant\nnumber of bug reports contain only plain natural language texts. According to\nexisting studies, IR-based approaches cannot perform well when they use these\nbug reports as search queries. On the other hand, there is a piece of recent\nevidence that suggests that even these natural language-only reports contain\nenough good keywords that could help localize the bugs successfully. On one\nhand, these findings suggest that natural language-only bug reports might be a\nsufficient source for good query keywords. On the other hand, they cast serious\ndoubt on the query selection practices in the IR-based bug localization. In\nthis article, we attempted to clear the sky on this aspect by conducting an\nin-depth empirical study that critically examines the state-of-the-art query\nselection practices in IR-based bug localization. In particular, we use a\ndataset of 2,320 bug reports, employ ten existing approaches from the\nliterature, exploit the Genetic Algorithm-based approach to construct optimal,\nnear-optimal search queries from these bug reports, and then answer three\nresearch questions. We confirmed that the state-of-the-art query construction\napproaches are indeed not sufficient for constructing appropriate queries (for\nbug localization) from certain natural language-only bug reports although they\ncontain such queries. We also demonstrate that optimal queries and non-optimal\nqueries chosen from bug report texts are significantly different in terms of\nseveral keyword characteristics, which has led us to actionable insights.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate 27%--34% improvement in the performance of\nnon-optimal queries through the application of our actionable insights to them.",

The problem of tree-based\naggregation that we consider in this paper asks which of these tree-defined\nsubgroups of leaves should really be treated as a single entity and which of\nthese entities should be distinguished from each other.\n\nWe introduce the \"false split rate\", an error measure that describes the\ndegree to which subgroups have been split when they should not have been. We\nthen propose a multiple hypothesis testing algorithm for tree-based\naggregation, which we prove controls this error measure. We focus on two main\nexamples of tree-based aggregation, one which involves aggregating means and\nthe other which involves aggregating regression coefficients. We apply this\nmethodology to aggregate stocks based on their volatility and to aggregate\nneighborhoods of New York City based on taxi fares.",

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated superior capability\nof tackling graph analytical problems in various applications. Nevertheless,\nwith the wide-spreading practice of GNNs in high-stake decision-making\nprocesses, there is an increasing societal concern that GNNs could make\ndiscriminatory decisions that may be illegal towards certain demographic\ngroups. Although some explorations have been made towards developing fair GNNs,\nexisting approaches are tailored for a specific GNN model. However, in\npractical scenarios, myriads of GNN variants have been proposed for different\ntasks, and it is costly to train and fine-tune existing debiasing models for\ndifferent GNNs. Also, bias in a trained model could originate from training\ndata, while how to mitigate bias in the graph data is usually overlooked. In\nthis work, different from existing work, we first propose novel definitions and\nmetrics to measure the bias in an attributed network, which leads to the\noptimization objective to mitigate bias. Based on the optimization objective,\nwe develop a framework named EDITS to mitigate the bias in attributed networks\nwhile preserving useful information. EDITS works in a model-agnostic manner,\nwhich means that it is independent of the specific GNNs applied for downstream\ntasks. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the validity of the proposed bias metrics and the superiority of\nEDITS on both bias mitigation and utility maintenance.

          "description": "Cardinality estimation is a fundamental but long unresolved problem in query\noptimization. Recently, multiple papers from different research groups\nconsistently report that learned models have the potential to replace existing\ncardinality estimators. In this paper, we ask a forward-thinking question: Are\nwe ready to deploy these learned cardinality models in production? Our study\nconsists of three main parts. Firstly, we focus on the static environment\n(i.e., no data updates) and compare five new learned methods with eight\ntraditional methods on four real-world datasets under a unified workload\nsetting. The results show that learned models are indeed more accurate than\ntraditional methods, but they often suffer from high training and inference\ncosts. Secondly, we explore whether these learned models are ready for dynamic\nenvironments (i.e., frequent data updates). We find that they cannot catch up\nwith fast data up-dates and return large errors for different reasons. For less\nfrequent updates, they can perform better but there is no clear winner among\nthemselves. Thirdly, we take a deeper look into learned models and explore when\nthey may go wrong. Our results show that the performance of learned methods can\nbe greatly affected by the changes in correlation, skewness, or domain size.\nMore importantly, their behaviors are much harder to interpret and often\nunpredictable. Based on these findings, we identify two promising research\ndirections (control the cost of learned models and make learned models\ntrustworthy) and suggest a number of research opportunities. We hope that our\nstudy can guide researchers and practitioners to work together to eventually\npush learned cardinality estimators into real database systems.",

Based on that analogy, we propose a new class\nof methods exploiting any plausible modular bound.

          "description": "Algorithmic fairness has aroused considerable interests in data mining and\nmachine learning communities recently. So far the existing research has been\nmostly focusing on the development of quantitative metrics to measure algorithm\ndisparities across different protected groups, and approaches for adjusting the\nalgorithm output to reduce such disparities. In this paper, we propose to study\nthe problem of identification of the source of model disparities. Unlike\nexisting interpretation methods which typically learn feature importance, we\nconsider the causal relationships among feature variables and propose a novel\nframework to decompose the disparity into the sum of contributions from\nfairness-aware causal paths, which are paths linking the sensitive attribute\nand the final predictions, on the graph. We also consider the scenario when the\ndirections on certain edges within those paths cannot be determined. Our\nframework is also model agnostic and applicable to a variety of quantitative\ndisparity measures. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data\nsets are provided to show that our method can provide precise and comprehensive\nexplanations to the model disparities.",

          "description": "Given a textual phrase and an image, the visual grounding problem is defined\nas the task of locating the content of the image referenced by the sentence. It\nis a challenging task that has several real-world applications in\nhuman-computer interaction, image-text reference resolution, and video-text\nreference resolution. In the last years, several works have addressed this\nproblem with heavy and complex models that try to capture visual-textual\ndependencies better than before. These models are typically constituted by two\nmain components that focus on how to learn useful multi-modal features for\ngrounding and how to improve the predicted bounding box of the visual mention,\nrespectively. Finding the right learning balance between these two sub-tasks is\nnot easy, and the current models are not necessarily optimal with respect to\nthis issue. In this work, we propose a model that, although using a simple\nmulti-modal feature fusion component, is able to achieve a higher accuracy than\nstate-of-the-art models thanks to the adoption of a more effective loss\nfunction, based on the classes probabilities, that reach, in the considered\ndatasets, a better learning balance between the two sub-tasks mentioned above.",

          "description": "Choosing the optimizer is considered to be among the most crucial design\ndecisions in deep learning, and it is not an easy one. The growing literature\nnow lists hundreds of optimization methods. In the absence of clear theoretical\nguidance and conclusive empirical evidence, the decision is often made based on\nanecdotes. In this work, we aim to replace these anecdotes, if not with a\nconclusive ranking, then at least with evidence-backed heuristics. To do so, we\nperform an extensive, standardized benchmark of fifteen particularly popular\ndeep learning optimizers while giving a concise overview of the wide range of\npossible choices. Analyzing more than $50,000$ individual runs, we contribute\nthe following three points: (i) Optimizer performance varies greatly across\ntasks. (ii) We observe that evaluating multiple optimizers with default\nparameters works approximately as well as tuning the hyperparameters of a\nsingle, fixed optimizer. (iii) While we cannot discern an optimization method\nclearly dominating across all tested tasks, we identify a significantly reduced\nsubset of specific optimizers and parameter choices that generally lead to\ncompetitive results in our experiments: Adam remains a strong contender, with\nnewer methods failing to significantly and consistently outperform it. Our\nopen-sourced results are available as challenging and well-tuned baselines for\nmore meaningful evaluations of novel optimization methods without requiring any\nfurther computational efforts.",

          "description": "Recent progress in scientific visualization has expanded the scope of\nvisualization from being merely a way of presentation to an analysis and\ndiscovery tool. A given visualization result is usually generated by applying a\nseries of transformations or filters to the underlying data. Nowadays, such\nfilters use deterministic algorithms to process the data. In this work, we aim\nat extending this methodology towards data-driven filters, thus filters that\nexpose the abilities of pre-trained machine learning models to the\nvisualization system. The use of such data-driven filters is of particular\ninterest in fields like segmentation, classification, etc., where machine\nlearning models regularly outperform existing algorithmic approaches. To\nshowcase this idea, we couple Paraview, the well-known flow visualization tool,\nwith PyTorch, a deep learning framework. Paraview is extended by plugins that\nallow users to load pre-trained models of their choice in the form of newly\ndeveloped filters. The filters transform the input data by feeding it into the\nmodel and then provide the model's output as input to the remaining\nvisualization pipeline. A series of simplistic use cases for segmentation and\nclassification on image and fluid data is presented to showcase the technical\napplicability of such data-driven transformations in Paraview for future\ncomplex analysis tasks.",

          "description": "Emphatic Temporal Difference (TD) methods are a class of off-policy\nReinforcement Learning (RL) methods involving the use of followon traces.\nDespite the theoretical success of emphatic TD methods in addressing the\nnotorious deadly triad (Sutton and Barto, 2018) of off-policy RL, there are\nstill three open problems. First, the motivation for emphatic TD methods\nproposed by Sutton et al. (2016) does not align with the convergence analysis\nof Yu (2015). Namely, a quantity used by Sutton et al. (2016) that is expected\nto be essential for the convergence of emphatic TD methods is not used in the\nactual convergence analysis of Yu (2015). Second, followon traces typically\nsuffer from large variance, making them hard to use in practice. Third, despite\nthe seminal work of Yu (2015) confirming the asymptotic convergence of some\nemphatic TD methods for prediction problems, there is still no finite sample\nanalysis for any emphatic TD method for prediction, much less control. In this\npaper, we address those three open problems simultaneously via using truncated\nfollowon traces in emphatic TD methods. Unlike the original followon traces,\nwhich depend on all previous history, truncated followon traces depend on only\nfinite history, reducing variance and enabling the finite sample analysis of\nour proposed emphatic TD methods for both prediction and control.",

In both cases,\nreinforcement learning techniques are used to optimize an added force that\nminimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the conditioned trajectory\nensemble and a driven one. Under the optimized added force, the system evolves\nthe rare fluctuation as a typical one, affording a variational estimate of its\nlikelihood in the original trajectory ensemble.

          "description": "Traditional industrial recommenders are usually trained on a single business\ndomain and then serve for this domain. However, in large commercial platforms,\nit is often the case that the recommenders need to make click-through rate\n(CTR) predictions for multiple business domains. Different domains have\noverlapping user groups and items. Thus, there exist commonalities. Since the\nspecific user groups have disparity and the user behaviors may change in\nvarious business domains, there also have distinctions. The distinctions result\nin domain-specific data distributions, making it hard for a single shared model\nto work well on all domains. To learn an effective and efficient CTR model to\nhandle multiple domains simultaneously, we present Star Topology Adaptive\nRecommender (STAR). Concretely, STAR has the star topology, which consists of\nthe shared centered parameters and domain-specific parameters. The shared\nparameters are applied to learn commonalities of all domains, and the\ndomain-specific parameters capture domain distinction for more refined\nprediction. Given requests from different business domains, STAR can adapt its\nparameters conditioned on the domain characteristics. The experimental result\nfrom production data validates the superiority of the proposed STAR model.\nSince 2020, STAR has been deployed in the display advertising system of\nAlibaba, obtaining averaging 8.0% improvement on CTR and 6.0% on RPM (Revenue\nPer Mille).",

Our\ngenerative ParVI (GPVI) approach maintains the asymptotic performance of ParVI\nmethods while offering the flexibility of a generative sampler. Through\ncarefully constructed experiments, we show that GPVI outperforms previous\ngenerative ParVI methods such as amortized SVGD, and is competitive with ParVI\nas well as gold-standard approaches like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for fitting\nboth exactly known and intractable target distributions.",

          "description": "Neural network (NN) models are increasingly used in scientific simulations,\nAI, and other high performance computing (HPC) fields to extract knowledge from\ndatasets. Each dataset requires tailored NN model architecture, but designing\nstructures by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Neural\narchitecture search (NAS) automates the design of NN architectures. NAS\nattempts to find well-performing NN models for specialized datsets, where\nperformance is measured by key metrics that capture the NN capabilities (e.g.,\naccuracy of classification of samples in a dataset). Existing NAS methods are\nresource intensive, especially when searching for highly accurate models for\nlarger and larger datasets.\n\nTo address this problem, we propose a performance estimation strategy that\nreduces the resources for training NNs and increases NAS throughput without\njeopardizing accuracy. We implement our strategy via an engine called PEng4NN\nthat plugs into existing NAS methods; in doing so, PEng4NN predicts the final\naccuracy of NNs early in the training process, informs the NAS of NN\nperformance, and thus enables the NAS to terminate training NNs early. We\nassess our engine on three diverse datasets (i.e., CIFAR-100, Fashion MNIST,\nand SVHN). By reducing the training epochs needed, our engine achieves\nsubstantial throughput gain; on average, our engine saves 61% to 82% of\ntraining epochs, increasing throughput by a factor of 2.5 to 5 compared to a\nstate-of-the-art NAS method. We achieve this gain without compromising\naccuracy, as we demonstrate with two key outcomes. First, across all our tests,\nbetween 74% and 97% of the ground truth best models lie in our set of predicted\nbest models. Second, the accuracy distributions of the ground truth best models\nand our predicted best models are comparable, with the mean accuracy values\ndiffering by at most .7 percentage points across all tests.",

Our contributions are twofold: 1) We develop a physically valid fog\nsimulation method that is applicable to any LiDAR dataset. This unleashes the\nacquisition of large-scale foggy training data at no extra cost. These\npartially synthetic data can be used to improve the robustness of several\nperception methods, such as 3D object detection and tracking or simultaneous\nlocalization and mapping, on real foggy data. 2) Through extensive experiments\nwith several state-of-the-art detection approaches, we show that our fog\nsimulation can be leveraged to significantly improve the performance for 3D\nobject detection in the presence of fog.

A challenge in improving treatment is resistance\nin genetically unstable cells. The purpose of this study is to evaluate\nunsupervised machine learning on classifying treatment-resistant phenotypes in\nheterogeneous tumors through analysis of single cell RNA sequencing(scRNAseq)\ndata with a pipeline and evaluation metrics. scRNAseq quantifies mRNA in cells\nand characterizes cell phenotypes. One scRNAseq dataset was analyzed\n(tumor/non-tumor cells of different molecular subtypes and patient\nidentifications). The pipeline consisted of data filtering, dimensionality\nreduction with Principal Component Analysis, projection with Uniform Manifold\nApproximation and Projection, clustering with nine approaches (Ward, BIRCH,\nGaussian Mixture Model, DBSCAN, Spectral, Affinity Propagation, Agglomerative\nClustering, Mean Shift, and K-Means), and evaluation. Seven models divided\ntumor versus non-tumor cells and molecular subtype while six models classified\ndifferent patient identification (13 of which were presented in the dataset);\nK-Means, Ward, and BIRCH often ranked highest with ~80% accuracy on the tumor\nversus non-tumor task and ~60% for molecular subtype and patient ID. An\noptimized classification pipeline using K-Means, Ward, and BIRCH models was\nevaluated to be most effective for further analysis. In clinical research where\nthere is currently no standard protocol for scRNAseq analysis, clusters\ngenerated from this pipeline can be used to understand cancer cell behavior and\nmalignant growth, directly affecting the success of treatment.",

          "description": "The large and still increasing popularity of deep learning clashes with a\nmajor limit of neural network architectures, that consists in their lack of\ncapability in providing human-understandable motivations of their decisions. In\nsituations in which the machine is expected to support the decision of human\nexperts, providing a comprehensible explanation is a feature of crucial\nimportance. The language used to communicate the explanations must be formal\nenough to be implementable in a machine and friendly enough to be\nunderstandable by a wide audience. In this paper, we propose a general approach\nto Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the case of neural architectures,\nshowing how a mindful design of the networks leads to a family of interpretable\ndeep learning models called Logic Explained Networks (LENs). LENs only require\ntheir inputs to be human-understandable predicates, and they provide\nexplanations in terms of simple First-Order Logic (FOL) formulas involving such\npredicates. LENs are general enough to cover a large number of scenarios.\nAmongst them, we consider the case in which LENs are directly used as special\nclassifiers with the capability of being explainable, or when they act as\nadditional networks with the role of creating the conditions for making a\nblack-box classifier explainable by FOL formulas. Despite supervised learning\nproblems are mostly emphasized, we also show that LENs can learn and provide\nexplanations in unsupervised learning settings. Experimental results on several\ndatasets and tasks show that LENs may yield better classifications than\nestablished white-box models, such as decision trees and Bayesian rule lists,\nwhile providing more compact and meaningful explanations.",

However, this progress could not\nshow any promises for fine-grained tasks such as Head Pose estimation. In this\narticle, we have tried to answer a question: How SSL can be used for Head Pose\nestimation? In general, there are two main approaches to use SSL: 1. Using\npre-trained weights which can be done via weights pre-training on ImageNet or\nvia SSL tasks. 2. Leveraging SSL as an auxiliary co-training task besides of\nSupervised Learning (SL) tasks at the same time. In this study, modified\nversions of jigsaw puzzling and rotation as SSL pre-text tasks are used and the\nbest architecture for our proposed Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL) is found.\nFinally, the HopeNet method as a baseline is selected and the impact of SSL\npre-training and ImageNet pre-training on both HMTL and SL are compared. The\nerror rate reduced by the HTML method up to 11% compare to the SL. Moreover,\nHMTL method showed that it was good with all kinds of initial weights: random,\nImageNet and SSL pre-training weights. Also, it was observed, when puzzled\nimages are used for SL alone, the average error rate placed between SL and HMTL\nwhich showed the importance of local spatial features compare to global spatial\nfeatures.",

          "description": "In the era of intelligent transportation, driver behavior profiling has\nbecome a beneficial technology as it provides knowledge regarding the driver's\naggressiveness. Previous approaches achieved promising driver behavior\nprofiling performance through establishing statistical heuristics rules or\nsupervised learning-based models. Still, there exist limits that the\npractitioner should prepare a labeled dataset, and prior approaches could not\nclassify aggressive behaviors which are not known a priori. In pursuit of\nimproving the aforementioned drawbacks, we propose a novel approach to driver\nbehavior profiling leveraging an unsupervised learning paradigm. First, we cast\nthe driver behavior profiling problem as anomaly detection. Second, we\nestablished recurrent neural networks that predict the next feature vector\ngiven a sequence of feature vectors. We trained the model with normal driver\ndata only. As a result, our model yields high regression error given a sequence\nof aggressive driver behavior and low error given at a sequence of normal\ndriver behavior. We figured this difference of error between normal and\naggressive driver behavior can be an adequate flag for driver behavior\nprofiling and accomplished a precise performance in experiments. Lastly, we\nfurther analyzed the optimal level of sequence length for identifying each\naggressive driver behavior. We expect the proposed approach to be a useful\nbaseline for unsupervised driver behavior profiling and contribute to the\nefficient, intelligent transportation ecosystem.",

          "description": "Adversarial patch attack against image classification deep neural networks\n(DNNs), in which the attacker can inject arbitrary distortions within a bounded\nregion of an image, is able to generate adversarial perturbations that are\nrobust (i.e., remain adversarial in physical world) and universal (i.e., remain\nadversarial on any input). It is thus important to detect and mitigate such\nattack to ensure the security of DNNs.\n\nThis work proposes Jujutsu, a technique to detect and mitigate robust and\nuniversal adversarial patch attack. Jujutsu leverages the universal property of\nthe patch attack for detection. It uses explainable AI technique to identify\nsuspicious features that are potentially malicious, and verify their\nmaliciousness by transplanting the suspicious features to new images. An\nadversarial patch continues to exhibit the malicious behavior on the new images\nand thus can be detected based on prediction consistency. Jujutsu leverages the\nlocalized nature of the patch attack for mitigation, by randomly masking the\nsuspicious features to \"remove\" adversarial perturbations. However, the network\nmight fail to classify the images as some of the contents are removed (masked).\nTherefore, Jujutsu uses image inpainting for synthesizing alternative contents\nfrom the pixels that are masked, which can reconstruct the \"clean\" image for\ncorrect prediction. We evaluate Jujutsu on five DNNs on two datasets, and show\nthat Jujutsu achieves superior performance and significantly outperforms\nexisting techniques. Jujutsu can further defend against various variants of the\nbasic attack, including 1) physical-world attack; 2) attacks that target\ndiverse classes; 3) attacks that use patches in different shapes and 4)\nadaptive attacks.",

          "description": "Learning to rank systems has become an important aspect of our daily life.\nHowever, the implicit user feedback that is used to train many learning to rank\nmodels is usually noisy and suffered from user bias (i.e., position bias).\nThus, obtaining an unbiased model using biased feedback has become an important\nresearch field for IR. Existing studies on unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) can\nbe generalized into two families-algorithms that attain unbiasedness with\nlogged data, offline learning, and algorithms that achieve unbiasedness by\nestimating unbiased parameters with real-time user interactions, namely online\nlearning. While there exist many algorithms from both families, there lacks a\nunified way to compare and benchmark them. As a result, it can be challenging\nfor researchers to choose the right technique for their problems or for people\nwho are new to the field to learn and understand existing algorithms. To solve\nthis problem, we introduced ULTRA, which is a flexible, extensible, and easily\nconfigure ULTR toolbox. Its key features include support for multiple ULTR\nalgorithms with configurable hyperparameters, a variety of built-in click\nmodels that can be used separately to simulate clicks, different ranking model\narchitecture and evaluation metrics, and simple learning to rank pipeline\ncreation. In this paper, we discuss the general framework of ULTR, briefly\ndescribe the algorithms in ULTRA, detailed the structure, and pipeline of the\ntoolbox. We experimented on all the algorithms supported by ultra and showed\nthat the toolbox performance is reasonable.

The problem of mining of frequent itemsets can be\nexplained on the following example: customers goes in a store put into theirs\nbaskets some goods; the owner of the store collects the baskets and wants to\nknow the set of goods that are bought together in at least p% of the baskets.\nCurrently, the sequential algorithms for mining of frequent itemsets are quite\ngood in the means of performance.

          "description": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) watermarking is a method for provenance\nverification of DNN models. Watermarking should be robust against watermark\nremoval attacks that derive a surrogate model that evades provenance\nverification. Many watermarking schemes that claim robustness have been\nproposed, but their robustness is only validated in isolation against a\nrelatively small set of attacks. There is no systematic, empirical evaluation\nof these claims against a common, comprehensive set of removal attacks. This\nuncertainty about a watermarking scheme's robustness causes difficulty to trust\ntheir deployment in practice. In this paper, we evaluate whether recently\nproposed watermarking schemes that claim robustness are robust against a large\nset of removal attacks. We survey methods from the literature that (i) are\nknown removal attacks, (ii) derive surrogate models but have not been evaluated\nas removal attacks, and (iii) novel removal attacks. Weight shifting and smooth\nretraining are novel removal attacks adapted to the DNN watermarking schemes\nsurveyed in this paper. We propose taxonomies for watermarking schemes and\nremoval attacks. Our empirical evaluation includes an ablation study over sets\nof parameters for each attack and watermarking scheme on the CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet datasets. Surprisingly, none of the surveyed watermarking schemes is\nrobust in practice. We find that schemes fail to withstand adaptive attacks and\nknown methods for deriving surrogate models that have not been evaluated as\nremoval attacks. This points to intrinsic flaws in how robustness is currently\nevaluated. We show that watermarking schemes need to be evaluated against a\nmore extensive set of removal attacks with a more realistic adversary model.\nOur source code and a complete dataset of evaluation results are publicly\navailable, which allows to independently verify our conclusions.",

          "description": "Universal adversarial attacks, which hinder most deep neural network (DNN)\ntasks using only a small single perturbation called a universal adversarial\nperturbation (UAP), is a realistic security threat to the practical application\nof a DNN. In particular, such attacks cause serious problems in medical\nimaging. Given that computer-based systems are generally operated under a\nblack-box condition in which only queries on inputs are allowed and outputs are\naccessible, the impact of UAPs seems to be limited because well-used algorithms\nfor generating UAPs are limited to a white-box condition in which adversaries\ncan access the model weights and loss gradients. Nevertheless, we demonstrate\nthat UAPs are easily generatable using a relatively small dataset under\nblack-box conditions. In particular, we propose a method for generating UAPs\nusing a simple hill-climbing search based only on DNN outputs and demonstrate\nthe validity of the proposed method using representative DNN-based medical\nimage classifications. Black-box UAPs can be used to conduct both non-targeted\nand targeted attacks. Overall, the black-box UAPs showed high attack success\nrates (40% to 90%), although some of them had relatively low success rates\nbecause the method only utilizes limited information to generate UAPs. The\nvulnerability of black-box UAPs was observed in several model architectures.\nThe results indicate that adversaries can also generate UAPs through a simple\nprocedure under the black-box condition to foil or control DNN-based medical\nimage diagnoses, and that UAPs are a more realistic security threat.",

          "description": "State of the art (SOTA) few-shot learning (FSL) methods suffer significant\nperformance drop in the presence of domain differences between source and\ntarget datasets. The strong discrimination ability on the source dataset does\nnot necessarily translate to high classification accuracy on the target\ndataset. In this work, we address this cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL)\nproblem by boosting the generalization capability of the model. Specifically,\nwe teach the model to capture broader variations of the feature distributions\nwith a novel noise-enhanced supervised autoencoder (NSAE). NSAE trains the\nmodel by jointly reconstructing inputs and predicting the labels of inputs as\nwell as their reconstructed pairs. Theoretical analysis based on intra-class\ncorrelation (ICC) shows that the feature embeddings learned from NSAE have\nstronger discrimination and generalization abilities in the target domain. We\nalso take advantage of NSAE structure and propose a two-step fine-tuning\nprocedure that achieves better adaption and improves classification performance\nin the target domain. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted\nto demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results\nshow that our proposed method consistently outperforms SOTA methods under\nvarious conditions.",

          "description": "Autonomous driving in multi-agent and dynamic traffic scenarios is\nchallenging, where the behaviors of other road agents are uncertain and hard to\nmodel explicitly, and the ego-vehicle should apply complicated negotiation\nskills with them to achieve both safe and efficient driving in various\nsettings, such as giving way, merging and taking turns. Traditional planning\nmethods are largely rule-based and scale poorly in these complex dynamic\nscenarios, often leading to reactive or even overly conservative behaviors.\nTherefore, they require tedious human efforts to maintain workability.\nRecently, deep learning-based methods have shown promising results with better\ngeneralization capability but less hand engineering effort. However, they are\neither implemented with supervised imitation learning (IL) that suffers from\nthe dataset bias and distribution mismatch problems, or trained with deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) but focus on one specific traffic scenario. In\nthis work, we propose DQ-GAT to achieve scalable and proactive autonomous\ndriving, where graph attention-based networks are used to implicitly model\ninteractions, and asynchronous deep Q-learning is employed to train the network\nend-to-end in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments through a\nhigh-fidelity driving simulation show that our method can better trade-off\nsafety and efficiency in both seen and unseen scenarios, achieving higher goal\nsuccess rates than the baselines (at most 4.7$\\times$) with comparable task\ncompletion time.

          "description": "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive and fatal\nneurodegenerative disease, that causes approximately 350 deaths in the United\nStates every year. In specific, it is a prion disease that is caused by a\nmisfolded prion protein, termed $PrP^{Sc}$, which is the infectious form of the\nprion protein $PrP^{C}$. Rather than being recycled by the body, the $PrP^{Sc}$\naggregates in the brain as plaques, leading to neurodegeneration of surrounding\ncells and the spongiform characteristics of the pathology. However, there has\nbeen very little research done into factors that can affect one's chances of\nacquiring $PrP^{Sc}$. In this paper, Elastic Net Regression, Long Short-Term\nMemory Recurrent Neural Network Architectures, and Random Forest have been used\nto predict Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Levels in the United States. New variables\nwere created as data for the models to use on the basis of common factors that\nare known to affect CJD, such as soil, food, and water quality. Based on the\nroot mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), and mean absolute error\n(MAE) values, the study reveals the high impact of unhealthy lifestyle choices,\nCO$_{2}$ Levels, Pesticide Usage, and Potash K$_{2}$O Usage on CJD Levels. In\ndoing so, the study highlights new avenues of research for CJD prevention and\ndetection, as well as potential causes.",

Nevertheless, among the most well-studied\nPTMs can say mainly types of proteins are containing phosphorylation and\nsignificant roles in many biological processes.

Therefore, it is necessary to predict the phosphorylation of target\nresidues in an uncharacterized amino acid sequence. Most experimental\ntechniques for predicting phosphorylation are time-consuming, costly, and\nerror-prone. By the way, computational methods have replaced these techniques.\nThese days, a vast amount of phosphorylation data is publicly accessible\nthrough many online databases. In this study, at first, all datasets of PTMs\nthat include phosphorylation sites (p-sites) were comprehensively reviewed.\nFurthermore, we showed that there are basically two main approaches for\nphosphorylation prediction by machine learning: End-to-End and conventional. We\ngave an overview for both of them. Also, we introduced 15 important feature\nextraction techniques which mostly have been used for conventional machine\nlearning methods",

          "description": "Transformers have improved the state-of-the-art across numerous tasks in\nsequence modeling. Besides the quadratic computational and memory complexity\nw.r.t the sequence length, the self-attention mechanism only processes\ninformation at the same scale, i.e., all attention heads are in the same\nresolution, resulting in the limited power of the Transformer. To remedy this,\nwe propose a novel and efficient structure named Adaptive Multi-Resolution\nAttention (AdaMRA for short), which scales linearly to sequence length in terms\nof time and space. Specifically, we leverage a multi-resolution multi-head\nattention mechanism, enabling attention heads to capture long-range contextual\ninformation in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, to capture the potential\nrelations between query representation and clues of different attention\ngranularities, we leave the decision of which resolution of attention to use to\nquery, which further improves the model's capacity compared to vanilla\nTransformer. In an effort to reduce complexity, we adopt kernel attention\nwithout degrading the performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model by achieving a\nstate-of-the-art performance-efficiency-memory trade-off. To facilitate AdaMRA\nutilization by the scientific community, the code implementation will be made\npublicly available.",

In\nparticular, we assume that the variables are binary. The existing LiNGAM\nassumes that no confounding is present, which is restrictive in practice. Based\non the concept of independent component analysis (ICA), this paper proposes an\nextended framework in which the mutual information among the noises is\nminimized. Another significant contribution is to reduce the realization of the\nshortest path problem. The distance between each pair of nodes expresses an\nassociated mutual information value, and the path with the minimum sum (KL\ndivergence) is sought. Although $p!$ mutual information values should be\ncompared, this paper dramatically reduces the computation when no confounding\nis present. The proposed algorithm finds the globally optimal solution, while\nthe existing locally greedily seek the order based on hypothesis testing. We\nuse the best estimator in the sense of Bayes/MDL that correctly detects\nindependence for mutual information estimation. Experiments using artificial\nand actual data show that the proposed version of LiNGAM achieves significantly\nbetter performance, particularly when confounding is present.",

          "description": "Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDoH) have important roles in\nshaping people's health. In clinical research studies, especially comparative\neffectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially\ncause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical\nanalyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies\nto examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured\nSBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much\nof the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language\nprocessing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from\nunstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system\nfocusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH\nconcepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract\nSBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the\ndifference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured\nEHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the\nInternational Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show\nthat the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of\n0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH\ninformation and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864\npatients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more\ndetailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only\ncaptured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical\nnarratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of\npatients' SBDoH factors.",

Anshu, Arunachalam, Kuwahara, and Soleimanifar (Nature\nPhysics, 2021) recently studied the sample complexity (number of copies of\n$\\rho$ needed) of this problem for geometrically local $N$-qubit Hamiltonians.\nIn the high-temperature (low $\\beta$) regime, their algorithm has sample\ncomplexity poly$(N, 1/\\beta,1/\\varepsilon)$ and can be implemented with\npolynomial, but suboptimal, time complexity.\n\nIn this paper, we study the same question for a more general class of\nHamiltonians. We show how to learn the coefficients of a Hamiltonian to error\n$\\varepsilon$ with sample complexity $S = O(\\log N/(\\beta\\varepsilon)^{2})$ and\ntime complexity linear in the sample size, $O(S N)$. Furthermore, we prove a\nmatching lower bound showing that our algorithm's sample complexity is optimal,\nand hence our time complexity is also optimal.\n\nIn the appendix, we show that virtually the same algorithm can be used to\nlearn $H$ from a real-time evolution unitary $e^{-it H}$ in a small $t$ regime\nwith similar sample and time complexity.",

We first consider the case of\nsingle neuron and show that the linear approximability, quantified by the\nKolmogorov width, is controlled by the eigenvalue decay of an associate kernel.\nThen, we show that similar results also hold for two-layer neural networks.\nThis spectral-based approach allows us to obtain upper bounds, lower bounds,\nand explicit hard examples in a united manner. In particular, these bounds\nimply that for networks activated by smooth functions, restricting the norms of\ninner-layer weights may significantly impair the expressiveness. By contrast,\nfor non-smooth activation functions, such as ReLU, the network expressiveness\nis independent of the inner-layer weight norms. In addition, we prove that for\na family of non-smooth activation functions, including ReLU, approximating any\nsingle neuron with random features suffers from the \\emph{curse of\ndimensionality}. This provides an explicit separation of expressiveness between\nneural networks and random feature models.",

Given the fact that the generative distribution may be\ncomplex and intractable, deep latent variable models use probabilistic\nframeworks to learn more expressive joint probability distributions over the\ndata and their low-dimensional hidden variables. Learning complex probability\ndistributions over sequential data without any supervision is a difficult task\nfor deep generative models. Ordinary Differential Equation Variational\nAuto-Encoder (ODE2VAE) is a deep latent variable model that aims to learn\ncomplex distributions over high-dimensional sequential data and their\nlow-dimensional representations. ODE2VAE infers continuous latent dynamics of\nthe high-dimensional input in a low-dimensional hierarchical latent space. The\nhierarchical organization of the continuous latent space embeds a\nphysics-guided inductive bias in the model. In this paper, we analyze the\nlatent representations inferred by the ODE2VAE model over three different\nphysical motion datasets: bouncing balls, projectile motion, and simple\npendulum. Through our experiments, we explore the effects of the physics-guided\ninductive bias of the ODE2VAE model over the learned dynamical latent\nrepresentations. We show that the model is able to learn meaningful latent\nrepresentations to an extent without any supervision.",

          "description": "Nonlocal models, including peridynamics, often use integral operators that\nembed lengthscales in their definition. However, the integrands in these\noperators are difficult to define from the data that are typically available\nfor a given physical system, such as laboratory mechanical property tests. In\ncontrast, molecular dynamics (MD) does not require these integrands, but it\nsuffers from computational limitations in the length and time scales it can\naddress. To combine the strengths of both methods and to obtain a\ncoarse-grained, homogenized continuum model that efficiently and accurately\ncaptures materials' behavior, we propose a learning framework to extract, from\nMD data, an optimal Linear Peridynamic Solid (LPS) model as a surrogate for MD\ndisplacements. To maximize the accuracy of the learnt model we allow the\nperidynamic influence function to be partially negative, while preserving the\nwell-posedness of the resulting model. To achieve this, we provide sufficient\nwell-posedness conditions for discretized LPS models with sign-changing\ninfluence functions and develop a constrained optimization algorithm that\nminimizes the equation residual while enforcing such solvability conditions.\nThis framework guarantees that the resulting model is mathematically\nwell-posed, physically consistent, and that it generalizes well to settings\nthat are different from the ones used during training. We illustrate the\nefficacy of the proposed approach with several numerical tests for single layer\ngraphene. Our two-dimensional tests show the robustness of the proposed\nalgorithm on validation data sets that include thermal noise, different domain\nshapes and external loadings, and discretizations substantially different from\nthe ones used for training.",

Since wet-lab\nexperiments are expensive and time-consuming, computational techniques for\nmiRNA-disease association prediction have attracted a lot of attention in\nrecent years. Data scarcity is one of the major challenges in building reliable\nmachine learning models. Data scarcity combined with the use of pre-calculated\nhand-crafted input features has led to problems of overfitting and data\nleakage.\n\nWe overcome the limitations of existing works by proposing a novel\nmulti-tasking convolution-based approach, which we refer to as MuCoMiD. MuCoMiD\nallows automatic feature extraction while incorporating knowledge from 4\nheterogeneous biological information sources (interactions between\nmiRNA/diseases and protein-coding genes (PCG), miRNA family information, and\ndisease ontology) in a multi-task setting which is a novel perspective and has\nnot been studied before. The use of multi-channel convolutions allows us to\nextract expressive representations while keeping the model linear and,\ntherefore, simple. To effectively test the generalization capability of our\nmodel, we construct large-scale experiments on standard benchmark datasets as\nwell as our proposed larger independent test sets and case studies. MuCoMiD\nshows an improvement of at least 5% in 5-fold CV evaluation on HMDDv2.0 and\nHMDDv3.0 datasets and at least 49% on larger independent test sets with unseen\nmiRNA and diseases over state-of-the-art approaches.

AuraSense is the\nfirst system to realize no-dead-spot proximity sensing for robot arms.

          "description": "Greater direct electrification of end-use sectors with a higher share of\nrenewables is one of the pillars to power a carbon-neutral society by 2050.\nHowever, in contrast to conventional power plants, renewable energy is subject\nto uncertainty raising challenges for their interaction with power systems.\nScenario-based probabilistic forecasting models have become an important tool\nto equip decision-makers. This paper proposes to present to the power systems\nforecasting practitioners a recent deep learning technique, the normalizing\nflows, to produce accurate scenario-based probabilistic forecasts that are\ncrucial to face the new challenges in power systems applications. The strength\nof this technique is to directly learn the stochastic multivariate distribution\nof the underlying process by maximizing the likelihood. Through comprehensive\nempirical evaluations using the open data of the Global Energy Forecasting\nCompetition 2014, we demonstrate that this methodology is competitive with\nother state-of-the-art deep learning generative models: generative adversarial\nnetworks and variational autoencoders. The models producing weather-based wind,\nsolar power, and load scenarios are properly compared both in terms of forecast\nvalue, by considering the case study of an energy retailer, and quality using\nseveral complementary metrics. The numerical experiments are simple and easily\nreproducible. Thus, we hope it will encourage other forecasting practitioners\nto test and use normalizing flows in power system applications such as bidding\non electricity markets, scheduling of power systems with high renewable energy\nsources penetration, energy management of virtual power plan or microgrids, and\nunit commitment.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks continue to awe the world with their remarkable\nperformance. Their predictions, however, are prone to be corrupted by\nadversarial examples that are imperceptible to humans. Current efforts to\nimprove the robustness of neural networks against adversarial examples are\nfocused on developing robust training methods, which update the weights of a\nneural network in a more robust direction. In this work, we take a step beyond\ntraining of the weight parameters and consider the problem of designing an\nadversarially robust neural architecture with high intrinsic robustness. We\npropose AdvRush, a novel adversarial robustness-aware neural architecture\nsearch algorithm, based upon a finding that independent of the training method,\nthe intrinsic robustness of a neural network can be represented with the\nsmoothness of its input loss landscape. Through a regularizer that favors a\ncandidate architecture with a smoother input loss landscape, AdvRush\nsuccessfully discovers an adversarially robust neural architecture. Along with\na comprehensive theoretical motivation for AdvRush, we conduct an extensive\namount of experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of AdvRush on various\nbenchmark datasets. Notably, on CIFAR-10, AdvRush achieves 55.91% robust\naccuracy under FGSM attack after standard training and 50.04% robust accuracy\nunder AutoAttack after 7-step PGD adversarial training.",

          "description": "Separating and labeling each instance of a nucleus (instance-aware\nsegmentation) is the key challenge in segmenting single cell nuclei on\nfluorescence microscopy images. Deep Neural Networks can learn the implicit\ntransformation of a nuclear image into a probability map indicating the class\nmembership of each pixel (nucleus or background), but the use of\npost-processing steps to turn the probability map into a labeled object mask is\nerror-prone. This especially accounts for nuclear images of tissue sections and\nnuclear images across varying tissue preparations. In this work, we aim to\nevaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to\nsegment nuclei in fluorescence images of various tissue origins and sample\npreparation types without post-processing. We compare architectures that\noperate on pixel to pixel translation and an architecture that operates on\nobject detection and subsequent locally applied segmentation. In addition, we\npropose a novel strategy to create artificial images to extend the training\nset. We evaluate the influence of ground truth annotation quality, image scale\nand segmentation complexity on segmentation performance. Results show that\nthree out of four deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net with ResNet34\nbackbone, Mask R-CNN) can segment fluorescent nuclear images on most of the\nsample preparation types and tissue origins with satisfactory segmentation\nperformance. Mask R-CNN, an architecture designed to address instance aware\nsegmentation tasks, outperforms other architectures. Equal nuclear mean size,\nconsistent nuclear annotations and the use of artificially generated images\nresult in overall acceptable precision and recall across different tissues and\nsample preparation types.",

These AIoT systems anticipate\nhorizontal collaboration among different resource-constrained AIoT node\ndevices, where CNN layers are partitioned and these devices collaboratively\ncompute complex CNN tasks. This horizontal collaboration opens another attack\nsurface to the CNN-based application, like inserting the hardware Trojans (HT)\ninto the embedded accelerators designed for the CNN. Therefore, there is a dire\nneed to explore this attack surface for designing secure embedded hardware\naccelerators for CNNs. Towards this goal, in this paper, we exploited this\nattack surface to propose an HT-based attack called FeSHI. Since in horizontal\ncollaboration of RC AIoT devices different sections of CNN architectures are\noutsourced to different untrusted third parties, the attacker may not know the\ninput image, but it has access to the layer-by-layer output feature maps\ninformation for the assigned sections of the CNN architecture. This attack\nexploits the statistical distribution, i.e., Gaussian distribution, of the\nlayer-by-layer feature maps of the CNN to design two triggers for stealthy HT\nwith a very low probability of triggering.

          "description": "Studying the implicit regularization effect of the nonlinear training\ndynamics of neural networks (NNs) is important for understanding why\nover-parameterized neural networks often generalize well on real dataset.\nEmpirically, for two-layer NN, existing works have shown that input weights of\nhidden neurons (the input weight of a hidden neuron consists of the weight from\nits input layer to the hidden neuron and its bias term) condense on isolated\norientations with a small initialization. The condensation dynamics implies\nthat NNs can learn features from the training data with a network configuration\neffectively equivalent to a much smaller network during the training. In this\nwork, we show that the multiple roots of activation function at origin\n(referred as ``multiplicity'') is a key factor for understanding the\ncondensation at the initial stage of training. Our experiments of multilayer\nnetworks suggest that the maximal number of condensed orientations is twice the\nmultiplicity of the activation function used. Our theoretical analysis of\ntwo-layer networks confirms experiments for two cases, one is for the\nactivation function of multiplicity one, which contains many common activation\nfunctions, and the other is for the one-dimensional input. This work makes a\nstep towards understanding how small initialization implicitly leads NNs to\ncondensation at initial training stage, which lays a foundation for the future\nstudy of the nonlinear dynamics of NNs and its implicit regularization effect\nat a later stage of training.",

          "description": "In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous\ndriving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may\ncompromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have\ndemonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in\ndetection precision of deep learning-based 3D object detection models. Although\ndriving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no\ncomprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning\nmodels and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial\nattacks, perturbation attacks and patch attacks, on the driving safety of\nvision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep\nlearning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in\nvision-based 3D object detection, Stereo R-CNN and DSGN. To evaluate driving\nsafety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving\nsafety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive\nevaluation experiments, we find that (1) the attack's impact on the driving\nsafety of autonomous vehicles and the attack's impact on the precision of 3D\nobject detectors are decoupled, and (2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger\nrobustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we\nfurther investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study.\nThe findings of this paper provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial\nattacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.",

          "description": "Recent research has shown that non-additive image steganographic frameworks\neffectively improve security performance through adjusting distortion\ndistribution. However, as far as we know, all of the existing non-additive\nproposals are based on handcrafted policies, and can only be applied to a\nspecific image domain, which heavily prevent non-additive steganography from\nreleasing its full potentiality. In this paper, we propose an automatic\nnon-additive steganographic distortion learning framework called MCTSteg to\nremove the above restrictions. Guided by the reinforcement learning paradigm,\nwe combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and steganalyzer-based environmental\nmodel to build MCTSteg. MCTS makes sequential decisions to adjust distortion\ndistribution without human intervention. Our proposed environmental model is\nused to obtain feedbacks from each decision. Due to its self-learning\ncharacteristic and domain-independent reward function, MCTSteg has become the\nfirst reported universal non-additive steganographic framework which can work\nin both spatial and JPEG domains. Extensive experimental results show that\nMCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted\nfeature-based and deep-learning-based steganalyzers. In both spatial and JPEG\ndomains, the security performance of MCTSteg steadily outperforms the state of\nthe art by a clear margin under different scenarios.",

          "description": "Decision-making often requires accurate estimation of treatment effects from\nobservational data. This is challenging as outcomes of alternative decisions\nare not observed and have to be estimated. Previous methods estimate outcomes\nbased on unconfoundedness but neglect any constraints that unconfoundedness\nimposes on the outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization\nframework for estimating average treatment effects that exploits\nunconfoundedness. To this end, we formalize unconfoundedness as an\northogonality constraint, which ensures that the outcomes are orthogonal to the\ntreatment assignment. This orthogonality constraint is then included in the\nloss function via a regularization. Based on our regularization framework, we\ndevelop deep orthogonal networks for unconfounded treatments (DONUT), which\nlearn outcomes that are orthogonal to the treatment assignment. Using a variety\nof benchmark datasets for estimating average treatment effects, we demonstrate\nthat DONUT outperforms the state-of-the-art substantially.",

          "description": "To enable process analysis based on an event log without compromising the\nprivacy of individuals involved in process execution, a log may be anonymized.\nSuch anonymization strives to transform a log so that it satisfies provable\nprivacy guarantees, while largely maintaining its utility for process analysis.\nExisting techniques perform anonymization using simple, syntactic measures to\nidentify suitable transformation operations. This way, the semantics of the\nactivities referenced by the events in a trace are neglected, potentially\nleading to transformations in which events of unrelated activities are merged.\nTo avoid this and incorporate the semantics of activities during anonymization,\nwe propose to instead incorporate a distance measure based on feature learning.\nSpecifically, we show how embeddings of events enable the definition of a\ndistance measure for traces to guide event log anonymization. Our experiments\nwith real-world data indicate that anonymization using this measure, compared\nto a syntactic one, yields logs that are closer to the original log in various\ndimensions and, hence, have higher utility for process analysis.",

          "description": "Compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have witnessed exceptional\nimprovements in performance in recent years. However, they still fail to\nprovide the same predictive power as CNNs with a large number of parameters.\nThe diverse and even abundant features captured by the layers is an important\ncharacteristic of these successful CNNs. However, differences in this\ncharacteristic between large CNNs and their compact counterparts have rarely\nbeen investigated. In compact CNNs, due to the limited number of parameters,\nabundant features are unlikely to be obtained, and feature diversity becomes an\nessential characteristic. Diverse features present in the activation maps\nderived from a data point during model inference may indicate the presence of a\nset of unique descriptors necessary to distinguish between objects of different\nclasses. In contrast, data points with low feature diversity may not provide a\nsufficient amount of unique descriptors to make a valid prediction; we refer to\nthem as random predictions. Random predictions can negatively impact the\noptimization process and harm the final performance. This paper proposes\naddressing the problem raised by random predictions by reshaping the standard\ncross-entropy to make it biased toward data points with a limited number of\nunique descriptive features. Our novel Bias Loss focuses the training on a set\nof valuable data points and prevents the vast number of samples with poor\nlearning features from misleading the optimization process. Furthermore, to\nshow the importance of diversity, we present a family of SkipNet models whose\narchitectures are brought to boost the number of unique descriptors in the last\nlayers. Our Skipnet-M can achieve 1% higher classification accuracy than\nMobileNetV3 Large.",

The system was trained on a processed patent database of over 3\nmillion organic reactions. Experimental reactions were atom-mapped, clustered,\nand extracted into reaction templates. We then trained a graph convolutional\nneural network-based one-step reaction proposer using template embeddings and\ndeveloped a guiding algorithm on the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of chemical\ncompounds to find the best candidate to explore. The atom-mapping algorithm and\nthe one-step reaction proposer were benchmarked against previous studies and\nshowed better results. The final product was demonstrated by retrosynthesis\nroutes reviewed and rated by human experts, showing satisfying functionality\nand a potential productivity boost in real-life use cases.",

          "description": "Multimodal IR, spanning text corpus, knowledge graph and images, called\noutside knowledge visual question answering (OKVQA), is of much recent\ninterest. However, the popular data set has serious limitations. A surprisingly\nlarge fraction of queries do not assess the ability to integrate cross-modal\ninformation. Instead, some are independent of the image, some depend on\nspeculation, some require OCR or are otherwise answerable from the image alone.\nTo add to the above limitations, frequency-based guessing is very effective\nbecause of (unintended) widespread answer overlaps between the train and test\nfolds. Overall, it is hard to determine when state-of-the-art systems exploit\nthese weaknesses rather than really infer the answers, because they are opaque\nand their 'reasoning' process is uninterpretable. An equally important\nlimitation is that the dataset is designed for the quantitative assessment only\nof the end-to-end answer retrieval task, with no provision for assessing the\ncorrect(semantic) interpretation of the input query. In response, we identify a\nkey structural idiom in OKVQA ,viz., S3 (select, substitute and search), and\nbuild a new data set and challenge around it. Specifically, the questioner\nidentifies an entity in the image and asks a question involving that entity\nwhich can be answered only by consulting a knowledge graph or corpus passage\nmentioning the entity. Our challenge consists of (i)OKVQAS3, a subset of OKVQA\nannotated based on the structural idiom and (ii)S3VQA, a new dataset built from\nscratch. We also present a neural but structurally transparent OKVQA system,\nS3, that explicitly addresses our challenge dataset, and outperforms recent\ncompetitive baselines.",

In this\npaper, we present a new graph attention neural network, namely GIPA, for\nattributed graph data learning. GIPA consists of three key components:\nattention, feature propagation and aggregation. Specifically, the attention\ncomponent introduces a new multi-layer perceptron based multi-head to generate\nbetter non-linear feature mapping and representation than conventional\nimplementations such as dot-product. The propagation component considers not\nonly node features but also edge features, which differs from existing GNNs\nthat merely consider node features.

The\nexperimental results reveal that GIPA can beat the state-of-the-art models in\nterms of prediction accuracy, e.g., GIPA achieves an average test ROC-AUC of\n$0.8700\\pm 0.0010$ and outperforms all the previous methods listed in the\nogbn-proteins leaderboard.",

In\nthis paper, we investigate the benefits of component compression and modeling\nof both time and phase delay structures between basis components in the SM\nkernel. By verifying the presence of dependencies between function components\nusing Gaussian conditionals and posterior covariance, we first propose a new SM\nkernel variant with a time and phase delay dependency structure (SMD) and then\nprovide a structure adaptation (SA) algorithm for the SMD. The SMD kernel is\nconstructed in two steps: first, time delay and phase delay are incorporated\ninto each basis component; next, cross-convolution between a basis component\nand the reversed complex conjugate of another basis component is performed,\nwhich yields a complex-valued and positive definite kernel incorporating\ndependency structures between basis components. The model compression and\ndependency sparsity of the SMD kernel can be obtained by using automatic\npruning in SA. We perform a thorough comparative experimental analysis of the\nSMD on both synthetic and real-life datasets. The results corroborate the\nefficacy of the dependency structure and SA in the SMD.",

          "description": "One intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their inherent\nvulnerability to backdoor attacks -- a trojan model responds to\ntrigger-embedded inputs in a highly predictable manner while functioning\nnormally otherwise. Despite the plethora of prior work on DNNs for continuous\ndata (e.g., images), the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) for\ndiscrete-structured data (e.g., graphs) is largely unexplored, which is highly\nconcerning given their increasing use in security-sensitive domains. To bridge\nthis gap, we present GTA, the first backdoor attack on GNNs. Compared with\nprior work, GTA departs in significant ways: graph-oriented -- it defines\ntriggers as specific subgraphs, including both topological structures and\ndescriptive features, entailing a large design spectrum for the adversary;\ninput-tailored -- it dynamically adapts triggers to individual graphs, thereby\noptimizing both attack effectiveness and evasiveness; downstream model-agnostic\n-- it can be readily launched without knowledge regarding downstream models or\nfine-tuning strategies; and attack-extensible -- it can be instantiated for\nboth transductive (e.g., node classification) and inductive (e.g., graph\nclassification) tasks, constituting severe threats for a range of\nsecurity-critical applications. Through extensive evaluation using benchmark\ndatasets and state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GTA.\nWe further provide analytical justification for its effectiveness and discuss\npotential countermeasures, pointing to several promising research directions.",

In response, several methods have been proposed in the literature to\nexplain their predictions. Among the explanatory methods, Shapley values is a\nfeature attribution method favoured for its robust theoretical foundation.\nHowever, the analysis of feature attributions using Shapley values requires\nchoosing a baseline that represents the concept of missingness. An arbitrary\nchoice of baseline could negatively impact the explanatory power of the method\nand possibly lead to incorrect interpretations. In this paper, we present a\nmethod for choosing a baseline according to a neutrality value: as a parameter\nselected by decision-makers, the point at which their choices are determined by\nthe model predictions being either above or below it. Hence, the proposed\nbaseline is set based on a parameter that depends on the actual use of the\nmodel. This procedure stands in contrast to how other baselines are set, i.e.\nwithout accounting for how the model is used. We empirically validate our\nchoice of baseline in the context of binary classification tasks, using two\ndatasets: a synthetic dataset and a dataset derived from the financial domain.",

Also, it is not trivial to generate a reference\nestimate using annotations from multiple experts. Here we present a deep neural\nnetwork, defined as U-Net-and-a-half, which can simultaneously learn from\nannotations performed by multiple experts on the same set of images.\nU-Net-and-a-half contains a convolutional encoder to generate features from the\ninput images, multiple decoders that allow simultaneous learning from image\nmasks obtained from annotations that were independently generated by multiple\nexperts, and a shared low-dimensional feature space. To demonstrate the\napplicability of our framework, we used two distinct datasets from digital\npathology and radiology, respectively.

          "description": "With the increasing demands of personalized learning, knowledge tracing has\nbecome important which traces students' knowledge states based on their\nhistorical practices. Factor analysis methods mainly use two kinds of factors\nwhich are separately related to students and questions to model students'\nknowledge states. These methods use the total number of attempts of students to\nmodel students' learning progress and hardly highlight the impact of the most\nrecent relevant practices. Besides, current factor analysis methods ignore rich\ninformation contained in questions. In this paper, we propose Multi-Factors\nAware Dual-Attentional model (MF-DAKT) which enriches question representations\nand utilizes multiple factors to model students' learning progress based on a\ndual-attentional mechanism. More specifically, we propose a novel\nstudent-related factor which records the most recent attempts on relevant\nconcepts of students to highlight the impact of recent exercises. To enrich\nquestions representations, we use a pre-training method to incorporate two\nkinds of question information including questions' relation and difficulty\nlevel. We also add a regularization term about questions' difficulty level to\nrestrict pre-trained question representations to fine-tuning during the process\nof predicting students' performance. Moreover, we apply a dual-attentional\nmechanism to differentiate contributions of factors and factor interactions to\nfinal prediction in different practice records. At last, we conduct experiments\non several real-world datasets and results show that MF-DAKT can outperform\nexisting knowledge tracing methods. We also conduct several studies to validate\nthe effects of each component of MF-DAKT.",

          "description": "Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks.\nThrough a combination of advanced training techniques and neural network\narchitectural components, it is now possible to create neural networks that can\nhandle tabular data, images, text, and audio as both input and output. Deep\nlearning allows a neural network to learn hierarchies of information in a way\nthat is like the function of the human brain. This course will introduce the\nstudent to classic neural network structures, Convolution Neural Networks\n(CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU),\nGeneral Adversarial Networks (GAN), and reinforcement learning. Application of\nthese architectures to computer vision, time series, security, natural language\nprocessing (NLP), and data generation will be covered. High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) aspects will demonstrate how deep learning can be leveraged\nboth on graphical processing units (GPUs), as well as grids. Focus is primarily\nupon the application of deep learning to problems, with some introduction to\nmathematical foundations. Readers will use the Python programming language to\nimplement deep learning using Google TensorFlow and Keras. It is not necessary\nto know Python prior to this book; however, familiarity with at least one\nprogramming language is assumed.",

          "description": "Federated Averaging (FedAvg, also known as Local-SGD) (McMahan et al., 2017)\nis a classical federated learning algorithm in which clients run multiple local\nSGD steps before communicating their update to an orchestrating server. We\npropose a new federated learning algorithm, FedPAGE, able to further reduce the\ncommunication complexity by utilizing the recent optimal PAGE method (Li et\nal., 2021) instead of plain SGD in FedAvg. We show that FedPAGE uses much fewer\ncommunication rounds than previous local methods for both federated convex and\nnonconvex optimization. Concretely, 1) in the convex setting, the number of\ncommunication rounds of FedPAGE is $O(\\frac{N^{3/4}}{S\\epsilon})$, improving\nthe best-known result $O(\\frac{N}{S\\epsilon})$ of SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et\nal.,2020) by a factor of $N^{1/4}$, where $N$ is the total number of clients\n(usually is very large in federated learning), $S$ is the sampled subset of\nclients in each communication round, and $\\epsilon$ is the target error; 2) in\nthe nonconvex setting, the number of communication rounds of FedPAGE is\n$O(\\frac{\\sqrt{N}+S}{S\\epsilon^2})$, improving the best-known result\n$O(\\frac{N^{2/3}}{S^{2/3}\\epsilon^2})$ of SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al.,2020) by\na factor of $N^{1/6}S^{1/3}$, if the sampled clients $S\\leq \\sqrt{N}$. Note\nthat in both settings, the communication cost for each round is the same for\nboth FedPAGE and SCAFFOLD. As a result, FedPAGE achieves new state-of-the-art\nresults in terms of communication complexity for both federated convex and\nnonconvex optimization.",

          "description": "Errors in measurements are key to weighting the value of data, but are often\nneglected in Machine Learning (ML). We show how Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) are able to learn about the context and patterns of signal and noise,\nleading to improvements in the performance of classification methods. We\nconstruct a model whereby two classes of objects follow an underlying Gaussian\ndistribution, and where the features (the input data) have varying, but known,\nlevels of noise. This model mimics the nature of scientific data sets, where\nthe noises arise as realizations of some random processes whose underlying\ndistributions are known. The classification of these objects can then be\nperformed using standard statistical techniques (e.g., least-squares\nminimization or Markov-Chain Monte Carlo), as well as ML techniques. This\nallows us to take advantage of a maximum likelihood approach to object\nclassification, and to measure the amount by which the ML methods are\nincorporating the information in the input data uncertainties. We show that,\nwhen each data point is subject to different levels of noise (i.e., noises with\ndifferent distribution functions), that information can be learned by the CNNs,\nraising the ML performance to at least the same level of the least-squares\nmethod -- and sometimes even surpassing it. Furthermore, we show that, with\nvarying noise levels, the confidence of the ML classifiers serves as a proxy\nfor the underlying cumulative distribution function, but only if the\ninformation about specific input data uncertainties is provided to the CNNs.",

The advanced dropout technique applies a model-free and easily\nimplemented distribution with parametric prior, and adaptively adjusts dropout\nrate. Specifically, the distribution parameters are optimized by stochastic\ngradient variational Bayes in order to carry out an end-to-end training. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of the advanced dropout against nine dropout\ntechniques on seven computer vision datasets (five small-scale datasets and two\nlarge-scale datasets) with various base models. The advanced dropout\noutperforms all the referred techniques on all the datasets.We further compare\nthe effectiveness ratios and find that advanced dropout achieves the highest\none on most cases. Next, we conduct a set of analysis of dropout rate\ncharacteristics, including convergence of the adaptive dropout rate, the\nlearned distributions of dropout masks, and a comparison with dropout rate\ngeneration without an explicit distribution. In addition, the ability of\noverfitting prevention is evaluated and confirmed.

          "description": "Neural-network classifiers achieve high accuracy when predicting the class of\nan input that they were trained to identify. Maintaining this accuracy in\ndynamic environments, where inputs frequently fall outside the fixed set of\ninitially known classes, remains a challenge. The typical approach is to detect\ninputs from novel classes and retrain the classifier on an augmented dataset.\nHowever, not only the classifier but also the detection mechanism needs to\nadapt in order to distinguish between newly learned and yet unknown input\nclasses. To address this challenge, we introduce an algorithmic framework for\nactive monitoring of a neural network. A monitor wrapped in our framework\noperates in parallel with the neural network and interacts with a human user\nvia a series of interpretable labeling queries for incremental adaptation. In\naddition, we propose an adaptive quantitative monitor to improve precision. An\nexperimental evaluation on a diverse set of benchmarks with varying numbers of\nclasses confirms the benefits of our active monitoring framework in dynamic\nscenarios.",

Domain adaptation techniques are thus required.\nCovariate shift adaptation yields good generalization performance when domains\ndiffer only by the marginal distribution of features. Covariate shift\nadaptation is usually implemented using importance weighting, which may fail,\naccording to common wisdom, due to small effective sample sizes (ESS). Previous\nresearch argues this scenario is more common in high-dimensional settings.\nHowever, how effective sample size, dimensionality, and model\nperformance/generalization are formally related in supervised learning,\nconsidering the context of covariate shift adaptation, is still somewhat\nobscure in the literature. Thus, a main challenge is presenting a unified\ntheory connecting those points. Hence, in this paper, we focus on building a\nunified view connecting the ESS, data dimensionality, and generalization in the\ncontext of covariate shift adaptation. Moreover, we also demonstrate how\ndimensionality reduction or feature selection can increase the ESS, and argue\nthat our results support dimensionality reduction before covariate shift\nadaptation as a good practice.",

          "description": "Channel attention mechanisms have been commonly applied in many visual tasks\nfor effective performance improvement. It is able to reinforce the informative\nchannels as well as to suppress the useless channels. Recently, different\nchannel attention modules have been proposed and implemented in various ways.\nGenerally speaking, they are mainly based on convolution and pooling\noperations. In this paper, we propose Gaussian process embedded channel\nattention (GPCA) module and further interpret the channel attention schemes in\na probabilistic way. The GPCA module intends to model the correlations among\nthe channels, which are assumed to be captured by beta distributed variables.\nAs the beta distribution cannot be integrated into the end-to-end training of\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a mathematically tractable solution,\nwe utilize an approximation of the beta distribution to solve this problem. To\nspecify, we adapt a Sigmoid-Gaussian approximation, in which the Gaussian\ndistributed variables are transferred into the interval [0,1]. The Gaussian\nprocess is then utilized to model the correlations among different channels. In\nthis case, a mathematically tractable solution is derived. The GPCA module can\nbe efficiently implemented and integrated into the end-to-end training of the\nCNNs. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the\nproposed GPCA module.

This metric is an\nindication of a deeper problem lies within the code and is associated with an\nissue which is prominent to experienced software developers with acceptable\ncoding practices. Recent studies have often observed that codes having code\nsmells are often prone to a higher probability of change in the software\ndevelopment cycle. In this paper, we developed code smell prediction models\nwith the help of features extracted from source code to predict eight types of\ncode smell. Our work also presents the application of data sampling techniques\nto handle class imbalance problem and feature selection techniques to find\nrelevant feature sets. Previous studies had made use of techniques such as\nNaive - Bayes and Random forest but had not explored deep learning methods to\npredict code smell. A total of 576 distinct Deep Learning models were trained\nusing the features and datasets mentioned above. The study concluded that the\ndeep learning models which used data from Synthetic Minority Oversampling\nTechnique gave better results in terms of accuracy, AUC with the accuracy of\nsome models improving from 88.47 to 96.84.",

          "description": "Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) recently emerged as a powerful paradigm\nfor recommendation based on implicit feedback collaborative filtering. However,\nstandard CML methods learn fixed user and item representations, which fails to\ncapture the complex interests of users. Existing extensions of CML also either\nignore the heterogeneity of user-item relations, i.e. that a user can\nsimultaneously like very different items, or the latent item-item relations,\ni.e. that a user's preference for an item depends, not only on its intrinsic\ncharacteristics, but also on items they previously interacted with. In this\npaper, we present a hierarchical CML model that jointly captures latent\nuser-item and item-item relations from implicit data. Our approach is inspired\nby translation mechanisms from knowledge graph embedding and leverages\nmemory-based attention networks. We empirically show the relevance of this\njoint relational modeling, by outperforming existing CML models on\nrecommendation tasks on several real-world datasets. Our experiments also\nemphasize the limits of current CML relational models on very sparse datasets.",

          "description": "Class imbalance is a substantial challenge in classifying many real-world\ncases. Synthetic over-sampling methods have been effective to improve the\nperformance of classifiers for imbalance problems. However, most synthetic\nover-sampling methods generate non-diverse synthetic instances within the\nconvex hull formed by the existing minority instances as they only concentrate\non the minority class and ignore the vast information provided by the majority\nclass. They also often do not perform well for extremely imbalanced data as the\nfewer the minority instances, the less information to generate synthetic\ninstances. Moreover, existing methods that generate synthetic instances using\nthe majority class distributional information cannot perform effectively when\nthe majority class has a multi-modal distribution. We propose a new method to\ngenerate diverse and adaptable synthetic instances using Synthetic\nOver-sampling with Minority and Majority classes (SOMM). SOMM generates\nsynthetic instances diversely within the minority data space. It updates the\ngenerated instances adaptively to the neighbourhood including both classes.\nThus, SOMM performs well for both binary and multiclass imbalance problems. We\nexamine the performance of SOMM for binary and multiclass problems using\nbenchmark data sets for different imbalance levels. The empirical results show\nthe superiority of SOMM compared to other existing methods.",

          "description": "The traditional Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) minimizes the\ntotal distance of the routes under the capacity constraints of the vehicles.\nBut more often, the objective involves multiple criteria including not only the\ntotal distance of the tour but also other factors such as travel costs, travel\ntime, and fuel consumption.Moreover, in reality, there are numerous implicit\npreferences ingrained in the minds of the route planners and the drivers.\nDrivers, for instance, have familiarity with certain neighborhoods and\nknowledge of the state of roads, and often consider the best places for rest\nand lunch breaks. This knowledge is difficult to formulate and balance when\noperational routing decisions have to be made. This motivates us to learn the\nimplicit preferences from past solutions and to incorporate these learned\npreferences in the optimization process. These preferences are in the form of\narc probabilities, i.e., the more preferred a route is, the higher is the joint\nprobability. The novelty of this work is the use of a neural network model to\nestimate the arc probabilities, which allows for additional features and\nautomatic parameter estimation. This first requires identifying suitable\nfeatures, neural architectures and loss functions, taking into account that\nthere is typically few data available. We investigate the difference with a\nprior weighted Markov counting approach, and study the applicability of neural\nnetworks in this setting.",

          "description": "Machine learning for procedural content generation has recently become an\nactive area of research. Levels vary in both form and function and are mostly\nunrelated to each other across games. This has made it difficult to assemble\nsuitably large datasets to bring machine learning to level design in the same\nway as it's been used for image generation. Here we propose Generative Playing\nNetworks which design levels for itself to play. The algorithm is built in two\nparts; an agent that learns to play game levels, and a generator that learns\nthe distribution of playable levels. As the agent learns and improves its\nability, the space of playable levels, as defined by the agent, grows. The\ngenerator targets the agent's playability estimates to then update its\nunderstanding of what constitutes a playable level. We call this process of\nlearning the distribution of data found through self-discovery with an\nenvironment, self-supervised inductive learning. Unlike previous approaches to\nprocedural content generation, Generative Playing Networks are end-to-end\ndifferentiable and do not require human-designed examples or domain knowledge.\nWe demonstrate the capability of this framework by training an agent and level\ngenerator for a 2D dungeon crawler game.",

The overwhelming majority of the literature focuses on small graph\nproblems, while several real-world problems are devoted to large graphs. Here,\nwe focus on two such problems that are related: influence estimation, a\n\\#P-hard counting problem, and influence maximization, an NP-hard problem. We\ndevelop GLIE, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that inherently parameterizes an\nupper bound of influence estimation and train it on small simulated graphs.\nExperiments show that GLIE can provide accurate predictions faster than the\nalternatives for graphs 10 times larger than the train set. More importantly,\nit can be used on arbitrary large graphs for influence maximization, as the\npredictions can rank effectively seed sets even when the accuracy deteriorates.\nTo showcase this, we propose a version of a standard Influence Maximization\n(IM) algorithm where we substitute traditional influence estimation with the\npredictions of GLIE.We also transfer GLIE into a reinforcement learning model\nthat learns how to choose seeds to maximize influence sequentially using GLIE's\nhidden representations and predictions. The final results show that the\nproposed methods surpasses a previous GNN-RL approach and perform on par with a\nstate-of-the-art IM algorithm.",

          "description": "Being able to learn from complex data with phase information is imperative\nfor many signal processing applications. Today' s real-valued deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) have shown efficiency in latent information analysis but fall\nshort when applied to the complex domain. Deep complex networks (DCN), in\ncontrast, can learn from complex data, but have high computational costs;\ntherefore, they cannot satisfy the instant decision-making requirements of many\ndeployable systems dealing with short observations or short signal bursts.\nRecent, Binarized Complex Neural Network (BCNN), which integrates DCNs with\nbinarized neural networks (BNN), shows great potential in classifying complex\ndata in real-time. In this paper, we propose a structural pruning based\naccelerator of BCNN, which is able to provide more than 5000 frames/s inference\nthroughput on edge devices. The high performance comes from both the algorithm\nand hardware sides. On the algorithm side, we conduct structural pruning to the\noriginal BCNN models and obtain 20 $\\times$ pruning rates with negligible\naccuracy loss; on the hardware side, we propose a novel 2D convolution\noperation accelerator for the binary complex neural network. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed design works with over 90% utilization and is\nable to achieve the inference throughput of 5882 frames/s and 4938 frames/s for\ncomplex NIN-Net and ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10 dataset and Alveo U280 Board.",

In this article we prove this conjecture in the situation\nwhere the probability distribution of the input data is equivalent to the\ncontinuous uniform distribution on a compact interval, where the probability\ndistributions for the random initializations of the ANN parameters are standard\nnormal distributions, and where the target function under consideration is\ncontinuous and piecewise affine linear.

          "description": "The Oxford English Dictionary defines precision medicine as \"medical care\ndesigned to optimize efficiency or therapeutic benefit for particular groups of\npatients, especially by using genetic or molecular profiling.\" It is not an\nentirely new idea: physicians from ancient times have recognized that medical\ntreatment needs to consider individual variations in patient characteristics.\nHowever, the modern precision medicine movement has been enabled by a\nconfluence of events: scientific advances in fields such as genetics and\npharmacology, technological advances in mobile devices and wearable sensors,\nand methodological advances in computing and data sciences.\n\nThis chapter is about bandit algorithms: an area of data science of special\nrelevance to precision medicine. With their roots in the seminal work of\nBellman, Robbins, Lai and others, bandit algorithms have come to occupy a\ncentral place in modern data science ( Lattimore and Szepesvari, 2020). Bandit\nalgorithms can be used in any situation where treatment decisions need to be\nmade to optimize some health outcome. Since precision medicine focuses on the\nuse of patient characteristics to guide treatment, contextual bandit algorithms\nare especially useful since they are designed to take such information into\naccount. The role of bandit algorithms in areas of precision medicine such as\nmobile health and digital phenotyping has been reviewed before (Tewari and\nMurphy, 2017; Rabbi et al., 2019). Since these reviews were published, bandit\nalgorithms have continued to find uses in mobile health and several new topics\nhave emerged in the research on bandit algorithms. This chapter is written for\nquantitative researchers in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and\noperations research who might be interested in knowing more about the\nalgorithmic and mathematical details of bandit algorithms that have been used\nin mobile health.",

          "description": "Collaborative training of neural networks leverages distributed data by\nexchanging gradient information between different clients. Although training\ndata entirely resides with the clients, recent work shows that training data\ncan be reconstructed from such exchanged gradient information. To enhance\nprivacy, gradient perturbation techniques have been proposed. However, they\ncome at the cost of reduced model performance, increased convergence time, or\nincreased data demand. In this paper, we introduce PRECODE, a PRivacy EnhanCing\nmODulE that can be used as generic extension for arbitrary model architectures.\nWe propose a simple yet effective realization of PRECODE using variational\nmodeling. The stochastic sampling induced by variational modeling effectively\nprevents privacy leakage from gradients and in turn preserves privacy of data\nowners. We evaluate PRECODE using state of the art gradient inversion attacks\non two different model architectures trained on three datasets. In contrast to\ncommonly used defense mechanisms, we find that our proposed modification\nconsistently reduces the attack success rate to 0% while having almost no\nnegative impact on model training and final performance. As a result, PRECODE\nreveals a promising path towards privacy enhancing model extensions.",

          "description": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits strong algorithmic regularization\neffects in practice, which has been hypothesized to play an important role in\nthe generalization of modern machine learning approaches. In this work, we seek\nto understand these issues in the simpler setting of linear regression\n(including both underparameterized and overparameterized regimes), where our\ngoal is to make sharp instance-based comparisons of the implicit regularization\nafforded by (unregularized) average SGD with the explicit regularization of\nridge regression. For a broad class of least squares problem instances (that\nare natural in high-dimensional settings), we show: (1) for every problem\ninstance and for every ridge parameter, (unregularized) SGD, when provided with\nlogarithmically more samples than that provided to the ridge algorithm,\ngeneralizes no worse than the ridge solution (provided SGD uses a tuned\nconstant stepsize); (2) conversely, there exist instances (in this wide problem\nclass) where optimally-tuned ridge regression requires quadratically more\nsamples than SGD in order to have the same generalization performance. Taken\ntogether, our results show that, up to the logarithmic factors, the\ngeneralization performance of SGD is always no worse than that of ridge\nregression in a wide range of overparameterized problems, and, in fact, could\nbe much better for some problem instances. More generally, our results show how\nalgorithmic regularization has important consequences even in simpler\n(overparameterized) convex settings.",

          "description": "Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning framework designed for\ndata privacy preservation i.e., local data remain private throughout the entire\ntraining and testing procedure. Federated Learning is gaining popularity\nbecause it allows one to use machine learning techniques while preserving\nprivacy. However, it inherits the vulnerabilities and susceptibilities raised\nin deep learning techniques. For instance, Federated Learning is particularly\nvulnerable to data poisoning attacks that may deteriorate its performance and\nintegrity due to its distributed nature and inaccessibility to the raw data. In\naddition, it is extremely difficult to correctly identify malicious clients due\nto the non-Independently and/or Identically Distributed (non-IID) data. The\nreal-world data can be complex and diverse, making them hardly distinguishable\nfrom the malicious data without direct access to the raw data. Prior research\nhas focused on detecting malicious clients while treating only the clients\nhaving IID data as benign. In this study, we propose a method that detects and\nclassifies anomalous clients from benign clients when benign ones have non-IID\ndata. Our proposed method leverages feature dimension reduction, dynamic\nclustering, and cosine similarity-based clipping. The experimental results\nvalidates that our proposed method not only classifies the malicious clients\nbut also alleviates their negative influences from the entire procedure. Our\nfindings may be used in future studies to effectively eliminate anomalous\nclients when building a model with diverse data.",

          "description": "Big Data are rapidly produced from various heterogeneous data sources. They\nare of different types (text, image, video or audio) and have different levels\nof reliability and completeness. One of the most interesting architectures that\ndeal with the large amount of emerging data at high velocity is called the\nlambda architecture. In fact, it combines two different processing layers\nnamely batch and speed layers, each providing specific views of data while\nensuring robustness, fast and scalable data processing. However, most papers\ndealing with the lambda architecture are focusing one single type of data\ngenerally produced by a single data source. Besides, the layers of the\narchitecture are implemented independently, or, at best, are combined to\nperform basic processing without assessing either the data reliability or\ncompleteness. Therefore, inspired by the lambda architecture, we propose in\nthis paper a generic multimodal architecture that combines both batch and\nstreaming processing in order to build a complete, global and accurate insight\nin near-real-time based on the knowledge extracted from multiple heterogeneous\nBig Data sources. Our architecture uses batch processing to analyze the data\nstructures and contents, build the learning models and calculate the\nreliability index of the involved sources, while the streaming processing uses\nthe built-in models of the batch layer to immediately process incoming data and\nrapidly provide results. We validate our architecture in the context of urban\ntraffic management systems in order to detect congestions.",

In DDS, a service loop is an\nelemental structure, including its service worker, the service providers and\ncorresponding service targets. The service workers should transport either\nhumans or parcels from the providers to the target locations. Various planning\ntasks within DDS can thus be classified into two individual stages: 1)\nDispatching, which is to form service loops from demand/supply distributions,\nand 2)Routing, which is to decide specific serving orders within the\nconstructed loops. Generating high-quality strategies in both stages is\nimportant to develop DDS but faces several challenging. Meanwhile, deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) has been developed rapidly in recent years. It is\na powerful tool to solve these problems since DRL can learn a parametric model\nwithout relying on too many problem-based assumptions and optimize long-term\neffect by learning sequential decisions. In this survey, we first define DDS,\nthen highlight common applications and important decision/control problems\nwithin. For each problem, we comprehensively introduce the existing DRL\nsolutions, and further summarize them in\n\\textit{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/DDS\\_Survey}.

First, we derive nonasymptotic iteration complexity estimates of exact\nand inexact PPA to minimize convex functions under $\\gamma-$Holderian growth:\n$\\BigO{\\log(1/\\epsilon)}$ (for $\\gamma \\in [1,2]$) and\n$\\BigO{1/\\epsilon^{\\gamma - 2}}$ (for $\\gamma > 2$). In particular, we recover\nwell-known results on exact PPA: finite convergence for sharp minima and linear\nconvergence for quadratic growth, even under presence of inexactness. Second,\nassuming that an usual (proximal) gradient/subgradient method subroutine is\nemployed to compute inexact PPA iteration, we show novel computational\ncomplexity bounds on a restarted variant of the inexact PPA, available when no\ninformation on the growth of the objective function is known. In the numerical\nexperiments we confirm the practical performance and implementability of our\nschemes.",

          "description": "Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging modality that can be conveniently used\nto classify suspicious breast nodules and potentially detect the onset of\nbreast cancer. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) techniques have\nshown promising results in classifying ultrasound images of the breast into\nbenign or malignant. However, CNN inference acts as a black-box model, and as\nsuch, its decision-making is not interpretable. Therefore, increasing effort\nhas been dedicated to explaining this process, most notably through GRAD-CAM\nand other techniques that provide visual explanations into inner workings of\nCNNs. In addition to interpretation, these methods provide clinically important\ninformation, such as identifying the location for biopsy or treatment. In this\nwork, we analyze how adversarial assaults that are practically undetectable may\nbe devised to alter these importance maps dramatically. Furthermore, we will\nshow that this change in the importance maps can come with or without altering\nthe classification result, rendering them even harder to detect. As such, care\nmust be taken when using these importance maps to shed light on the inner\nworkings of deep learning. Finally, we utilize Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and\npropose a new network based on ResNet-50 to improve the classification\naccuracies. Our sensitivity and specificity is comparable to the state of the\nart results.",

          "description": "We study the problem of knowledge tracing (KT) where the goal is to trace the\nstudents' knowledge mastery over time so as to make predictions on their future\nperformance. Owing to the good representation capacity of deep neural networks\n(DNNs), recent advances on KT have increasingly concentrated on exploring DNNs\nto improve the performance of KT. However, we empirically reveal that the DNNs\nbased KT models may run the risk of overfitting, especially on small datasets,\nleading to limited generalization. In this paper, by leveraging the current\nadvances in adversarial training (AT), we propose an efficient AT based KT\nmethod (ATKT) to enhance KT model's generalization and thus push the limit of\nKT. Specifically, we first construct adversarial perturbations and add them on\nthe original interaction embeddings as adversarial examples. The original and\nadversarial examples are further used to jointly train the KT model, forcing it\nis not only to be robust to the adversarial examples, but also to enhance the\ngeneralization over the original ones. To better implement AT, we then present\nan efficient attentive-LSTM model as KT backbone, where the key is a proposed\nknowledge hidden state attention module that adaptively aggregates information\nfrom previous knowledge hidden states while simultaneously highlighting the\nimportance of current knowledge hidden state to make a more accurate\nprediction. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our ATKT achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

          "description": "Radio-frequency fingerprints~(RFFs) are promising solutions for realizing\nlow-cost physical layer authentication. Machine learning-based methods have\nbeen proposed for RFF extraction and discrimination. However, most existing\nmethods are designed for the closed-set scenario where the set of devices is\nremains unchanged. These methods can not be generalized to the RFF\ndiscrimination of unknown devices. To enable the discrimination of RFF from\nboth known and unknown devices, we propose a new end-to-end deep learning\nframework for extracting RFFs from raw received signals. The proposed framework\ncomprises a novel preprocessing module, called neural synchronization~(NS),\nwhich incorporates the data-driven learning with signal processing priors as an\ninductive bias from communication-model based processing. Compared to\ntraditional carrier synchronization techniques, which are static, this module\nestimates offsets by two learnable deep neural networks jointly trained by the\nRFF extractor. Additionally, a hypersphere representation is proposed to\nfurther improve the discrimination of RFF. Theoretical analysis shows that such\na data-and-model framework can better optimize the mutual information between\ndevice identity and the RFF, which naturally leads to better performance.\nExperimental results verify that the proposed RFF significantly outperforms\npurely data-driven DNN-design and existing handcrafted RFF methods in terms of\nboth discrimination and network generalizability.",

DR, an eye\nillness caused by diabetes, can lead to blindness if it is not identified and\ntreated in its early stages. Unfortunately, diagnosis of DR requires medically\ntrained professionals, but Bangladesh has limited specialists in comparison to\nits population. Moreover, the screening process is often expensive, prohibiting\nmany from receiving timely and proper diagnosis. To address the problem, we\nintroduce a deep learning algorithm which screens for different stages of DR.\nWe use a state-of-the-art CNN architecture to diagnose patients based on\nretinal fundus imagery. This paper is an experimental evaluation of the\nalgorithm we developed for DR diagnosis and screening specifically for\nBangladeshi patients. We perform this validation study using separate pools of\nretinal image data of real patients from a hospital and field studies in\nBangladesh. Our results show that the algorithm is effective at screening\nBangladeshi eyes even when trained on a public dataset which is out of domain,\nand can accurately determine the stage of DR as well, achieving an overall\naccuracy of 92.27\\% and 93.02\\% on two validation sets of Bangladeshi eyes. The\nresults confirm the ability of the algorithm to be used in real clinical\nsettings and applications due to its high accuracy and classwise metrics.

The unsupervised open domain\nadaption for generating realistic photos from a hand-drawn sketch is\nchallenging as there is no such sketch of that class for training data. The\nabsence of learning supervision and the huge domain gap between both the\nfreehand drawing and picture domains make it hard. We present an approach that\nlearns both sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation to synthesise the\nmissing freehand drawings from pictures. Due to the domain gap between\nsynthetic sketches and genuine ones, the generator trained on false drawings\nmay produce unsatisfactory results when dealing with drawings of lacking\nclasses. To address this problem, we offer a simple but effective open-domain\nsampling and optimization method that tricks the generator into considering\nfalse drawings as genuine. Our approach generalises the learnt sketch-to-photo\nand photo-to-sketch mappings from in-domain input to open-domain categories.

          "description": "The task of skeleton-based action recognition remains a core challenge in\nhuman-centred scene understanding due to the multiple granularities and large\nvariation in human motion. Existing approaches typically employ a single neural\nrepresentation for different motion patterns, which has difficulty in capturing\nfine-grained action classes given limited training data. To address the\naforementioned problems, we propose a novel multi-granular spatio-temporal\ngraph network for skeleton-based action classification that jointly models the\ncoarse- and fine-grained skeleton motion patterns. To this end, we develop a\ndual-head graph network consisting of two interleaved branches, which enables\nus to extract features at two spatio-temporal resolutions in an effective and\nefficient manner. Moreover, our network utilises a cross-head communication\nstrategy to mutually enhance the representations of both heads. We conducted\nextensive experiments on three large-scale datasets, namely NTU RGB+D 60, NTU\nRGB+D 120, and Kinetics-Skeleton, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance\non all the benchmarks, which validates the effectiveness of our method.",

          "description": "The CP decomposition for high dimensional non-orthogonal spike tensors is an\nimportant problem with broad applications across many disciplines. However,\nprevious works with theoretical guarantee typically assume restrictive\nincoherence conditions on the basis vectors for the CP components. In this\npaper, we propose new computationally efficient composite PCA and concurrent\northogonalization algorithms for tensor CP decomposition with theoretical\nguarantees under mild incoherence conditions. The composite PCA applies the\nprincipal component or singular value decompositions twice, first to a matrix\nunfolding of the tensor data to obtain singular vectors and then to the matrix\nfolding of the singular vectors obtained in the first step. It can be used as\nan initialization for any iterative optimization schemes for the tensor CP\ndecomposition. The concurrent orthogonalization algorithm iteratively estimates\nthe basis vector in each mode of the tensor by simultaneously applying\nprojections to the orthogonal complements of the spaces generated by others CP\ncomponents in other modes. It is designed to improve the alternating least\nsquares estimator and other forms of the high order orthogonal iteration for\ntensors with low or moderately high CP ranks. Our theoretical investigation\nprovides estimation accuracy and statistical convergence rates for the two\nproposed algorithms. Our implementations on synthetic data demonstrate\nsignificant practical superiority of our approach over existing methods.",

          "description": "Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being adopted in a wide variety of\napplication domains. Usually, a well-performing ML model, especially, emerging\ndeep neural network model, relies on a large volume of training data and\nhigh-powered computational resources. The need for a vast volume of available\ndata raises serious privacy concerns because of the risk of leakage of highly\nprivacy-sensitive information and the evolving regulatory environments that\nincreasingly restrict access to and use of privacy-sensitive data. Furthermore,\na trained ML model may also be vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as\nmembership/property inference attacks and model inversion attacks. Hence,\nwell-designed privacy-preserving ML (PPML) solutions are crucial and have\nattracted increasing research interest from academia and industry. More and\nmore efforts of PPML are proposed via integrating privacy-preserving techniques\ninto ML algorithms, fusing privacy-preserving approaches into ML pipeline, or\ndesigning various privacy-preserving architectures for existing ML systems. In\nparticular, existing PPML arts cross-cut ML, system, security, and privacy;\nhence, there is a critical need to understand state-of-art studies, related\nchallenges, and a roadmap for future research. This paper systematically\nreviews and summarizes existing privacy-preserving approaches and proposes a\nPGU model to guide evaluation for various PPML solutions through elaborately\ndecomposing their privacy-preserving functionalities. The PGU model is designed\nas the triad of Phase, Guarantee, and technical Utility. Furthermore, we also\ndiscuss the unique characteristics and challenges of PPML and outline possible\ndirections of future work that benefit a wide range of research communities\namong ML, distributed systems, security, and privacy areas.",

          "description": "The performance of many medical image analysis tasks are strongly associated\nwith image data quality. When developing modern deep learning algorithms,\nrather than relying on subjective (human-based) image quality assessment (IQA),\ntask amenability potentially provides an objective measure of task-specific\nimage quality. To predict task amenability, an IQA agent is trained using\nreinforcement learning (RL) with a simultaneously optimised task predictor,\nsuch as a classification or segmentation neural network. In this work, we\ndevelop transfer learning or adaptation strategies to increase the adaptability\nof both the IQA agent and the task predictor so that they are less dependent on\nhigh-quality, expert-labelled training data. The proposed transfer learning\nstrategy re-formulates the original RL problem for task amenability in a\nmeta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework. The resulting algorithm\nfacilitates efficient adaptation of the agent to different definitions of image\nquality, each with its own Markov decision process environment including\ndifferent images, labels and an adaptable task predictor. Our work demonstrates\nthat the IQA agents pre-trained on non-expert task labels can be adapted to\npredict task amenability as defined by expert task labels, using only a small\nset of expert labels. Using 6644 clinical ultrasound images from 249 prostate\ncancer patients, our results for image classification and segmentation tasks\nshow that the proposed IQA method can be adapted using data with as few as\nrespective 19.7% and 29.6% expert-reviewed consensus labels and still achieve\ncomparable IQA and task performance, which would otherwise require a training\ndataset with 100% expert labels.",

          "description": "Deep learning models achieve strong performance for radiology image\nclassification, but their practical application is bottlenecked by the need for\nlarge labeled training datasets. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches\nleverage small labeled datasets alongside larger unlabeled datasets and offer\npotential for reducing labeling cost. In this work, we introduce NoTeacher, a\nnovel consistency-based SSL framework which incorporates probabilistic\ngraphical models. Unlike Mean Teacher which maintains a teacher network updated\nvia a temporal ensemble, NoTeacher employs two independent networks, thereby\neliminating the need for a teacher network. We demonstrate how NoTeacher can be\ncustomized to handle a range of challenges in radiology image classification.\nSpecifically, we describe adaptations for scenarios with 2D and 3D inputs, uni\nand multi-label classification, and class distribution mismatch between labeled\nand unlabeled portions of the training data. In realistic empirical evaluations\non three public benchmark datasets spanning the workhorse modalities of\nradiology (X-Ray, CT, MRI), we show that NoTeacher achieves over 90-95% of the\nfully supervised AUROC with less than 5-15% labeling budget. Further, NoTeacher\noutperforms established SSL methods with minimal hyperparameter tuning, and has\nimplications as a principled and practical option for semisupervised learning\nin radiology applications.",

          "description": "For the past ten years, CNN has reigned supreme in the world of computer\nvision, but recently, Transformer is on the rise. However, the quadratic\ncomputational cost of self-attention has become a severe problem of practice.\nThere has been much research on architectures without CNN and self-attention in\nthis context. In particular, MLP-Mixer is a simple idea designed using MLPs and\nhit an accuracy comparable to the Vision Transformer. However, the only\ninductive bias in this architecture is the embedding of tokens. Thus, there is\nstill a possibility to build a non-convolutional inductive bias into the\narchitecture itself, and we built in an inductive bias using two simple ideas.\nA way is to divide the token-mixing block vertically and horizontally. Another\nway is to make spatial correlations denser among some channels of token-mixing.\nWith this approach, we were able to improve the accuracy of the MLP-Mixer while\nreducing its parameters and computational complexity. Compared to other\nMLP-based models, the proposed model, named RaftMLP has a good balance of\ncomputational complexity, the number of parameters, and actual memory usage. In\naddition, our work indicates that MLP-based models have the potential to\nreplace CNNs by adopting inductive bias.

          "description": "Due to the limited availability and high cost of the reverse\ntranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, many studies have\nproposed machine learning techniques for detecting COVID-19 from medical\nimaging. The purpose of this study is to systematically review, assess, and\nsynthesize research articles that have used different machine learning\ntechniques to detect and diagnose COVID-19 from chest X-ray and CT scan images.\nA structured literature search was conducted in the relevant bibliographic\ndatabases to ensure that the survey solely centered on reproducible and\nhigh-quality research. We selected papers based on our inclusion criteria. In\nthis survey, we reviewed $98$ articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria.\nWe have surveyed a complete pipeline of chest imaging analysis techniques\nrelated to COVID-19, including data collection, pre-processing, feature\nextraction, classification, and visualization. We have considered CT scans and\nX-rays as both are widely used to describe the latest developments in medical\nimaging to detect COVID-19. This survey provides researchers with valuable\ninsights into different machine learning techniques and their performance in\nthe detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest imaging. At the end, the\nchallenges and limitations in detecting COVID-19 using machine learning\ntechniques and the future direction of research are discussed.",

          "description": "The neuroimage analysis community has neglected the automated segmentation of\nthe olfactory bulb (OB) despite its crucial role in olfactory function. The\nlack of an automatic processing method for the OB can be explained by its\nchallenging properties. Nonetheless, recent advances in MRI acquisition\ntechniques and resolution have allowed raters to generate more reliable manual\nannotations. Furthermore, the high accuracy of deep learning methods for\nsolving semantic segmentation problems provides us with an option to reliably\nassess even small structures. In this work, we introduce a novel, fast, and\nfully automated deep learning pipeline to accurately segment OB tissue on\nsub-millimeter T2-weighted (T2w) whole-brain MR images. To this end, we\ndesigned a three-stage pipeline: (1) Localization of a region containing both\nOBs using FastSurferCNN, (2) Segmentation of OB tissue within the localized\nregion through four independent AttFastSurferCNN - a novel deep learning\narchitecture with a self-attention mechanism to improve modeling of contextual\ninformation, and (3) Ensemble of the predicted label maps. The OB pipeline\nexhibits high performance in terms of boundary delineation, OB localization,\nand volume estimation across a wide range of ages in 203 participants of the\nRhineland Study. Moreover, it also generalizes to scans of an independent\ndataset never encountered during training, the Human Connectome Project (HCP),\nwith different acquisition parameters and demographics, evaluated in 30 cases\nat the native 0.7mm HCP resolution, and the default 0.8mm pipeline resolution.\nWe extensively validated our pipeline not only with respect to segmentation\naccuracy but also to known OB volume effects, where it can sensitively\nreplicate age effects.",

          "description": "Analysing correlations between streams of events is an important problem. It\narises for example in Neurosciences, when the connectivity of neurons should be\ninferred from spike trains that record neurons' individual spiking activity.\nWhile recently some approaches for inferring delayed synaptic connections have\nbeen proposed, they are limited in the types of connectivities and delays they\nare able to handle, or require computation-intensive procedures. This paper\nproposes a faster and more flexible approach for analysing such delayed\ncorrelated activity: a statistical approach for the Analysis of Connectivity in\nspiking Events (ACE), based on the idea of hypothesis testing. It first\ncomputes for any pair of a source and a target neuron the inter-spike delays\nbetween subsequent source- and target-spikes. Then, it derives a null model for\nthe distribution of inter-spike delays for \\emph{uncorrelated}~neurons.\nFinally, it compares the observed distribution of inter-spike delays to this\nnull model and infers pairwise connectivity based on the Pearson's Chi-squared\ntest statistic. Thus, ACE is capable to detect connections with a priori\nunknown, non-discrete (and potentially large) inter-spike delays, which might\nvary between pairs of neurons. Since ACE works incrementally, it has potential\nfor being used in online processing. In our experiments, we visualise the\nadvantages of ACE in varying experimental scenarios (except for one special\ncase) and in a state-of-the-art dataset which has been generated for\nneuro-scientific research under most realistic conditions.",

          "description": "The Influenza virus can be considered as one of the most severe viruses that\ncan infect multiple species with often fatal consequences to the hosts. The\nHemagglutinin (HA) gene of the virus can be a target for antiviral drug\ndevelopment realised through accurate identification of its sub-types and\npossible the targeted hosts. This paper focuses on accurately predicting if an\nInfluenza type A virus can infect specific hosts, and more specifically, Human,\nAvian and Swine hosts, using only the protein sequence of the HA gene. In more\ndetail, we propose encoding the protein sequences into numerical signals using\nthe Hydrophobicity Index and subsequently utilising a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork-based predictive model. The Influenza HA protein sequences used in the\nproposed work are obtained from the Influenza Research Database (IRD).\nSpecifically, complete and unique HA protein sequences were used for avian,\nhuman and swine hosts. The data obtained for this work was 17999 human-host\nproteins, 17667 avian-host proteins and 9278 swine-host proteins. Given this\nset of collected proteins, the proposed method yields as much as 10% higher\naccuracy for an individual class (namely, Avian) and 5% higher overall accuracy\nthan in an earlier study. It is also observed that the accuracy for each class\nin this work is more balanced than what was presented in this earlier study. As\nthe results show, the proposed model can distinguish HA protein sequences with\nhigh accuracy whenever the virus under investigation can infect Human, Avian or\nSwine hosts.",

          "description": "Geohazards such as landslides have caused great losses to the safety of\npeople's lives and property, which is often accompanied with surface cracks. If\nsuch surface cracks could be identified in time, it is of great significance\nfor the monitoring and early warning of geohazards. Currently, the most common\nmethod for crack identification is manual detection, which is with low\nefficiency and accuracy. In this paper, a deep transfer learning framework is\nproposed to effectively and efficiently identify slope surface cracks for the\nsake of fast monitoring and early warning of geohazards such as landslides. The\nessential idea is to employ transfer learning by training (a) the large sample\ndataset of concrete cracks and (b) the small sample dataset of soil and rock\nmasses cracks. In the proposed framework, (1) pretrained cracks identification\nmodels are constructed based on the large sample dataset of concrete cracks;\n(2) refined cracks identification models are further constructed based on the\nsmall sample dataset of soil and rock masses cracks. The proposed framework\ncould be applied to conduct UAV surveys on high-steep slopes to realize the\nmonitoring and early warning of landslides to ensure the safety of people's\nlives and property.",
