          "description": "The knowledge of scripts, common chains of events in stereotypical scenarios,\nis a valuable asset for task-oriented natural language understanding systems.\nWe propose the Goal-Oriented Script Construction task, where a model produces a\nsequence of steps to accomplish a given goal. We pilot our task on the first\nmultilingual script learning dataset supporting 18 languages collected from\nwikiHow, a website containing half a million how-to articles. For baselines, we\nconsider both a generation-based approach using a language model and a\nretrieval-based approach by first retrieving the relevant steps from a large\ncandidate pool and then ordering them. We show that our task is practical,\nfeasible but challenging for state-of-the-art Transformer models, and that our\nmethods can be readily deployed for various other datasets and domains with\ndecent zero-shot performance.",

          "description": "Dialogue systems research is traditionally focused on dialogues between two\ninterlocutors, largely ignoring group conversations. Moreover, most previous\nresearch is focused either on task-oriented dialogue (e.g.\\ restaurant\nbookings) or user engagement (chatbots), while research on systems for\ncollaborative dialogues is an under-explored area. To this end, we introduce\nthe first publicly available dataset containing collaborative conversations on\nsolving a cognitive task, consisting of 500 group dialogues and 14k utterances.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel annotation schema that captures deliberation\ncues and release 50 dialogues annotated with it. Finally, we demonstrate the\nusefulness of the annotated data in training classifiers to predict the\nconstructiveness of a conversation.

          "description": "Recent improvements in the predictive quality of natural language processing\nsystems are often dependent on a substantial increase in the number of model\nparameters. This has led to various attempts of compressing such models, but\nexisting methods have not considered the differences in the predictive power of\nvarious model components or in the generalizability of the compressed models.\nTo understand the connection between model compression and out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, we define the task of compressing language representation\nmodels such that they perform best in a domain adaptation setting. We choose to\naddress this problem from a causal perspective, attempting to estimate the\naverage treatment effect (ATE) of a model component, such as a single layer, on\nthe model's predictions. Our proposed ATE-guided Model Compression scheme\n(AMoC), generates many model candidates, differing by the model components that\nwere removed. Then, we select the best candidate through a stepwise regression\nmodel that utilizes the ATE to predict the expected performance on the target\ndomain. AMoC outperforms strong baselines on dozens of domain pairs across\nthree text classification and sequence tagging tasks.",

          "description": "Large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) such as BERT and GPT have recently\nachieved great success and become a milestone in the field of artificial\nintelligence (AI). Owing to sophisticated pre-training objectives and huge\nmodel parameters, large-scale PTMs can effectively capture knowledge from\nmassive labeled and unlabeled data. By storing knowledge into huge parameters\nand fine-tuning on specific tasks, the rich knowledge implicitly encoded in\nhuge parameters can benefit a variety of downstream tasks, which has been\nextensively demonstrated via experimental verification and empirical analysis.\nIt is now the consensus of the AI community to adopt PTMs as backbone for\ndownstream tasks rather than learning models from scratch. In this paper, we\ntake a deep look into the history of pre-training, especially its special\nrelation with transfer learning and self-supervised learning, to reveal the\ncrucial position of PTMs in the AI development spectrum. Further, we\ncomprehensively review the latest breakthroughs of PTMs. These breakthroughs\nare driven by the surge of computational power and the increasing availability\nof data, towards four important directions: designing effective architectures,\nutilizing rich contexts, improving computational efficiency, and conducting\ninterpretation and theoretical analysis. Finally, we discuss a series of open\nproblems and research directions of PTMs, and hope our view can inspire and\nadvance the future study of PTMs.",

          "description": "Medical imaging technologies, including computed tomography (CT) or chest\nX-Ray (CXR), are largely employed to facilitate the diagnosis of the COVID-19.\nSince manual report writing is usually too time-consuming, a more intelligent\nauxiliary medical system that could generate medical reports automatically and\nimmediately is urgently needed. In this article, we propose to use the medical\nvisual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the\nCOVID-19 scans and generate the medical report automatically based on the\ndetected lesion regions. To produce more accurate medical reports and minimize\nthe visual-and-linguistic differences, this model adopts an alternate learning\nstrategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.\nTo be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the\nknowledge from medical texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize\nthe acquired knowledge for professional medical sentences generations through\nobservations of medical images. In practice, for automatic medical report\ngeneration on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical\nfindings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital\nof Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun\nYat-sen University, Zhuhai, China. Besides, to alleviate the insufficiency of\nthe COVID-19 training samples, our model was first trained on the large-scale\nChinese CX-CHR dataset and then transferred to the COVID-19 CT dataset for\nfurther fine-tuning. The experimental results showed that Medical-VLBERT\nachieved state-of-the-art performances on terminology prediction and report\ngeneration with the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset and the CX-CHR dataset.

          "description": "Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDoH) have important roles in\nshaping people's health. In clinical research studies, especially comparative\neffectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially\ncause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical\nanalyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies\nto examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured\nSBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much\nof the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language\nprocessing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from\nunstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system\nfocusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH\nconcepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract\nSBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the\ndifference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured\nEHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the\nInternational Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show\nthat the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of\n0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH\ninformation and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864\npatients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more\ndetailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only\ncaptured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical\nnarratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of\npatients' SBDoH factors.",

          "description": "Interpretability methods like Integrated Gradient and LIME are popular\nchoices for explaining natural language model predictions with relative word\nimportance scores. These interpretations need to be robust for trustworthy NLP\napplications in high-stake areas like medicine or finance. Our paper\ndemonstrates how interpretations can be manipulated by making simple word\nperturbations on an input text. Via a small portion of word-level swaps, these\nadversarial perturbations aim to make the resulting text semantically and\nspatially similar to its seed input (therefore sharing similar\ninterpretations). Simultaneously, the generated examples achieve the same\nprediction label as the seed yet are given a substantially different\nexplanation by the interpretation methods. Our experiments generate fragile\ninterpretations to attack two SOTA interpretation methods, across three popular\nTransformer models and on two different NLP datasets. We observe that the rank\norder correlation drops by over 20% when less than 10% of words are perturbed\non average. Further, rank-order correlation keeps decreasing as more words get\nperturbed.

          "description": "Handwritten mathematical expressions (HMEs) contain ambiguities in their\ninterpretations, even for humans sometimes. Several math symbols are very\nsimilar in the writing style, such as dot and comma or 0, O, and o, which is a\nchallenge for HME recognition systems to handle without using contextual\ninformation. To address this problem, this paper presents a Transformer-based\nMath Language Model (TMLM). Based on the self-attention mechanism, the\nhigh-level representation of an input token in a sequence of tokens is computed\nby how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long\ndependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical\nexpression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of\napproximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the\nperplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e.,\nthe N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we\ncombine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition\nsystem using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates. The\nexpression rates on the testing sets of CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 were\nimproved by 2.97 and 0.83 percentage points, respectively.",

          "description": "We introduce a new domain expert mixture (DEMix) layer that enables\nconditioning a language model (LM) on the domain of the input text. A DEMix\nlayer is a collection of expert feedforward networks, each specialized to a\ndomain, that makes the LM modular: experts can be mixed, added or removed after\ninitial training. Extensive experiments with autoregressive transformer LMs (up\nto 1.3B parameters) show that DEMix layers reduce test-time perplexity,\nincrease training efficiency, and enable rapid adaptation with little overhead.\nWe show that mixing experts during inference, using a parameter-free weighted\nensemble, allows the model to better generalize to heterogeneous or unseen\ndomains. We also show that experts can be added to iteratively incorporate new\ndomains without forgetting older ones, and that experts can be removed to\nrestrict access to unwanted domains, without additional training. Overall,\nthese results demonstrate benefits of explicitly conditioning on textual\ndomains during language modeling.",

          "description": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have become increasingly more\ncomplex and widespread. With recent developments in neural networks, a growing\nconcern is whether it is responsible to use these models. Concerns such as\nsafety and ethics can be partially addressed by providing explanations.\nFurthermore, when models do fail, providing explanations is paramount for\naccountability purposes. To this end, interpretability serves to provide these\nexplanations in terms that are understandable to humans. Central to what is\nunderstandable is how explanations are communicated. Therefore, this survey\nprovides a categorization of how recent interpretability methods communicate\nexplanations and discusses the methods in depth. Furthermore, the survey\nfocuses on post-hoc methods, which provide explanations after a model is\nlearned and generally model-agnostic. A common concern for this class of\nmethods is whether they accurately reflect the model. Hence, how these post-hoc\nmethods are evaluated is discussed throughout the paper.",

Prior studies show that pre-trained V&L\nmodels can significantly improve the model performance for downstream tasks\nsuch as Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, V&L models are less effective\nwhen applied in the medical domain (e.g., on X-ray images and clinical notes)\ndue to the domain gap. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of applying\npre-trained V&L models in medical applications. In particular, we identify that\nthe visual representation in general V&L models is not suitable for processing\nmedical data. To overcome this limitation, we propose BERTHop, a\ntransformer-based model based on PixelHop++ and VisualBERT, for better\ncapturing the associations between the two modalities. Experiments on the OpenI\ndataset, a commonly used thoracic disease diagnosis benchmark, show that\nBERTHop achieves an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 98.12% which is 1.62%\nhigher than state-of-the-art (SOTA) while it is trained on a 9 times smaller\ndataset.",

The dataset consists of 6,176 user-generated comments in code mixed\nKannada scraped from YouTube and manually annotated as bearing hope speech or\nNot-hope speech. In addition, we introduce DC-BERT4HOPE, a dual-channel model\nthat uses the English translation of KanHope for additional training to promote\nhope speech detection. The approach achieves a weighted F1-score of 0.756,\nbettering other models. Henceforth, KanHope aims to instigate research in\nKannada while broadly promoting researchers to take a pragmatic approach\ntowards online content that encourages, positive, and supportive.",

          "description": "Understanding documents from their visual snapshots is an emerging problem\nthat requires both advanced computer vision and NLP methods. The recent advance\nin OCR enables the accurate recognition of text blocks, yet it is still\nchallenging to extract key information from documents due to the diversity of\ntheir layouts. Although recent studies on pre-trained language models show the\nimportance of incorporating layout information on this task, the conjugation of\ntexts and their layouts still follows the style of BERT optimized for\nunderstanding the 1D text. This implies there is room for further improvement\nconsidering the 2D nature of text layouts. This paper introduces a pre-trained\nlanguage model, BERT Relying On Spatiality (BROS), which effectively utilizes\nthe information included in individual text blocks and their layouts.\nSpecifically, BROS encodes spatial information by utilizing relative positions\nand learns spatial dependencies between OCR blocks with a novel area-masking\nstrategy. These two novel approaches lead to an efficient encoding of spatial\nlayout information highlighted by the robust performance of BROS under\nlow-resource environments. We also introduce a general-purpose parser that can\nbe combined with BROS to extract key information even when there is no order\ninformation between text blocks. BROS shows its superiority on four public\nbenchmarks---FUNSD, SROIE*, CORD, and SciTSR---and its robustness in practical\ncases where order information of text blocks is not available. Further\nexperiments with a varying number of training examples demonstrate the high\ntraining efficiency of our approach. Our code will be open to the public.",

We propose\nstudying human perception of spoken communication as a means to better\nunderstand how information is encoded across these channels, focusing on the\nquestion 'What characteristics of communicative context affect listener's\nexpectations of speech?'. To investigate this, we present a novel behavioural\ntask testing whether listeners can discriminate between the true utterance in a\ndialogue and utterances sampled from other contexts with the same lexical\ncontent. We characterize how perception - and subsequent discriminative\ncapability - is affected by different degrees of additional contextual\ninformation across both the lexical and non-lexical channel of speech. Results\ndemonstrate that people can effectively discriminate between different prosodic\nrealisations, that non-lexical context is informative, and that this channel\nprovides more salient information than the lexical channel, highlighting the\nimportance of the non-lexical channel in spoken interaction.",

          "description": "Conventional Intent Detection (ID) models are usually trained offline, which\nrelies on a fixed dataset and a predefined set of intent classes. However, in\nreal-world applications, online systems usually involve continually emerging\nnew user intents, which pose a great challenge to the offline training\nparadigm. Recently, lifelong learning has received increasing attention and is\nconsidered to be the most promising solution to this challenge. In this paper,\nwe propose Lifelong Intent Detection (LID), which continually trains an ID\nmodel on new data to learn newly emerging intents while avoiding\ncatastrophically forgetting old data. Nevertheless, we find that existing\nlifelong learning methods usually suffer from a serious imbalance between old\nand new data in the LID task. Therefore, we propose a novel lifelong learning\nmethod, Multi-Strategy Rebalancing (MSR), which consists of cosine\nnormalization, hierarchical knowledge distillation, and inter-class margin loss\nto alleviate the multiple negative effects of the imbalance problem.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which\nsignificantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods\non the ATIS, SNIPS, HWU64, and CLINC150 benchmarks.",

This prevents practitioners from improving translation quality\nthrough better search, as these idiosyncratic translations end up being\nselected by the decoding algorithm, a problem known as the beam search curse.\nRecently, a sampling-based approximation to minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding\nhas been proposed as an alternative decision rule for NMT that would likely not\nsuffer from the same problems. We analyse this approximation and establish that\nit has no equivalent to the beam search curse, i.e. better search always leads\nto better translations. We also design different approximations aimed at\ndecoupling the cost of exploration from the cost of robust estimation of\nexpected utility. This allows for exploration of much larger hypothesis spaces,\nwhich we show to be beneficial.

          "description": "Multi-head attention, a collection of several attention mechanisms that\nindependently attend to different parts of the input, is the key ingredient in\nthe Transformer (Vaswaniet al., 2017). Recent work has shown, however, that a\nlarge proportion of the heads in a Transformer's multi-head attention mechanism\ncan be safely pruned away without significantly harming the performance of the\nmodel; such pruning leads to models that are noticeably smaller and faster in\npractice. Our work introduces a new head pruning technique that we term\ndifferentiable subset pruning. Intuitively, our method learns per-head\nimportance variables and then enforces a user-specified hard constraint on the\nnumber of unpruned heads. The importance variables are learned via stochastic\ngradient descent. We conduct experiments on natural language inference and\nmachine translation; we show that differentiable subset pruning performs\ncomparably or better than Voita et al.

We show that RIDER, despite its simplicity, achieves 10 to 20\nabsolute gains in top-1 retrieval accuracy and 1 to 4 Exact Match (EM) gains\nwithout refining the retriever or reader. In addition, RIDER, without any\ntraining, outperforms state-of-the-art transformer-based supervised rerankers.\nRemarkably, RIDER achieves 48.3 EM on the Natural Questions dataset and 66.4 EM\non the TriviaQA dataset when only 1,024 tokens (7.8 passages on average) are\nused as the reader input after passage reranking.",

          "description": "Neural text generation models are typically trained by maximizing\nlog-likelihood with the sequence cross entropy loss, which encourages an exact\ntoken-by-token match between a target sequence with a generated sequence. Such\ntraining objective is sub-optimal when the target sequence not perfect, e.g.,\nwhen the target sequence is corrupted with noises, or when only weak sequence\nsupervision is available. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nEdit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL), which computes the matching loss of a\ntarget n-gram with all n-grams in the generated sequence. EISL draws\ninspirations from convolutional networks (ConvNets) which are shift-invariant\nto images, hence is robust to the shift of n-grams to tolerate edits in the\ntarget sequences. Moreover, the computation of EISL is essentially a\nconvolution operation with target n-grams as kernels, which is easy to\nimplement with existing libraries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EISL, we\nconduct experiments on three tasks: machine translation with noisy target\nsequences, unsupervised text style transfer, and non-autoregressive machine\ntranslation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms\ncross entropy loss on these three tasks.",

          "description": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can achieve promising results with outrageous\nlarge amount of parameters but constant computation cost, and thus it has\nbecome a trend in model scaling. Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring\nquality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this\nwork, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe\nthat load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,\ncontrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely\nactivated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can\nsignificantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step\nforward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits\nexperts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This\nstrategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,\nand our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is\nmore effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$\ntrillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in\ncomparison with the recent SOTAs on $2048$ TPU cores.

However, existing pre-trained models lack of causal\nknowledge which prevents today's NLP systems from thinking like humans. In this\npaper, we investigate the problem of injecting causal knowledge into\npre-trained models. There are two fundamental problems: 1) how to collect\nvarious granularities of causal pairs from unstructured texts; 2) how to\neffectively inject causal knowledge into pre-trained models. To address these\nissues, we extend the idea of CausalBERT from previous studies, and conduct\nexperiments on various datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. In addition, we\nadopt a regularization-based method to preserve the already learned knowledge\nwith an extra regularization term while injecting causal knowledge. Extensive\nexperiments on 7 datasets, including four causal pair classification tasks, two\ncausal QA tasks and a causal inference task, demonstrate that CausalBERT\ncaptures rich causal knowledge and outperforms all pre-trained models-based\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving a new causal inference benchmark.",

          "description": "The syntactic behaviour of texts can highly vary depending on their contexts\n(e.g. author, genre, etc.). From the standpoint of stylometry, it can be\nhelpful to objectively measure this behaviour. In this paper, we discuss how\ncoalgebras are used to formalise the notion of behaviour by embedding syntactic\nfeatures of a given text into probabilistic transition systems. By introducing\nthe behavioural distance, we are then able to quantitatively measure\ndifferences between points in these systems and thus, comparing features of\ndifferent texts. Furthermore, the behavioural distance of points can be\napproximated by a polynomial-time algorithm.",

To answer these\nquestions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a\nnew English-French dataset comprising supporting context words for 14K\ntranslations that professional translators found useful for pronoun\ndisambiguation. Using SCAT, we perform an in-depth analysis of the context used\nto disambiguate, examining positional and lexical characteristics of the\nsupporting words.

          "description": "The exponential growths of social media and micro-blogging sites not only\nprovide platforms for empowering freedom of expressions and individual voices,\nbut also enables people to express anti-social behaviour like online\nharassment, cyberbullying, and hate speech. Numerous works have been proposed\nto utilize textual data for social and anti-social behaviour analysis, by\npredicting the contexts mostly for highly-resourced languages like English.\nHowever, some languages are under-resourced, e.g., South Asian languages like\nBengali, that lack computational resources for accurate natural language\nprocessing (NLP). In this paper, we propose an explainable approach for hate\nspeech detection from the under-resourced Bengali language, which we called\nDeepHateExplainer. Bengali texts are first comprehensively preprocessed, before\nclassifying them into political, personal, geopolitical, and religious hates\nusing a neural ensemble method of transformer-based neural architectures (i.e.,\nmonolingual Bangla BERT-base, multilingual BERT-cased/uncased, and\nXLM-RoBERTa). Important(most and least) terms are then identified using\nsensitivity analysis and layer-wise relevance propagation(LRP), before\nproviding human-interpretable explanations. Finally, we compute\ncomprehensiveness and sufficiency scores to measure the quality of explanations\nw.r.t faithfulness. Evaluations against machine learning~(linear and tree-based\nmodels) and neural networks (i.e., CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM with word\nembeddings) baselines yield F1-scores of 78%, 91%, 89%, and 84%, for political,\npersonal, geopolitical, and religious hates, respectively, outperforming both\nML and DNN baselines.",

This paper sets a framework for future analysis in\nunderstanding the opinions of the public during a pandemic and how these\nopinions can be distilled [in a semi-automated approach] to inform government\ncommunication in the future.",

Various data\nmodelling methods create different possibilities in feature extraction and\nturning them into beneficial information. The variety of modalities included in\ndata plays a significant part in predicting the results. We try to explore the\nsignificance of visual features of images in classifying memes. Memes are a\nblend of both image and text, where the text is embedded into the image. We try\nto incorporate the memes as troll and non-trolling memes based on the images\nand the text on them. However, the images are to be analysed and combined with\nthe text to increase performance. Our work illustrates different textual\nanalysis methods and contrasting multimodal methods ranging from simple merging\nto cross attention to utilising both worlds' - best visual and textual\nfeatures.

To monitor the pandemic trend, existing studies rely on\nthe aggregation of traditional statistical models and epidemic spread theory.\nIn other words, historical statistics of COVID-19, as well as the population\nmobility data, become the essential knowledge for monitoring the pandemic\ntrend. However, these solutions can barely provide precise prediction and\nsatisfactory explanations on the long-term disease surveillance while the\nubiquitous social media resources can be the key enabler for solving this\nproblem. For example, serious discussions may occur on social media before and\nafter some breaking events take place. These events, such as marathon and\nparade, may impact the spread of the virus. To take advantage of the social\nmedia data, we propose a novel framework, Social Media enhAnced pandemic\nsuRveillance Technique (SMART), which is composed of two modules: (i)\ninformation extraction module to construct heterogeneous knowledge graphs based\non the extracted events and relationships among them; (ii) time series\nprediction module to provide both short-term and long-term forecasts of the\nconfirmed cases and fatality at the state-level in the United States and to\ndiscover risk factors for COVID-19 interventions.

Motivated by this question, we aim at constructing an\ninformative prior over neural weights, in order to adapt quickly to held-out\nlanguages in the task of character-level language modeling. We infer this\ndistribution from a sample of typologically diverse training languages via\nLaplace approximation. The use of such a prior outperforms baseline models with\nan uninformative prior (so-called \"fine-tuning\") in both zero-shot and few-shot\nsettings. This shows that the prior is imbued with universal phonological\nknowledge. Moreover, we harness additional language-specific side information\nas distant supervision for held-out languages. Specifically, we condition\nlanguage models on features from typological databases, by concatenating them\nto hidden states or generating weights with hyper-networks. These features\nappear beneficial in the few-shot setting, but not in the zero-shot setting.\nSince the paucity of digital texts affects the majority of the world's\nlanguages, we hope that these findings will help broaden the scope of\napplications for language technology.",

          "description": "The capabilities of natural language models trained on large-scale data have\nincreased immensely over the past few years. Open source libraries such as\nHuggingFace have made these models easily available and accessible. While prior\nresearch has identified biases in large language models, this paper considers\nbiases contained in the most popular versions of these models when applied\n`out-of-the-box' for downstream tasks. We focus on generative language models\nas they are well-suited for extracting biases inherited from training data.\nSpecifically, we conduct an in-depth analysis of GPT-2, which is the most\ndownloaded text generation model on HuggingFace, with over half a million\ndownloads in the past month alone. We assess biases related to occupational\nassociations for different protected categories by intersecting gender with\nreligion, sexuality, ethnicity, political affiliation, and continental name\norigin. Using a template-based data collection pipeline, we collect 396K\nsentence completions made by GPT-2 and find: (i) The machine-predicted jobs are\nless diverse and more stereotypical for women than for men, especially for\nintersections; (ii) Intersectional interactions are highly relevant for\noccupational associations, which we quantify by fitting 262 logistic models;\n(iii) For most occupations, GPT-2 reflects the skewed gender and ethnicity\ndistribution found in US Labour Bureau data, and even pulls the\nsocietally-skewed distribution towards gender parity in cases where its\npredictions deviate from real labor market observations. This raises the\nnormative question of what language models _should_ learn - whether they should\nreflect or correct for existing inequalities.",

          "description": "Sentence semantic matching requires an agent to determine the semantic\nrelation between two sentences, which is widely used in various natural\nlanguage tasks, such as Natural Language Inference (NLI), Paraphrase\nIdentification (PI), and so on. Much recent progress has been made in this\narea, especially attention-based methods and pre-trained language model based\nmethods. However, most of these methods focus on all the important parts in\nsentences in a static way and only emphasize how important the words are to the\nquery, inhibiting the ability of attention mechanism. In order to overcome this\nproblem and boost the performance of attention mechanism, we propose a novel\ndynamic re-read attention, which can pay close attention to one small region of\nsentences at each step and re-read the important parts for better sentence\nrepresentations. Based on this attention variation, we develop a novel Dynamic\nRe-read Network (DRr-Net) for sentence semantic matching. Moreover, selecting\none small region in dynamic re-read attention seems insufficient for sentence\nsemantics, and employing pre-trained language models as input encoders will\nintroduce incomplete and fragile representation problems. To this end, we\nextend DRrNet to Locally-Aware Dynamic Re-read Attention Net (LadRa-Net), in\nwhich local structure of sentences is employed to alleviate the shortcoming of\nByte-Pair Encoding (BPE) in pre-trained language models and boost the\nperformance of dynamic reread attention. Extensive experiments on two popular\nsentence semantic matching tasks demonstrate that DRr-Net can significantly\nimprove the performance of sentence semantic matching. Meanwhile, LadRa-Net is\nable to achieve better performance by considering the local structures of\nsentences. In addition, it is exceedingly interesting that some discoveries in\nour experiments are consistent with some findings of psychological research.",

Using natural language processing of historical text, we found\nevidence for semantic change in emotion words over the past century and that\nvarying rates of change were predicted in part by an emotion concept's\nprototypicality - how representative it is of the broader category of\n\"emotion\". Prototypicality negatively correlated with historical rates of\nemotion semantic change obtained from text-based word embeddings, beyond more\nestablished variables including usage frequency in English and a second\ncomparison language, French. This effect for prototypicality did not\nconsistently extend to the semantic category of birds, suggesting its relevance\nfor predicting semantic change may be category-dependent.

          "description": "The current state-of-the-art generative models for open-domain question\nanswering (ODQA) have focused on generating direct answers from unstructured\ntextual information. However, a large amount of world's knowledge is stored in\nstructured databases, and need to be accessed using query languages such as\nSQL. Furthermore, query languages can answer questions that require complex\nreasoning, as well as offering full explainability. In this paper, we propose a\nhybrid framework that takes both textual and tabular evidence as input and\ngenerates either direct answers or SQL queries depending on which form could\nbetter answer the question. The generated SQL queries can then be executed on\nthe associated databases to obtain the final answers. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first paper that applies Text2SQL to ODQA tasks.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that on several ODQA datasets, the hybrid methods\nconsistently outperforms the baseline models that only take homogeneous input\nby a large margin. Specifically we achieve state-of-the-art performance on\nOpenSQuAD dataset using a T5-base model. In a detailed analysis, we demonstrate\nthat the being able to generate structural SQL queries can always bring gains,\nespecially for those questions that requires complex reasoning.",

          "description": "Structured text understanding on Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) is a crucial\npart of Document Intelligence. Due to the complexity of content and layout in\nVRDs, structured text understanding has been a challenging task. Most existing\nstudies decoupled this problem into two sub-tasks: entity labeling and entity\nlinking, which require an entire understanding of the context of documents at\nboth token and segment levels. However, little work has been concerned with the\nsolutions that efficiently extract the structured data from different levels.\nThis paper proposes a unified framework named StrucTexT, which is flexible and\neffective for handling both sub-tasks. Specifically, based on the transformer,\nwe introduce a segment-token aligned encoder to deal with the entity labeling\nand entity linking tasks at different levels of granularity. Moreover, we\ndesign a novel pre-training strategy with three self-supervised tasks to learn\na richer representation. StrucTexT uses the existing Masked Visual Language\nModeling task and the new Sentence Length Prediction and Paired Boxes Direction\ntasks to incorporate the multi-modal information across text, image, and\nlayout. We evaluate our method for structured text understanding at\nsegment-level and token-level and show it outperforms the state-of-the-art\ncounterparts with significantly superior performance on the FUNSD, SROIE, and\nEPHOIE datasets.",

          "description": "Recall the classical text generation works, the generation framework can be\nbriefly divided into two phases: \\textbf{idea reasoning} and \\textbf{surface\nrealization}. The target of idea reasoning is to figure out the main idea which\nwill be presented in the following talking/writing periods. Surface realization\naims to arrange the most appropriate sentence to depict and convey the\ninformation distilled from the main idea. However, the current popular\ntoken-by-token text generation methods ignore this crucial process and suffer\nfrom many serious issues, such as idea/topic drift. To tackle the problems and\nrealize this two-phase paradigm, we propose a new framework named Sentence\nSemantic Regression (\\textbf{SSR}) based on sentence-level language modeling.\nFor idea reasoning, two architectures \\textbf{SSR-AR} and \\textbf{SSR-NonAR}\nare designed to conduct sentence semantic regression autoregressively (like\nGPT2/3) and bidirectionally (like BERT). In the phase of surface realization, a\nmixed-granularity sentence decoder is designed to generate text with better\nconsistency by jointly incorporating the predicted sentence-level main idea as\nwell as the preceding contextual token-level information. We conduct\nexperiments on four tasks of story ending prediction, story ending generation,\ndialogue generation, and sentence infilling. The results show that SSR can\nobtain better performance in terms of automatic metrics and human evaluation.",

In this paper, we study how to\nconstruct effective explainable product search by comparing model-agnostic\nexplanation paradigms with model-intrinsic paradigms and analyzing the\nimportant factors that determine the performance of product search\nexplanations. We propose an explainable product search model with\nmodel-intrinsic interpretability and conduct crowdsourcing to compare it with\nthe state-of-the-art explainable product search model with model-agnostic\ninterpretability. We observe that both paradigms have their own advantages and\nthe effectiveness of search explanations on different properties are affected\nby different factors. For example, explanation fidelity is more important for\nuser's overall satisfaction on the system while explanation novelty may be more\nuseful in attracting user purchases. These findings could have important\nimplications for the future studies and design of explainable product search\nengines.",

          "description": "Being light-weight and cost-effective, IR-based approaches for bug\nlocalization have shown promise in finding software bugs. However, the accuracy\nof these approaches heavily depends on their used bug reports. A significant\nnumber of bug reports contain only plain natural language texts. According to\nexisting studies, IR-based approaches cannot perform well when they use these\nbug reports as search queries. On the other hand, there is a piece of recent\nevidence that suggests that even these natural language-only reports contain\nenough good keywords that could help localize the bugs successfully. On one\nhand, these findings suggest that natural language-only bug reports might be a\nsufficient source for good query keywords. On the other hand, they cast serious\ndoubt on the query selection practices in the IR-based bug localization. In\nthis article, we attempted to clear the sky on this aspect by conducting an\nin-depth empirical study that critically examines the state-of-the-art query\nselection practices in IR-based bug localization. In particular, we use a\ndataset of 2,320 bug reports, employ ten existing approaches from the\nliterature, exploit the Genetic Algorithm-based approach to construct optimal,\nnear-optimal search queries from these bug reports, and then answer three\nresearch questions. We confirmed that the state-of-the-art query construction\napproaches are indeed not sufficient for constructing appropriate queries (for\nbug localization) from certain natural language-only bug reports although they\ncontain such queries. We also demonstrate that optimal queries and non-optimal\nqueries chosen from bug report texts are significantly different in terms of\nseveral keyword characteristics, which has led us to actionable insights.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate 27%--34% improvement in the performance of\nnon-optimal queries through the application of our actionable insights to them.",

          "description": "Traditional industrial recommenders are usually trained on a single business\ndomain and then serve for this domain. However, in large commercial platforms,\nit is often the case that the recommenders need to make click-through rate\n(CTR) predictions for multiple business domains. Different domains have\noverlapping user groups and items. Thus, there exist commonalities. Since the\nspecific user groups have disparity and the user behaviors may change in\nvarious business domains, there also have distinctions. The distinctions result\nin domain-specific data distributions, making it hard for a single shared model\nto work well on all domains. To learn an effective and efficient CTR model to\nhandle multiple domains simultaneously, we present Star Topology Adaptive\nRecommender (STAR). Concretely, STAR has the star topology, which consists of\nthe shared centered parameters and domain-specific parameters. The shared\nparameters are applied to learn commonalities of all domains, and the\ndomain-specific parameters capture domain distinction for more refined\nprediction. Given requests from different business domains, STAR can adapt its\nparameters conditioned on the domain characteristics. The experimental result\nfrom production data validates the superiority of the proposed STAR model.\nSince 2020, STAR has been deployed in the display advertising system of\nAlibaba, obtaining averaging 8.0% improvement on CTR and 6.0% on RPM (Revenue\nPer Mille).",

          "description": "Learning to rank systems has become an important aspect of our daily life.\nHowever, the implicit user feedback that is used to train many learning to rank\nmodels is usually noisy and suffered from user bias (i.e., position bias).\nThus, obtaining an unbiased model using biased feedback has become an important\nresearch field for IR. Existing studies on unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) can\nbe generalized into two families-algorithms that attain unbiasedness with\nlogged data, offline learning, and algorithms that achieve unbiasedness by\nestimating unbiased parameters with real-time user interactions, namely online\nlearning. While there exist many algorithms from both families, there lacks a\nunified way to compare and benchmark them. As a result, it can be challenging\nfor researchers to choose the right technique for their problems or for people\nwho are new to the field to learn and understand existing algorithms. To solve\nthis problem, we introduced ULTRA, which is a flexible, extensible, and easily\nconfigure ULTR toolbox. Its key features include support for multiple ULTR\nalgorithms with configurable hyperparameters, a variety of built-in click\nmodels that can be used separately to simulate clicks, different ranking model\narchitecture and evaluation metrics, and simple learning to rank pipeline\ncreation. In this paper, we discuss the general framework of ULTR, briefly\ndescribe the algorithms in ULTRA, detailed the structure, and pipeline of the\ntoolbox. We experimented on all the algorithms supported by ultra and showed\nthat the toolbox performance is reasonable. Our toolbox is an important\nresource for researchers to conduct experiments on ULTR algorithms with\ndifferent configurations as well as testing their own algorithms with the\nsupported features.",

          "description": "Prediction over tabular data is an essential task in many data science\napplications such as recommender systems, online advertising, medical\ntreatment, etc. Tabular data is structured into rows and columns, with each row\nas a data sample and each column as a feature attribute. Both the columns and\nrows of the tabular data carry useful patterns that could improve the model\nprediction performance. However, most existing models focus on the cross-column\npatterns yet overlook the cross-row patterns as they deal with single samples\nindependently. In this work, we propose a general learning framework named\nRetrieval & Interaction Machine (RIM) that fully exploits both cross-row and\ncross-column patterns among tabular data. Specifically, RIM first leverages\nsearch engine techniques to efficiently retrieve useful rows of the table to\nassist the label prediction of the target row, then uses feature interaction\nnetworks to capture the cross-column patterns among the target row and the\nretrieved rows so as to make the final label prediction. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on 11 datasets of three important tasks, i.e., CTR prediction\n(classification), top-n recommendation (ranking) and rating prediction\n(regression).

          "description": "Recently, we have witnessed the bloom of neural ranking models in the\ninformation retrieval (IR) field. So far, much effort has been devoted to\ndeveloping effective neural ranking models that can generalize well on new\ndata. There has been less attention paid to the robustness perspective. Unlike\nthe effectiveness which is about the average performance of a system under\nnormal purpose, robustness cares more about the system performance in the worst\ncase or under malicious operations instead. When a new technique enters into\nthe real-world application, it is critical to know not only how it works in\naverage, but also how would it behave in abnormal situations. So we raise the\nquestion in this work: Are neural ranking models robust? To answer this\nquestion, firstly, we need to clarify what we refer to when we talk about the\nrobustness of ranking models in IR. We show that robustness is actually a\nmulti-dimensional concept and there are three ways to define it in IR: 1) The\nperformance variance under the independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.)\nsetting; 2) The out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability; and 3) The\ndefensive ability against adversarial operations. The latter two definitions\ncan be further specified into two different perspectives respectively, leading\nto 5 robustness tasks in total. Based on this taxonomy, we build corresponding\nbenchmark datasets, design empirical experiments, and systematically analyze\nthe robustness of several representative neural ranking models against\ntraditional probabilistic ranking models and learning-to-rank (LTR) models. The\nempirical results show that there is no simple answer to our question. While\nneural ranking models are less robust against other IR models in most cases,\nsome of them can still win 1 out of 5 tasks. This is the first comprehensive\nstudy on the robustness of neural ranking models.",

          "description": "Question Answering (QA), a popular and promising technique for intelligent\ninformation access, faces a dilemma about data as most other AI techniques. On\none hand, modern QA methods rely on deep learning models which are typically\ndata-hungry. Therefore, it is expected to collect and fuse all the available QA\ndatasets together in a common site for developing a powerful QA model. On the\nother hand, real-world QA datasets are typically distributed in the form of\nisolated islands belonging to different parties. Due to the increasing\nawareness of privacy security, it is almost impossible to integrate the data\nscattered around, or the cost is prohibited. A possible solution to this\ndilemma is a new approach known as federated learning, which is a\nprivacy-preserving machine learning technique over distributed datasets. In\nthis work, we propose to adopt federated learning for QA with the special\nconcern on the statistical heterogeneity of the QA data. Here the heterogeneity\nrefers to the fact that annotated QA data are typically with non-identical and\nindependent distribution (non-IID) and unbalanced sizes in practice.\nTraditional federated learning methods may sacrifice the accuracy of individual\nmodels under the heterogeneous situation. To tackle this problem, we propose a\nnovel Federated Matching framework for QA, named FedMatch, with a\nbackbone-patch architecture. The shared backbone is to distill the common\nknowledge of all the participants while the private patch is a compact and\nefficient module to retain the domain information for each participant. To\nfacilitate the evaluation, we build a benchmark collection based on several QA\ndatasets from different domains to simulate the heterogeneous situation in\npractice. Empirical studies demonstrate that our model can achieve significant\nimprovements against the baselines over all the datasets.",

          "description": "Recommendation for new users, also called user cold start, has been a\nwell-recognized challenge for online recommender systems. Most existing methods\nview the crux as the lack of initial data. However, in this paper, we argue\nthat there are neglected problems: 1) New users' behaviour follows much\ndifferent distributions from regular users. 2) Although personalized features\nare involved, heavily imbalanced samples prevent the model from balancing\nnew/regular user distributions, as if the personalized features are\noverwhelmed. We name the problem as the ``submergence\" of personalization. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a novel module: Personalized COld Start MOdules\n(POSO). Considering from a model architecture perspective, POSO personalizes\nexisting modules by introducing multiple user-group-specialized sub-modules.\nThen, it fuses their outputs by personalized gates, resulting in comprehensive\nrepresentations. In such way, POSO projects imbalanced features to even\nmodules. POSO can be flexibly integrated into many existing modules and\neffectively improves their performance with negligible computational overheads.\nThe proposed method shows remarkable advantage in industrial scenario. It has\nbeen deployed on the large-scale recommender system of Kwai, and improves new\nuser Watch Time by a large margin (+7.75%). Moreover, POSO can be further\ngeneralized to regular users, inactive users and returning users (+2%-3% on\nWatch Time), as well as item cold start (+3.8% on Watch Time). Its\neffectiveness has also been verified on public dataset (MovieLens 20M). We\nbelieve such practical experience can be well generalized to other scenarios.",

Prior\nwork on supervised query suggestion models suffered from selection and exposure\nbias, and relied on sparse and noisy immediate user-feedback (e.g., clicks),\nleading to low quality suggestions. Reinforcement Learning techniques employed\nto reformulate a query using terms from search results, have limited\nscalability to large-scale industry applications. To recommend high quality\nrelated search queries, we train a Deep Reinforcement Learning model to predict\nthe query a user would enter next. The reward signal is composed of long-term\nsession-based user feedback, syntactic relatedness and estimated naturalness of\ngenerated query. Over the baseline supervised model, our proposed approach\nachieves a significant relative improvement in terms of recommendation\ndiversity (3%), down-stream user-engagement (4.2%) and per-sentence word\nrepetitions (82%).",

          "description": "Recently, Graph Convolution Network (GCN) based methods have achieved\noutstanding performance for recommendation. These methods embed users and items\nin Euclidean space, and perform graph convolution on user-item interaction\ngraphs. However, real-world datasets usually exhibit tree-like hierarchical\nstructures, which make Euclidean space less effective in capturing user-item\nrelationship. In contrast, hyperbolic space, as a continuous analogue of a\ntree-graph, provides a promising alternative. In this paper, we propose a fully\nhyperbolic GCN model for recommendation, where all operations are performed in\nhyperbolic space. Utilizing the advantage of hyperbolic space, our method is\nable to embed users/items with less distortion and capture user-item\ninteraction relationship more accurately. Extensive experiments on public\nbenchmark datasets show that our method outperforms both Euclidean and\nhyperbolic counterparts and requires far lower embedding dimensionality to\nachieve comparable performance.",

          "description": "Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) recently emerged as a powerful paradigm\nfor recommendation based on implicit feedback collaborative filtering. However,\nstandard CML methods learn fixed user and item representations, which fails to\ncapture the complex interests of users. Existing extensions of CML also either\nignore the heterogeneity of user-item relations, i.e. that a user can\nsimultaneously like very different items, or the latent item-item relations,\ni.e. that a user's preference for an item depends, not only on its intrinsic\ncharacteristics, but also on items they previously interacted with. In this\npaper, we present a hierarchical CML model that jointly captures latent\nuser-item and item-item relations from implicit data. Our approach is inspired\nby translation mechanisms from knowledge graph embedding and leverages\nmemory-based attention networks. We empirically show the relevance of this\njoint relational modeling, by outperforming existing CML models on\nrecommendation tasks on several real-world datasets. Our experiments also\nemphasize the limits of current CML relational models on very sparse datasets.",

          "description": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is one of the core tasks in recommender\nsystems (RS). It predicts a personalized click probability for each user-item\npair. Recently, researchers have found that the performance of CTR model can be\nimproved greatly by taking user behavior sequence into consideration,\nespecially long-term user behavior sequence. The report on an e-commerce\nwebsite shows that 23\\% of users have more than 1000 clicks during the past 5\nmonths. Though there are numerous works focus on modeling sequential user\nbehaviors, few works can handle long-term user behavior sequence due to the\nstrict inference time constraint in real world system. Two-stage methods are\nproposed to push the limit for better performance. At the first stage, an\nauxiliary task is designed to retrieve the top-$k$ similar items from long-term\nuser behavior sequence. At the second stage, the classical attention mechanism\nis conducted between the candidate item and $k$ items selected in the first\nstage. However, information gap happens between retrieval stage and the main\nCTR task. This goal divergence can greatly diminishing the performance gain of\nlong-term user sequence. In this paper, inspired by Reformer, we propose a\nlocality-sensitive hashing (LSH) method called ETA (End-to-end Target\nAttention) which can greatly reduce the training and inference cost and make\nthe end-to-end training with long-term user behavior sequence possible. Both\noffline and online experiments confirm the effectiveness of our model. We\ndeploy ETA into a large-scale real world E-commerce system and achieve extra\n3.1\\% improvements on GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) compared to a two-stage\nlong user sequence CTR model.",

          "description": "User-item interactions in recommendations can be naturally de-noted as a\nuser-item bipartite graph. Given the success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in\ngraph representation learning, GNN-based C methods have been proposed to\nadvance recommender systems. These methods often make recommendations based on\nthe learned user and item embeddings. However, we found that they do not\nperform well wit sparse user-item graphs which are quite common in real-world\nrecommendations. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel perspective to\nbuild GNN-based CF methods for recommendations which leads to the proposed\nframework Localized Graph Collaborative Filtering (LGCF). One key advantage of\nLGCF is that it does not need to learn embeddings for each user and item, which\nis challenging in sparse scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, LGCF aims at encoding useful CF information into a localized\ngraph and making recommendations based on such graph. Extensive experiments on\nvarious datasets validate the effectiveness of LGCF especially in sparse\nscenarios.

Recently, we\nhave witnessed an explosive growth of research interests on the first-stage\nsemantic retrieval models. We believe it is the right time to survey current\nstatus, learn from existing methods, and gain some insights for future\ndevelopment. In this paper, we describe the current landscape of the\nfirst-stage retrieval models under a unified framework to clarify the\nconnection between classical term-based retrieval methods, early semantic\nretrieval methods and neural semantic retrieval methods.

          "description": "User response prediction, which aims to predict the probability that a user\nwill provide a predefined positive response in a given context such as clicking\non an ad or purchasing an item, is crucial to many industrial applications such\nas online advertising, recommender systems, and search ranking. However, due to\nthe high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these\ntasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies\nin predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing\nfeature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order\ncross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing\nmethods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model\narchitecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with\nequal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel\narchitecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross\nnetwork's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at\nthe vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of\ndifferent cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head\nattention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to\nperform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed\nmodel can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets.

          "description": "In the current deep learning based recommendation system, the embedding\nmethod is generally employed to complete the conversion from the\nhigh-dimensional sparse feature vector to the low-dimensional dense feature\nvector. However, as the dimension of the input vector of the embedding layer is\ntoo large, the addition of the embedding layer significantly slows down the\nconvergence speed of the entire neural network, which is not acceptable in\nreal-world scenarios. In addition, as the interaction between users and items\nincreases and the relationship between items becomes more complicated, the\nembedding method proposed for sequence data is no longer suitable for graphic\ndata in the current real environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the\nDual-modal Graph Embedding Method (DGEM) to solve these problems. DGEM includes\ntwo modes, static and dynamic. We first construct the item graph to extract the\ngraph structure and use random walk of unequal probability to capture the\nhigh-order proximity between the items. Then we generate the graph embedding\nvector through the Skip-Gram model, and finally feed the downstream deep neural\nnetwork for the recommendation task. The experimental results show that DGEM\ncan mine the high-order proximity between items and enhance the expression\nability of the recommendation model. Meanwhile it also improves the\nrecommendation performance by utilizing the time dependent relationship between\nitems.",

However, relying on user interaction data is problematic because one\nfirst needs a massive user base to build a sufficient log; public query logs\nare insufficient on their own. Given the recent success of causal language\nmodels (such as the Text-To-Text Transformer (T5) model) at text generation\ntasks, we explore the capacity of these models to generate potential query\nintents. We find that to encourage diversity in the generated queries, it is\nbeneficial to adapt the model by including a new Distributional Causal Language\nModeling (DCLM) objective during fine-tuning and a representation replacement\nduring inference. Across six standard evaluation benchmarks, we find that our\nmethod (which we call IntenT5) improves search result diversity and attains\n(and sometimes exceeds) the diversity obtained when using query suggestions\nbased on a proprietary query log.

The second tier modality alignment optimizes the textual-visual joint\nembedding loss function using a double batch-hard triplet loss with soft-margin\noptimization. The third modality alignment incorporates two types of\ncross-modality alignments as the auxiliary loss regularizations to further\nreduce the alignment errors in the joint learning of the two modality-specific\nembedding functions.

These\nmodels learn to compute a ranking score between the given query and document.\nThe majority of existing models are trained in pairwise fashion using\nhuman-judged labels directly without further calibration. The traditional\npairwise schemes can be time-consuming and require pre-defined\npositive-negative document pairs for training, potentially leading to learning\nbias due to document distribution mismatch between training and test\nconditions. Some popular existing listwise schemes rely on the strong\npre-defined probabilistic assumptions and stark difference between relevant and\nnon-relevant documents for the given query, which may limit the model potential\ndue to the low-quality or ambiguous relevance labels. To address these\nconcerns, we turn to a physics-inspired ranking balance scheme and propose\nPoolRank, a pooling-based listwise learning framework. The proposed scheme has\nfour major advantages: (1) PoolRank extracts training information from the best\ncandidates at the local level based on model performance and relative ranking\namong abundant document candidates. (2) By combining four pooling-based loss\ncomponents in a multi-task learning fashion, PoolRank calibrates the ranking\nbalance for the partially relevant and the highly non-relevant documents\nautomatically without costly human inspection. (3) PoolRank can be easily\ngeneralized to any neural retrieval model without requiring additional\nlearnable parameters or model structure modifications.

In this survey paper, we first proposed a\ntwo-level taxonomy of cross-domain recommendation which classifies different\nrecommendation scenarios and recommendation tasks. We then introduce and\nsummarize existing cross-domain recommendation approaches under different\nrecommendation scenarios in a structured manner. We also organize datasets\ncommonly used. We conclude this survey by providing several potential research\ndirections about this field.",

          "description": "Exposure bias is a well-known issue in recommender systems where items and\nsuppliers are not equally represented in the recommendation results. This is\nespecially problematic when bias is amplified over time as a few popular items\nare repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists. This phenomenon can be\nviewed as a recommendation feedback loop: the system repeatedly recommends\ncertain items at different time points and interactions of users with those\nitems will amplify bias towards those items over time. This issue has been\nextensively studied in the literature on model-based or neighborhood-based\nrecommendation algorithms, but less work has been done on online recommendation\nmodels such as those based on multi-armed Bandit algorithms. In this paper, we\nstudy exposure bias in a class of well-known bandit algorithms known as Linear\nCascade Bandits. We analyze these algorithms on their ability to handle\nexposure bias and provide a fair representation for items and suppliers in the\nrecommendation results. Our analysis reveals that these algorithms fail to\ntreat items and suppliers fairly and do not sufficiently explore the item space\nfor each user. To mitigate this bias, we propose a discounting factor and\nincorporate it into these algorithms that controls the exposure of items at\neach time step. To show the effectiveness of the proposed discounting factor on\nmitigating exposure bias, we perform experiments on two datasets using three\ncascading bandit algorithms and our experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod improves the exposure fairness for items and suppliers.",

While\nthere has been much work in streamlining, caching, and modifying transformer\narchitectures for production, here we explore a new direction: distilling a\nlarge pre-trained translation model into a lightweight bi-encoder which can be\nefficiently cached and queried. We argue from a probabilistic perspective that\nsequence-to-sequence models are a conceptually ideal---albeit highly\nimpractical---retriever. We derive a new distillation objective, implementing\nit as a data augmentation scheme.

          "description": "Motives or goals are recognized in psychology literature as the most\nfundamental drive that explains and predicts why people do what they do,\nincluding when they browse the web. Although providing enormous value, these\nhigher-ordered goals are often unobserved, and little is known about how to\nleverage such goals to assist people's browsing activities. This paper proposes\nto take a new approach to address this problem, which is fulfilled through a\nnovel neural framework, Goal-directed Web Browsing (GoWeB). We adopt a\npsychologically-sound taxonomy of higher-ordered goals and learn to build their\nrepresentations in a structure-preserving manner. Then we incorporate the\nresulting representations for enhancing the experiences of common activities\npeople perform on the web. Experiments on large-scale data from Microsoft Edge\nweb browser show that GoWeB significantly outperforms competitive baselines for\nin-session web page recommendation, re-visitation classification, and\ngoal-based web page grouping. A follow-up analysis further characterizes how\nthe variety of human motives can affect the difference observed in human\nbehavioral patterns.",

          "description": "The online estimation of rhythmic information, such as beat positions,\ndownbeat positions, and meter, is critical for many real-time music\napplications. Musical rhythm comprises complex hierarchical relationships\nacross time, rendering its analysis intrinsically challenging and at times\nsubjective. Furthermore, systems which attempt to estimate rhythmic information\nin real-time must be causal and must produce estimates quickly and efficiently.\nIn this work, we introduce an online system for joint beat, downbeat, and meter\ntracking, which utilizes causal convolutional and recurrent layers, followed by\na pair of sequential Monte Carlo particle filters applied during inference. The\nproposed system does not need to be primed with a time signature in order to\nperform downbeat tracking, and is instead able to estimate meter and adjust the\npredictions over time. Additionally, we propose an information gate strategy to\nsignificantly decrease the computational cost of particle filtering during the\ninference step, making the system much faster than previous sampling-based\nmethods. Experiments on the GTZAN dataset, which is unseen during training,\nshow that the system outperforms various online beat and downbeat tracking\nsystems and achieves comparable performance to a baseline offline joint method.",

          "description": "BERT-based Neural Ranking Models (NRMs) can be classified according to how\nthe query and document are encoded through BERT's self-attention layers -\nbi-encoder versus cross-encoder. Bi-encoder models are highly efficient because\nall the documents can be pre-processed before the query time, but their\nperformance is inferior compared to cross-encoder models. Both models utilize a\nranker that receives BERT representations as the input and generates a\nrelevance score as the output. In this work, we propose a method where\nmulti-teacher distillation is applied to a cross-encoder NRM and a bi-encoder\nNRM to produce a bi-encoder NRM with two rankers. The resulting student\nbi-encoder achieves an improved performance by simultaneously learning from a\ncross-encoder teacher and a bi-encoder teacher and also by combining relevance\nscores from the two rankers. We call this method TRMD (Two Rankers and\nMulti-teacher Distillation). In the experiments, TwinBERT and ColBERT are\nconsidered as baseline bi-encoders. When monoBERT is used as the cross-encoder\nteacher, together with either TwinBERT or ColBERT as the bi-encoder teacher,\nTRMD produces a student bi-encoder that performs better than the corresponding\nbaseline bi-encoder. For P@20, the maximum improvement was 11.4%, and the\naverage improvement was 6.8%. As an additional experiment, we considered\nproducing cross-encoder students with TRMD, and found that it could also\nimprove the cross-encoders.",

          "description": "Hybrid recommendations have recently attracted a lot of attention where user\nfeatures are utilized as auxiliary information to address the sparsity problem\ncaused by insufficient user-item interactions. However, extracted user features\ngenerally contain rich multimodal information, and most of them are irrelevant\nto the recommendation purpose. Therefore, excessive reliance on these features\nwill make the model overfit on noise and difficult to generalize. In this\narticle, we propose a variational bandwidth auto-encoder (VBAE) for\nrecommendations, aiming to address the sparsity and noise problems\nsimultaneously. VBAE first encodes user collaborative and feature information\ninto Gaussian latent variables via deep neural networks to capture non-linear\nuser similarities. Moreover, by considering the fusion of collaborative and\nfeature variables as a virtual communication channel from an\ninformation-theoretic perspective, we introduce a user-dependent channel to\ndynamically control the information allowed to be accessed from the feature\nembeddings. A quantum-inspired uncertainty measurement of the hidden rating\nembeddings is proposed accordingly to infer the channel bandwidth by\ndisentangling the uncertainty information in the ratings from the semantic\ninformation. Through this mechanism, VBAE incorporates adequate auxiliary\ninformation from user features if collaborative information is insufficient,\nwhile avoiding excessive reliance on noisy user features to improve its\ngeneralization ability to new users. Extensive experiments conducted on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Codes\nand datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/vbae.",

While existing approaches can only fill\nin a short segment with a fixed number of notes, or a fixed time span between\nthe past and future contexts, our model can infill a variable number of notes\n(up to 128) for different time spans. We achieve so with three major technical\ncontributions. First, we adapt XLNet, an autoregressive model originally\nproposed for unsupervised model pre-training, to music score infilling. Second,\nwe propose a new, musically specialized positional encoding called relative bar\nencoding that better informs the model of notes' position within the past and\nfuture context. Third, to capitalize relative bar encoding, we perform\nlook-ahead onset prediction to predict the onset of a note one time step before\npredicting the other attributes of the note.

We performance several experiments to show the\nefficiency and effectiveness of this filter. We further compare our filter with\nother the-state-of-the-art edge preserving methods.

          "description": "Binaural audio gives the listener the feeling of being in the recording place\nand enhances the immersive experience if coupled with AR/VR. But the problem\nwith binaural audio recording is that it requires a specialized setup which is\nnot possible to fabricate within handheld devices as compared to traditional\nmono audio that can be recorded with a single microphone. In order to overcome\nthis drawback, prior works have tried to uplift the mono recorded audio to\nbinaural audio as a post processing step conditioning on the visual input. But\nall the prior approaches missed other most important information required for\nthe task, i.e. distance of different sound producing objects from the recording\nsetup. In this work, we argue that the depth map of the scene can act as a\nproxy for encoding distance information of objects in the scene and show that\nadding depth features along with image features improves the performance both\nqualitatively and quantitatively.

          "description": "This paper proposes a novel model for recognizing images with composite\nattribute-object concepts, notably for composite concepts that are unseen\nduring model training. We aim to explore the three key properties required by\nthe task --- relation-aware, consistent, and decoupled --- to learn rich and\nrobust features for primitive concepts that compose attribute-object pairs. To\nthis end, we propose the Blocked Message Passing Network (BMP-Net). The model\nconsists of two modules. The concept module generates semantically meaningful\nfeatures for primitive concepts, whereas the visual module extracts visual\nfeatures for attributes and objects from input images. A message passing\nmechanism is used in the concept module to capture the relations between\nprimitive concepts. Furthermore, to prevent the model from being biased towards\nseen composite concepts and reduce the entanglement between attributes and\nobjects, we propose a blocking mechanism that equalizes the information\navailable to the model for both seen and unseen concepts. Extensive experiments\nand ablation studies on two benchmarks show the efficacy of the proposed model.",

Many video editing components are astonishingly hard to automate\nprimarily due to the lack of raw video materials. This paper focuses on a new\ntask for computational video editing, namely the task of raking cut\nplausibility. Our key idea is to leverage content that has already been edited\nto learn fine-grained audiovisual patterns that trigger cuts. To do this, we\nfirst collected a data source of more than 10K videos, from which we extract\nmore than 255K cuts. We devise a model that learns to discriminate between real\nand artificial cuts via contrastive learning. We set up a new task and a set of\nbaselines to benchmark video cut generation. We observe that our proposed model\noutperforms the baselines by large margins. To demonstrate our model in\nreal-world applications, we conduct human studies in a collection of unedited\nvideos.

          "description": "Recent research has shown that non-additive image steganographic frameworks\neffectively improve security performance through adjusting distortion\ndistribution. However, as far as we know, all of the existing non-additive\nproposals are based on handcrafted policies, and can only be applied to a\nspecific image domain, which heavily prevent non-additive steganography from\nreleasing its full potentiality. In this paper, we propose an automatic\nnon-additive steganographic distortion learning framework called MCTSteg to\nremove the above restrictions. Guided by the reinforcement learning paradigm,\nwe combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and steganalyzer-based environmental\nmodel to build MCTSteg. MCTS makes sequential decisions to adjust distortion\ndistribution without human intervention. Our proposed environmental model is\nused to obtain feedbacks from each decision. Due to its self-learning\ncharacteristic and domain-independent reward function, MCTSteg has become the\nfirst reported universal non-additive steganographic framework which can work\nin both spatial and JPEG domains. Extensive experimental results show that\nMCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted\nfeature-based and deep-learning-based steganalyzers. In both spatial and JPEG\ndomains, the security performance of MCTSteg steadily outperforms the state of\nthe art by a clear margin under different scenarios.",

          "description": "User response prediction, which aims to predict the probability that a user\nwill provide a predefined positive response in a given context such as clicking\non an ad or purchasing an item, is crucial to many industrial applications such\nas online advertising, recommender systems, and search ranking. However, due to\nthe high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these\ntasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies\nin predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing\nfeature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order\ncross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing\nmethods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model\narchitecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with\nequal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel\narchitecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross\nnetwork's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at\nthe vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of\ndifferent cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head\nattention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to\nperform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed\nmodel can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets. The results have robustly\ndemonstrated that our proposed model DCAP achieves superior prediction\nperformance compared with the state-of-the-art models.",

Particularly, unsupervised deep hashing is supported by powerful\ndeep neural networks and has the desirable advantage of label independence. It\nis a promising technique for scalable image retrieval. However, deep models\nintroduce a large number of parameters, which is hard to optimize due to the\nlack of explicit semantic labels and brings considerable training cost. As a\nresult, the retrieval accuracy and training efficiency of existing unsupervised\ndeep hashing are still limited. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we\npropose a simple and efficient \\emph{Lightweight Augmented Graph Network\nHashing} (LAGNH) method with a two-pronged strategy. For one thing, we extract\nthe inner structure of the image as the auxiliary semantics to enhance the\nsemantic supervision of the unsupervised hash learning process. For another, we\ndesign a lightweight network structure with the assistance of the auxiliary\nsemantics, which greatly reduces the number of network parameters that needs to\nbe optimized and thus greatly accelerates the training process. Specifically,\nwe design a cross-modal attention module based on the auxiliary semantic\ninformation to adaptively mitigate the adverse effects in the deep image\nfeatures. Besides, the hash codes are learned by multi-layer message passing\nwithin an adversarial regularized graph convolutional network. Simultaneously,\nthe semantic representation capability of hash codes is further enhanced by\nreconstructing the similarity graph.",

          "description": "This paper investigates a valuable setting called few-shot unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (FS-UDA), which has not been sufficiently studied in the\nliterature. In this setting, the source domain data are labelled, but with\nfew-shot per category, while the target domain data are unlabelled. To address\nthe FS-UDA setting, we develop a general UDA model to solve the following two\nkey issues: the few-shot labeled data per category and the domain adaptation\nbetween support and query sets. Our model is general in that once trained it\nwill be able to be applied to various FS-UDA tasks from the same source and\ntarget domains. Inspired by the recent local descriptor based few-shot learning\n(FSL), our general UDA model is fully built upon local descriptors (LDs) for\nimage classification and domain adaptation. By proposing a novel concept called\nsimilarity patterns (SPs), our model not only effectively considers the spatial\nrelationship of LDs that was ignored in previous FSL methods, but also makes\nthe learned image similarity better serve the required domain alignment.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel IMage-to-class sparse Similarity Encoding\n(IMSE) method. It learns SPs to extract the local discriminative information\nfor classification and meanwhile aligns the covariance matrix of the SPs for\ndomain adaptation. Also, domain adversarial training and multi-scale local\nfeature matching are performed upon LDs. Extensive experiments conducted on a\nmulti-domain benchmark dataset DomainNet demonstrates the state-of-the-art\nperformance of our IMSE for the novel setting of FS-UDA. In addition, for FSL,\nour IMSE can also show better performance than most of recent FSL methods on\nminiImageNet.",

          "description": "Two-stage methods have dominated Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection for\nseveral years. Recently, one-stage HOI detection methods have become popular.\nIn this paper, we aim to explore the essential pros and cons of two-stage and\none-stage methods. With this as the goal, we find that conventional two-stage\nmethods mainly suffer from positioning positive interactive human-object pairs,\nwhile one-stage methods are challenging to make an appropriate trade-off on\nmulti-task learning, i.e., object detection, and interaction classification.\nTherefore, a core problem is how to take the essence and discard the dregs from\nthe conventional two types of methods. To this end, we propose a novel\none-stage framework with disentangling human-object detection and interaction\nclassification in a cascade manner. In detail, we first design a human-object\npair generator based on a state-of-the-art one-stage HOI detector by removing\nthe interaction classification module or head and then design a relatively\nisolated interaction classifier to classify each human-object pair. Two cascade\ndecoders in our proposed framework can focus on one specific task, detection or\ninteraction classification. In terms of the specific implementation, we adopt a\ntransformer-based HOI detector as our base model. The newly introduced\ndisentangling paradigm outperforms existing methods by a large margin, with a\nsignificant relative mAP gain of 9.32% on HICO-Det.",

          "description": "In the application of machine learning to remote sensing, labeled data is\noften scarce or expensive, which impedes the training of powerful models like\ndeep convolutional neural networks. Although unlabeled data is abundant, recent\nself-supervised learning approaches are ill-suited to the remote sensing\ndomain. In addition, most remote sensing applications currently use only a\nsmall subset of the multi-sensor, multi-channel information available,\nmotivating the need for fused multi-sensor representations. We propose a new\nself-supervised training objective, Contrastive Sensor Fusion, which exploits\ncoterminous data from multiple sources to learn useful representations of every\npossible combination of those sources. This method uses information common\nacross multiple sensors and bands by training a single model to produce a\nrepresentation that remains similar when any subset of its input channels is\nused. Using a dataset of 47 million unlabeled coterminous image triplets, we\ntrain an encoder to produce semantically meaningful representations from any\npossible combination of channels from the input sensors. These representations\noutperform fully supervised ImageNet weights on a remote sensing classification\ntask and improve as more sensors are fused.

          "description": "While state-of-the-art 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) achieve very\ngood results on action recognition datasets, they are computationally very\nexpensive and require many GFLOPs. While the GFLOPs of a 3D CNN can be\ndecreased by reducing the temporal feature resolution within the network, there\nis no setting that is optimal for all input clips. In this work, we therefore\nintroduce a differentiable Similarity Guided Sampling (SGS) module, which can\nbe plugged into any existing 3D CNN architecture. SGS empowers 3D CNNs by\nlearning the similarity of temporal features and grouping similar features\ntogether. As a result, the temporal feature resolution is not anymore static\nbut it varies for each input video clip. By integrating SGS as an additional\nlayer within current 3D CNNs, we can convert them into much more efficient 3D\nCNNs with adaptive temporal feature resolutions (ATFR). Our evaluations show\nthat the proposed module improves the state-of-the-art by reducing the\ncomputational cost (GFLOPs) by half while preserving or even improving the\naccuracy. We evaluate our module by adding it to multiple state-of-the-art 3D\nCNNs on various datasets such as Kinetics-600, Kinetics-400, mini-Kinetics,\nSomething-Something V2, UCF101, and HMDB51.",

          "description": "Text-based image retrieval has seen considerable progress in recent years.\nHowever, the performance of existing methods suffers in real life since the\nuser is likely to provide an incomplete description of an image, which often\nleads to results filled with false positives that fit the incomplete\ndescription. In this work, we introduce the partial-query problem and\nextensively analyze its influence on text-based image retrieval. Previous\ninteractive methods tackle the problem by passively receiving users' feedback\nto supplement the incomplete query iteratively, which is time-consuming and\nrequires heavy user effort. Instead, we propose a novel retrieval framework\nthat conducts the interactive process in an Ask-and-Confirm fashion, where AI\nactively searches for discriminative details missing in the current query, and\nusers only need to confirm AI's proposal. Specifically, we propose an\nobject-based interaction to make the interactive retrieval more user-friendly\nand present a reinforcement-learning-based policy to search for discriminative\nobjects. Furthermore, since fully-supervised training is often infeasible due\nto the difficulty of obtaining human-machine dialog data, we present a\nweakly-supervised training strategy that needs no human-annotated dialogs other\nthan a text-image dataset.

It is widely believed\nthat such downgraded performance is solely due to the catastrophic forgetting\nof previously learned knowledge. In this study, we argue that the class\nconfusion phenomena may also play a role in downgrading the classification\nperformance during continual learning, i.e., the high similarity between new\nclasses and any previously learned classes would also cause the classifier to\nmake mistakes in recognizing these old classes, even if the knowledge of these\nold classes is not forgotten.

          "description": "Although using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as backbones achieves\ngreat successes in computer vision, this work investigates a simple backbone\nnetwork useful for many dense prediction tasks without convolutions. Unlike the\nrecently-proposed Transformer model (e.g., ViT) that is specially designed for\nimage classification, we propose Pyramid Vision Transformer~(PVT), which\novercomes the difficulties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction\ntasks. PVT has several merits compared to prior arts. (1) Different from ViT\nthat typically has low-resolution outputs and high computational and memory\ncost, PVT can be not only trained on dense partitions of the image to achieve\nhigh output resolution, which is important for dense predictions but also using\na progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce computations of large feature maps.\n(2) PVT inherits the advantages from both CNN and Transformer, making it a\nunified backbone in various vision tasks without convolutions by simply\nreplacing CNN backbones. (3) We validate PVT by conducting extensive\nexperiments, showing that it boosts the performance of many downstream tasks,\ne.g., object detection, semantic, and instance segmentation. For example, with\na comparable number of parameters, RetinaNet+PVT achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO\ndataset, surpassing RetinNet+ResNet50 (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute AP.

          "description": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have many potential medical imaging\napplications, including data augmentation, domain adaptation, and model\nexplanation. Due to the limited memory of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs),\nmost current 3D GAN models are trained on low-resolution medical images, these\nmodels either cannot scale to high-resolution or are prone to patchy artifacts.\nIn this work, we propose a novel end-to-end GAN architecture that can generate\nhigh-resolution 3D images. We achieve this goal by separating training and\ninference. During training, we adopt a hierarchical structure that\nsimultaneously generates a low-resolution version of the image and a randomly\nselected sub-volume of the high-resolution image. The hierarchical design has\ntwo advantages: First, the memory demand for training on high-resolution images\nis amortized among subvolumes. Furthermore, anchoring the high-resolution\nsubvolumes to a single low-resolution image ensures anatomical consistency\nbetween subvolumes. During inference, our model can directly generate full\nhigh-resolution images. We also incorporate an encoder with a similar\nhierarchical structure into the model to extract features from the images.\nExperiments on 3D thorax CT and brain MRI demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms state of the art in image generation. We also demonstrate clinical\napplications of the proposed model in data augmentation, image super-resolution\nand clinical-relevant feature extraction.",

          "description": "In current object detection, algorithms require the object to be directly\nvisible in order to be detected. As humans, however, we intuitively use visual\ncues caused by the respective object to already make assumptions about its\nappearance. In the context of driving, such cues can be shadows during the day\nand often light reflections at night. In this paper, we study the problem of\nhow to map this intuitive human behavior to computer vision algorithms to\ndetect oncoming vehicles at night just from the light reflections they cause by\ntheir headlights. For that, we present an extensive open-source dataset\ncontaining 59746 annotated grayscale images out of 346 different scenes in a\nrural environment at night. In these images, all oncoming vehicles, their\ncorresponding light objects (e.g., headlamps), and their respective light\nreflections (e.g., light reflections on guardrails) are labeled. In this\ncontext, we discuss the characteristics of the dataset and the challenges in\nobjectively describing visual cues such as light reflections. We provide\ndifferent metrics for different ways to approach the task and report the\nresults we achieved using state-of-the-art and custom object detection models\nas a first benchmark. With that, we want to bring attention to a new and so far\nneglected field in computer vision research, encourage more researchers to\ntackle the problem, and thereby further close the gap between human performance\nand computer vision systems.",

Unlike conventional attention-based methods which only learn\na global attention map, our attention pyramid exploits the attention regions in\na multi-scale manner because human attention varies with different scales. Our\nattention pyramid imitates the process of human visual perception which tends\nto notice the foreground person over the cluttered background, and further\nfocus on the specific color of the shirt with close observation. Specifically,\nwe describe our attention pyramid by a \"split-attend-merge-stack\" principle. We\nfirst split the features into multiple local parts and learn the corresponding\nattentions. Then, we merge local attentions and stack these merged attentions\nwith the residual connection as an attention pyramid. The proposed attention\npyramid is a lightweight plug-and-play module that can be applied to\noff-the-shelf models. We implement our attention pyramid method in two\ndifferent attention mechanisms including channel-wise attention and spatial\nattention. We evaluate our method on four largescale person re-identification\nbenchmarks including Market-1501, DukeMTMC, CUHK03, and MSMT17.

Existing methods attempt to provide posthoc\nexplanations by investigating visual cues, which may not explore the internal\nrepresentations learned by deep networks. In this paper, we find that some\nhidden units of the network are selective to certain ranges of depth, and thus\nsuch behavior can be served as a way to interpret the internal representations.\nBased on our observations, we quantify the interpretability of a deep MDE\nnetwork by the depth selectivity of its hidden units. Moreover, we then propose\na method to train interpretable MDE deep networks without changing their\noriginal architectures, by assigning a depth range for each unit to select.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method is able to enhance the\ninterpretability of deep MDE networks by largely improving the depth\nselectivity of their units, while not harming or even improving the depth\nestimation accuracy. We further provide a comprehensive analysis to show the\nreliability of selective units, the applicability of our method on different\nlayers, models, and datasets, and a demonstration on analysis of model error.\nSource code and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/youzunzhi/InterpretableMDE .",

          "description": "Tracking multiple objects individually differs from tracking groups of\nrelated objects. When an object is a part of the group, its trajectory depends\non the trajectories of the other group members. Most of the current\nstate-of-the-art trackers follow the approach of tracking each object\nindependently, with the mechanism to handle the overlapping trajectories where\nnecessary. Such an approach does not take inter-object relations into account,\nwhich may cause unreliable tracking for the members of the groups, especially\nin crowded scenarios, where individual cues become unreliable due to\nocclusions. To overcome these limitations and to extend such trackers to\ncrowded scenes, we propose a plug-in Relation Encoding Module (REM). REM\nencodes relations between tracked objects by running a message passing over a\ncorresponding spatio-temporal graph, computing relation embeddings for the\ntracked objects. Our experiments on MOT17 and MOT20 demonstrate that the\nbaseline tracker improves its results after a simple extension with REM. The\nproposed module allows for tracking severely or even fully occluded objects by\nutilizing relational cues.",

This paper aims to design a framework for\nthe latter approach and bridge the gap between artificial and human\nintelligence. To this end, we propose logic-guided generation (LoGe), a novel\ngenerative DNN framework that reduces abstract reasoning as an optimization\nproblem in propositional logic.

Obviously, ordinary ReID processing methods cannot effectively\nhandle such a scenario, with the introduction of image datasets being the\noptimal solution, in addition to being considerably expensive.\n\nTo solve the aforementioned problem, a simple and effective method to\ngenerate images in several new scenarios was proposed, which is names the Copy\nand Paste method based on Pose(CPP). The CPP method is based on key point\ndetection, using copy as paste, to composite a new semantic image dataset in\ntwo different semantic image datasets.

          "description": "To train accurate deep object detectors under the extreme\nforeground-background imbalance, heuristic sampling methods are always\nnecessary, which either re-sample a subset of all training samples (hard\nsampling methods, \\eg biased sampling, OHEM), or use all training samples but\nre-weight them discriminatively (soft sampling methods, \\eg Focal Loss, GHM).\nIn this paper, we challenge the necessity of such hard/soft sampling methods\nfor training accurate deep object detectors. While previous studies have shown\nthat training detectors without heuristic sampling methods would significantly\ndegrade accuracy, we reveal that this degradation comes from an unreasonable\nclassification gradient magnitude caused by the imbalance, rather than a lack\nof re-sampling/re-weighting. Motivated by our discovery, we propose a simple\nyet effective \\emph{Sampling-Free} mechanism to achieve a reasonable\nclassification gradient magnitude by initialization and loss scaling.

          "description": "Context is of fundamental importance to both human and machine vision; e.g.,\nan object in the air is more likely to be an airplane than a pig. The rich\nnotion of context incorporates several aspects including physics rules,\nstatistical co-occurrences, and relative object sizes, among others. While\nprevious work has focused on crowd-sourced out-of-context photographs from the\nweb to study scene context, controlling the nature and extent of contextual\nviolations has been a daunting task. Here we introduce a diverse, synthetic\nOut-of-Context Dataset (OCD) with fine-grained control over scene context. By\nleveraging a 3D simulation engine, we systematically control the gravity,\nobject co-occurrences and relative sizes across 36 object categories in a\nvirtual household environment. We conducted a series of experiments to gain\ninsights into the impact of contextual cues on both human and machine vision\nusing OCD. We conducted psychophysics experiments to establish a human\nbenchmark for out-of-context recognition, and then compared it with\nstate-of-the-art computer vision models to quantify the gap between the two. We\npropose a context-aware recognition transformer model, fusing object and\ncontextual information via multi-head attention. Our model captures useful\ninformation for contextual reasoning, enabling human-level performance and\nbetter robustness in out-of-context conditions compared to baseline models\nacross OCD and other out-of-context datasets.

          "description": "In recent years, computer vision algorithms have become more and more\npowerful, which enabled technologies such as autonomous driving to evolve with\nrapid pace. However, current algorithms mainly share one limitation: They rely\non directly visible objects. This is a major drawback compared to human\nbehavior, where indirect visual cues caused by the actual object (e.g.,\nshadows) are already used intuitively to retrieve information or anticipate\noccurring objects. While driving at night, this performance deficit becomes\neven more obvious: Humans already process the light artifacts caused by\noncoming vehicles to assume their future appearance, whereas current object\ndetection systems rely on the oncoming vehicle's direct visibility. Based on\nprevious work in this subject, we present with this paper a complete system\ncapable of solving the task to providently detect oncoming vehicles at\nnighttime based on their caused light artifacts. For that, we outline the full\nalgorithm architecture ranging from the detection of light artifacts in the\nimage space, localizing the objects in the three-dimensional space, and\nverifying the objects over time. To demonstrate the applicability, we deploy\nthe system in a test vehicle and use the information of providently detected\nvehicles to control the glare-free high beam system proactively. Using this\nexperimental setting, we quantify the time benefit that the provident vehicle\ndetection system provides compared to an in-production computer vision system.\nAdditionally, the glare-free high beam use case provides a real-time and\nreal-world visualization interface of the detection results. With this\ncontribution, we want to put awareness on the unconventional sensing task of\nprovident object detection and further close the performance gap between human\nbehavior and computer vision algorithms in order to bring autonomous and\nautomated driving a step forward.",

However, it is\ndifficult to produce high-quality arbitrary view synthetic X-ray images in\nreal-time due to different CT slice thickness, high computational cost, and the\ncomplexity of algorithms. Our goal is to generate high-resolution synthetic\nX-ray images in real-time by upsampling low-resolution images with deep\nlearning-based super-resolution methods. Reference-based Super Resolution\n(RefSR) has been well studied in recent years and has shown higher performance\nthan traditional Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). It can produce fine\ndetails by utilizing the reference image but still inevitably generates some\nartifacts and noise. In this paper, we introduce frequency domain loss as a\nconstraint to further improve the quality of the RefSR results with fine\ndetails and without obvious artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first paper utilizing the frequency domain for the loss functions in the\nfield of super-resolution.

          "description": "Existing blind image super-resolution (SR) methods mostly assume blur kernels\nare spatially invariant across the whole image. However, such an assumption is\nrarely applicable for real images whose blur kernels are usually spatially\nvariant due to factors such as object motion and out-of-focus. Hence, existing\nblind SR methods would inevitably give rise to poor performance in real\napplications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a mutual affine\nnetwork (MANet) for spatially variant kernel estimation. Specifically, MANet\nhas two distinctive features. First, it has a moderate receptive field so as to\nkeep the locality of degradation. Second, it involves a new mutual affine\nconvolution (MAConv) layer that enhances feature expressiveness without\nincreasing receptive field, model size and computation burden. This is made\npossible through exploiting channel interdependence, which applies each channel\nsplit with an affine transformation module whose input are the rest channel\nsplits. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real images show that the\nproposed MANet not only performs favorably for both spatially variant and\ninvariant kernel estimation, but also leads to state-of-the-art blind SR\nperformance when combined with non-blind SR methods.",

          "description": "Vision transformers have attracted much attention from computer vision\nresearchers as they are not restricted to the spatial inductive bias of\nConvNets. However, although Transformer-based backbones have achieved much\nprogress on ImageNet classification, it is still unclear whether the learned\nrepresentations are as transferable as or even more transferable than ConvNets'\nfeatures. To address this point, we systematically investigate the transfer\nlearning ability of ConvNets and vision transformers in 15 single-task and\nmulti-task performance evaluations. Given the strong correlation between the\nperformance of pre-trained models and transfer learning, we include 2 residual\nConvNets (i.e., R-101x3 and R-152x4) and 3 Transformer-based visual backbones\n(i.e., ViT-B, ViT-L and Swin-B), which have close error rates on ImageNet, that\nindicate similar transfer learning performance on downstream datasets.\n\nWe observe consistent advantages of Transformer-based backbones on 13\ndownstream tasks (out of 15), including but not limited to fine-grained\nclassification, scene recognition (classification, segmentation and depth\nestimation), open-domain classification, face recognition, etc. More\nspecifically, we find that two ViT models heavily rely on whole network\nfine-tuning to achieve performance gains while Swin Transformer does not have\nsuch a requirement. Moreover, vision transformers behave more robustly in\nmulti-task learning, i.e., bringing more improvements when managing mutually\nbeneficial tasks and reducing performance losses when tackling irrelevant\ntasks. We hope our discoveries can facilitate the exploration and exploitation\nof vision transformers in the future.",

In the last years, several works have addressed this\nproblem with heavy and complex models that try to capture visual-textual\ndependencies better than before.

          "description": "Normalizing flows have recently demonstrated promising results for low-level\nvision tasks. For image super-resolution (SR), it learns to predict diverse\nphoto-realistic high-resolution (HR) images from the low-resolution (LR) image\nrather than learning a deterministic mapping. For image rescaling, it achieves\nhigh accuracy by jointly modelling the downscaling and upscaling processes.\nWhile existing approaches employ specialized techniques for these two tasks, we\nset out to unify them in a single formulation. In this paper, we propose the\nhierarchical conditional flow (HCFlow) as a unified framework for image SR and\nimage rescaling. More specifically, HCFlow learns a bijective mapping between\nHR and LR image pairs by modelling the distribution of the LR image and the\nrest high-frequency component simultaneously. In particular, the high-frequency\ncomponent is conditional on the LR image in a hierarchical manner. To further\nenhance the performance, other losses such as perceptual loss and GAN loss are\ncombined with the commonly used negative log-likelihood loss in training.\nExtensive experiments on general image SR, face image SR and image rescaling\nhave demonstrated that the proposed HCFlow achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.",

          "description": "Medical images, especially volumetric images, are of high resolution and\noften exceed the capacity of standard desktop GPUs. As a result, most deep\nlearning-based medical image analysis tasks require the input images to be\ndownsampled, often substantially, before these can be fed to a neural network.\nHowever, downsampling can lead to a loss of image quality, which is undesirable\nespecially in reconstruction tasks, where the fine geometric details need to be\npreserved. In this paper, we propose that high-resolution images can be\nreconstructed in a coarse-to-fine fashion, where a deep learning algorithm is\nonly responsible for generating a coarse representation of the image, which\nconsumes moderate GPU memory. For producing the high-resolution outcome, we\npropose two novel methods: learned voxel rearrangement of the coarse output and\nhierarchical image synthesis. Compared to the coarse output, the\nhigh-resolution counterpart allows for smooth surface triangulation, which can\nbe 3D-printed in the highest possible quality.

          "description": "This paper presents a real-time online vision framework to jointly recover an\nindoor scene's 3D structure and semantic label. Given noisy depth maps, a\ncamera trajectory, and 2D semantic labels at train time, the proposed neural\nnetwork learns to fuse the depth over frames with suitable semantic labels in\nthe scene space. Our approach exploits the joint volumetric representation of\nthe depth and semantics in the scene feature space to solve this task. For a\ncompelling online fusion of the semantic labels and geometry in real-time, we\nintroduce an efficient vortex pooling block while dropping the routing network\nin online depth fusion to preserve high-frequency surface details. We show that\nthe context information provided by the semantics of the scene helps the depth\nfusion network learn noise-resistant features. Not only that, it helps overcome\nthe shortcomings of the current online depth fusion method in dealing with thin\nobject structures, thickening artifacts, and false surfaces. Experimental\nevaluation on the Replica dataset shows that our approach can perform depth\nfusion at 37, 10 frames per second with an average reconstruction F-score of\n88%, and 91%, respectively, depending on the depth map resolution. Moreover,\nour model shows an average IoU score of 0.515 on the ScanNet 3D semantic\nbenchmark leaderboard.",

However, there is an ever-increasing need of more\npowerful and efficient SBCs which can run power intensive Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) in real-time and can also satisfy necessary functional safety\nrequirements such as Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL). ProAI is being\ndeveloped by ZF mainly to run powerful and efficient applications such as\nmultitask DNNs and on top of that it also has the required safety certification\nfor AD. In this work, we compare and discuss state of the art SBC on the basis\nof power intensive multitask DNN architecture called Multitask-CenterNet with\nrespect to performance measures such as, FPS and power efficiency. As an\nautomotive supercomputer, ProAI delivers an excellent combination of\nperformance and efficiency, managing nearly twice the number of FPS per watt\nthan a modern workstation laptop and almost four times compared to the Jetson\nNano.

          "description": "Virtual 3D try-on can provide an intuitive and realistic view for online\nshopping and has a huge potential commercial value. However, existing 3D\nvirtual try-on methods mainly rely on annotated 3D human shapes and garment\ntemplates, which hinders their applications in practical scenarios. 2D virtual\ntry-on approaches provide a faster alternative to manipulate clothed humans,\nbut lack the rich and realistic 3D representation. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Monocular-to-3D Virtual Try-On Network (M3D-VTON) that builds on the\nmerits of both 2D and 3D approaches. By integrating 2D information efficiently\nand learning a mapping that lifts the 2D representation to 3D, we make the\nfirst attempt to reconstruct a 3D try-on mesh only taking the target clothing\nand a person image as inputs. The proposed M3D-VTON includes three modules: 1)\nThe Monocular Prediction Module (MPM) that estimates an initial full-body depth\nmap and accomplishes 2D clothes-person alignment through a novel two-stage\nwarping procedure; 2) The Depth Refinement Module (DRM) that refines the\ninitial body depth to produce more detailed pleat and face characteristics; 3)\nThe Texture Fusion Module (TFM) that fuses the warped clothing with the\nnon-target body part to refine the results. We also construct a high-quality\nsynthesized Monocular-to-3D virtual try-on dataset, in which each person image\nis associated with a front and a back depth map. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed M3D-VTON can manipulate and reconstruct the 3D\nhuman body wearing the given clothing with compelling details and is more\nefficient than other 3D approaches.",

          "description": "Medical imaging technologies, including computed tomography (CT) or chest\nX-Ray (CXR), are largely employed to facilitate the diagnosis of the COVID-19.\nSince manual report writing is usually too time-consuming, a more intelligent\nauxiliary medical system that could generate medical reports automatically and\nimmediately is urgently needed. In this article, we propose to use the medical\nvisual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the\nCOVID-19 scans and generate the medical report automatically based on the\ndetected lesion regions. To produce more accurate medical reports and minimize\nthe visual-and-linguistic differences, this model adopts an alternate learning\nstrategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.\nTo be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the\nknowledge from medical texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize\nthe acquired knowledge for professional medical sentences generations through\nobservations of medical images. In practice, for automatic medical report\ngeneration on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical\nfindings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital\nof Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun\nYat-sen University, Zhuhai, China. Besides, to alleviate the insufficiency of\nthe COVID-19 training samples, our model was first trained on the large-scale\nChinese CX-CHR dataset and then transferred to the COVID-19 CT dataset for\nfurther fine-tuning. The experimental results showed that Medical-VLBERT\nachieved state-of-the-art performances on terminology prediction and report\ngeneration with the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset and the CX-CHR dataset.

          "description": "Background: Cervical cancer seriously affects the health of the female\nreproductive system. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) emerges as a\nnon-invasive, high-resolution imaging technology for cervical disease\ndetection. However, OCT image annotation is knowledge-intensive and\ntime-consuming, which impedes the training process of deep-learning-based\nclassification models. Objective: This study aims to develop a computer-aided\ndiagnosis (CADx) approach to classifying in-vivo cervical OCT images based on\nself-supervised learning. Methods: Besides high-level semantic features\nextracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed CADx approach\nleverages unlabeled cervical OCT images' texture features learned by\ncontrastive texture learning. We conducted ten-fold cross-validation on the OCT\nimage dataset from a multi-center clinical study on 733 patients from China.\nResults: In a binary classification task for detecting high-risk diseases,\nincluding high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and cervical\ncancer, our method achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.9798 Plus\nor Minus 0.0157 with a sensitivity of 91.17 Plus or Minus 4.99% and a\nspecificity of 93.96 Plus or Minus 4.72% for OCT image patches; also, it\noutperformed two out of four medical experts on the test set. Furthermore, our\nmethod achieved a 91.53% sensitivity and 97.37% specificity on an external\nvalidation dataset containing 287 3D OCT volumes from 118 Chinese patients in a\nnew hospital using a cross-shaped threshold voting strategy. Conclusion: The\nproposed contrastive-learning-based CADx method outperformed the end-to-end CNN\nmodels and provided better interpretability based on texture features, which\nholds great potential to be used in the clinical protocol of \"see-and-treat.\"",

          "description": "Many camera sensors use a dual-pixel (DP) design that operates as a\nrudimentary light field providing two sub-aperture views of a scene in a single\ncapture. The DP sensor was developed to improve how cameras perform autofocus.\nSince the DP sensor's introduction, researchers have found additional uses for\nthe DP data, such as depth estimation, reflection removal, and defocus\ndeblurring. We are interested in the latter task of defocus deblurring. In\nparticular, we propose a single-image deblurring network that incorporates the\ntwo sub-aperture views into a multi-task framework. Specifically, we show that\njointly learning to predict the two DP views from a single blurry input image\nimproves the network's ability to learn to deblur the image. Our experiments\nshow this multi-task strategy achieves +1dB PSNR improvement over\nstate-of-the-art defocus deblurring methods. In addition, our multi-task\nframework allows accurate DP-view synthesis (e.g., ~ 39dB PSNR) from the single\ninput image. These high-quality DP views can be used for other DP-based\napplications, such as reflection removal. As part of this effort, we have\ncaptured a new dataset of 7,059 high-quality images to support our training for\nthe DP-view synthesis task.

          "description": "Deep hashing has been widely applied to large-scale image retrieval by\nencoding high-dimensional data points into binary codes for efficient\nretrieval. Compared with pairwise/triplet similarity based hash learning,\ncentral similarity based hashing can more efficiently capture the global data\ndistribution. For multi-label image retrieval, however, previous methods only\nuse multiple hash centers with equal weights to generate one centroid as the\nlearning target, which ignores the relationship between the weights of hash\ncenters and the proportion of instance regions in the image. To address the\nabove issue, we propose a two-step alternative optimization approach,\nInstance-weighted Central Similarity (ICS), to automatically learn the center\nweight corresponding to a hash code. Firstly, we apply the maximum entropy\nregularizer to prevent one hash center from dominating the loss function, and\ncompute the center weights via projection gradient descent. Secondly, we update\nneural network parameters by standard back-propagation with fixed center\nweights. More importantly, the learned center weights can well reflect the\nproportion of foreground instances in the image. Our method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on the image retrieval benchmarks, and especially\nimproves the mAP by 1.6%-6.4% on the MS COCO dataset.",

          "description": "More than 90\\% of colorectal cancer is gradually transformed from colorectal\npolyps. In clinical practice, precise polyp segmentation provides important\ninformation in the early detection of colorectal cancer. Therefore, automatic\npolyp segmentation techniques are of great importance for both patients and\ndoctors. Most existing methods are based on U-shape structure and use\nelement-wise addition or concatenation to fuse different level features\nprogressively in decoder. However, both the two operations easily generate\nplenty of redundant information, which will weaken the complementarity between\ndifferent level features, resulting in inaccurate localization and blurred\nedges of polyps. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-scale\nsubtraction network (MSNet) to segment polyp from colonoscopy image.\nSpecifically, we first design a subtraction unit (SU) to produce the difference\nfeatures between adjacent levels in encoder. Then, we pyramidally equip the SUs\nat different levels with varying receptive fields, thereby obtaining rich\nmulti-scale difference information. In addition, we build a training-free\nnetwork \"LossNet\" to comprehensively supervise the polyp-aware features from\nbottom layer to top layer, which drives the MSNet to capture the detailed and\nstructural cues simultaneously. Extensive experiments on five benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our MSNet performs favorably against most\nstate-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics.

Recently, a new problem of\ngenerating cloned or synthesized human voice of a person is emerging. AI-based\ndeep learning models can synthesize any person's voice requiring just a few\nseconds of audio. With the emerging threat of impersonation attacks using\ndeepfake videos and audios, new deepfake detectors are need that focuses on\nboth, video and audio. Detecting deepfakes is a challenging task and\nresearchers have made numerous attempts and proposed several deepfake detection\nmethods. To develop a good deepfake detector, a handsome amount of good quality\ndataset is needed that captures the real world scenarios. Many researchers have\ncontributed in this cause and provided several deepfake dataset, self generated\nand in-the-wild. However, almost all of these datasets either contains deepfake\nvideos or audio. Moreover, the recent deepfake datasets proposed by researchers\nhave racial bias issues. Hence, there is a crucial need of a good deepfake\nvideo and audio deepfake dataset. To fill this gap, we propose a novel\nAudio-Video Deepfake dataset (FakeAVCeleb) that not only contains deepfake\nvideos but respective synthesized cloned audios as well. We generated our\ndataset using recent most popular deepfake generation methods and the videos\nand audios are perfectly lip-synced with each other. To generate a more\nrealistic dataset, we selected real YouTube videos of celebrities having four\nracial backgrounds (Caucasian, Black, East Asian and South Asian) to counter\nthe racial bias issue.

          "description": "Multitask learning is a common approach in machine learning, which allows to\ntrain multiple objectives with a shared architecture. It has been shown that by\ntraining multiple tasks together inference time and compute resources can be\nsaved, while the objectives performance remains on a similar or even higher\nlevel. However, in perception related multitask networks only closely related\ntasks can be found, such as object detection, instance and semantic\nsegmentation or depth estimation. Multitask networks with diverse tasks and\ntheir effects with respect to efficiency on one another are not well studied.\nIn this paper we augment the CenterNet anchor-free approach for training\nmultiple diverse perception related tasks together, including the task of\nobject detection and semantic segmentation as well as human pose estimation. We\nrefer to this DNN as Multitask-CenterNet (MCN). Additionally, we study\ndifferent MCN settings for efficiency. The MCN can perform several tasks at\nonce while maintaining, and in some cases even exceeding, the performance\nvalues of its corresponding single task networks. More importantly, the MCN\narchitecture decreases inference time and reduces network size when compared to\na composition of single task networks.",

Conventional methods typically\nstack sub-networks with multi-scale input images and gradually improve\nsharpness of images from the bottom sub-network to the top sub-network,\nyielding inevitably high computational costs. Toward a fast and accurate\ndeblurring network design, we revisit the coarse-to-fine strategy and present a\nmulti-input multi-output U-net (MIMO-UNet). The MIMO-UNet has three distinct\nfeatures. First, the single encoder of the MIMO-UNet takes multi-scale input\nimages to ease the difficulty of training. Second, the single decoder of the\nMIMO-UNet outputs multiple deblurred images with different scales to mimic\nmulti-cascaded U-nets using a single U-shaped network.

          "description": "Existing efforts on Just noticeable difference (JND) estimation mainly\ndedicate to modeling the visibility masking effects of different factors in\nspatial and frequency domains, and then fusing them into an overall JND\nestimate. However, the overall visibility masking effect can be related with\nmore contributing factors beyond those have been considered in the literature\nand it is also insufficiently accurate to formulate the masking effect even for\nan individual factor. Moreover, the potential interactions among different\nmasking effects are also difficult to be characterized with a simple fusion\nmodel. In this work, we turn to a dramatically different way to address these\nproblems with a top-down design philosophy. Instead of formulating and fusing\nmultiple masking effects in a bottom-up way, the proposed JND estimation model\ndirectly generates a critical perceptual lossless (CPL) image from a top-down\nperspective and calculates the difference map between the original image and\nthe CPL image as the final JND map. Given an input image, an adaptively\ncritical point (perceptual lossless threshold), defined as the minimum number\nof spectral components in Karhunen-Lo\\'{e}ve Transform (KLT) used for\nperceptual lossless image reconstruction, is derived by exploiting the\nconvergence characteristics of KLT coefficient energy. Then, the CPL image can\nbe reconstructed via inverse KLT according to the derived critical point.\nFinally, the difference map between the original image and the CPL image is\ncalculated as the JND map. The performance of the proposed JND model is\nevaluated with two applications including JND-guided noise injection and\nJND-guided image compression. Experimental results have demonstrated that our\nproposed JND model can achieve better performance than several latest JND\nmodels.",

          "description": "Few-shot learning aims to recognize novel classes with few examples.\nPre-training based methods effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a\nfeature extractor and then fine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based\nmeta-learning. However, results show that the fine-tuning step makes marginal\nimprovements. In this paper, 1) we figure out the reason, i.e., in the\npre-trained feature space, the base classes already form compact clusters while\nnovel classes spread as groups with large variances, which implies that\nfine-tuning feature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning\nfeature extractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes.\nConsequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based meta-learning\nframework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge (i.e.,\nclass-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative features\nfor seen attributes as priors. Second, a part/attribute transfer network is\ndesigned to learn to infer the representative features for unseen attributes as\nsupplementary priors. Finally, a prototype completion network is devised to\nlearn to complete prototypes with these priors. Moreover, to avoid the\nprototype completion error, we further develop a Gaussian based prototype\nfusion strategy that fuses the mean-based and completed prototypes by\nexploiting the unlabeled samples.

However, box filter can not keep some features of the\nsignal, such as edges, corners and the jump in the step function. In this\npaper, we present a one-sided box filter that can smooth the signal but keep\nthe discontinuous features in the signal. More specifically, we perform box\nfilter on eight one-sided windows, leading to a one-sided box filter that can\npreserve corners and edges. Our filter inherits the constant $O(1)$\ncomputational complexity of the original box filter with respect to the window\nsize and also the linear $O(N)$ computational complexity with respect to the\ntotal number of samples. We performance several experiments to show the\nefficiency and effectiveness of this filter. We further compare our filter with\nother the-state-of-the-art edge preserving methods. Our filter can be deployed\nin a large range of applications where the classical box filter is adopted.",

          "description": "Different from visible cameras which record intensity images frame by frame,\nthe biologically inspired event camera produces a stream of asynchronous and\nsparse events with much lower latency. In practice, the visible cameras can\nbetter perceive texture details and slow motion, while event cameras can be\nfree from motion blurs and have a larger dynamic range which enables them to\nwork well under fast motion and low illumination. Therefore, the two sensors\ncan cooperate with each other to achieve more reliable object tracking. In this\nwork, we propose a large-scale Visible-Event benchmark (termed VisEvent) due to\nthe lack of a realistic and scaled dataset for this task. Our dataset consists\nof 820 video pairs captured under low illumination, high speed, and background\nclutter scenarios, and it is divided into a training and a testing subset, each\nof which contains 500 and 320 videos, respectively. Based on VisEvent, we\ntransform the event flows into event images and construct more than 30 baseline\nmethods by extending current single-modality trackers into dual-modality\nversions. More importantly, we further build a simple but effective tracking\nalgorithm by proposing a cross-modality transformer, to achieve more effective\nfeature fusion between visible and event data. Extensive experiments on the\nproposed VisEvent dataset, and two simulated datasets (i.e., OTB-DVS and\nVOT-DVS), validated the effectiveness of our model.

          "description": "Universal adversarial attacks, which hinder most deep neural network (DNN)\ntasks using only a small single perturbation called a universal adversarial\nperturbation (UAP), is a realistic security threat to the practical application\nof a DNN. In particular, such attacks cause serious problems in medical\nimaging. Given that computer-based systems are generally operated under a\nblack-box condition in which only queries on inputs are allowed and outputs are\naccessible, the impact of UAPs seems to be limited because well-used algorithms\nfor generating UAPs are limited to a white-box condition in which adversaries\ncan access the model weights and loss gradients. Nevertheless, we demonstrate\nthat UAPs are easily generatable using a relatively small dataset under\nblack-box conditions. In particular, we propose a method for generating UAPs\nusing a simple hill-climbing search based only on DNN outputs and demonstrate\nthe validity of the proposed method using representative DNN-based medical\nimage classifications. Black-box UAPs can be used to conduct both non-targeted\nand targeted attacks. Overall, the black-box UAPs showed high attack success\nrates (40% to 90%), although some of them had relatively low success rates\nbecause the method only utilizes limited information to generate UAPs. The\nvulnerability of black-box UAPs was observed in several model architectures.\nThe results indicate that adversaries can also generate UAPs through a simple\nprocedure under the black-box condition to foil or control DNN-based medical\nimage diagnoses, and that UAPs are a more realistic security threat.",

Owing to label\nsparsity, existing work fails to learn action completeness, resulting in\nfragmentary action predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,\nwhere dense pseudo-labels are generated to provide completeness guidance for\nthe model. Concretely, we first select pseudo background points to supplement\npoint-level action labels. Then, by taking the points as seeds, we search for\nthe optimal sequence that is likely to contain complete action instances while\nagreeing with the seeds. To learn completeness from the obtained sequence, we\nintroduce two novel losses that contrast action instances with background ones\nin terms of action score and feature similarity, respectively.

Moreover, we demonstrate the superiority of our\nmethod over existing state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks: THUMOS'14,\nGTEA, BEOID, and ActivityNet.

Secondly, we propose\na bidirectional multi-layer fusion scheme, where multimodal features can be\nexploited progressively. To take advantage of such scheme, we introduce two\nasymmetric fusion operations including channel shuffle and pixel shift, which\nlearn different fused features with respect to different fusion directions.\nThese two operations are parameter-free and strengthen the multimodal feature\ninteractions across channels as well as enhance the spatial feature\ndiscrimination within channels.

To overcome the real-world limitations of data collection,\nsimulating tactile response in a virtual environment comes as a desirable\ndirection of robotic research. In this paper, we propose Elastic Interaction of\nParticles (EIP) for tactile simulation. Most existing works model the tactile\nsensor as a rigid multi-body, which is incapable of reflecting the elastic\nproperty of the tactile sensor as well as characterizing the fine-grained\nphysical interaction between the two objects. By contrast, EIP models the\ntactile sensor as a group of coordinated particles, and the elastic property is\napplied to regulate the deformation of particles during contact. With the\ntactile simulation by EIP, we further propose a tactile-visual perception\nnetwork that enables information fusion between tactile data and visual images.\nThe perception network is based on a global-to-local fusion mechanism where\nmulti-scale tactile features are aggregated to the corresponding local region\nof the visual modality with the guidance of tactile positions and directions.\nThe fusion method exhibits superiority regarding the 3D geometric\nreconstruction task.",

Several math symbols are very\nsimilar in the writing style, such as dot and comma or 0, O, and o, which is a\nchallenge for HME recognition systems to handle without using contextual\ninformation. To address this problem, this paper presents a Transformer-based\nMath Language Model (TMLM). Based on the self-attention mechanism, the\nhigh-level representation of an input token in a sequence of tokens is computed\nby how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long\ndependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical\nexpression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of\napproximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the\nperplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e.,\nthe N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we\ncombine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition\nsystem using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates. The\nexpression rates on the testing sets of CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 were\nimproved by 2.97 and 0.83 percentage points, respectively.",

          "description": "Face recognition (FR) has made extraordinary progress owing to the\nadvancement of deep convolutional neural networks. However, demographic bias\namong different racial cohorts still challenges the practical face recognition\nsystem. The race factor has been proven to be a dilemma for fair FR (FFR) as\nthe subject-related specific attributes induce the classification bias whilst\ncarrying some useful cues for FR. To mitigate racial bias and meantime preserve\nrobust FR, we abstract face identity-related representation as a signal\ndenoising problem and propose a progressive cross transformer (PCT) method for\nfair face recognition. Originating from the signal decomposition theory, we\nattempt to decouple face representation into i) identity-related components and\nii) noisy/identity-unrelated components induced by race. As an extension of\nsignal subspace decomposition, we formulate face decoupling as a generalized\nfunctional expression model to cross-predict face identity and race\ninformation. The face expression model is further concretized by designing dual\ncross-transformers to distill identity-related components and suppress racial\nnoises. In order to refine face representation, we take a progressive face\ndecoupling way to learn identity/race-specific transformations, so that\nidentity-unrelated components induced by race could be better disentangled. We\nevaluate the proposed PCT on the public fair face recognition benchmarks (BFW,\nRFW) and verify that PCT is capable of mitigating bias in face recognition\nwhile achieving state-of-the-art FR performance.

          "description": "Recent progress of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) demonstrates the capability\nof these methods in computer vision field. However, this progress could not\nshow any promises for fine-grained tasks such as Head Pose estimation. In this\narticle, we have tried to answer a question: How SSL can be used for Head Pose\nestimation? In general, there are two main approaches to use SSL: 1. Using\npre-trained weights which can be done via weights pre-training on ImageNet or\nvia SSL tasks. 2. Leveraging SSL as an auxiliary co-training task besides of\nSupervised Learning (SL) tasks at the same time. In this study, modified\nversions of jigsaw puzzling and rotation as SSL pre-text tasks are used and the\nbest architecture for our proposed Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL) is found.\nFinally, the HopeNet method as a baseline is selected and the impact of SSL\npre-training and ImageNet pre-training on both HMTL and SL are compared. The\nerror rate reduced by the HTML method up to 11% compare to the SL. Moreover,\nHMTL method showed that it was good with all kinds of initial weights: random,\nImageNet and SSL pre-training weights. Also, it was observed, when puzzled\nimages are used for SL alone, the average error rate placed between SL and HMTL\nwhich showed the importance of local spatial features compare to global spatial\nfeatures.",

          "description": "Perceiving obstacles and avoiding collisions is fundamental to the safe\noperation of a robot system, particularly when the robot must operate in highly\ndynamic human environments. Proximity detection using on-robot sensors can be\nused to avoid or mitigate impending collisions. However, existing proximity\nsensing methods are orientation and placement dependent, resulting in blind\nspots even with large numbers of sensors. In this paper, we introduce the\nphenomenon of the Leaky Surface Wave (LSW), a novel sensing modality, and\npresent AuraSense, a proximity detection system using the LSW. AuraSense is the\nfirst system to realize no-dead-spot proximity sensing for robot arms. It\nrequires only a single pair of piezoelectric transducers, and can easily be\napplied to off-the-shelf robots with minimal modifications. We further\nintroduce a set of signal processing techniques and a lightweight neural\nnetwork to address the unique challenges in using the LSW for proximity\nsensing. Finally, we demonstrate a prototype system consisting of a single\npiezoelectric element pair on a robot manipulator, which validates our design.\nWe conducted several micro benchmark experiments and performed more than 2000\non-robot proximity detection trials with various potential robot arm materials,\ncolliding objects, approach patterns, and robot movement patterns. AuraSense\nachieves 100% and 95.3% true positive proximity detection rates when the arm\napproaches static and mobile obstacles respectively, with a true negative rate\nover 99%, showing the real-world viability of this system.",

But the problem\nwith binaural audio recording is that it requires a specialized setup which is\nnot possible to fabricate within handheld devices as compared to traditional\nmono audio that can be recorded with a single microphone. In order to overcome\nthis drawback, prior works have tried to uplift the mono recorded audio to\nbinaural audio as a post processing step conditioning on the visual input. But\nall the prior approaches missed other most important information required for\nthe task, i.e. distance of different sound producing objects from the recording\nsetup. In this work, we argue that the depth map of the scene can act as a\nproxy for encoding distance information of objects in the scene and show that\nadding depth features along with image features improves the performance both\nqualitatively and quantitatively.

However, previous methods usually suffered from\ndiscrete nature of point cloud and unstructured prediction of points in local\nregions, which makes it hard to reveal fine local geometric details on the\ncomplete shape. To resolve this issue, we propose SnowflakeNet with Snowflake\nPoint Deconvolution (SPD) to generate the complete point clouds. The\nSnowflakeNet models the generation of complete point clouds as the\nsnowflake-like growth of points in 3D space, where the child points are\nprogressively generated by splitting their parent points after each SPD. Our\ninsight of revealing detailed geometry is to introduce skip-transformer in SPD\nto learn point splitting patterns which can fit local regions the best.\nSkip-transformer leverages attention mechanism to summarize the splitting\npatterns used in the previous SPD layer to produce the splitting in the current\nSPD layer. The locally compact and structured point cloud generated by SPD is\nable to precisely capture the structure characteristic of 3D shape in local\npatches, which enables the network to predict highly detailed geometries, such\nas smooth regions, sharp edges and corners.

          "description": "We propose a novel framework for fine-grained object recognition that learns\nto recover object variation in 3D space from a single image, trained on an\nimage collection without using any ground-truth 3D annotation. We accomplish\nthis by representing an object as a composition of 3D shape and its appearance,\nwhile eliminating the effect of camera viewpoint, in a canonical configuration.\nUnlike conventional methods modeling spatial variation in 2D images only, our\nmethod is capable of reconfiguring the appearance feature in a canonical 3D\nspace, thus enabling the subsequent object classifier to be invariant under 3D\ngeometric variation. Our representation also allows us to go beyond existing\nmethods, by incorporating 3D shape variation as an additional cue for object\nrecognition. To learn the model without ground-truth 3D annotation, we deploy a\ndifferentiable renderer in an analysis-by-synthesis framework. By incorporating\n3D shape and appearance jointly in a deep representation, our method learns the\ndiscriminative representation of the object and achieves competitive\nperformance on fine-grained image recognition and vehicle re-identification. We\nalso demonstrate that the performance of 3D shape reconstruction is improved by\nlearning fine-grained shape deformation in a boosting manner.",

          "description": "We introduce the problem of multi-camera trajectory forecasting (MCTF), which\ninvolves predicting the trajectory of a moving object across a network of\ncameras. While multi-camera setups are widespread for applications such as\nsurveillance and traffic monitoring, existing trajectory forecasting methods\ntypically focus on single-camera trajectory forecasting (SCTF), limiting their\nuse for such applications. Furthermore, using a single camera limits the\nfield-of-view available, making long-term trajectory forecasting impossible. We\naddress these shortcomings of SCTF by developing an MCTF framework that\nsimultaneously uses all estimated relative object locations from several\nviewpoints and predicts the object's future location in all possible\nviewpoints. Our framework follows a Which-When-Where approach that predicts in\nwhich camera(s) the objects appear and when and where within the camera views\nthey appear. To this end, we propose the concept of trajectory tensors: a new\ntechnique to encode trajectories across multiple camera views and the\nassociated uncertainties. We develop several encoder-decoder MCTF models for\ntrajectory tensors and present extensive experiments on our own database\n(comprising 600 hours of video data from 15 camera views) created particularly\nfor the MCTF task. Results show that our trajectory tensor models outperform\ncoordinate trajectory-based MCTF models and existing SCTF methods adapted for\nMCTF.

We aim to explore the three key properties required by\nthe task --- relation-aware, consistent, and decoupled --- to learn rich and\nrobust features for primitive concepts that compose attribute-object pairs. To\nthis end, we propose the Blocked Message Passing Network (BMP-Net). The model\nconsists of two modules. The concept module generates semantically meaningful\nfeatures for primitive concepts, whereas the visual module extracts visual\nfeatures for attributes and objects from input images. A message passing\nmechanism is used in the concept module to capture the relations between\nprimitive concepts. Furthermore, to prevent the model from being biased towards\nseen composite concepts and reduce the entanglement between attributes and\nobjects, we propose a blocking mechanism that equalizes the information\navailable to the model for both seen and unseen concepts.

Despite progress in machine learning and computer\nvision that allows for advanced gesture recognition, an integrated collection\nof such open-source methods and a user-customisable approach to utilising them\nin a low-cost solution for touchless interaction in existing software is still\nmissing. In this paper, we introduce the MotionInput v2.0 application.

It then maps human motion gestures to input operations for existing\napplications and games. The user can choose their own preferred way of\ninteracting from a series of motion types, including single and bi-modal hand\ngesturing, full-body repetitive or extremities-based exercises, head and facial\nmovements, eye tracking, and combinations of the above. We also introduce a\nseries of bespoke gesture recognition classifications as DirectInput triggers,\nincluding gestures for idle states, auto calibration, depth capture from a 2D\nRGB webcam stream and tracking of facial motions such as mouth motions,\nwinking, and head direction with rotation. Three use case areas assisted the\ndevelopment of the modules: creativity software, office and clinical software,\nand gaming software. A collection of open-source libraries has been integrated\nand provide a layer of modular gesture mapping on top of existing mouse and\nkeyboard controls in Windows via DirectX.

Incrementally learning\nthese OOD objects with few annotations is an ideal way to enlarge the knowledge\nbase of the deep learning models. In this paper, we propose an open world\nsemantic segmentation system that includes two modules: (1) an open-set\nsemantic segmentation module to detect both in-distribution and OOD objects.\n(2) an incremental few-shot learning module to gradually incorporate those OOD\nobjects into its existing knowledge base.

We adopt the Deep Metric\nLearning Network (DMLNet) with contrastive clustering to implement open-set\nsemantic segmentation. Compared to other open-set semantic segmentation\nmethods, our DMLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging\nopen-set semantic segmentation datasets without using additional data or\ngenerative models.

          "description": "Background and Aim: Recently, deep learning using convolutional neural\nnetwork has been used successfully to classify the images of breast cells\naccurately. However, the accuracy of manual classification of those\nhistopathological images is comparatively low. This research aims to increase\nthe accuracy of the classification of breast cancer images by utilizing a\nPatch-Based Classifier (PBC) along with deep learning architecture.\nMethodology: The proposed system consists of a Deep Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (DCNN) that helps in enhancing and increasing the accuracy of the\nclassification process. This is done by the use of the Patch-based Classifier\n(PBC). CNN has completely different layers where images are first fed through\nconvolutional layers using hyperbolic tangent function together with the\nmax-pooling layer, drop out layers, and SoftMax function for classification.\nFurther, the output obtained is fed to a patch-based classifier that consists\nof patch-wise classification output followed by majority voting. Results: The\nresults are obtained throughout the classification stage for breast cancer\nimages that are collected from breast-histology datasets. The proposed solution\nimproves the accuracy of classification whether or not the images had normal,\nbenign, in-situ, or invasive carcinoma from 87% to 94% with a decrease in\nprocessing time from 0.45 s to 0.2s on average.

While recent progress\nof deep learning has boosted performance on various tasks using visual cues,\ndeep cognition to reason intentions, motivation, or causality remains\nchallenging. Existing datasets that aim to examine video reasoning capability\nfocus on visual signals such as actions, objects, relations, or could be\nanswered utilizing text bias. Observing this, we propose a novel task, along\nwith a new dataset: Trope Understanding in Movies and Animations (TrUMAn),\nintending to evaluate and develop learning systems beyond visual signals.\nTropes are frequently used storytelling devices for creative works. By coping\nwith the trope understanding task and enabling the deep cognition skills of\nmachines, we are optimistic that data mining applications and algorithms could\nbe taken to the next level. To tackle the challenging TrUMAn dataset, we\npresent a Trope Understanding and Storytelling (TrUSt) with a new Conceptual\nStoryteller module, which guides the video encoder by performing video\nstorytelling on a latent space. The generated story embedding is then fed into\nthe trope understanding model to provide further signals. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that state-of-the-art learning systems on existing tasks reach only\n12.01% of accuracy with raw input signals. Also, even in the oracle case with\nhuman-annotated descriptions, BERT contextual embedding achieves at most 28% of\naccuracy. Our proposed TrUSt boosts the model performance and reaches 13.94%\nperformance. We also provide detailed analysis topave the way for future\nresearch.

The main challenge\nof this task is the large modality gap between attributes and images. To reduce\nthe gap, we present a new loss for learning cross-modal embeddings in the\ncontext of attribute-based person search. We regard a set of attributes as a\ncategory of people sharing the same traits. In a joint embedding space of the\ntwo modalities, our loss pulls images close to their person categories for\nmodality alignment. More importantly, it pushes apart a pair of person\ncategories by a margin determined adaptively by their semantic distance, where\nthe distance metric is learned end-to-end so that the loss considers importance\nof each attribute when relating person categories.

We developed an interactive, scalable and fast image\nsimilarity search engine (which can take one or more images as the query image)\nthat automatically sifts through the unlabeled dataset reducing dataset\ngeneration time from weeks to minutes. In this work, we describe key components\nof the end to end pipeline. Our similarity search system was created to be able\nto identify similar images from a potentially petabyte scale database that are\nsimilar to an input image, and for this we had to break down each query image\ninto its features, which were generated by a classification layer stripped CNN\ntrained in a supervised manner. To store and search these features efficiently,\nwe had to make several scalability improvements. To improve the speed, reduce\nthe storage, and shrink memory requirements for embedding search, we add a\nfully connected layer to our CNN make all images into a 128 length vector\nbefore entering the classification layers. This helped us compress the size of\nour image features from 2048 (for ResNet, which was initially tried as our\nfeaturizer) to 128 for our new custom model. Additionally, we utilize existing\napproximate nearest neighbor search libraries to significantly speed up\nembedding search. Our system currently searches over our entire database of\nimages at 5 seconds per query on a single virtual machine in the cloud. In the\nfuture, we would like to incorporate a SimCLR based featurizing model which\ncould be trained without any labelling by a human (since the classification\naspect of the model is irrelevant to this use case).",

To address the\naforementioned problems, we propose a novel multi-granular spatio-temporal\ngraph network for skeleton-based action classification that jointly models the\ncoarse- and fine-grained skeleton motion patterns. To this end, we develop a\ndual-head graph network consisting of two interleaved branches, which enables\nus to extract features at two spatio-temporal resolutions in an effective and\nefficient manner. Moreover, our network utilises a cross-head communication\nstrategy to mutually enhance the representations of both heads. We conducted\nextensive experiments on three large-scale datasets, namely NTU RGB+D 60, NTU\nRGB+D 120, and Kinetics-Skeleton, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance\non all the benchmarks, which validates the effectiveness of our method.",

          "description": "Development of deep learning systems for biomedical segmentation often\nrequires access to expert-driven, manually annotated datasets. If more than a\nsingle expert is involved in the annotation of the same images, then the\ninter-expert agreement is not necessarily perfect, and no single expert\nannotation can precisely capture the so-called ground truth of the regions of\ninterest on all images. Also, it is not trivial to generate a reference\nestimate using annotations from multiple experts. Here we present a deep neural\nnetwork, defined as U-Net-and-a-half, which can simultaneously learn from\nannotations performed by multiple experts on the same set of images.\nU-Net-and-a-half contains a convolutional encoder to generate features from the\ninput images, multiple decoders that allow simultaneous learning from image\nmasks obtained from annotations that were independently generated by multiple\nexperts, and a shared low-dimensional feature space. To demonstrate the\napplicability of our framework, we used two distinct datasets from digital\npathology and radiology, respectively. Specifically, we trained two separate\nmodels using pathologist-driven annotations of glomeruli on whole slide images\nof human kidney biopsies (10 patients), and radiologist-driven annotations of\nlumen cross-sections of human arteriovenous fistulae obtained from\nintravascular ultrasound images (10 patients), respectively. The models based\non U-Net-and-a-half exceeded the performance of the traditional U-Net models\ntrained on single expert annotations alone, thus expanding the scope of\nmultitask learning in the context of biomedical image segmentation.",

          "description": "This paper aims to demonstrate the efficiency of the Adversarial Open Domain\nAdaption framework for sketch-to-photo synthesis. The unsupervised open domain\nadaption for generating realistic photos from a hand-drawn sketch is\nchallenging as there is no such sketch of that class for training data. The\nabsence of learning supervision and the huge domain gap between both the\nfreehand drawing and picture domains make it hard. We present an approach that\nlearns both sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation to synthesise the\nmissing freehand drawings from pictures. Due to the domain gap between\nsynthetic sketches and genuine ones, the generator trained on false drawings\nmay produce unsatisfactory results when dealing with drawings of lacking\nclasses. To address this problem, we offer a simple but effective open-domain\nsampling and optimization method that tricks the generator into considering\nfalse drawings as genuine. Our approach generalises the learnt sketch-to-photo\nand photo-to-sketch mappings from in-domain input to open-domain categories. On\nthe Scribble and SketchyCOCO datasets, we compared our technique to the most\ncurrent competing methods. For many types of open-domain drawings, our model\noutperforms impressive results in synthesising accurate colour, substance, and\nretaining the structural layout.",

          "description": "Automatically generating videos in which synthesized speech is synchronized\nwith lip movements in a talking head has great potential in many human-computer\ninteraction scenarios. In this paper, we present an automatic method to\ngenerate synchronized speech and talking-head videos on the basis of text and a\nsingle face image of an arbitrary person as input. In contrast to previous\ntext-driven talking head generation methods, which can only synthesize the\nvoice of a specific person, the proposed method is capable of synthesizing\nspeech for any person that is inaccessible in the training stage. Specifically,\nthe proposed method decomposes the generation of synchronized speech and\ntalking head videos into two stages, i.e., a text-to-speech (TTS) stage and a\nspeech-driven talking head generation stage. The proposed TTS module is a\nface-conditioned multi-speaker TTS model that gets the speaker identity\ninformation from face images instead of speech, which allows us to synthesize a\npersonalized voice on the basis of the input face image. To generate the\ntalking head videos from the face images, a facial landmark-based method that\ncan predict both lip movements and head rotations is proposed. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate\nsynchronized speech and talking head videos for arbitrary persons and\nnon-persons. Synthesized speech shows consistency with the given face regarding\nto the synthesized voice's timbre and one's appearance in the image, and the\nproposed landmark-based talking head method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nlandmark-based method on generating natural talking head videos.",

          "description": "The neuroimage analysis community has neglected the automated segmentation of\nthe olfactory bulb (OB) despite its crucial role in olfactory function. The\nlack of an automatic processing method for the OB can be explained by its\nchallenging properties. Nonetheless, recent advances in MRI acquisition\ntechniques and resolution have allowed raters to generate more reliable manual\nannotations. Furthermore, the high accuracy of deep learning methods for\nsolving semantic segmentation problems provides us with an option to reliably\nassess even small structures. In this work, we introduce a novel, fast, and\nfully automated deep learning pipeline to accurately segment OB tissue on\nsub-millimeter T2-weighted (T2w) whole-brain MR images. To this end, we\ndesigned a three-stage pipeline: (1) Localization of a region containing both\nOBs using FastSurferCNN, (2) Segmentation of OB tissue within the localized\nregion through four independent AttFastSurferCNN - a novel deep learning\narchitecture with a self-attention mechanism to improve modeling of contextual\ninformation, and (3) Ensemble of the predicted label maps. The OB pipeline\nexhibits high performance in terms of boundary delineation, OB localization,\nand volume estimation across a wide range of ages in 203 participants of the\nRhineland Study. Moreover, it also generalizes to scans of an independent\ndataset never encountered during training, the Human Connectome Project (HCP),\nwith different acquisition parameters and demographics, evaluated in 30 cases\nat the native 0.7mm HCP resolution, and the default 0.8mm pipeline resolution.\nWe extensively validated our pipeline not only with respect to segmentation\naccuracy but also to known OB volume effects, where it can sensitively\nreplicate age effects.",

          "description": "Separating and labeling each instance of a nucleus (instance-aware\nsegmentation) is the key challenge in segmenting single cell nuclei on\nfluorescence microscopy images. Deep Neural Networks can learn the implicit\ntransformation of a nuclear image into a probability map indicating the class\nmembership of each pixel (nucleus or background), but the use of\npost-processing steps to turn the probability map into a labeled object mask is\nerror-prone. This especially accounts for nuclear images of tissue sections and\nnuclear images across varying tissue preparations. In this work, we aim to\nevaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to\nsegment nuclei in fluorescence images of various tissue origins and sample\npreparation types without post-processing. We compare architectures that\noperate on pixel to pixel translation and an architecture that operates on\nobject detection and subsequent locally applied segmentation. In addition, we\npropose a novel strategy to create artificial images to extend the training\nset. We evaluate the influence of ground truth annotation quality, image scale\nand segmentation complexity on segmentation performance. Results show that\nthree out of four deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net with ResNet34\nbackbone, Mask R-CNN) can segment fluorescent nuclear images on most of the\nsample preparation types and tissue origins with satisfactory segmentation\nperformance. Mask R-CNN, an architecture designed to address instance aware\nsegmentation tasks, outperforms other architectures. Equal nuclear mean size,\nconsistent nuclear annotations and the use of artificially generated images\nresult in overall acceptable precision and recall across different tissues and\nsample preparation types.",

However, as far as we know, all of the existing non-additive\nproposals are based on handcrafted policies, and can only be applied to a\nspecific image domain, which heavily prevent non-additive steganography from\nreleasing its full potentiality. In this paper, we propose an automatic\nnon-additive steganographic distortion learning framework called MCTSteg to\nremove the above restrictions. Guided by the reinforcement learning paradigm,\nwe combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and steganalyzer-based environmental\nmodel to build MCTSteg. MCTS makes sequential decisions to adjust distortion\ndistribution without human intervention. Our proposed environmental model is\nused to obtain feedbacks from each decision. Due to its self-learning\ncharacteristic and domain-independent reward function, MCTSteg has become the\nfirst reported universal non-additive steganographic framework which can work\nin both spatial and JPEG domains. Extensive experimental results show that\nMCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted\nfeature-based and deep-learning-based steganalyzers. In both spatial and JPEG\ndomains, the security performance of MCTSteg steadily outperforms the state of\nthe art by a clear margin under different scenarios.",

          "description": "Contrastive learning shows great potential in unpaired image-to-image\ntranslation, but sometimes the translated results are in poor quality and the\ncontents are not preserved consistently. In this paper, we uncover that the\nnegative examples play a critical role in the performance of contrastive\nlearning for image translation. The negative examples in previous methods are\nrandomly sampled from the patches of different positions in the source image,\nwhich are not effective to push the positive examples close to the query\nexamples. To address this issue, we present instance-wise hard Negative Example\nGeneration for Contrastive learning in Unpaired image-to-image\nTranslation~(NEGCUT). Specifically, we train a generator to produce negative\nexamples online. The generator is novel from two perspectives: 1) it is\ninstance-wise which means that the generated examples are based on the input\nimage, and 2) it can generate hard negative examples since it is trained with\nan adversarial loss. With the generator, the performance of unpaired\nimage-to-image translation is significantly improved. Experiments on three\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed NEGCUT framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to previous methods.",

Although many image manipulation location\nalgorithms have been proposed, most of them only focus on the RGB images with\ndifferent color spaces, and the frequency information that contains the\npotential tampering clues is often ignored. In this work, a novel end-to-end\ntwo-stream boundary-aware network (abbreviated as TBNet) is proposed for\ngeneric image manipulation localization in which the RGB stream, the frequency\nstream, and the boundary artifact location are explored in a unified framework.\nSpecifically, we first design an adaptive frequency selection module (AFS) to\nadaptively select the appropriate frequency to mine inconsistent statistics and\neliminate the interference of redundant statistics. Then, an adaptive\ncross-attention fusion module (ACF) is proposed to adaptively fuse the RGB\nfeature and the frequency feature. Finally, the boundary artifact location\nnetwork (BAL) is designed to locate the boundary artifacts for which the\nparameters are jointly updated by the outputs of the ACF, and its results are\nfurther fed into the decoder. Thus, the parameters of the RGB stream, the\nfrequency stream, and the boundary artifact location network are jointly\noptimized, and their latent complementary relationships are fully mined. The\nresults of extensive experiments performed on four public benchmarks of the\nimage manipulation localization task, namely, CASIA1.0, COVER, Carvalho, and\nIn-The-Wild, demonstrate that the proposed TBNet can significantly outperform\nstate-of-the-art generic image manipulation localization methods in terms of\nboth MCC and F1.",

          "description": "Recent vision-language (VL) studies have shown remarkable progress by\nlearning generic representations from massive image-text pairs with transformer\nmodels and then fine-tuning on downstream VL tasks. While existing research has\nbeen focused on achieving high accuracy with large pre-trained models, building\na lightweight model is of great value in practice but is less explored. In this\npaper, we propose a smaller and faster VL model, MiniVLM, which can be\nfinetuned with good performance on various downstream tasks like its larger\ncounterpart. MiniVLM consists of two modules, a vision feature extractor and a\ntransformer-based vision-language fusion module. We design a Two-stage\nEfficient feature Extractor (TEE), inspired by the one-stage EfficientDet\nnetwork, to significantly reduce the time cost of visual feature extraction by\n$95\\%$, compared to a baseline model. We adopt the MiniLM structure to reduce\nthe computation cost of the transformer module after comparing different\ncompact BERT models. In addition, we improve the MiniVLM pre-training by adding\n$7M$ Open Images data, which are pseudo-labeled by a state-of-the-art\ncaptioning model. We also pre-train with high-quality image tags obtained from\na strong tagging model to enhance cross-modality alignment. The large models\nare used offline without adding any overhead in fine-tuning and inference. With\nthe above design choices, our MiniVLM reduces the model size by $73\\%$ and the\ninference time cost by $94\\%$ while being able to retain $94-97\\%$ of the\naccuracy on multiple VL tasks. We hope that MiniVLM helps ease the use of the\nstate-of-the-art VL research for on-the-edge applications.",

C5 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for cross-camera color\nconstancy on several datasets, is fast to evaluate (~7 and ~90 ms per image on\na GPU or CPU, respectively), and requires little memory (~2 MB), and, thus, is\na practical solution to the problem of calibration-free automatic white balance\nfor mobile photography.",

          "description": "Key for solving fine-grained image categorization is finding discriminate and\nlocal regions that correspond to subtle visual traits. Great strides have been\nmade, with complex networks designed specifically to learn part-level\ndiscriminate feature representations. In this paper, we show it is possible to\ncultivate subtle details without the need for overly complicated network\ndesigns or training mechanisms -- a single loss is all it takes. The main trick\nlies with how we delve into individual feature channels early on, as opposed to\nthe convention of starting from a consolidated feature map. The proposed loss\nfunction, termed as mutual-channel loss (MC-Loss), consists of two\nchannel-specific components: a discriminality component and a diversity\ncomponent. The discriminality component forces all feature channels belonging\nto the same class to be discriminative, through a novel channel-wise attention\nmechanism. The diversity component additionally constraints channels so that\nthey become mutually exclusive on spatial-wise. The end result is therefore a\nset of feature channels that each reflects different locally discriminative\nregions for a specific class. The MC-Loss can be trained end-to-end, without\nthe need for any bounding-box/part annotations, and yields highly\ndiscriminative regions during inference. Experimental results show our MC-Loss\nwhen implemented on top of common base networks can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on all four fine-grained categorization datasets (CUB-Birds,\nFGVC-Aircraft, Flowers-102, and Stanford-Cars). Ablative studies further\ndemonstrate the superiority of MC-Loss when compared with other recently\nproposed general-purpose losses for visual classification, on two different\nbase networks.

          "description": "Compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have witnessed exceptional\nimprovements in performance in recent years. However, they still fail to\nprovide the same predictive power as CNNs with a large number of parameters.\nThe diverse and even abundant features captured by the layers is an important\ncharacteristic of these successful CNNs. However, differences in this\ncharacteristic between large CNNs and their compact counterparts have rarely\nbeen investigated. In compact CNNs, due to the limited number of parameters,\nabundant features are unlikely to be obtained, and feature diversity becomes an\nessential characteristic. Diverse features present in the activation maps\nderived from a data point during model inference may indicate the presence of a\nset of unique descriptors necessary to distinguish between objects of different\nclasses. In contrast, data points with low feature diversity may not provide a\nsufficient amount of unique descriptors to make a valid prediction; we refer to\nthem as random predictions. Random predictions can negatively impact the\noptimization process and harm the final performance. This paper proposes\naddressing the problem raised by random predictions by reshaping the standard\ncross-entropy to make it biased toward data points with a limited number of\nunique descriptive features. Our novel Bias Loss focuses the training on a set\nof valuable data points and prevents the vast number of samples with poor\nlearning features from misleading the optimization process. Furthermore, to\nshow the importance of diversity, we present a family of SkipNet models whose\narchitectures are brought to boost the number of unique descriptors in the last\nlayers. Our Skipnet-M can achieve 1% higher classification accuracy than\nMobileNetV3 Large.",

          "description": "Data hiding is the procedure of encoding desired information into an image to\nresist potential noises while ensuring the embedded image has little perceptual\nperturbations from the original image. Recently, with the tremendous successes\ngained by deep neural networks in various fields, data hiding areas have\nattracted increasing number of attentions. The neglect of considering the pixel\nsensitivity within the cover image of deep neural methods will inevitably\naffect the model robustness for information hiding. Targeting at the problem,\nin this paper, we propose a novel deep data hiding scheme with Inverse Gradient\nAttention (IGA), combing the ideas of adversarial learning and attention\nmechanism to endow different sensitivity to different pixels. With the proposed\ncomponent, the model can spotlight pixels with more robustness for embedding\ndata. Empirically, extensive experiments show that the proposed model\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two prevalent datasets under\nmultiple settings.

          "description": "Semantic segmentation is a crucial step in many Earth observation tasks.\nLarge quantity of pixel-level annotation is required to train deep networks for\nsemantic segmentation. Earth observation techniques are applied to varieties of\napplications and since classes vary widely depending on the applications,\ntherefore, domain knowledge is often required to label Earth observation\nimages, impeding availability of labeled training data in many Earth\nobservation applications. To tackle these challenges, in this paper we propose\nan unsupervised semantic segmentation method that can be trained using just a\nsingle unlabeled scene. Remote sensing scenes are generally large. The proposed\nmethod exploits this property to sample smaller patches from the larger scene\nand uses deep clustering and contrastive learning to refine the weights of a\nlightweight deep model composed of a series of the convolution layers along\nwith an embedded channel attention. After unsupervised training on the target\nimage/scene, the model automatically segregates the major classes present in\nthe scene and produces the segmentation map.

These variations make person\nRe-Identification (ReID) a challenging problem. Nevertheless, human attributes\nusually stand as robust visual properties to such variations. In this paper, we\npropose a new method to leverage features from human attributes for person\nReID. Our model uses a tensor to non-linearly fuse identity and attribute\nfeatures, and then forces the parameters of the tensor in the loss function to\ngenerate discriminative fused features for ReID. Since tensor-based methods\nusually contain a large number of parameters, training all of these parameters\nbecomes very slow, and the chance of overfitting increases as well. To address\nthis issue, we propose two new techniques based on Structural Sparsity Learning\n(SSL) and Tensor Decomposition (TD) methods to create an accurate and stable\nlearning problem. We conducted experiments on several standard pedestrian\ndatasets, and experimental results indicate that our tensor-based approach\nsignificantly improves person ReID baselines and also outperforms state of the\nart methods.",

Here, we leverage MLT paradigm in two problem settings. First, it\nis assumed that the structure of the tasks (e.g., grouping pattern of facial\nattributes) is known as a prior knowledge, and parameters of the tasks (i.e.,\npredictors) within the same group are represented by a linear combination of a\nlimited number of underlying basis tasks. Here, a sparsity constraint on the\ncoefficients of this linear combination is also considered such that each task\nis represented in a more structured and simpler manner. Second, it is assumed\nthat the structure of the tasks is unknown, and then structure and parameters\nof the tasks are learned jointly by using a Laplacian regularization framework.\nOur MTL methods are compared with competing methods for facial attribute\nprediction to show its effectiveness.",

          "description": "Anatomical structures such as the hippocampus, liver, and bones can be\nanalyzed as orientable, closed surfaces. This permits the computation of\nvolume, surface area, mean curvature, Gaussian curvature, and the\nEuler-Poincar\\'e characteristic as well as comparison of these morphometrics\nbetween structures of different topology. The structures are commonly\nrepresented implicitly in curve evolution problems as the zero level set of an\nembedding. Practically, binary images of anatomical structures are embedded\nusing a signed distance transform. However, quantization prevents the accurate\ncomputation of curvatures, leading to considerable errors in morphometry. This\npaper presents a fast, simple embedding procedure for accurate local\nmorphometry as the zero crossing of the Gaussian blurred binary image. The\nproposed method was validated based on the femur and fourth lumbar vertebrae of\n50 clinical computed tomography datasets. The results show that the signed\ndistance transform leads to large quantization errors in the computed local\ncurvature. Global validation of morphometry using regression and Bland-Altman\nanalysis revealed that the coefficient of determination for the average mean\ncurvature is improved from 93.8% with the signed distance transform to 100%\nwith the proposed method. For the surface area, the proportional bias is\nimproved from -5.0% for the signed distance transform to +0.6% for the proposed\nmethod. The Euler-Poincar\\'e characteristic is improved from unusable in the\nsigned distance transform to 98% accuracy for the proposed method. The proposed\nmethod enables an improved local and global evaluation of curvature for\npurposes of morphometry on closed, implicit surfaces.",

          "description": "Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous systems which intend to operate\nin the real world. Single task vision networks extract information only based\non some aspects of the scene. In multi-task learning (MTL), on the other hand,\nthese single tasks are jointly learned, thereby providing an opportunity for\ntasks to share information and obtain a more comprehensive understanding. To\nthis end, we develop UniNet, a unified scene understanding network that\naccurately and efficiently infers vital vision tasks including object\ndetection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, monocular depth\nestimation, and monocular instance depth prediction. As these tasks look at\ndifferent semantic and geometric information, they can either complement or\nconflict with each other. Therefore, understanding inter-task relationships can\nprovide useful cues to enable complementary information sharing. We evaluate\nthe task relationships in UniNet through the lens of adversarial attacks based\non the notion that they can exploit learned biases and task interactions in the\nneural network. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset, using\nuntargeted and targeted attacks reveal that semantic tasks strongly interact\namongst themselves, and the same holds for geometric tasks. Additionally, we\nshow that the relationship between semantic and geometric tasks is asymmetric\nand their interaction becomes weaker as we move towards higher-level\nrepresentations.",

          "description": "Multimodal IR, spanning text corpus, knowledge graph and images, called\noutside knowledge visual question answering (OKVQA), is of much recent\ninterest. However, the popular data set has serious limitations. A surprisingly\nlarge fraction of queries do not assess the ability to integrate cross-modal\ninformation. Instead, some are independent of the image, some depend on\nspeculation, some require OCR or are otherwise answerable from the image alone.\nTo add to the above limitations, frequency-based guessing is very effective\nbecause of (unintended) widespread answer overlaps between the train and test\nfolds. Overall, it is hard to determine when state-of-the-art systems exploit\nthese weaknesses rather than really infer the answers, because they are opaque\nand their 'reasoning' process is uninterpretable. An equally important\nlimitation is that the dataset is designed for the quantitative assessment only\nof the end-to-end answer retrieval task, with no provision for assessing the\ncorrect(semantic) interpretation of the input query. In response, we identify a\nkey structural idiom in OKVQA ,viz., S3 (select, substitute and search), and\nbuild a new data set and challenge around it. Specifically, the questioner\nidentifies an entity in the image and asks a question involving that entity\nwhich can be answered only by consulting a knowledge graph or corpus passage\nmentioning the entity. Our challenge consists of (i)OKVQAS3, a subset of OKVQA\nannotated based on the structural idiom and (ii)S3VQA, a new dataset built from\nscratch. We also present a neural but structurally transparent OKVQA system,\nS3, that explicitly addresses our challenge dataset, and outperforms recent\ncompetitive baselines.",

          "description": "In real applications, different computation-resource devices need\ndifferent-depth networks (e.g., ResNet-18/34/50) with high-accuracy. Usually,\nexisting methods either design multiple networks and train them independently,\nor construct depth-level/width-level dynamic neural networks which is hard to\nprove the accuracy of each sub-net. In this article, we propose an elegant\nDepth-Level Dynamic Neural Network (DDNN) integrated different-depth sub-nets\nof similar architectures. To improve the generalization of sub-nets, we design\nthe Embedded-Knowledge-Distillation (EKD) training mechanism for the DDNN to\nimplement knowledge transfer from the teacher (full-net) to multiple students\n(sub-nets). Specifically, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is introduced to\nconstrain the posterior class probability consistency between full-net and\nsub-nets, and self-attention distillation on the same resolution feature of\ndifferent depth is addressed to drive more abundant feature representations of\nsub-nets. Thus, we can obtain multiple high-accuracy sub-nets simultaneously in\na DDNN via the online knowledge distillation in each training iteration without\nextra computation cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet\ndatasets demonstrate that sub-nets in DDNN with EKD training achieve better\nperformance than individually training networks while preserving the original\nperformance of full-nets.",

To address such\nchallenges we introduce UIBert, a transformer-based joint image-text model\ntrained through novel pre-training tasks on large-scale unlabeled UI data to\nlearn generic feature representations for a UI and its components. Our key\nintuition is that the heterogeneous features in a UI are self-aligned, i.e.,\nthe image and text features of UI components, are predictive of each other. We\npropose five pretraining tasks utilizing this self-alignment among different\nfeatures of a UI component and across various components in the same UI. We\nevaluate our method on nine real-world downstream UI tasks where UIBert\noutperforms strong multimodal baselines by up to 9.26% accuracy.",

Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) techniques have\nshown promising results in classifying ultrasound images of the breast into\nbenign or malignant.

In this\nwork, we analyze how adversarial assaults that are practically undetectable may\nbe devised to alter these importance maps dramatically. Furthermore, we will\nshow that this change in the importance maps can come with or without altering\nthe classification result, rendering them even harder to detect. As such, care\nmust be taken when using these importance maps to shed light on the inner\nworkings of deep learning.

Many video editing components are astonishingly hard to automate\nprimarily due to the lack of raw video materials. This paper focuses on a new\ntask for computational video editing, namely the task of raking cut\nplausibility. Our key idea is to leverage content that has already been edited\nto learn fine-grained audiovisual patterns that trigger cuts. To do this, we\nfirst collected a data source of more than 10K videos, from which we extract\nmore than 255K cuts.

          "description": "Data is a crucial component of machine learning. The field is reliant on data\nto train, validate, and test models. With increased technical capabilities,\nmachine learning research has boomed in both academic and industry settings,\nand one major focus has been on computer vision. Computer vision is a popular\ndomain of machine learning increasingly pertinent to real-world applications,\nfrom facial recognition in policing to object detection for autonomous\nvehicles. Given computer vision's propensity to shape machine learning research\nand impact human life, we seek to understand disciplinary practices around\ndataset documentation - how data is collected, curated, annotated, and packaged\ninto datasets for computer vision researchers and practitioners to use for\nmodel tuning and development. Specifically, we examine what dataset\ndocumentation communicates about the underlying values of vision data and the\nlarger practices and goals of computer vision as a field. To conduct this\nstudy, we collected a corpus of about 500 computer vision datasets, from which\nwe sampled 114 dataset publications across different vision tasks. Through both\na structured and thematic content analysis, we document a number of values\naround accepted data practices, what makes desirable data, and the treatment of\nhumans in the dataset construction process. We discuss how computer vision\ndatasets authors value efficiency at the expense of care; universality at the\nexpense of contextuality; impartiality at the expense of positionality; and\nmodel work at the expense of data work. Many of the silenced values we identify\nsit in opposition with social computing practices. We conclude with suggestions\non how to better incorporate silenced values into the dataset creation and\ncuration process.",

In the proposed framework, (1) pretrained cracks identification\nmodels are constructed based on the large sample dataset of concrete cracks;\n(2) refined cracks identification models are further constructed based on the\nsmall sample dataset of soil and rock masses cracks.

          "description": "Predicting the movement trajectories of multiple classes of road users in\nreal-world scenarios is a challenging task due to the diverse trajectory\npatterns. While recent works of pedestrian trajectory prediction successfully\nmodelled the influence of surrounding neighbours based on the relative\ndistances, they are ineffective on multi-class trajectory prediction. This is\nbecause they ignore the impact of the implicit correlations between different\ntypes of road users on the trajectory to be predicted - for example, a nearby\npedestrian has a different level of influence from a nearby car. In this paper,\nwe propose to introduce class information into a graph convolutional neural\nnetwork to better predict the trajectory of an individual. We embed the class\nlabels of the surrounding objects into the label adjacency matrix (LAM), which\nis combined with the velocity-based adjacency matrix (VAM) comprised of the\nobjects' velocity, thereby generating a semantics-guided graph adjacency (SAM).\nSAM effectively models semantic information with trainable parameters to\nautomatically learn the embedded label features that will contribute to the\nfixed velocity-based trajectory. Such information of spatial and temporal\ndependencies is passed to a graph convolutional and temporal convolutional\nnetwork to estimate the predicted trajectory distributions. We further propose\nnew metrics, known as Average2 Displacement Error (aADE) and Average Final\nDisplacement Error (aFDE), that assess network accuracy more accurately. We\ncall our framework Semantics-STGCNN. It consistently shows superior performance\nto the state-of-the-arts in existing and the newly proposed metrics.",

          "description": "Person reidentification (ReID) is a very hot research topic in machine\nlearning and computer vision, and many person ReID approaches have been\nproposed; however, most of these methods assume that the same person has the\nsame clothes within a short time interval, and thus their visual appearance\nmust be similar. However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person\nhas a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they\nalso often take different personal belongings with them. When the existing\nperson ReID methods are applied in this type of case, almost all of them fail.\nTo date, only a few works have focused on the cloth-changing person ReID task,\nbut since it is very difficult to extract generalized and robust features for\nrepresenting people with different clothes, their performances need to be\nimproved. Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve\nthese issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding\nalgorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual\nsemantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and\nthe generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively\nsolve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a\nperson with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme\n(MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth\ndesensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of\nthe approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level\nhuman attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of\npose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially\nsemantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic\ninformation that is used to align the human attributes.",

Directly applying vanilla object detector to defect detection task can\nachieve promising results, while there still exists challenging issues that\nhave not been solved. The first issue is the texture shift which means a\ntrained defect detector model will be easily affected by unseen texture, and\nthe second issue is partial visual confusion which indicates that a partial\ndefect box is visually similar with a complete box. To tackle these two\nproblems, we propose a Reference-based Defect Detection Network (RDDN).\nSpecifically, we introduce template reference and context reference to against\nthose two problems, respectively. Template reference can reduce the texture\nshift from image, feature or region levels, and encourage the detectors to\nfocus more on the defective area as a result. We can use either well-aligned\ntemplate images or the outputs of a pseudo template generator as template\nreferences in this work, and they are jointly trained with detectors by the\nsupervision of normal samples. To solve the partial visual confusion issue, we\npropose to leverage the carried context information of context reference, which\nis the concentric bigger box of each region proposal, to perform more accurate\nregion classification and regression.

          "description": "The performance of many medical image analysis tasks are strongly associated\nwith image data quality. When developing modern deep learning algorithms,\nrather than relying on subjective (human-based) image quality assessment (IQA),\ntask amenability potentially provides an objective measure of task-specific\nimage quality. To predict task amenability, an IQA agent is trained using\nreinforcement learning (RL) with a simultaneously optimised task predictor,\nsuch as a classification or segmentation neural network. In this work, we\ndevelop transfer learning or adaptation strategies to increase the adaptability\nof both the IQA agent and the task predictor so that they are less dependent on\nhigh-quality, expert-labelled training data. The proposed transfer learning\nstrategy re-formulates the original RL problem for task amenability in a\nmeta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework. The resulting algorithm\nfacilitates efficient adaptation of the agent to different definitions of image\nquality, each with its own Markov decision process environment including\ndifferent images, labels and an adaptable task predictor. Our work demonstrates\nthat the IQA agents pre-trained on non-expert task labels can be adapted to\npredict task amenability as defined by expert task labels, using only a small\nset of expert labels. Using 6644 clinical ultrasound images from 249 prostate\ncancer patients, our results for image classification and segmentation tasks\nshow that the proposed IQA method can be adapted using data with as few as\nrespective 19.7% and 29.6% expert-reviewed consensus labels and still achieve\ncomparable IQA and task performance, which would otherwise require a training\ndataset with 100% expert labels.",

          "description": "Style transfer aims to reproduce content images with the styles from\nreference images. Existing universal style transfer methods successfully\ndeliver arbitrary styles to original images either in an artistic or a\nphoto-realistic way. However, the range of 'arbitrary style' defined by\nexisting works is bounded in the particular domain due to their structural\nlimitation. Specifically, the degrees of content preservation and stylization\nare established according to a predefined target domain. As a result, both\nphoto-realistic and artistic models have difficulty in performing the desired\nstyle transfer for the other domain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nunified architecture, Domain-aware Style Transfer Networks (DSTN) that transfer\nnot only the style but also the property of domain (i.e., domainness) from a\ngiven reference image. To this end, we design a novel domainness indicator that\ncaptures the domainness value from the texture and structural features of\nreference images. Moreover, we introduce a unified framework with domain-aware\nskip connection to adaptively transfer the stroke and palette to the input\ncontents guided by the domainness indicator. Our extensive experiments validate\nthat our model produces better qualitative results and outperforms previous\nmethods in terms of proxy metrics on both artistic and photo-realistic\nstylizations.",

          "description": "For the past ten years, CNN has reigned supreme in the world of computer\nvision, but recently, Transformer is on the rise. However, the quadratic\ncomputational cost of self-attention has become a severe problem of practice.\nThere has been much research on architectures without CNN and self-attention in\nthis context. In particular, MLP-Mixer is a simple idea designed using MLPs and\nhit an accuracy comparable to the Vision Transformer. However, the only\ninductive bias in this architecture is the embedding of tokens. Thus, there is\nstill a possibility to build a non-convolutional inductive bias into the\narchitecture itself, and we built in an inductive bias using two simple ideas.\nA way is to divide the token-mixing block vertically and horizontally. Another\nway is to make spatial correlations denser among some channels of token-mixing.\nWith this approach, we were able to improve the accuracy of the MLP-Mixer while\nreducing its parameters and computational complexity. Compared to other\nMLP-based models, the proposed model, named RaftMLP has a good balance of\ncomputational complexity, the number of parameters, and actual memory usage. In\naddition, our work indicates that MLP-based models have the potential to\nreplace CNNs by adopting inductive bias.

We have used eye-tracking to assay the spatial\ndistribution of information hotspots for humans via fixation maps and an\nactivation mapping technique for obtaining analogous distributions for deep\nnetworks through visualization maps. Qualitative comparison between\nvisualization maps and fixation maps reveals an interesting correlate of\ncongruence. The deep learning model considered similar regions in character,\nwhich humans have fixated in the case of correctly classified characters. On\nthe other hand, when the focused regions are different for humans and deep\nnets, the characters are typically misclassified by the latter. Hence, we\npropose to use the visual fixation maps obtained from the eye-tracking\nexperiment as a supervisory input to align the model's focus on relevant\ncharacter regions. We find that such supervision improves the model's\nperformance significantly and does not require any additional parameters.

          "description": "Differentiable Neural Architecture Search is one of the most popular Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS) methods for its search efficiency and simplicity,\naccomplished by jointly optimizing the model weight and architecture parameters\nin a weight-sharing supernet via gradient-based algorithms. At the end of the\nsearch phase, the operations with the largest architecture parameters will be\nselected to form the final architecture, with the implicit assumption that the\nvalues of architecture parameters reflect the operation strength. While much\nhas been discussed about the supernet's optimization, the architecture\nselection process has received little attention. We provide empirical and\ntheoretical analysis to show that the magnitude of architecture parameters does\nnot necessarily indicate how much the operation contributes to the supernet's\nperformance. We propose an alternative perturbation-based architecture\nselection that directly measures each operation's influence on the supernet. We\nre-evaluate several differentiable NAS methods with the proposed architecture\nselection and find that it is able to extract significantly improved\narchitectures from the underlying supernets consistently. Furthermore, we find\nthat several failure modes of DARTS can be greatly alleviated with the proposed\nselection method, indicating that much of the poor generalization observed in\nDARTS can be attributed to the failure of magnitude-based architecture\nselection rather than entirely the optimization of its supernet.",

DR, an eye\nillness caused by diabetes, can lead to blindness if it is not identified and\ntreated in its early stages. Unfortunately, diagnosis of DR requires medically\ntrained professionals, but Bangladesh has limited specialists in comparison to\nits population. Moreover, the screening process is often expensive, prohibiting\nmany from receiving timely and proper diagnosis. To address the problem, we\nintroduce a deep learning algorithm which screens for different stages of DR.\nWe use a state-of-the-art CNN architecture to diagnose patients based on\nretinal fundus imagery. This paper is an experimental evaluation of the\nalgorithm we developed for DR diagnosis and screening specifically for\nBangladeshi patients. We perform this validation study using separate pools of\nretinal image data of real patients from a hospital and field studies in\nBangladesh. Our results show that the algorithm is effective at screening\nBangladeshi eyes even when trained on a public dataset which is out of domain,\nand can accurately determine the stage of DR as well, achieving an overall\naccuracy of 92.27\\% and 93.02\\% on two validation sets of Bangladeshi eyes.

          "description": "This paper proposes a novel approach to map-based navigation system for\nunmanned aircraft. The proposed system attempts label-to-label matching, not\nimage-to-image matching, between aerial images and a map database. By using\nsemantic segmentation, the ground objects are labelled and the configuration of\nthe objects is used to find the corresponding location in the map database. The\nuse of the deep learning technique as a tool for extracting high-level features\nreduces the image-based localization problem to a pattern matching problem.\nThis paper proposes a pattern matching algorithm which does not require\naltitude information or a camera model to estimate the absolute horizontal\nposition. The feasibility analysis with simulated images shows the proposed\nmap-based navigation can be realized with the proposed pattern matching\nalgorithm and it is able to provide positions given the labelled objects.",

          "description": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a type of brain disease which causes visual,\nsensory, and motor problems for people with a detrimental effect on the\nfunctioning of the nervous system. In order to diagnose MS, multiple screening\nmethods have been proposed so far; among them, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nhas received considerable attention among physicians. MRI modalities provide\nphysicians with fundamental information about the structure and function of the\nbrain, which is crucial for the rapid diagnosis of MS lesions. Diagnosing MS\nusing MRI is time-consuming, tedious, and prone to manual errors. Hence,\ncomputer aided diagnosis systems (CADS) based on artificial intelligence (AI)\nmethods have been proposed in recent years for accurate diagnosis of MS using\nMRI neuroimaging modalities. In the AI field, automated MS diagnosis is being\nconducted using (i) conventional machine learning and (ii) deep learning (DL)\ntechniques. The conventional machine learning approach is based on feature\nextraction and selection by trial and error. In DL, these steps are performed\nby the DL model itself. In this paper, a complete review of automated MS\ndiagnosis methods performed using DL techniques with MRI neuroimaging\nmodalities are discussed. Also, each work is thoroughly reviewed and discussed.\nFinally, the most important challenges and future directions in the automated\nMS diagnosis using DL techniques coupled with MRI modalities are presented in\ndetail.",

We address this\nchallenge by enriching both the local and global contexts in the popular\ntwo-stage temporal localization framework, where action proposals are first\ngenerated followed by action classification and temporal boundary regression.\nOur proposed model, dubbed ContextLoc, can be divided into three sub-networks:\nL-Net, G-Net and P-Net.

Previous\nmethods are either subject to single-modal input or perform supervised\nimage-level product retrieval, thus fail to accommodate real-life scenarios\nwhere enormous weakly annotated multi-modal data are present. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a more realistic setting that aims to perform weakly-supervised\nmulti-modal instance-level product retrieval among fine-grained product\ncategories. To promote the study of this challenging task, we contribute\nProduct1M, one of the largest multi-modal cosmetic datasets for real-world\ninstance-level retrieval. Notably, Product1M contains over 1 million\nimage-caption pairs and consists of two sample types, i.e., single-product and\nmulti-product samples, which encompass a wide variety of cosmetics brands. In\naddition to the great diversity, Product1M enjoys several appealing\ncharacteristics including fine-grained categories, complex combinations, and\nfuzzy correspondence that well mimic the real-world scenes. Moreover, we\npropose a novel model named Cross-modal contrAstive Product Transformer for\ninstance-level prodUct REtrieval (CAPTURE), that excels in capturing the\npotential synergy between multi-modal inputs via a hybrid-stream transformer in\na self-supervised manner.CAPTURE generates discriminative instance features via\nmasked multi-modal learning as well as cross-modal contrastive pretraining and\nit outperforms several SOTA cross-modal baselines.

Moreover, we design an intuitive solution under\nthis framework, which is called Point to Point Network (P2PNet). P2PNet\ndiscards superfluous steps and directly predicts a set of point proposals to\nrepresent heads in an image, being consistent with the human annotation\nresults.

          "description": "Significant work has been done towards deep learning (DL) models for\nautomatic lung and lesion segmentation and classification of COVID-19 on chest\nCT data. However, comprehensive visualization systems focused on supporting the\ndual visual+DL diagnosis of COVID-19 are non-existent. We present COVID-view, a\nvisualization application specially tailored for radiologists to diagnose\nCOVID-19 from chest CT data. The system incorporates a complete pipeline of\nautomatic lungs segmentation, localization/ isolation of lung abnormalities,\nfollowed by visualization, visual and DL analysis, and\nmeasurement/quantification tools. Our system combines the traditional 2D\nworkflow of radiologists with newer 2D and 3D visualization techniques with DL\nsupport for a more comprehensive diagnosis. COVID-view incorporates a novel DL\nmodel for classifying the patients into positive/negative COVID-19 cases, which\nacts as a reading aid for the radiologist using COVID-view and provides the\nattention heatmap as an explainable DL for the model output. We designed and\nevaluated COVID-view through suggestions, close feedback and conducting case\nstudies of real-world patient data by expert radiologists who have substantial\nexperience diagnosing chest CT scans for COVID-19, pulmonary embolism, and\nother forms of lung infections. We present requirements and task analysis for\nthe diagnosis of COVID-19 that motivate our design choices and results in a\npractical system which is capable of handling real-world patient cases.",

They contain fruitful information about the shape of data.\nThe use of machine learning algorithms on the space of persistence diagrams\nproves to be challenging as the space lacks an inner product. For that reason,\ntransforming these diagrams in a way that is compatible with machine learning\nis an important topic currently researched in TDA. In this paper, our main\ncontribution consists of three components. First, we develop a general and\nunifying framework of vectorizing diagrams that we call the \\textit{Persistence\nCurves} (PCs), and show that several well-known summaries, such as Persistence\nLandscapes, fall under the PC framework. Second, we propose several new\nsummaries based on PC framework and provide a theoretical foundation for their\nstability analysis. Finally, we apply proposed PCs to two\napplications---texture classification and determining the parameters of a\ndiscrete dynamical system; their performances are competitive with other TDA\nmethods.",

The discrimination capability of the domain classifier w.r.t the\nincreasingly aligned feature distributions deteriorates as training goes on,\nthus cannot effectively further drive the training of feature extractor. In\nthis work, we propose an efficient optimization strategy named Re-enforceable\nAdversarial Domain Adaptation (RADA) which aims to re-energize the domain\ndiscriminator during the training by using dynamic domain labels. Particularly,\nwe relabel the well aligned target domain samples as source domain samples on\nthe fly. Such relabeling makes the less separable distributions more separable,\nand thus leads to a more powerful domain classifier w.r.t. the new data\ndistributions, which in turn further drives feature alignment.

          "description": "The early diagnosis and screening of glaucoma are important for patients to\nreceive treatment in time and maintain eyesight. Nowadays, deep learning (DL)\nbased models have been successfully used for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of\nglaucoma from retina fundus images. However, a DL model pre-trained using a\ndataset from one hospital center may have poor performance on a dataset from\nanother new hospital center and therefore its applications in the real scene\nare limited. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive transfer learning (SATL)\nstrategy to fill the domain gap between multicenter datasets. Specifically, the\nencoder of a DL model that is pre-trained on the source domain is used to\ninitialize the encoder of a reconstruction model. Then, the reconstruction\nmodel is trained using only unlabeled image data from the target domain, which\nmakes the encoder in the model adapt itself to extract useful high-level\nfeatures both for target domain images encoding and glaucoma classification,\nsimultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SATL\nstrategy is effective in the domain adaptation task between one private and two\npublic glaucoma diagnosis datasets, i.e. pri-RFG, REFUGE, and LAG. Moreover,\nthe proposed strategy is completely independent of the source domain data,\nwhich meets the real scene application and the privacy protection policy.",

It is a common paradigm in object detection frameworks\nto perform multi-scale detection. However, each scale is treated equally during\ntraining. In this paper, we carefully study the objective imbalance of\nmulti-scale detector training. We argue that the loss in each scale level is\nneither equally important nor independent. Different from the existing\nsolutions of setting multi-task weights, we dynamically optimize the loss\nweight of each scale level in the training process.

The encoder consists of deep layers\nwith a small number of parameters, while the decoder makes use of spatial\nlocation information to obtain more accurate results. The evaluation took place\non two publicly available datasets demonstrating the improved performance of\nthe proposed pipeline compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. FastHand\noffers high accuracy scores while reaching a speed of 25 frames per second on\nan NVIDIA Jetson TX2 graphics processing unit.",

          "description": "Face recognition networks encode information about sensitive attributes while\nbeing trained for identity classification. Such encoding has two major issues:\n(a) it makes the face representations susceptible to privacy leakage (b) it\nappears to contribute to bias in face recognition. However, existing bias\nmitigation approaches generally require end-to-end training and are unable to\nachieve high verification accuracy. Therefore, we present a descriptor-based\nadversarial de-biasing approach called `Protected Attribute Suppression System\n(PASS)'. PASS can be trained on top of descriptors obtained from any previously\ntrained high-performing network to classify identities and simultaneously\nreduce encoding of sensitive attributes. This eliminates the need for\nend-to-end training. As a component of PASS, we present a novel discriminator\ntraining strategy that discourages a network from encoding protected attribute\ninformation. We show the efficacy of PASS to reduce gender and skintone\ninformation in descriptors from SOTA face recognition networks like Arcface. As\na result, PASS descriptors outperform existing baselines in reducing gender and\nskintone bias on the IJB-C dataset, while maintaining a high verification\naccuracy.",

          "description": "This paper presents a three-tier modality alignment approach to learning\ntext-image joint embedding, coined as JEMA, for cross-modal retrieval of\ncooking recipes and food images. The first tier improves recipe text embedding\nby optimizing the LSTM networks with term extraction and ranking enhanced\nsequence patterns, and optimizes the image embedding by combining the\nResNeXt-101 image encoder with the category embedding using wideResNet-50 with\nword2vec. The second tier modality alignment optimizes the textual-visual joint\nembedding loss function using a double batch-hard triplet loss with soft-margin\noptimization. The third modality alignment incorporates two types of\ncross-modality alignments as the auxiliary loss regularizations to further\nreduce the alignment errors in the joint learning of the two modality-specific\nembedding functions. The category-based cross-modal alignment aims to align the\nimage category with the recipe category as a loss regularization to the joint\nembedding. The cross-modal discriminator-based alignment aims to add the\nvisual-textual embedding distribution alignment to further regularize the joint\nembedding loss. Extensive experiments with the one-million recipes benchmark\ndataset Recipe1M demonstrate that the proposed JEMA approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art cross-modal embedding methods for both image-to-recipe and\nrecipe-to-image retrievals.",

Deep\nlearning-based region of interest segmentation is among the most exciting use\ncases. However, this paradigm is restricted in real-world clinical applications\ndue to poor robustness and generalization. The issue is more sinister with a\nlack of training data. In this paper, we address the challenge from the\nrepresentation learning point of view. We investigate that the collapsed\nrepresentations, as one of the main reasons which caused poor robustness and\ngeneralization, could be avoided through transfer learning. Therefore, we\npropose a novel two-stage framework for robust generalized segmentation. In\nparticular, an unsupervised Tile-wise AutoEncoder (T-AE) pretraining\narchitecture is coined to learn meaningful representation for improving the\ngeneralization and robustness of the downstream tasks. Furthermore, the learned\nknowledge is transferred to the segmentation benchmark. Coupled with an image\nreconstruction network, the representation keeps to be decoded, encouraging the\nmodel to capture more semantic features. Experiments of lung segmentation on\nmulti chest X-ray datasets are conducted. Empirically, the related experimental\nresults demonstrate the superior generalization capability of the proposed\nframework on unseen domains in terms of high performance and robustness to\ncorruption, especially under the scenario of the limited training data.",

          "description": "Unsupervised learning of global features for 3D shape analysis is an\nimportant research challenge because it avoids manual effort for supervised\ninformation collection. In this paper, we propose a view-based deep learning\nmodel called Hierarchical View Predictor (HVP) to learn 3D shape features from\nunordered views in an unsupervised manner. To mine highly discriminative\ninformation from unordered views, HVP performs a novel hierarchical view\nprediction over a view pair, and aggregates the knowledge learned from the\npredictions in all view pairs into a global feature. In a view pair, we pose\nhierarchical view prediction as the task of hierarchically predicting a set of\nimage patches in a current view from its complementary set of patches, and in\naddition, completing the current view and its opposite from any one of the two\nsets of patches. Hierarchical prediction, in patches to patches, patches to\nview and view to view, facilitates HVP to effectively learn the structure of 3D\nshapes from the correlation between patches in the same view and the\ncorrelation between a pair of complementary views. In addition, the employed\nimplicit aggregation over all view pairs enables HVP to learn global features\nfrom unordered views.

          "description": "Anomaly detection is a critical problem in the manufacturing industry. In\nmany applications, images of objects to be analyzed are captured from multiple\nperspectives which can be exploited to improve the robustness of anomaly\ndetection. In this work, we build upon the deep support vector data description\nalgorithm and address multi-perspective anomaly detection using three different\nfusion techniques, i.e., early fusion, late fusion, and late fusion with\nmultiple decoders. We employ different augmentation techniques with a denoising\nprocess to deal with scarce one-class data, which further improves the\nperformance (ROC AUC $= 80\\%$). Furthermore, we introduce the dices dataset,\nwhich consists of over 2000 grayscale images of falling dices from multiple\nperspectives, with 5\\% of the images containing rare anomalies (e.g., drill\nholes, sawing, or scratches). We evaluate our approach on the new dices dataset\nusing images from two different perspectives and also benchmark on the standard\nMNIST dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed\n{multi-perspective} approach exceeds the state-of-the-art {single-perspective\nanomaly detection on both the MNIST and dices datasets}. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work that focuses on addressing multi-perspective\nanomaly detection in images by jointly using different perspectives together\nwith one single objective function for anomaly detection.",

          "description": "In this paper, we study the task of hallucinating an authentic\nhigh-resolution (HR) face from an occluded thumbnail. We propose a multi-stage\nProgressive Upsampling and Inpainting Generative Adversarial Network, dubbed\nPro-UIGAN, which exploits facial geometry priors to replenish and upsample (8*)\nthe occluded and tiny faces (16*16 pixels). Pro-UIGAN iteratively (1) estimates\nfacial geometry priors for low-resolution (LR) faces and (2) acquires\nnon-occluded HR face images under the guidance of the estimated priors. Our\nmulti-stage hallucination network super-resolves and inpaints occluded LR faces\nin a coarse-to-fine manner, thus reducing unwanted blurriness and artifacts\nsignificantly. Specifically, we design a novel cross-modal transformer module\nfor facial priors estimation, in which an input face and its landmark features\nare formulated as queries and keys, respectively. Such a design encourages\njoint feature learning across the input facial and landmark features, and deep\nfeature correspondences will be discovered by attention. Thus, facial\nappearance features and facial geometry priors are learned in a mutual\npromotion manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Pro-UIGAN achieves\nvisually pleasing HR faces, reaching superior performance in downstream tasks,\ni.e., face alignment, face parsing, face recognition and expression\nclassification, compared with other state-of-the-art (SotA) methods.",

          "description": "We introduce the first Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to find a\nbetter transformer architecture for image recognition. Recently, transformers\nwithout CNN-based backbones are found to achieve impressive performance for\nimage recognition. However, the transformer is designed for NLP tasks and thus\ncould be sub-optimal when directly used for image recognition. In order to\nimprove the visual representation ability for transformers, we propose a new\nsearch space and searching algorithm. Specifically, we introduce a locality\nmodule that models the local correlations in images explicitly with fewer\ncomputational cost. With the locality module, our search space is defined to\nlet the search algorithm freely trade off between global and local information\nas well as optimizing the low-level design choice in each module. To tackle the\nproblem caused by huge search space, a hierarchical neural architecture search\nmethod is proposed to search the optimal vision transformer from two levels\nseparately with the evolutionary algorithm. Extensive experiments on the\nImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method can find more discriminative and\nefficient transformer variants than the ResNet family (e.g., ResNet101) and the\nbaseline ViT for image classification.",

          "description": "Visual understanding requires comprehending complex visual relations between\nobjects within a scene. Here, we seek to characterize the computational demands\nfor abstract visual reasoning. We do this by systematically assessing the\nability of modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn to solve\nthe Synthetic Visual Reasoning Test (SVRT) challenge, a collection of\ntwenty-three visual reasoning problems. Our analysis leads to a novel taxonomy\nof visual reasoning tasks, which can be primarily explained by both the type of\nrelations (same-different vs. spatial-relation judgments) and the number of\nrelations used to compose the underlying rules. Prior cognitive neuroscience\nwork suggests that attention plays a key role in human's visual reasoning\nability. To test this, we extended the CNNs with spatial and feature-based\nattention mechanisms. In a second series of experiments, we evaluated the\nability of these attention networks to learn to solve the SVRT challenge and\nfound the resulting architectures to be much more efficient at solving the\nhardest of these visual reasoning tasks. Most importantly, the corresponding\nimprovements on individual tasks partially explained the taxonomy.

          "description": "Fast arbitrary neural style transfer has attracted widespread attention from\nacademic, industrial and art communities due to its flexibility in enabling\nvarious applications. Existing solutions either attentively fuse deep style\nfeature into deep content feature without considering feature distributions, or\nadaptively normalize deep content feature according to the style such that\ntheir global statistics are matched. Although effective, leaving shallow\nfeature unexplored and without locally considering feature statistics, they are\nprone to unnatural output with unpleasing local distortions. To alleviate this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a novel attention and normalization module,\nnamed Adaptive Attention Normalization (AdaAttN), to adaptively perform\nattentive normalization on per-point basis. Specifically, spatial attention\nscore is learnt from both shallow and deep features of content and style\nimages. Then per-point weighted statistics are calculated by regarding a style\nfeature point as a distribution of attention-weighted output of all style\nfeature points. Finally, the content feature is normalized so that they\ndemonstrate the same local feature statistics as the calculated per-point\nweighted style feature statistics. Besides, a novel local feature loss is\nderived based on AdaAttN to enhance local visual quality. We also extend\nAdaAttN to be ready for video style transfer with slight modifications.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art arbitrary\nimage/video style transfer.

          "description": "We propose the ViNet architecture for audio-visual saliency prediction. ViNet\nis a fully convolutional encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder uses visual\nfeatures from a network trained for action recognition, and the decoder infers\na saliency map via trilinear interpolation and 3D convolutions, combining\nfeatures from multiple hierarchies. The overall architecture of ViNet is\nconceptually simple; it is causal and runs in real-time (60 fps). ViNet does\nnot use audio as input and still outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-visual\nsaliency prediction models on nine different datasets (three visual-only and\nsix audio-visual datasets). ViNet also surpasses human performance on the CC,\nSIM and AUC metrics for the AVE dataset, and to our knowledge, it is the first\nnetwork to do so. We also explore a variation of ViNet architecture by\naugmenting audio features into the decoder. To our surprise, upon sufficient\ntraining, the network becomes agnostic to the input audio and provides the same\noutput irrespective of the input. Interestingly, we also observe similar\nbehaviour in the previous state-of-the-art models \\cite{tsiami2020stavis} for\naudio-visual saliency prediction. Our findings contrast with previous works on\ndeep learning-based audio-visual saliency prediction, suggesting a clear avenue\nfor future explorations incorporating audio in a more effective manner.

To ad- dress this, we propose an incremental learning strategy\nthat can fast adapt deep segmentation models without catastrophic forgetting,\nusing a streaming input data with pixel annotations on the novel classes only.\nTo this end, we develop a uni ed learning strategy based on the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) framework, which integrates an iterative\nrelabeling strategy that lls in the missing labels and a rehearsal-based\nincremental learning step that balances the stability-plasticity of the model.\nMoreover, our EM algorithm adopts an adaptive sampling method to select\ninformative train- ing data and a class-balancing training strategy in the\nincremental model updates, both improving the e cacy of model learning.

          "description": "Automated and accurate segmentation of the infected regions in computed\ntomography (CT) images is critical for the prediction of the pathological stage\nand treatment response of COVID-19. Several deep convolutional neural networks\n(DCNNs) have been designed for this task, whose performance, however, tends to\nbe suppressed by their limited local receptive fields and insufficient global\nreasoning ability. In this paper, we propose a pixel-wise sparse graph\nreasoning (PSGR) module and insert it into a segmentation network to enhance\nthe modeling of long-range dependencies for COVID-19 infected region\nsegmentation in CT images. In the PSGR module, a graph is first constructed by\nprojecting each pixel on a node based on the features produced by the\nsegmentation backbone, and then converted into a sparsely-connected graph by\nkeeping only K strongest connections to each uncertain pixel. The long-range\ninformation reasoning is performed on the sparsely-connected graph to generate\nenhanced features. The advantages of this module are two-fold: (1) the\npixel-wise mapping strategy not only avoids imprecise pixel-to-node projections\nbut also preserves the inherent information of each pixel for global reasoning;\nand (2) the sparsely-connected graph construction results in effective\ninformation retrieval and reduction of the noise propagation. The proposed\nsolution has been evaluated against four widely-used segmentation models on\nthree public datasets.

Then, the\ndistances between the extracted vessel and non-water obstacle blobs are\ncomputed using a novel GSD estimation algorithm. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis work is the first attempt to detect and estimate distances to unknown\nobjects from long-range visual data captured with conventional RGB cameras and\nauxiliary absolute positioning systems (e.g. GPS). The simulation results\nillustrate the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed method for visually aided\nnavigation of vessels assisted by UAV.",

          "description": "Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws\nincreasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem\nby trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead\nof the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting\nmight make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely\nimbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a\nnovel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP),\nwhich always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all\nintervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably\nintroduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose\nanother criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects\nthe best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during\ninference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly\nnegligible. As far as we are aware, this work is the first to delve into such a\nclassification task and ends up with a promising solution for count interval\npartition. Following the above two theoretically demonstrated criterions, we\npropose a simple yet effective model termed Uniform Error Partition Network\n(UEPNet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging\ndatasets.

MRE can\nenhance the semantic representation and improve the model's perception of the\nimage context, which enables the model to locate the salient object accurately.\nSecondly, in order to reduce the reuse of redundant information in the complex\ntop-down fusion method and weaken the differences between semantic features, a\nrelatively simple but effective parallel fusion strategy (PFS) is proposed.

This is the first time to\nemploy automated machine learning for deepfake detection. Based on our explored\nsearch space, our proposed method achieves competitive prediction accuracy\ncompared to previous methods. To improve the generalizability of our method,\nespecially when training data and testing data are manipulated by different\nmethods, we propose a simple yet effective strategy in our network learning\nprocess: making it to estimate potential manipulation regions besides\npredicting the real/fake labels. Unlike previous works manually design neural\nnetworks, our method can relieve us from the high labor cost in network\nconstruction. More than that, compared to previous works, our method depends\nmuch less on prior knowledge, e.g., which manipulation method is utilized or\nwhere exactly the fake image is manipulated.

The spatial variation of the point spread function (PSF) of a\nlight-sheet microscope is determined by the interaction between the excitation\nsheet and the detection objective PSF. First, we introduce a model of the image\nformation process that incorporates this interaction, therefore capturing the\nmain characteristics of this imaging modality. Then, we formulate a variational\nmodel that accounts for the combination of Poisson and Gaussian noise through a\ndata fidelity term consisting of the infimal convolution of the single noise\nfidelities, first introduced in L. Calatroni et al. \"Infimal convolution of\ndata discrepancies for mixed noise removal\", SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences\n10.3 (2017), 1196-1233.

The inverse\nproblem is solved by applying the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm\nin a novel way.

          "description": "Most existing trackers based on deep learning perform tracking in a holistic\nstrategy, which aims to learn deep representations of the whole target for\nlocalizing the target. It is arduous for such methods to track targets with\nvarious appearance variations. To address this limitation, another type of\nmethods adopts a part-based tracking strategy which divides the target into\nequal patches and tracks all these patches in parallel. The target state is\ninferred by summarizing the tracking results of these patches. A potential\nlimitation of such trackers is that not all patches are equally informative for\ntracking. Some patches that are not discriminative may have adverse effects. In\nthis paper, we propose to track the salient local parts of the target that are\ndiscriminative for tracking. In particular, we propose a fine-grained saliency\nmining module to capture the local saliencies. Further, we design a\nsaliency-association modeling module to associate the captured saliencies\ntogether to learn effective correlation representations between the exemplar\nand the search image for state estimation.

However, action detection requires not\nonly categorizing actions, but also localizing them in untrimmed videos.\nTherefore, transferring knowledge pertaining to temporal relations is critical\nfor this task which is missing in the previous cross-modal KD frameworks. To\nthis end, we aim at learning an augmented RGB representation for action\ndetection, taking advantage of additional modalities at training time through\nKD. We propose a KD framework consisting of two levels of distillation. On one\nhand, atomic-level distillation encourages the RGB student to learn the\nsub-representation of the actions from the teacher in a contrastive manner. On\nthe other hand, sequence-level distillation encourages the student to learn the\ntemporal knowledge from the teacher, which consists of transferring the Global\nContextual Relations and the Action Boundary Saliency. The result is an\nAugmented-RGB stream that can achieve competitive performance as the two-stream\nnetwork while using only RGB at inference time.

          "description": "Learning to generate 3D point clouds without 3D supervision is an important\nbut challenging problem. Current solutions leverage various differentiable\nrenderers to project the generated 3D point clouds onto a 2D image plane, and\ntrain deep neural networks using the per-pixel difference with 2D ground truth\nimages. However, these solutions are still struggling to fully recover fine\nstructures of 3D shapes, such as thin tubes or planes. To resolve this issue,\nwe propose an unsupervised approach for 3D point cloud generation with fine\nstructures. Specifically, we cast 3D point cloud learning as a 2D projection\nmatching problem. Rather than using entire 2D silhouette images as a regular\npixel supervision, we introduce structure adaptive sampling to randomly sample\n2D points within the silhouettes as an irregular point supervision, which\nalleviates the consistency issue of sampling from different view angles. Our\nmethod pushes the neural network to generate a 3D point cloud whose 2D\nprojections match the irregular point supervision from different view angles.\nOur 2D projection matching approach enables the neural network to learn more\naccurate structure information than using the per-pixel difference, especially\nfor fine and thin 3D structures. Our method can recover fine 3D structures from\n2D silhouette images at different resolutions, and is robust to different\nsampling methods and point number in irregular point supervision.

          "description": "We present a geometric framework for aligning white matter fiber tracts. By\nregistering fiber tracts between brains, one expects to see overlap of\nanatomical structures that often provide meaningful comparisons across\nsubjects. However, the geometry of white matter tracts is highly heterogeneous,\nand finding direct tract-correspondence across multiple individuals remains a\nchallenging problem. We present a novel deformation metric between tracts that\nallows one to compare tracts while simultaneously obtaining a registration. To\naccomplish this, fiber tracts are represented by an intrinsic mean along with\nthe deformation fields represented by tangent vectors from the mean. In this\nsetting, one can determine a parallel transport between tracts and then\nregister corresponding tangent vectors. We present the results of bundle\nalignment on a population of 43 healthy adult subjects.",

          "description": "Rain removal plays an important role in the restoration of degraded images.\nRecently, data-driven methods have achieved remarkable success. However, these\napproaches neglect that the appearance of rain is often accompanied by low\nlight conditions, which will further degrade the image quality. Therefore, it\nis very indispensable to jointly remove the rain and enhance the light for\nreal-world rain image restoration. In this paper, we aim to address this\nproblem from two aspects. First, we proposed a novel entangled network, namely\nEMNet, which can remove the rain and enhance illumination in one go.\nSpecifically, two encoder-decoder networks interact complementary information\nthrough entanglement structure, and parallel rain removal and illumination\nenhancement. Considering that the encoder-decoder structure is unreliable in\npreserving spatial details, we employ a detail recovery network to restore the\ndesired fine texture. Second, we present a new synthetic dataset, namely\nDarkRain, to boost the development of rain image restoration algorithms in\npractical scenarios. DarkRain not only contains different degrees of rain, but\nalso considers different lighting conditions, and more realistically simulates\nthe rainfall in the real world. EMNet is extensively evaluated on the proposed\nbenchmark and achieves state-of-the-art results. In addition, after a simple\ntransformation, our method outshines existing methods in both rain removal and\nlow-light image enhancement. The source code and dataset will be made publicly\navailable later.",

          "description": "Multi-View Stereo (MVS) is a core task in 3D computer vision. With the surge\nof novel deep learning methods, learned MVS has surpassed the accuracy of\nclassical approaches, but still relies on building a memory intensive dense\ncost volume. Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is a parallel line of research and has\nrecently seen an increase in popularity with Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)\nmodels, which optimize a per scene radiance field. However, NeRF methods do not\ngeneralize to novel scenes and are slow to train and test. We propose to bridge\nthe gap between these two methodologies with a novel network that can recover\n3D scene geometry as a distance function, together with high-resolution color\nimages. Our method uses only a sparse set of images as input and can generalize\nwell to novel scenes. Additionally, we propose a coarse-to-fine sphere tracing\napproach in order to significantly increase speed. We show on various datasets\nthat our method reaches comparable accuracy to per-scene optimized methods\nwhile being able to generalize and running significantly faster.",

          "description": "Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) has become an important technique in exploiting\nhyperspectral data since it decomposes a mixed pixel into a collection of\nendmembers weighted by fractional abundances. The endmembers of a hyperspectral\nimage (HSI) are more likely to be generated by independent sources and be mixed\nin a macroscopic degree before arriving at the sensor element of the imaging\nspectrometer as mixed spectra. Over the past few decades, many attempts have\nfocused on imposing auxiliary constraints on the conventional nonnegative\nmatrix factorization (NMF) framework in order to effectively unmix these mixed\nspectra. As a promising step toward finding an optimum constraint to extract\nendmembers, this paper presents a novel blind HU algorithm, referred to as\nKurtosis-based Smooth Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (KbSNMF) which\nincorporates a novel constraint based on the statistical independence of the\nprobability density functions of endmember spectra. Imposing this constraint on\nthe conventional NMF framework promotes the extraction of independent\nendmembers while further enhancing the parts-based representation of data.\nExperiments conducted on diverse synthetic HSI datasets (with numerous numbers\nof endmembers, spectral bands, pixels, and noise levels) and three standard\nreal HSI datasets demonstrate the validity of the proposed KbSNMF algorithm\ncompared to several state-of-the-art NMF-based HU baselines. The proposed\nalgorithm exhibits superior performance especially in terms of extracting\nendmember spectra from hyperspectral data; therefore, it could uplift the\nperformance of recent deep learning HU methods which utilize the endmember\nspectra as supervisory input data for abundance extraction.",

Our method benefits from\n1) a bifold encoding approach where different data modalities are processed\nindependently allowing them to develop their own representations, and jointly\nto produce a representation for all modalities using shared parameters; 2) a\nnovel interaction modeling technique that relies on categorical semantic\nparsing of the scenes to capture interactions between target pedestrians and\ntheir surroundings; and 3) a bifold prediction mechanism that uses both\nindependent and shared decoding of multimodal representations. Using public\npedestrian behavior benchmark datasets for driving, PIE and JAAD, we highlight\nthe benefits of the proposed method for behavior prediction and show that our\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves trajectory and action\nprediction by up to 22% and 9% respectively.

          "description": "The issue of COVID-19, increasing with a massive mortality rate. This led to\nthe WHO declaring it as a pandemic. In this situation, it is crucial to perform\nefficient and fast diagnosis. The reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction\n(RTPCR) test is conducted to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2. This test is\ntime-consuming and instead chest CT (or Chest X-ray) can be used for a fast and\naccurate diagnosis. Automated diagnosis is considered to be important as it\nreduces human effort and provides accurate and low-cost tests. The\ncontributions of our research are three-fold. First, it is aimed to analyse the\nbehaviour and performance of variant vision models ranging from Inception to\nNAS networks with the appropriate fine-tuning procedure. Second, the behaviour\nof these models is visually analysed by plotting CAMs for individual networks\nand determining classification performance with AUCROC curves. Thirdly, stacked\nensembles techniques are imparted to provide higher generalisation on combining\nthe fine-tuned models, in which six ensemble neural networks are designed by\ncombining the existing fine-tuned networks. Implying these stacked ensembles\nprovides a great generalization to the models. The ensemble model designed by\ncombining all the fine-tuned networks obtained a state-of-the-art accuracy\nscore of 99.17%. The precision and recall for the COVID-19 class are 99.99% and\n89.79% respectively, which resembles the robustness of the stacked ensembles.",

Lightweight CNNs can achieve comparable accuracy to standard\nCNNs with fewer parameters; however, the number of weights still scales\nquadratically with the CNN's width. Our MGIC architectures replace each CNN\nblock with an MGIC counterpart that utilizes a hierarchy of nested grouped\nconvolutions of small group size to address this.\n\nHence, our proposed architectures scale linearly with respect to the\nnetwork's width while retaining full coupling of the channels as in standard\nCNNs.\n\nOur extensive experiments on image classification, segmentation, and point\ncloud classification show that applying this strategy to different\narchitectures like ResNet and MobileNetV3 reduces the number of parameters\nwhile obtaining similar or better accuracy.",

          "description": "Current image transformation and recoloring algorithms try to introduce\nartistic effects in the photographed images, based on user input of target\nimage(s) or selection of pre-designed filters. These manipulations, although\nintended to enhance the impact of an image on the viewer, do not include the\noption of image transformation by specifying the affect information. In this\npaper we present an automatic image-transformation method that transforms the\nsource image such that it can induce an emotional affect on the viewer, as\ndesired by the user. Our proposed novel image emotion transfer algorithm does\nnot require a user-specified target image. The proposed algorithm uses features\nextracted from top layers of deep convolutional neural network and the\nuser-specified emotion distribution to select multiple target images from an\nimage database for color transformation, such that the resultant image has\ndesired emotional impact. Our method can handle more diverse set of photographs\nthan the previous methods. We conducted a detailed user study showing the\neffectiveness of our proposed method. A discussion and reasoning of failure\ncases has also been provided, indicating inherent limitation of color-transfer\nbased methods in the use of emotion assignment.\n\nProject Page: this http URL",

          "description": "A key factor for assessing the state of the heart after myocardial infarction\n(MI) is to measure whether the myocardium segment is viable after reperfusion\nor revascularization therapy. Delayed enhancement-MRI or DE-MRI, which is\nperformed several minutes after injection of the contrast agent, provides high\ncontrast between viable and nonviable myocardium and is therefore a method of\nchoice to evaluate the extent of MI. To automatically assess myocardial status,\nthe results of the EMIDEC challenge that focused on this task are presented in\nthis paper. The challenge's main objectives were twofold. First, to evaluate if\ndeep learning methods can distinguish between normal and pathological cases.\nSecond, to automatically calculate the extent of myocardial infarction. The\npublicly available database consists of 150 exams divided into 50 cases with\nnormal MRI after injection of a contrast agent and 100 cases with myocardial\ninfarction (and then with a hyperenhanced area on DE-MRI), whatever their\ninclusion in the cardiac emergency department. Along with MRI, clinical\ncharacteristics are also provided. The obtained results issued from several\nworks show that the automatic classification of an exam is a reachable task\n(the best method providing an accuracy of 0.92), and the automatic segmentation\nof the myocardium is possible. However, the segmentation of the diseased area\nneeds to be improved, mainly due to the small size of these areas and the lack\nof contrast with the surrounding structures.",

          "description": "COVID-19 has caused many deaths worldwide. The automation of the diagnosis of\nthis virus is highly desired. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown\noutstanding classification performance on image datasets. To date, it appears\nthat COVID computer-aided diagnosis systems based on CNNs and clinical\ninformation have not yet been analysed or explored. We propose a novel method,\nnamed the CNN-AE, to predict the survival chance of COVID-19 patients using a\nCNN trained with clinical information. Notably, the required resources to\nprepare CT images are expensive and limited compared to those required to\ncollect clinical data, such as blood pressure, liver disease, etc. We evaluated\nour method using a publicly available clinical dataset that we collected. The\ndataset properties were carefully analysed to extract important features and\ncompute the correlations of features. A data augmentation procedure based on\nautoencoders (AEs) was proposed to balance the dataset. The experimental\nresults revealed that the average accuracy of the CNN-AE (96.05%) was higher\nthan that of the CNN (92.49%). To demonstrate the generality of our\naugmentation method, we trained some existing mortality risk prediction methods\non our dataset (with and without data augmentation) and compared their\nperformances. We also evaluated our method using another dataset for further\ngenerality verification. To show that clinical data can be used for COVID-19\nsurvival chance prediction, the CNN-AE was compared with multiple pre-trained\ndeep models that were tuned based on CT images.",

          "description": "While recent studies on semi-supervised learning have shown remarkable\nprogress in leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, most of them presume a\nbasic setting of the model is randomly initialized. In this work, we consider\nsemi-supervised learning and transfer learning jointly, leading to a more\npractical and competitive paradigm that can utilize both powerful pre-trained\nmodels from source domain as well as labeled/unlabeled data in the target\ndomain. To better exploit the value of both pre-trained weights and unlabeled\ntarget examples, we introduce adaptive consistency regularization that consists\nof two complementary components: Adaptive Knowledge Consistency (AKC) on the\nexamples between the source and target model, and Adaptive Representation\nConsistency (ARC) on the target model between labeled and unlabeled examples.\nExamples involved in the consistency regularization are adaptively selected\naccording to their potential contributions to the target task. We conduct\nextensive experiments on popular benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and\nMURA, by fine-tuning the ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-50 model. Results show\nthat our proposed adaptive consistency regularization outperforms\nstate-of-the-art semi-supervised learning techniques such as Pseudo Label, Mean\nTeacher, and FixMatch. Moreover, our algorithm is orthogonal to existing\nmethods and thus able to gain additional improvements on top of MixMatch and\nFixMatch.

In point cloud processing,\ndifferent representations have their own pros and cons. Thus, finding suitable\nways to represent point cloud data structure while keeping its own internal\nphysical property such as permutation and scale-invariant is a fundamental\nproblem. Therefore, we propose our work, DRINet, which serves as the basic\nnetwork structure for dual-representation learning with great flexibility at\nfeature transferring and less computation cost, especially for large-scale\npoint clouds. DRINet mainly consists of two modules called Sparse Point-Voxel\nFeature Extraction and Sparse Voxel-Point Feature Extraction. By utilizing\nthese two modules iteratively, features can be propagated between two different\nrepresentations. We further propose a novel multi-scale pooling layer for\npointwise locality learning to improve context information propagation. Our\nnetwork achieves state-of-the-art results for point cloud classification and\nsegmentation tasks on several datasets while maintaining high runtime\nefficiency. For large-scale outdoor scenarios, our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods with a real-time inference speed of 62ms per frame.",

Recently, several works have considered a\nback-projection (BP) based fidelity term as an alternative to the common least\nsquares (LS), and demonstrated excellent results for popular inverse problems.\nThese works have also empirically shown that using the BP term, rather than the\nLS term, requires fewer iterations of optimization algorithms. In this paper,\nwe examine the convergence rate of the projected gradient descent (PGD)\nalgorithm for the BP objective. Our analysis allows to identify an inherent\nsource for its faster convergence compared to using the LS objective, while\nmaking only mild assumptions. We also analyze the more general proximal\ngradient method under a relaxed contraction condition on the proximal mapping\nof the prior. This analysis further highlights the advantage of BP when the\nlinear measurement operator is badly conditioned.

          "description": "With the success of deep neural networks, knowledge distillation which guides\nthe learning of a small student network from a large teacher network is being\nactively studied for model compression and transfer learning. However, few\nstudies have been performed to resolve the poor learning issue of the student\nnetwork when the student and teacher model sizes significantly differ. In this\npaper, we propose a densely guided knowledge distillation using multiple\nteacher assistants that gradually decreases the model size to efficiently\nbridge the large gap between the teacher and student networks. To stimulate\nmore efficient learning of the student network, we guide each teacher assistant\nto every other smaller teacher assistants iteratively. Specifically, when\nteaching a smaller teacher assistant at the next step, the existing larger\nteacher assistants from the previous step are used as well as the teacher\nnetwork. Moreover, we design stochastic teaching where, for each mini-batch, a\nteacher or teacher assistants are randomly dropped. This acts as a regularizer\nto improve the efficiency of teaching of the student network. Thus, the student\ncan always learn salient distilled knowledge from the multiple sources. We\nverified the effectiveness of the proposed method for a classification task\nusing CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.

Remarkably, the most\ncritical scenarios aremuch less frequent and more complex than the\nuncriticalones. Therefore, uncritical cases dominate the prediction. In this\npaper, we address specifically the challenging scenarios at the long tail of\nthe dataset distribution. Our analysis shows that the common losses tend to\nplace challenging cases suboptimally in the embedding space. As a consequence,\nwe propose to supplement the usual loss with aloss that places challenging\ncases closer to each other.

To overcome the problem mentioned above,\nwe propose a deep learning pipeline for the temporal analysis of the visual\nchanges induced in the plant due to stress and apply it for the specific case\nof water stress identification in Chickpea plant shoot images. For this, we\nhave considered an image dataset of two chickpea varieties JG-62 and Pusa-372,\nunder three water stress conditions; control, young seedling, and before\nflowering, captured over five months. We have employed a variant of the\nLong-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) to learn spatio-temporal\npatterns from the chickpea plant dataset and use them for water stress\nclassification.

Furthermore, our\nLRCN model has demonstrated robustness to noisy input, with a less than 2.5%\ndip in average model accuracy and a small standard deviation about the mean for\nboth species.

          "description": "Deep learning based visual trackers entail offline pre-training on large\nvolumes of video datasets with accurate bounding box annotations that are\nlabor-expensive to achieve. We present a new framework to facilitate bounding\nbox annotations for video sequences, which investigates a\nselection-and-refinement strategy to automatically improve the preliminary\nannotations generated by tracking algorithms. A temporal assessment network\n(T-Assess Net) is proposed which is able to capture the temporal coherence of\ntarget locations and select reliable tracking results by measuring their\nquality. Meanwhile, a visual-geometry refinement network (VG-Refine Net) is\nalso designed to further enhance the selected tracking results by considering\nboth target appearance and temporal geometry constraints, allowing inaccurate\ntracking results to be corrected. The combination of the above two networks\nprovides a principled approach to ensure the quality of automatic video\nannotation. Experiments on large scale tracking benchmarks demonstrate that our\nmethod can deliver highly accurate bounding box annotations and significantly\nreduce human labor by 94.0%, yielding an effective means to further boost\ntracking performance with augmented training data.",

To tackle this\nchallenging problem, we introduce TransForensics, a novel image forgery\nlocalization method inspired by Transformers. The two major components in our\nframework are dense self-attention encoders and dense correction modules. The\nformer is to model global context and all pairwise interactions between local\npatches at different scales, while the latter is used for improving the\ntransparency of the hidden layers and correcting the outputs from different\nbranches. Compared to previous traditional and deep learning methods,\nTransForensics not only can capture discriminative representations and obtain\nhigh-quality mask predictions but is also not limited by tampering types and\npatch sequence orders.

          "description": "Close your eyes and listen to music, one can easily imagine an actor dancing\nrhythmically along with the music. These dance movements are usually made up of\ndance movements you have seen before. In this paper, we propose to reproduce\nsuch an inherent capability of the human-being within a computer vision system.\nThe proposed system consists of three modules. To explore the relationship\nbetween music and dance movements, we propose a cross-modal alignment module\nthat focuses on dancing video clips, accompanied on pre-designed music, to\nlearn a system that can judge the consistency between the visual features of\npose sequences and the acoustic features of music. The learned model is then\nused in the imagination module to select a pose sequence for the given music.\nSuch pose sequence selected from the music, however, is usually discontinuous.\nTo solve this problem, in the spatial-temporal alignment module we develop a\nspatial alignment algorithm based on the tendency and periodicity of dance\nmovements to predict dance movements between discontinuous fragments. In\naddition, the selected pose sequence is often misaligned with the music beat.\nTo solve this problem, we further develop a temporal alignment algorithm to\nalign the rhythm of music and dance. Finally, the processed pose sequence is\nused to synthesize realistic dancing videos in the imagination module. The\ngenerated dancing videos match the content and rhythm of the music.\nExperimental results and subjective evaluations show that the proposed approach\ncan perform the function of generating promising dancing videos by inputting\nmusic.",

However, CAM\nmerely discovers seeds from a small number of regions, which may be\ninsufficient to serve as pseudo masks for semantic segmentation. In this paper,\nwe formulate the expansion of object regions in CAM as an increase in\ninformation. From the perspective of information theory, we propose a novel\nComplementary Patch (CP) Representation and prove that the information of the\nsum of the CAMs by a pair of input images with complementary hidden (patched)\nparts, namely CP Pair, is greater than or equal to the information of the\nbaseline CAM. Therefore, a CAM with more information related to object seeds\ncan be obtained by narrowing down the gap between the sum of CAMs generated by\nthe CP Pair and the original CAM. We propose a CP Network (CPN) implemented by\na triplet network and three regularization functions. To further improve the\nquality of the CAMs, we propose a Pixel-Region Correlation Module (PRCM) to\naugment the contextual information by using object-region relations between the\nfeature maps and the CAMs. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nshow that our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art in WSSS,\nvalidating the effectiveness of our CP Representation and CPN.",

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework to accurately identify the seen categories in target domain,\nand effectively recover the semantic attributes for unseen categories.\nSpecifically, structure preserving partial alignment is developed to recognize\nthe seen categories through domain-invariant feature learning.

In this paper, we formulate a new adversarial attack against\ndeep ranking systems, i.e., the Order Attack, which covertly alters the\nrelative order among a selected set of candidates according to an\nattacker-specified permutation, with limited interference to other unrelated\ncandidates. Specifically, it is formulated as a triplet-style loss imposing an\ninequality chain reflecting the specified permutation.

To cope with them, we propose a\nShort-range Ranking Correlation metric as a surrogate objective for black-box\nOrder Attack to approximate the white-box method. The Order Attack is evaluated\non the Fashion-MNIST and Stanford-Online-Products datasets under both white-box\nand black-box threat models.

          "description": "A point cloud serves as a representation of the surface of a\nthree-dimensional (3D) shape. Deep generative models have been adapted to model\ntheir variations typically using a map from a ball-like set of latent\nvariables. However, previous approaches did not pay much attention to the\ntopological structure of a point cloud, despite that a continuous map cannot\nexpress the varying numbers of holes and intersections. Moreover, a point cloud\nis often composed of multiple subparts, and it is also difficult to express. In\nthis study, we propose ChartPointFlow, a flow-based generative model with\nmultiple latent labels for 3D point clouds. Each label is assigned to points in\nan unsupervised manner. Then, a map conditioned on a label is assigned to a\ncontinuous subset of a point cloud, similar to a chart of a manifold. This\nenables our proposed model to preserve the topological structure with clear\nboundaries, whereas previous approaches tend to generate blurry point clouds\nand fail to generate holes. The experimental results demonstrate that\nChartPointFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of generation and\nreconstruction compared with other point cloud generators.

          "description": "Although deep learning based image compression methods have achieved\npromising progress these days, the performance of these methods still cannot\nmatch the latest compression standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC). Most of the\nrecent developments focus on designing a more accurate and flexible entropy\nmodel that can better parameterize the distributions of the latent features.\nHowever, few efforts are devoted to structuring a better transformation between\nthe image space and the latent feature space. In this paper, instead of\nemploying previous autoencoder style networks to build this transformation, we\npropose an enhanced Invertible Encoding Network with invertible neural networks\n(INNs) to largely mitigate the information loss problem for better compression.\nExperimental results on the Kodak, CLIC, and Tecnick datasets show that our\nmethod outperforms the existing learned image compression methods and\ncompression standards, including VVC (VTM 12.1), especially for high-resolution\nimages.

          "description": "Chinese character style transfer is a very challenging problem because of the\ncomplexity of the glyph shapes or underlying structures and large numbers of\nexisted characters, when comparing with English letters. Moreover, the\nhandwriting of calligraphy masters has a more irregular stroke and is difficult\nto obtain in real-world scenarios. Recently, several GAN-based methods have\nbeen proposed for font synthesis, but some of them require numerous reference\ndata and the other part of them have cumbersome preprocessing steps to divide\nthe character into different parts to be learned and transferred separately. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple but powerful end-to-end Chinese calligraphy\nfont generation framework ZiGAN, which does not require any manual operation or\nredundant preprocessing to generate fine-grained target-style characters with\nfew-shot references. To be specific, a few paired samples from different\ncharacter styles are leveraged to attain a fine-grained correlation between\nstructures underlying different glyphs. To capture valuable style knowledge in\ntarget and strengthen the coarse-grained understanding of character content, we\nutilize multiple unpaired samples to align the feature distributions belonging\nto different character styles. By doing so, only a few target Chinese\ncalligraphy characters are needed to generated expected style transferred\ncharacters. Experiments demonstrate that our method has a state-of-the-art\ngeneralization ability in few-shot Chinese character style transfer.",

Although the domain shifts may\nexist in various dimensions such as appearance, textures, etc, the contextual\ndependency, which is generally shared across different domains, is neglected by\nrecent methods. In this paper, we utilize this important clue as explicit prior\nknowledge and propose end-to-end Context-Aware Mixup (CAMix) for domain\nadaptive semantic segmentation. Firstly, we design a contextual mask generation\nstrategy by leveraging accumulated spatial distributions and contextual\nrelationships. The generated contextual mask is critical in this work and will\nguide the domain mixup. In addition, we define the significance mask to\nindicate where the pixels are credible. To alleviate the over-alignment (e.g.,\nearly performance degradation), the source and target significance masks are\nmixed based on the contextual mask into the mixed significance mask, and we\nintroduce a significance-reweighted consistency loss on it.

However, on the datasets involving complex foreground and background\nregions such as CIFAR-10, the performance of the capsule network is sub-optimal\ndue to its naive data routing policy and incompetence towards extracting\ncomplex features.

          "description": "Semi-supervised video object segmentation is a task of segmenting the target\nobject in a video sequence given only a mask annotation in the first frame. The\nlimited information available makes it an extremely challenging task. Most\nprevious best-performing methods adopt matching-based transductive reasoning or\nonline inductive learning. Nevertheless, they are either less discriminative\nfor similar instances or insufficient in the utilization of spatio-temporal\ninformation. In this work, we propose to integrate transductive and inductive\nlearning into a unified framework to exploit the complementarity between them\nfor accurate and robust video object segmentation. The proposed approach\nconsists of two functional branches. The transduction branch adopts a\nlightweight transformer architecture to aggregate rich spatio-temporal cues\nwhile the induction branch performs online inductive learning to obtain\ndiscriminative target information. To bridge these two diverse branches, a\ntwo-head label encoder is introduced to learn the suitable target prior for\neach of them. The generated mask encodings are further forced to be\ndisentangled to better retain their complementarity.

These activities are designed to be\nrealistic, diverse, and complex, aiming to reproduce the challenges that agents\nmust face in the real world. Building such a benchmark poses three fundamental\ndifficulties for each activity: definition (it can differ by time, place, or\nperson), instantiation in a simulator, and evaluation. BEHAVIOR addresses these\nwith three innovations. First, we propose an object-centric, predicate\nlogic-based description language for expressing an activity's initial and goal\nconditions, enabling generation of diverse instances for any activity. Second,\nwe identify the simulator-agnostic features required by an underlying\nenvironment to support BEHAVIOR, and demonstrate its realization in one such\nsimulator. Third, we introduce a set of metrics to measure task progress and\nefficiency, absolute and relative to human demonstrators. We include 500 human\ndemonstrations in virtual reality (VR) to serve as the human ground truth. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that even state of the art embodied AI solutions\nstruggle with the level of realism, diversity, and complexity imposed by the\nactivities in our benchmark. We make BEHAVIOR publicly available at\nbehavior.stanford.edu to facilitate and calibrate the development of new\nembodied AI solutions.",

Light field image capturing devices usually suffer\nfrom the inherent trade-off between the angular and spatial resolutions. To\ntackle this problem, several methods, such as light field reconstruction and\nlight field super-resolution, have been proposed but leaving two problems\nunaddressed, namely domain asymmetry and efficient information flow. In this\npaper, we propose an end-to-end Spatio-Angular Dense Network (SADenseNet) for\nlight field reconstruction with two novel components, namely correlation blocks\nand spatio-angular dense skip connections to address them. The former performs\neffective modeling of the correlation information in a way that conforms with\nthe domain asymmetry.

          "description": "In this work, we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for\nperson re-ID where annotations are available for the source domain but not for\ntarget. Previous methods typically follow a two-stage optimization pipeline,\nwhere the network is first pre-trained on source and then fine-tuned on target\nwith pseudo labels created by feature clustering. Such methods sustain two main\nlimitations. (1) The label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative\nfeatures for recognizing target classes. (2) The domain gap may hinder\nknowledge transferring from source to target. We propose three types of\ntechnical schemes to alleviate these issues. First, we propose a cluster-wise\ncontrastive learning algorithm (CCL) by iterative optimization of feature\nlearning and cluster refinery to learn noise-tolerant representations in the\nunsupervised manner. Second, we adopt a progressive domain adaptation (PDA)\nstrategy to gradually mitigate the domain gap between source and target data.\nThird, we propose Fourier augmentation (FA) for further maximizing the class\nseparability of re-ID models by imposing extra constraints in the Fourier\nspace. We observe that these proposed schemes are capable of facilitating the\nlearning of discriminative feature representations. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our method consistently achieves notable improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods on multiple benchmarks, e.g.,\nsurpassing MMT largely by 8.1\\%, 9.9\\%, 11.4\\% and 11.1\\% mAP on the\nMarket-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT and Duke-to-MSMT tasks,\nrespectively.",

          "description": "The selective visual attention mechanism in the human visual system (HVS)\nrestricts the amount of information to reach visual awareness for perceiving\nnatural scenes, allowing near real-time information processing with limited\ncomputational capacity [Koch and Ullman, 1987]. This kind of selectivity acts\nas an 'Information Bottleneck (IB)', which seeks a trade-off between\ninformation compression and predictive accuracy. However, such information\nconstraints are rarely explored in the attention mechanism for deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an IB-inspired spatial attention\nmodule for DNN structures built for visual recognition. The module takes as\ninput an intermediate representation of the input image, and outputs a\nvariational 2D attention map that minimizes the mutual information (MI) between\nthe attention-modulated representation and the input, while maximizing the MI\nbetween the attention-modulated representation and the task label. To further\nrestrict the information bypassed by the attention map, we quantize the\ncontinuous attention scores to a set of learnable anchor values during\ntraining. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IB-inspired spatial\nattention mechanism can yield attention maps that neatly highlight the regions\nof interest while suppressing backgrounds, and bootstrap standard DNN\nstructures for visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification,\nfine-grained recognition, cross-domain classification). The attention maps are\ninterpretable for the decision making of the DNNs as verified in the\nexperiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/ashleylqx/AIB.git.",

          "description": "Aiming at discovering and locating most distinctive objects from visual\nscenes, salient object detection (SOD) plays an essential role in various\ncomputer vision systems.

The major limitation of previous methods is that they\ntry to identify the salient regions and estimate the accurate objects\nboundaries simultaneously with a single regression task at low-resolution. This\npractice ignores the inherent difference between the two difficult problems,\nresulting in poor detection quality. In this paper, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework for high-resolution SOD task, which disentangles the task\ninto a low-resolution saliency classification network (LRSCN) and a\nhigh-resolution refinement network (HRRN). As a pixel-wise classification task,\nLRSCN is designed to capture sufficient semantics at low-resolution to identify\nthe definite salient, background and uncertain image regions. HRRN is a\nregression task, which aims at accurately refining the saliency value of pixels\nin the uncertain region to preserve a clear object boundary at high-resolution\nwith limited GPU memory. It is worth noting that by introducing uncertainty\ninto the training process, our HRRN can well address the high-resolution\nrefinement task without using any high-resolution training data.

          "description": "Reconstructing a layout of indoor spaces has been a crucial part of growing\nindoor location based services. One of the key challenges in the proliferation\nof indoor location based services is the unavailability of indoor spatial maps\ndue to the complex nature of capturing an indoor space model (e.g., floor plan)\nof an existing building. In this paper, we propose a system to automatically\ngenerate floor plans that can recognize rooms from the point-clouds obtained\nthrough smartphones like Google's Tango. In particular, we propose two\napproaches - a Recurrent Neural Network based approach using Pointer Network\nand a Convolutional Neural Network based approach using Mask-RCNN to identify\nrooms (and thereby floor plans) from point-clouds. Experimental results on\ndifferent datasets demonstrate approximately 0.80-0.90 Intersection-over-Union\nscores, which show that our models can effectively identify the rooms and\nregenerate the shapes of the rooms in heterogeneous environment.",

          "description": "Fine-tuning from pre-trained ImageNet models has been a simple, effective,\nand popular approach for various computer vision tasks. The common practice of\nfine-tuning is to adopt a default hyperparameter setting with a fixed\npre-trained model, while both of them are not optimized for specific tasks and\ntime constraints. Moreover, in cloud computing or GPU clusters where the tasks\narrive sequentially in a stream, faster online fine-tuning is a more desired\nand realistic strategy for saving money, energy consumption, and CO2 emission.\nIn this paper, we propose a joint Neural Architecture Search and Online\nAdaption framework named NASOA towards a faster task-oriented fine-tuning upon\nthe request of users. Specifically, NASOA first adopts an offline NAS to\nidentify a group of training-efficient networks to form a pretrained model zoo.\nWe propose a novel joint block and macro-level search space to enable a\nflexible and efficient search. Then, by estimating fine-tuning performance via\nan adaptive model by accumulating experience from the past tasks, an online\nschedule generator is proposed to pick up the most suitable model and generate\na personalized training regime with respect to each desired task in a one-shot\nfashion. The resulting model zoo is more training efficient than SOTA models,\ne.g. 6x faster than RegNetY-16GF, and 1.7x faster than EfficientNetB3.\nExperiments on multiple datasets also show that NASOA achieves much better\nfine-tuning results, i.e. improving around 2.1% accuracy than the best\nperformance in RegNet series under various constraints and tasks; 40x faster\ncompared to the BOHB.",

          "description": "Domain adaptation aims to bridge the domain shifts between the source and\ntarget domains. These shifts may span different dimensions such as fog,\nrainfall, etc. However, recent methods typically do not consider explicit prior\nknowledge on a specific dimension, thus leading to less desired adaptation\nperformance. In this paper, we study a practical setting called Specific Domain\nAdaptation (SDA) that aligns the source and target domains in a\ndemanded-specific dimension. Within this setting, we observe the intra-domain\ngap induced by different domainness (i.e., numerical magnitudes of this\ndimension) is crucial when adapting to a specific domain. To address the\nproblem, we propose a novel Self-Adversarial Disentangling (SAD) framework. In\nparticular, given a specific dimension, we first enrich the source domain by\nintroducing a domainness creator with providing additional supervisory signals.\nGuided by the created domainness, we design a self-adversarial regularizer and\ntwo loss functions to jointly disentangle the latent representations into\ndomainness-specific and domainness-invariant features, thus mitigating the\nintra-domain gap. Our method can be easily taken as a plug-and-play framework\nand does not introduce any extra costs in the inference time.

          "description": "Faces manifest large variations in many aspects, such as identity,\nexpression, pose, and face styling. Therefore, it is a great challenge to\ndisentangle and extract these characteristics from facial images, especially in\nan unsupervised manner. In this work, we introduce cycle-consistency in facial\ncharacteristics as free supervisory signal to learn facial representations from\nunlabeled facial images. The learning is realized by superimposing the facial\nmotion cycle-consistency and identity cycle-consistency constraints. The main\nidea of the facial motion cycle-consistency is that, given a face with\nexpression, we can perform de-expression to a neutral face via the removal of\nfacial motion and further perform re-expression to reconstruct back to the\noriginal face. The main idea of the identity cycle-consistency is to exploit\nboth de-identity into mean face by depriving the given neutral face of its\nidentity via feature re-normalization and re-identity into neutral face by\nadding the personal attributes to the mean face. At training time, our model\nlearns to disentangle two distinct facial representations to be useful for\nperforming cycle-consistent face reconstruction. At test time, we use the\nlinear protocol scheme for evaluating facial representations on various tasks,\nincluding facial expression recognition and head pose regression. We also can\ndirectly apply the learnt facial representations to person recognition,\nfrontalization and image-to-image translation. Our experiments show that the\nresults of our approach is competitive with those of existing methods,\ndemonstrating the rich and unique information embedded in the disentangled\nrepresentations.

          "description": "Turn-taking has played an essential role in structuring the regulation of a\nconversation. The task of identifying the main speaker (who is properly taking\nhis/her turn of speaking) and the interrupters (who are interrupting or\nreacting to the main speaker's utterances) remains a challenging task. Although\nsome prior methods have partially addressed this task, there still remain some\nlimitations. Firstly, a direct association of Audio and Visual features may\nlimit the correlations to be extracted due to different modalities. Secondly,\nthe relationship across temporal segments helping to maintain the consistency\nof localization, separation, and conversation contexts is not effectively\nexploited. Finally, the interactions between speakers that usually contain the\ntracking and anticipatory decisions about the transition to a new speaker are\nusually ignored. Therefore, this work introduces a new Audio-Visual Transformer\napproach to the problem of localization and highlighting the main speaker in\nboth audio and visual channels of a multi-speaker conversation video in the\nwild. The proposed method exploits different types of correlations presented in\nboth visual and audio signals. The temporal audio-visual relationships across\nspatial-temporal space are anticipated and optimized via the self-attention\nmechanism in a Transformerstructure. Moreover, a newly collected dataset is\nintroduced for the main speaker detection. To the best of our knowledge, it is\none of the first studies that is able to automatically localize and highlight\nthe main speaker in both visual and audio channels in multi-speaker\nconversation videos.",

          "description": "This paper strives for action recognition and detection in video modalities\nlike RGB, depth maps or 3D-skeleton sequences when only limited\nmodality-specific labeled examples are available. For the RGB, and derived\noptical-flow, modality many large-scale labeled datasets have been made\navailable. They have become the de facto pre-training choice when recognizing\nor detecting new actions from RGB datasets that have limited amounts of labeled\nexamples available. Unfortunately, large-scale labeled action datasets for\nother modalities are unavailable for pre-training. In this paper, our goal is\nto recognize actions from limited examples in non-RGB video modalities, by\nlearning from large-scale labeled RGB data. To this end, we propose a two-step\ntraining process: (i) we extract action representation knowledge from an\nRGB-trained teacher network and adapt it to a non-RGB student network. (ii) we\nthen fine-tune the transfer model with available labeled examples of the target\nmodality. For the knowledge transfer we introduce feature-supervision\nstrategies, which rely on unlabeled pairs of two modalities (the RGB and the\ntarget modality) to transfer feature level representations from the teacher to\nthe student network. Ablations and generalizations with two RGB source datasets\nand two non-RGB target datasets demonstrate that an optical-flow teacher\nprovides better action transfer features than RGB for both depth maps and\n3D-skeletons, even when evaluated on a different target domain, or for a\ndifferent task. Compared to alternative cross-modal action transfer methods we\nshow a good improvement in performance especially when labeled non-RGB examples\nto learn from are scarce",

But due to its complexity, researchers have not reached great\nresults compared to the action recognition task. The complexity is related to\npredicting precise start and end times for different actions in any video. In\nthis paper, we propose a new network based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and\ntwo novel post-processing ideas for TAL task. Specifically, we propose a new\ndesign for the output layer of the GRU resulting in the so-called GRU-Splitted\nmodel. Moreover, linear interpolation is used to generate the action proposals\nwith precise start and end times. Finally, to rank the generated proposals\nappropriately, we use a Learn to Rank (LTR) approach. We evaluated the\nperformance of the proposed method on Thumos14 dataset. Results show the\nsuperiority of the performance of the proposed method compared to\nstate-of-the-art.

However, the use\nof simulation has skewed the attention to tasks that only require what robotics\nsimulators can simulate: motion and physical contact. We present iGibson 2.0,\nan open-source simulation environment that supports the simulation of a more\ndiverse set of household tasks through three key innovations. First, iGibson\n2.0 supports object states, including temperature, wetness level, cleanliness\nlevel, and toggled and sliced states, necessary to cover a wider range of\ntasks. Second, iGibson 2.0 implements a set of predicate logic functions that\nmap the simulator states to logic states like Cooked or Soaked. Additionally,\ngiven a logic state, iGibson 2.0 can sample valid physical states that satisfy\nit. This functionality can generate potentially infinite instances of tasks\nwith minimal effort from the users. The sampling mechanism allows our scenes to\nbe more densely populated with small objects in semantically meaningful\nlocations. Third, iGibson 2.0 includes a virtual reality (VR) interface to\nimmerse humans in its scenes to collect demonstrations. As a result, we can\ncollect demonstrations from humans on these new types of tasks, and use them\nfor imitation learning. We evaluate the new capabilities of iGibson 2.0 to\nenable robot learning of novel tasks, in the hope of demonstrating the\npotential of this new simulator to support new research in embodied AI. iGibson\n2.0 and its new dataset will be publicly available at\nthis http URL",

However, acquiring and\nmanually labeling a large medical image set is resource-intensive, expensive,\nand sometimes impractical due to data sharing and privacy issues. To address\nthis challenge, we propose an adversarial data augmentation approach to improve\nthe efficiency in utilizing training data and to enlarge the dataset via\nsimulated but realistic transformations. Specifically, we present a generic\ntask-driven learning framework, which jointly optimizes a data augmentation\nmodel and a segmentation network during training, generating informative\nexamples to enhance network generalizability for the downstream task. The data\naugmentation model utilizes a set of photometric and geometric image\ntransformations and chains them to simulate realistic complex imaging\nvariations that could exist in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The proposed\nadversarial data augmentation does not rely on generative networks and can be\nused as a plug-in module in general segmentation networks. It is\ncomputationally efficient and applicable for both supervised and\nsemi-supervised learning. We analyze and evaluate the method on two MR image\nsegmentation tasks: cardiac segmentation and prostate segmentation.

The challenges\nof collecting such datasets, especially in case of 3D volumes, motivate to\ndevelop approaches that can learn from other types of labels that are cheap to\nobtain, e.g. bounding boxes. We focus on 3D medical images with their\ncorresponding 3D bounding boxes which are considered as series of per-slice\nnon-tight 2D bounding boxes. While current weakly-supervised approaches that\nuse 2D bounding boxes as weak labels can be applied to medical image\nsegmentation, we show that their success is limited in cases when the\nassumption about the tightness of the bounding boxes breaks. We propose a new\nbounding box correction framework which is trained on a small set of\npixel-level annotations to improve the tightness of a larger set of non-tight\nbounding box annotations. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated by\nevaluating a known weakly-supervised segmentation approach with and without the\nproposed bounding box correction algorithm.

          "description": "The capabilities of autonomous flight with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\nhave significantly increased in recent times. However, basic problems such as\nfast and robust geo-localization in GPS-denied environments still remain\nunsolved. Existing research has primarily concentrated on improving the\naccuracy of localization at the cost of long and varying computation time in\nvarious situations, which often necessitates the use of powerful ground station\nmachines. In order to make image-based geo-localization online and pragmatic\nfor lightweight embedded systems on UAVs, we propose a framework that is\nreliable in changing scenes, flexible about computing resource allocation and\nadaptable to common camera placements. The framework is comprised of two\nstages: offline database preparation and online inference. At the first stage,\ncolor images and depth maps are rendered as seen from potential vehicle poses\nquantized over the satellite and topography maps of anticipated flying areas. A\ndatabase is then populated with the global and local descriptors of the\nrendered images. At the second stage, for each captured real-world query image,\ntop global matches are retrieved from the database and the vehicle pose is\nfurther refined via local descriptor matching. We present field experiments of\nimage-based localization on two different UAV platforms to validate our\nresults.",

          "description": "This paper presents an end-to-end semi-supervised object detection approach,\nin contrast to previous more complex multi-stage methods. The end-to-end\ntraining gradually improves pseudo label qualities during the curriculum, and\nthe more and more accurate pseudo labels in turn benefit object detection\ntraining. We also propose two simple yet effective techniques within this\nframework: a soft teacher mechanism where the classification loss of each\nunlabeled bounding box is weighed by the classification score produced by the\nteacher network; a box jittering approach to select reliable pseudo boxes for\nthe learning of box regression. On the COCO benchmark, the proposed approach\noutperforms previous methods by a large margin under various labeling ratios,\ni.e. 1\\%, 5\\% and 10\\%. Moreover, our approach proves to perform also well when\nthe amount of labeled data is relatively large. For example, it can improve a\n40.9 mAP baseline detector trained using the full COCO training set by +3.6\nmAP, reaching 44.5 mAP, by leveraging the 123K unlabeled images of COCO. On the\nstate-of-the-art Swin Transformer based object detector (58.9 mAP on test-dev),\nit can still significantly improve the detection accuracy by +1.5 mAP, reaching\n60.4 mAP, and improve the instance segmentation accuracy by +1.2 mAP, reaching\n52.4 mAP. Further incorporating with the Object365 pre-trained model, the\ndetection accuracy reaches 61.3 mAP and the instance segmentation accuracy\nreaches 53.0 mAP, pushing the new state-of-the-art.",

          "description": "Coronaviruses constitute a family of viruses that gives rise to respiratory\ndiseases. As COVID-19 is highly contagious, early diagnosis of COVID-19 is\ncrucial for an effective treatment strategy. However, the RT-PCR test which is\nconsidered to be a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suffers from a\nhigh false-negative rate. Chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis has emerged as a\nfeasible and effective diagnostic technique towards this objective. In this\nwork, we propose the COVID-19 classification problem as a three-class\nclassification problem to distinguish between COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia\nclasses. We propose a three-stage framework, named COV-ELM. Stage one deals\nwith preprocessing and transformation while stage two deals with feature\nextraction. These extracted features are passed as an input to the ELM at the\nthird stage, resulting in the identification of COVID-19. The choice of ELM in\nthis work has been motivated by its faster convergence, better generalization\ncapability, and shorter training time in comparison to the conventional\ngradient-based learning algorithms. As bigger and diverse datasets become\navailable, ELM can be quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based\ncompetitor models. The proposed model achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95\nand the overall sensitivity of ${0.94 \\pm 0.02} at a 95% confidence interval.\nWhen compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the COV-ELM is\nfound to outperform its competitors in this three-class classification\nscenario. Further, LIME has been integrated with the proposed COV-ELM model to\ngenerate annotated CXR images. The annotations are based on the superpixels\nthat have contributed to distinguish between the different classes. It was\nobserved that the superpixels correspond to the regions of the human lungs that\nare clinically observed in COVID-19 and Pneumonia cases.",

          "description": "Adversarial robustness of deep learning models has gained much traction in\nthe last few years. Various attacks and defenses are proposed to improve the\nadversarial robustness of modern-day deep learning architectures. While all\nthese approaches help improve the robustness, one promising direction for\nimproving adversarial robustness is un-explored, i.e., the complex topology of\nthe neural network architecture. In this work, we answer the following\nquestion: \"Can the complex topology of a neural network give adversarial\nrobustness without any form of adversarial training?\" empirically by\nexperimenting with different hand-crafted and NAS based architectures. Our\nfindings show that, for small-scale attacks, NAS-based architectures are more\nrobust for small-scale datasets and simple tasks than hand-crafted\narchitectures. However, as the dataset's size or the task's complexity\nincrease, hand-crafted architectures are more robust than NAS-based\narchitectures. We perform the first large scale study to understand adversarial\nrobustness purely from an architectural perspective. Our results show that\nrandom sampling in the search space of DARTS (a popular NAS method) with simple\nensembling can improve the robustness to PGD attack by nearly ~12\\%. We show\nthat NAS, which is popular for SoTA accuracy, can provide adversarial accuracy\nas a free add-on without any form of adversarial training. Our results show\nthat leveraging the power of neural network topology with methods like\nensembles can be an excellent way to achieve adversarial robustness without any\nform of adversarial training. We also introduce a metric that can be used to\ncalculate the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness.",

          "description": "The goal of representation learning is different from the ultimate objective\nof machine learning such as decision making, it is therefore very difficult to\nestablish clear and direct objectives for training representation learning\nmodels. It has been argued that a good representation should disentangle the\nunderlying variation factors, yet how to translate this into training\nobjectives remains unknown. This paper presents an attempt to establish direct\ntraining criterions and design principles for developing good representation\nlearning models. We propose that a good representation learning model should be\nmaximally expressive, i.e., capable of distinguishing the maximum number of\ninput configurations. We formally define expressiveness and introduce the\nmaximum expressiveness (MEXS) theorem of a general learning model. We propose\nto train a model by maximizing its expressiveness while at the same time\nincorporating general priors such as model smoothness. We present a conscience\ncompetitive learning algorithm which encourages the model to reach its MEXS\nwhilst at the same time adheres to model smoothness prior. We also introduce a\nlabel consistent training (LCT) technique to boost model smoothness by\nencouraging it to assign consistent labels to similar samples. We present\nextensive experimental results to show that our method can indeed design\nrepresentation learning models capable of developing representations that are\nas good as or better than state of the art. We also show that our technique is\ncomputationally efficient, robust against different parameter settings and can\nwork effectively on a variety of datasets.

          "description": "In image fusion, images obtained from different sensors are fused to generate\na single image with enhanced information. In recent years, state-of-the-art\nmethods have adopted Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to encode meaningful\nfeatures for image fusion. Specifically, CNN-based methods perform image fusion\nby fusing local features. However, they do not consider long-range dependencies\nthat are present in the image. Transformer-based models are designed to\novercome this by modeling the long-range dependencies with the help of\nself-attention mechanism. This motivates us to propose a novel Image Fusion\nTransformer (IFT) where we develop a transformer-based multi-scale fusion\nstrategy that attends to both local and long-range information (or global\ncontext). The proposed method follows a two-stage training approach. In the\nfirst stage, we train an auto-encoder to extract deep features at multiple\nscales. In the second stage, multi-scale features are fused using a\nSpatio-Transformer (ST) fusion strategy. The ST fusion blocks are comprised of\na CNN and a transformer branch which capture local and long-range features,\nrespectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that\nthe proposed method performs better than many competitive fusion algorithms.\nFurthermore, we show the effectiveness of the proposed ST fusion strategy with\nan ablation analysis.

          "description": "Plant species identification is time consuming, costly, and requires lots of\nefforts, and expertise knowledge. In recent, many researchers use deep learning\nmethods to classify plants directly using plant images. While deep learning\nmodels have achieved a great success, the lack of interpretability limit their\nwidespread application. To overcome this, we explore the use of interpretable,\nmeasurable and computer-aided features extracted from plant leaf images. Image\nprocessing is one of the most challenging, and crucial steps in\nfeature-extraction. The purpose of image processing is to improve the leaf\nimage by removing undesired distortion. The main image processing steps of our\nalgorithm involves: i) Convert original image to RGB (Red-Green-Blue) image,\nii) Gray scaling, iii) Gaussian smoothing, iv) Binary thresholding, v) Remove\nstalk, vi) Closing holes, and vii) Resize image. The next step after image\nprocessing is to extract features from plant leaf images. We introduced 52\ncomputationally efficient features to classify plant species. These features\nare mainly classified into four groups as: i) shape-based features, ii)\ncolor-based features, iii) texture-based features, and iv) scagnostic features.\nLength, width, area, texture correlation, monotonicity and scagnostics are to\nname few of them. We explore the ability of features to discriminate the\nclasses of interest under supervised learning and unsupervised learning\nsettings. For that, supervised dimensionality reduction technique, Linear\nDiscriminant Analysis (LDA), and unsupervised dimensionality reduction\ntechnique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used to convert and visualize\nthe images from digital-image space to feature space. The results show that the\nfeatures are sufficient to discriminate the classes of interest under both\nsupervised and unsupervised learning settings.",

A limitation of current SOD\nmodels is insufficient utilization of inter-pixel information, which usually\nresults in imperfect segmentation near edge regions and low spatial coherence.\nAs we demonstrate, using a saliency mask as the only label is suboptimal. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a connectivity-based approach called\nbilateral connectivity network (BiconNet), which uses connectivity masks\ntogether with saliency masks as labels for effective modeling of inter-pixel\nrelationships and object saliency. Moreover, we propose a bilateral voting\nmodule to enhance the output connectivity map, and a novel edge feature\nenhancement method that efficiently utilizes edge-specific features. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our\nproposed method can be plugged into any existing state-of-the-art\nsaliency-based SOD framework to improve its performance with negligible\nparameter increase.",

          "description": "Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) maps have emerged as one of the most powerful\nrepresentations for scene understanding due to their ability to provide rich\nspatial context while being easy to interpret and process. However, generating\nBEV maps requires complex multi-stage paradigms that encapsulate a series of\ndistinct tasks such as depth estimation, ground plane estimation, and semantic\nsegmentation. These sub-tasks are often learned in a disjoint manner which\nprevents the model from holistic reasoning and results in erroneous BEV maps.\nMoreover, existing algorithms only predict the semantics in the BEV space,\nwhich limits their use in applications where the notion of object instances is\ncritical. In this work, we present the first end-to-end learning approach for\ndirectly predicting dense panoptic segmentation maps in the BEV, given a single\nmonocular image in the frontal view (FV). Our architecture follows the top-down\nparadigm and incorporates a novel dense transformer module consisting of two\ndistinct transformers that learn to independently map vertical and flat regions\nin the input image from the FV to the BEV. Additionally, we derive a\nmathematical formulation for the sensitivity of the FV-BEV transformation which\nallows us to intelligently weight pixels in the BEV space to account for the\nvarying descriptiveness across the FV image. Extensive evaluations on the\nKITTI-360 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach exceeds the\nstate-of-the-art in the PQ metric by 3.61 pp and 4.93 pp respectively.",

In this paper we present a\nprobabilistic method which combines a hidden Markov state process that encodes\nneuron geometric properties with a random field appearance model of the\nflourescence process. Our method utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently\ncompute the global maximizers of what we call the \"most probable\" neuron path.\nWe applied our algorithm to the output of image segmentation models where false\nnegatives severed neuronal processes, and showed that it can follow axons in\nthe presence of noise or nearby neurons. Our method has the potential to be\nintegrated into a semi or fully automated reconstruction pipeline.\nAdditionally, it creates a framework for conditioning the probability to fixed\nstart and endpoints through which users can intervene with hard constraints to,\nfor example, rule out certain reconstructions, or assign axons to particular\ncell bodies.",

          "description": "Deep generative models have made great progress in synthesizing images with\narbitrary human poses and transferring poses of one person to others. However,\nmost existing approaches explicitly leverage the pose information extracted\nfrom the source images as a conditional input for the generative networks.\nMeanwhile, they usually focus on the visual fidelity of the synthesized images\nbut neglect the inherent consistency, which further confines their performance\nof pose transfer. To alleviate the current limitations and improve the quality\nof the synthesized images, we propose a pose transfer network with Disentangled\nFeature Consistency (DFC-Net) to facilitate human pose transfer. Given a pair\nof images containing the source and target person, DFC-Net extracts pose and\nstatic information from the source and target respectively, then synthesizes an\nimage of the target person with the desired pose from the source. Moreover,\nDFC-Net leverages disentangled feature consistency losses in the adversarial\ntraining to strengthen the transfer coherence and integrates the keypoint\namplifier to enhance the pose feature extraction. Additionally, an unpaired\nsupport dataset Mixamo-Sup providing more extra pose information has been\nfurther utilized during the training to improve the generality and robustness\nof DFC-Net.

          "description": "Instance segmentation is an important pre-processing task in numerous\nreal-world applications, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and\nhuman-computer interaction. Compared with the rapid development of deep\nlearning for two-dimensional (2D) image tasks, deep learning-based instance\nsegmentation of 3D point cloud still has a lot of room for development. In\nparticular, distinguishing a large number of occluded objects of the same class\nis a highly challenging problem, which is seen in a robotic bin-picking. In a\nusual bin-picking scene, many indentical objects are stacked together and the\nmodel of the objects is known. Thus, the semantic information can be ignored;\ninstead, the focus in the bin-picking is put on the segmentation of instances.\nBased on this task requirement, we propose a Fast Point Cloud Clustering (FPCC)\nfor instance segmentation of bin-picking scene. FPCC includes a network named\nFPCC-Net and a fast clustering algorithm. FPCC-net has two subnets, one for\ninferring the geometric centers for clustering and the other for describing\nfeatures of each point. FPCC-Net extracts features of each point and infers\ngeometric center points of each instance simultaneously. After that, the\nproposed clustering algorithm clusters the remaining points to the closest\ngeometric center in feature embedding space. Experiments show that FPCC also\nsurpasses the existing works in bin-picking scenes and is more computationally\nefficient. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/xyjbaal/FPCC.",

Our proposed method, Global and Part-Aware\nNetwork (GPA-Net), creates global and local branches on the conv-layer for\nlearning robust discriminative global and part-level features. For learning the\nlocal (part-level) features, we perform uniform partitioning on the conv-layer\nin both horizontal and vertical directions.

          "description": "Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT)\ndue to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one\nmap between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests\nnear equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from\ncompressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As\nthe latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent\nthis equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical\nsignificance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach\nbased on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the\nsubsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step\napproach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly\nrecovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the\nphotoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic\nforward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet\ntransform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are\nformulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily\noverdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of\nthe solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed\nsensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA.\nSubsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as\nimplemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to\nrecover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition\nincluding a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative\nmerits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real\ndata in a fair and rigorous manner.",

          "description": "Anomaly detection with weakly supervised video-level labels is typically\nformulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, in which we aim to\nidentify snippets containing abnormal events, with each video represented as a\nbag of video snippets. Although current methods show effective detection\nperformance, their recognition of the positive instances, i.e., rare abnormal\nsnippets in the abnormal videos, is largely biased by the dominant negative\ninstances, especially when the abnormal events are subtle anomalies that\nexhibit only small differences compared with normal events. This issue is\nexacerbated in many methods that ignore important video temporal dependencies.\nTo address this issue, we introduce a novel and theoretically sound method,\nnamed Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude learning (RTFM), which trains a feature\nmagnitude learning function to effectively recognise the positive instances,\nsubstantially improving the robustness of the MIL approach to the negative\ninstances from abnormal videos. RTFM also adapts dilated convolutions and\nself-attention mechanisms to capture long- and short-range temporal\ndependencies to learn the feature magnitude more faithfully. Extensive\nexperiments show that the RTFM-enabled MIL model (i) outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin on four benchmark data sets\n(ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime, XD-Violence and UCSD-Peds) and (ii) achieves\nsignificantly improved subtle anomaly discriminability and sample efficiency.\nCode is available at https://github.com/tianyu0207/RTFM.",

          "description": "Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)} have been widely used for\nportrait image generation. However, in the latent space learned by GANs,\ndifferent attributes, such as pose, shape, and texture style, are generally\nentangled, making the explicit control of specific attributes difficult. To\naddress this issue, we propose a SofGAN image generator to decouple the latent\nspace of portraits into two subspaces: a geometry space and a texture space.\nThe latent codes sampled from the two subspaces are fed to two network branches\nseparately, one to generate the 3D geometry of portraits with canonical pose,\nand the other to generate textures. The aligned 3D geometries also come with\nsemantic part segmentation, encoded as a semantic occupancy field (SOF). The\nSOF allows the rendering of consistent 2D semantic segmentation maps at\narbitrary views, which are then fused with the generated texture maps and\nstylized to a portrait photo using our semantic instance-wise (SIW) module.\nThrough extensive experiments, we show that our system can generate high\nquality portrait images with independently controllable geometry and texture\nattributes. The method also generalizes well in various applications such as\nappearance-consistent facial animation and dynamic styling.",

Different from previous work, our model\nis specifically designed to handle (also) point-cloud pairs with low overlap.\nIts key novelty is an overlap-attention block for early information exchange\nbetween the latent encodings of the two point clouds. In this way the\nsubsequent decoding of the latent representations into per-point features is\nconditioned on the respective other point cloud, and thus can predict which\npoints are not only salient, but also lie in the overlap region between the two\npoint clouds.

The\nstructure of Extreme Leaning Machine was not designed to feed two input data\nstreams simultaneously, thus, in 2-input scenarios Extreme Learning Machine\nmethods are normally applied using concatenated inputs.

          "description": "Domain adaptation (DA) has drawn high interest for its capacity to adapt a\nmodel trained on labeled source data to perform well on unlabeled or weakly\nlabeled target data from a different domain. Most common DA techniques require\nconcurrent access to the input images of both the source and target domains.\nHowever, in practice, privacy concerns often impede the availability of source\nimages in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in medical\nimaging, where, for instance, the source and target images could come from\ndifferent clinical sites. We introduce a source-free domain adaptation for\nimage segmentation. Our formulation is based on minimizing a label-free entropy\nloss defined over target-domain data, which we further guide with a\ndomain-invariant prior on the segmentation regions. Many priors can be derived\nfrom anatomical information. Here, a class ratio prior is estimated from\nanatomical knowledge and integrated in the form of a Kullback Leibler (KL)\ndivergence in our overall loss function. Furthermore, we motivate our overall\nloss with an interesting link to maximizing the mutual information between the\ntarget images and their label predictions. We show the effectiveness of our\nprior aware entropy minimization in a variety of domain-adaptation scenarios,\nwith different modalities and applications, including spine, prostate, and\ncardiac segmentation. Our method yields comparable results to several state of\nthe art adaptation techniques, despite having access to much less information,\nas the source images are entirely absent in our adaptation phase. Our\nstraightforward adaptation strategy uses only one network, contrary to popular\nadversarial techniques, which are not applicable to a source-free DA setting.\nOur framework can be readily used in a breadth of segmentation problems, and\nour code is publicly available: https://github.com/mathilde-b/SFDA",

          "description": "Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) have shown remarkable\nperformance in unconditional image generation. However, due to the\nstochasticity of the generative process in DDPM, it is challenging to generate\nimages with the desired semantics. In this work, we propose Iterative Latent\nVariable Refinement (ILVR), a method to guide the generative process in DDPM to\ngenerate high-quality images based on a given reference image. Here, the\nrefinement of the generative process in DDPM enables a single DDPM to sample\nimages from various sets directed by the reference image. The proposed ILVR\nmethod generates high-quality images while controlling the generation. The\ncontrollability of our method allows adaptation of a single DDPM without any\nadditional learning in various image generation tasks, such as generation from\nvarious downsampling factors, multi-domain image translation, paint-to-image,\nand editing with scribbles.",

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging has been proposed as a\nscreening tool as it is a much cheaper and easier to apply imaging modality\nthan others that are traditionally used for pulmonary examinations, namely\nchest x-ray and computed tomography. Given the scarcity of expert radiologists\nfor interpreting POCUS examinations in many highly affected regions around the\nworld, low-cost deep learning-driven clinical decision support solutions can\nhave a large impact during the on-going pandemic. Motivated by this, we\nintroduce COVID-Net US, a highly efficient, self-attention deep convolutional\nneural network design tailored for COVID-19 screening from lung POCUS images.\nExperimental results show that the proposed COVID-Net US can achieve an AUC of\nover 0.98 while achieving 353X lower architectural complexity, 62X lower\ncomputational complexity, and 14.3X faster inference times on a Raspberry Pi.\nClinical validation was also conducted, where select cases were reviewed and\nreported on by a practicing clinician (20 years of clinical practice)\nspecializing in intensive care (ICU) and 15 years of expertise in POCUS\ninterpretation. To advocate affordable healthcare and artificial intelligence\nfor resource-constrained environments, we have made COVID-Net US open source\nand publicly available as part of the COVID-Net open source initiative.",

In this paper, we attempt to\ndevise a feature-level data manipulation, differing from data augmentation, to\nenhance the generic contrastive self-supervised learning. To this end, we first\ndesign a visualization scheme for pos/neg score (Pos/neg score indicates cosine\nsimilarity of pos/neg pair.) distribution, which enables us to analyze,\ninterpret and understand the learning process. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst attempt of its kind. More importantly, leveraging this tool, we gain some\nsignificant observations, which inspire our novel Feature Transformation\nproposals including the extrapolation of positives. This operation creates\nharder positives to boost the learning because hard positives enable the model\nto be more view-invariant. Besides, we propose the interpolation among\nnegatives, which provides diversified negatives and makes the model more\ndiscriminative. It is the first attempt to deal with both challenges\nsimultaneously. Experiment results show that our proposed Feature\nTransformation can improve at least 6.0% accuracy on ImageNet-100 over MoCo\nbaseline, and about 2.0% accuracy on ImageNet-1K over the MoCoV2 baseline.\nTransferring to the downstream tasks successfully demonstrate our model is less\ntask-bias.

          "description": "The aortic vessel tree is composed of the aorta and its branching arteries,\nand plays a key role in supplying the whole body with blood. Aortic diseases,\nlike aneurysms or dissections, can lead to an aortic rupture, whose treatment\nwith open surgery is highly risky. Therefore, patients commonly undergo drug\ntreatment under constant monitoring, which requires regular inspections of the\nvessels through imaging. The standard imaging modality for diagnosis and\nmonitoring is computed tomography (CT), which can provide a detailed picture of\nthe aorta and its branching vessels if combined with a contrast agent,\nresulting in a CT angiography (CTA). Optimally, the whole aortic vessel tree\ngeometry from consecutive CTAs, are overlaid and compared. This allows to not\nonly detect changes in the aorta, but also more peripheral vessel tree changes,\ncaused by the primary pathology or newly developed. When performed manually,\nthis reconstruction requires slice by slice contouring, which could easily take\na whole day for a single aortic vessel tree and, hence, is not feasible in\nclinical practice. Automatic or semi-automatic vessel tree segmentation\nalgorithms, on the other hand, can complete this task in a fraction of the\nmanual execution time and run in parallel to the clinical routine of the\nclinicians. In this paper, we systematically review computing techniques for\nthe automatic and semi-automatic segmentation of the aortic vessel tree. The\nreview concludes with an in-depth discussion on how close these\nstate-of-the-art approaches are to an application in clinical practice and how\nactive this research field is, taking into account the number of publications,\ndatasets and challenges.",

          "description": "Rotating object detection has wide applications in aerial photographs, remote\nsensing images, UAVs, etc. At present, most of the rotating object detection\ndatasets focus on the field of remote sensing, and these images are usually\nshot in high-altitude scenes. However, image datasets captured at low-altitude\nareas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a\nlow-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research\nand development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD\nconsists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by\noriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the\nrotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting\ntasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the\nrotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating\nobject detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and\ntwo-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted\nhorizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor\nrefinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective\nstrategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the\nregression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the\nTS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely\nwith one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD\ndataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD\ndemonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

Post-processing and refining\nthe results of segmentation is a common practice to decrease the\nmisclassifications originating from the segmentation network. In addition to\nwidely used methods like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) which focus on the\nstructure of the segmented volume/area, a graph-based recent approach makes use\nof certain and uncertain points in a graph and refines the segmentation\naccording to a small graph convolutional network (GCN).

To address\nthese issues, we define a new neighbor-selection mechanism according to feature\ndistances and combine the two networks in the training procedure. According to\nthe experimental results on pancreas segmentation from Computed Tomography (CT)\nimages, we demonstrate improvement in the quantitative measures. Also,\nexamining the dynamic neighbors created by our method, edges between\nsemantically similar image parts are observed.

What is particularly interesting is that after replacing the\nnuclear norm with the $L_{2,1}$ norm proposed based on this decomposition, as\nthe upper bound of the nuclear norm, when the intermediate matrix $D$ in its\ndecomposition is close to the diagonal matrix, it will converge to the nuclear\nnorm, and is exactly equal, when the $D$ matrix is equal to the diagonal\nmatrix, to the nuclear norm, which ingeniously avoids the calculation of the\nsingular value of the matrix.

We then use a deep R(2+1)D network for FER, which we train in a\nself-supervised fashion based on the augmentations and subsequently fine-tune.\nExperiments are performed on the Oulu-CASIA dataset and the performance is\ncompared to other works in FER. The results indicate that our method achieves\nan accuracy of 89.4%, setting a new state-of-the-art by outperforming other\nworks.

          "description": "Lung ultrasound imaging has been shown effective in detecting typical\npatterns for interstitial pneumonia, as a point-of-care tool for both patients\nwith COVID-19 and other community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In this work, we\nfocus on the hyperechoic B-line segmentation task. Using deep neural networks,\nwe automatically outline the regions that are indicative of pathology-sensitive\nartifacts and their associated sonographic patterns. With a real-world\ndata-scarce scenario, we investigate approaches to utilize both COVID-19 and\nCAP lung ultrasound data to train the networks; comparing fine-tuning and\nunsupervised domain adaptation. Segmenting either type of lung condition at\ninference may support a range of clinical applications during evolving epidemic\nstages, but also demonstrates value in resource-constrained clinical scenarios.\nAdapting real clinical data acquired from COVID-19 patients to those from CAP\npatients significantly improved Dice scores from 0.60 to 0.87 (p < 0.001) and\nfrom 0.43 to 0.71 (p < 0.001), on independent COVID-19 and CAP test cases,\nrespectively. It is of practical value that the improvement was demonstrated\nwith only a small amount of data in both training and adaptation data sets, a\ncommon constraint for deploying machine learning models in clinical practice.\nInterestingly, we also report that the inverse adaptation, from labelled CAP\ndata to unlabeled COVID-19 data, did not demonstrate an improvement when tested\non either condition. Furthermore, we offer a possible explanation that\ncorrelates the segmentation performance to label consistency and data domain\ndiversity in this point-of-care lung ultrasound application.",

To explicitly learn meta-class representations in few-shot\nsegmentation task, we propose a novel Meta-class Memory based few-shot\nsegmentation method (MM-Net), where we introduce a set of learnable memory\nembeddings to memorize the meta-class information during the base class\ntraining and transfer to novel classes during the inference stage. Moreover,\nfor the $k$-shot scenario, we propose a novel image quality measurement module\nto select images from the set of support images.

Experiments on both PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO dataset shows that\nour proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in both 1-shot\nand 5-shot settings.

          "description": "Labeling is onerous for crowd counting as it should annotate each individual\nin crowd images. Recently, several methods have been proposed for\nsemi-supervised crowd counting to reduce the labeling efforts. Given a limited\nlabeling budget, they typically select a few crowd images and densely label all\nindividuals in each of them. Despite the promising results, we argue the\nNone-or-All labeling strategy is suboptimal as the densely labeled individuals\nin each crowd image usually appear similar while the massive unlabeled crowd\nimages may contain entirely diverse individuals. To this end, we propose to\nbreak the labeling chain of previous methods and make the first attempt to\nreduce spatial labeling redundancy for semi-supervised crowd counting. First,\ninstead of annotating all the regions in each crowd image, we propose to\nannotate the representative ones only. We analyze the region representativeness\nfrom both vertical and horizontal directions, and formulate them as cluster\ncenters of Gaussian Mixture Models. Additionally, to leverage the rich\nunlabeled regions, we exploit the similarities among individuals in each crowd\nimage to directly supervise the unlabeled regions via feature propagation\ninstead of the error-prone label propagation employed in the previous methods.\nIn this way, we can transfer the original spatial labeling redundancy caused by\nindividual similarities to effective supervision signals on the unlabeled\nregions. Extensive experiments on the widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that\nour method can outperform previous best approaches by a large margin.",

          "description": "A few-shot semantic segmentation model is typically composed of a CNN\nencoder, a CNN decoder and a simple classifier (separating foreground and\nbackground pixels). Most existing methods meta-learn all three model components\nfor fast adaptation to a new class. However, given that as few as a single\nsupport set image is available, effective model adaption of all three\ncomponents to the new class is extremely challenging. In this work we propose\nto simplify the meta-learning task by focusing solely on the simplest\ncomponent, the classifier, whilst leaving the encoder and decoder to\npre-training. We hypothesize that if we pre-train an off-the-shelf segmentation\nmodel over a set of diverse training classes with sufficient annotations, the\nencoder and decoder can capture rich discriminative features applicable for any\nunseen classes, rendering the subsequent meta-learning stage unnecessary. For\nthe classifier meta-learning, we introduce a Classifier Weight Transformer\n(CWT) designed to dynamically adapt the supportset trained classifier's weights\nto each query image in an inductive way.

An\nindispensable part of the health diet is dietary assessment. Traditional manual\nrecording methods are burdensome and contain substantial biases and errors.\nRecent advances in Artificial Intelligence, especially computer vision\ntechnologies, have made it possible to develop automatic dietary assessment\nsolutions, which are more convenient, less time-consuming and even more\naccurate to monitor daily food intake.\n\nScope and approach: This review presents one unified Vision-Based Dietary\nAssessment (VBDA) framework, which generally consists of three stages: food\nimage analysis, volume estimation and nutrient derivation. Vision-based food\nanalysis methods, including food recognition, detection and segmentation, are\nsystematically summarized, and methods of volume estimation and nutrient\nderivation are also given. The prosperity of deep learning makes VBDA gradually\nmove to an end-to-end implementation, which applies food images to a single\nnetwork to directly estimate the nutrition. The recently proposed end-to-end\nmethods are also discussed. We further analyze existing dietary assessment\ndatasets, indicating that one large-scale benchmark is urgently needed, and\nfinally highlight key challenges and future trends for VBDA.\n\nKey findings and conclusions: After thorough exploration, we find that\nmulti-task end-to-end deep learning approaches are one important trend of VBDA.\nDespite considerable research progress, many challenges remain for VBDA due to\nthe meal complexity. We also provide the latest ideas for future development of\nVBDA, e.g., fine-grained food analysis and accurate volume estimation. This\nsurvey aims to encourage researchers to propose more practical solutions for\nVBDA.",

          "description": "Colonoscopy is a standard imaging tool for visualizing the entire\ngastrointestinal (GI) tract of patients to capture lesion areas. However, it\ntakes the clinicians excessive time to review a large number of images\nextracted from colonoscopy videos. Thus, automatic detection of biological\nanatomical landmarks within the colon is highly demanded, which can help reduce\nthe burden of clinicians by providing guidance information for the locations of\nlesion areas. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach\nto detect biological anatomical landmarks in colonoscopy videos. First, raw\ncolonoscopy video sequences are pre-processed to reject interference frames.\nSecond, a ResNet-101 based network is used to detect three biological\nanatomical landmarks separately to obtain the intermediate detection results.\nThird, to achieve more reliable localization of the landmark periods within the\nwhole video period, we propose to post-process the intermediate detection\nresults by identifying the incorrectly predicted frames based on their temporal\ndistribution and reassigning them back to the correct class. Finally, the\naverage detection accuracy reaches 99.75\\%. Meanwhile, the average IoU of 0.91\nshows a high degree of similarity between our predicted landmark periods and\nground truth. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is\ncapable of accurately detecting and localizing biological anatomical landmarks\nfrom colonoscopy videos.",

One severe limitation of the technique is that it can capture\nonly sparse shape, but not high frequency shapes, because certain area of\nprojection pattern is required to encode spatial information. In this paper, we\npropose a technique to recover high-frequency shapes by using shading\ninformation, which is captured by one-shot RGB-D sensor based on structured\nlight with single camera. Since color image comprises shading information of\nobject surface, high-frequency shapes can be recovered by shape from shading\ntechniques. Although multiple images with different lighting positions are\nrequired for shape from shading techniques, we propose a learning based\napproach to recover shape from a single image. In addition, to overcome the\nproblem of preparing sufficient amount of data for training, we propose a new\ndata augmentation method for high-frequency shapes using synthetic data and\ndomain adaptation.

The architecture consists of two back-to-back\nconditional GAN deep neural networks: the first generator network generates 2D\ndepth images based on raw radar intensity data, and the second generator\nnetwork outputs 3D point clouds based on the results of the first generator.\nThe architecture exploits both convolutional neural network's convolutional\noperation (that extracts local structure neighborhood information) and the\nefficiency and detailed geometry capture capability of point clouds (other than\ncostly voxelization of 3D space or distance fields).

In this setting, the source domain data are labelled, but with\nfew-shot per category, while the target domain data are unlabelled. To address\nthe FS-UDA setting, we develop a general UDA model to solve the following two\nkey issues: the few-shot labeled data per category and the domain adaptation\nbetween support and query sets. Our model is general in that once trained it\nwill be able to be applied to various FS-UDA tasks from the same source and\ntarget domains. Inspired by the recent local descriptor based few-shot learning\n(FSL), our general UDA model is fully built upon local descriptors (LDs) for\nimage classification and domain adaptation. By proposing a novel concept called\nsimilarity patterns (SPs), our model not only effectively considers the spatial\nrelationship of LDs that was ignored in previous FSL methods, but also makes\nthe learned image similarity better serve the required domain alignment.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel IMage-to-class sparse Similarity Encoding\n(IMSE) method. It learns SPs to extract the local discriminative information\nfor classification and meanwhile aligns the covariance matrix of the SPs for\ndomain adaptation. Also, domain adversarial training and multi-scale local\nfeature matching are performed upon LDs.

          "description": "Existing domain adaptation methods for crowd counting view each crowd image\nas a whole and reduce domain discrepancies on crowds and backgrounds\nsimultaneously. However, we argue that these methods are suboptimal, as crowds\nand backgrounds have quite different characteristics and backgrounds may vary\ndramatically in different crowd scenes (see Fig.~\\ref{teaser}). This makes\ncrowds not well aligned across domains together with backgrounds in a holistic\nmanner. To this end, we propose to untangle crowds and backgrounds from crowd\nimages and design fine-grained domain adaption methods for crowd counting.\nDifferent from other tasks which possess region-based fine-grained annotations\n(e.g., segments or bounding boxes), crowd counting only annotates one point on\neach human head, which impedes the implementation of fine-grained adaptation\nmethods. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective schema to learn\ncrowd segmentation from point-level crowd counting annotations in the context\nof Multiple Instance Learning. We further leverage the derived segments to\npropose a crowd-aware fine-grained domain adaptation framework for crowd\ncounting, which consists of two novel adaptation modules, i.e., Crowd Region\nTransfer (CRT) and Crowd Density Alignment (CDA). Specifically, the CRT module\nis designed to guide crowd features transfer across domains beyond background\ndistractions, and the CDA module dedicates to constraining the target-domain\ncrowd density distributions.

          "description": "Semantic segmentation of medical images is an essential first step in\ncomputer-aided diagnosis systems for many applications. However, given many\ndisparate imaging modalities and inherent variations in the patient data, it is\ndifficult to consistently achieve high accuracy using modern deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs). This has led researchers to propose interactive image\nsegmentation techniques where a medical expert can interactively correct the\noutput of a DNN to the desired accuracy. However, these techniques often need\nseparate training data with the associated human interactions, and do not\ngeneralize to various diseases, and types of medical images. In this paper, we\nsuggest a novel conditional inference technique for DNNs which takes the\nintervention by a medical expert as test time constraints and performs\ninference conditioned upon these constraints. Our technique is generic can be\nused for medical images from any modality. Unlike other methods, our approach\ncan correct multiple structures simultaneously and add structures missed at\ninitial segmentation. We report an improvement of 13.3, 12.5, 17.8, 10.2, and\n12.4 times in user annotation time than full human annotation for the nucleus,\nmultiple cells, liver and tumor, organ, and brain segmentation respectively. We\nreport a time saving of 2.8, 3.0, 1.9, 4.4, and 8.6 fold compared to other\ninteractive segmentation techniques. Our method can be useful to clinicians for\ndiagnosis and post-surgical follow-up with minimal intervention from the\nmedical expert.

CLIP also allows its users to\nflexibly specify image classification classes in natural language, which we\nfind can shift how biases manifest. Additionally, through some preliminary\nprobes we find that CLIP can inherit biases found in prior computer vision\nsystems. Given the wide and unpredictable domain of uses for such models, this\nraises questions regarding what sufficiently safe behaviour for such systems\nmay look like. These results add evidence to the growing body of work calling\nfor a change in the notion of a 'better' model--to move beyond simply looking\nat higher accuracy at task-oriented capability evaluations, and towards a\nbroader 'better' that takes into account deployment-critical features such as\ndifferent use contexts, and people who interact with the model when thinking\nabout model deployment.",

Due to the complexity of content and layout in\nVRDs, structured text understanding has been a challenging task. Most existing\nstudies decoupled this problem into two sub-tasks: entity labeling and entity\nlinking, which require an entire understanding of the context of documents at\nboth token and segment levels. However, little work has been concerned with the\nsolutions that efficiently extract the structured data from different levels.\nThis paper proposes a unified framework named StrucTexT, which is flexible and\neffective for handling both sub-tasks. Specifically, based on the transformer,\nwe introduce a segment-token aligned encoder to deal with the entity labeling\nand entity linking tasks at different levels of granularity. Moreover, we\ndesign a novel pre-training strategy with three self-supervised tasks to learn\na richer representation. StrucTexT uses the existing Masked Visual Language\nModeling task and the new Sentence Length Prediction and Paired Boxes Direction\ntasks to incorporate the multi-modal information across text, image, and\nlayout. We evaluate our method for structured text understanding at\nsegment-level and token-level and show it outperforms the state-of-the-art\ncounterparts with significantly superior performance on the FUNSD, SROIE, and\nEPHOIE datasets.",

          "description": "The growing number of action classes has posed a new challenge for video\nunderstanding, making Zero-Shot Action Recognition (ZSAR) a thriving direction.\nThe ZSAR task aims to recognize target (unseen) actions without training\nexamples by leveraging semantic representations to bridge seen and unseen\nactions. However, due to the complexity and diversity of actions, it remains\nchallenging to semantically represent action classes and transfer knowledge\nfrom seen data. In this work, we propose an ER-enhanced ZSAR model inspired by\nan effective human memory technique Elaborative Rehearsal (ER), which involves\nelaborating a new concept and relating it to known concepts. Specifically, we\nexpand each action class as an Elaborative Description (ED) sentence, which is\nmore discriminative than a class name and less costly than manual-defined\nattributes. Besides directly aligning class semantics with videos, we\nincorporate objects from the video as Elaborative Concepts (EC) to improve\nvideo semantics and generalization from seen actions to unseen actions. Our\nER-enhanced ZSAR model achieves state-of-the-art results on three existing\nbenchmarks. Moreover, we propose a new ZSAR evaluation protocol on the Kinetics\ndataset to overcome limitations of current benchmarks and demonstrate the first\ncase where ZSAR performance is comparable to few-shot learning baselines on\nthis more realistic setting.

          "description": "In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous\ndriving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may\ncompromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have\ndemonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in\ndetection precision of deep learning-based 3D object detection models. Although\ndriving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no\ncomprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning\nmodels and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial\nattacks, perturbation attacks and patch attacks, on the driving safety of\nvision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep\nlearning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in\nvision-based 3D object detection, Stereo R-CNN and DSGN. To evaluate driving\nsafety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving\nsafety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive\nevaluation experiments, we find that (1) the attack's impact on the driving\nsafety of autonomous vehicles and the attack's impact on the precision of 3D\nobject detectors are decoupled, and (2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger\nrobustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we\nfurther investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study.\nThe findings of this paper provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial\nattacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.",

The goal is to learn a robust model from a\nsingle source and expect it to generalize over many unknown distributions.

In this paper, we propose uncertainty-guided domain\ngeneralization to tackle the aforementioned limitations.

          "description": "Transfer learning allows the reuse of deep learning features on new datasets\nwith limited data. However, the resulting models could be unnecessarily large\nand thus inefficient. Although network pruning can be applied to improve\ninference efficiency, existing algorithms usually require fine-tuning and may\nnot be suitable for small datasets. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that\ntransforms the convolutional weights into the subspaces of orthonormal bases\nwhere a model is pruned. Using singular value decomposition, we decompose a\nconvolutional layer into two layers: a convolutional layer with the orthonormal\nbasis vectors as the filters, and a layer that we name \"BasisScalingConv\",\nwhich is responsible for rescaling the features and transforming them back to\nthe original space. As the filters in each transformed layer are linearly\nindependent with known relative importance, pruning can be more effective and\nstable, and fine tuning individual weights is unnecessary. Furthermore, as the\nnumbers of input and output channels of the original convolutional layer remain\nunchanged, basis pruning is applicable to virtually all network architectures.\nBasis pruning can also be combined with existing pruning algorithms for double\npruning to further increase the pruning capability. With less than 1% reduction\nin the classification accuracy, we can achieve pruning ratios up to 98.9% in\nparameters and 98.6% in FLOPs.",

Despite their remarkable performance, these\nmethods make a prior assumption that the low-resolution video is obtained by\ndown-scaling the high-resolution video using a known degradation kernel, which\ndoes not hold in practical settings. Another problem with these methods is that\nthey cannot exploit instance-specific internal information of video at testing\ntime.

          "description": "A lifespan face synthesis (LFS) model aims to generate a set of\nphoto-realistic face images of a person's whole life, given only one snapshot\nas reference. The generated face image given a target age code is expected to\nbe age-sensitive reflected by bio-plausible transformations of shape and\ntexture, while being identity preserving. This is extremely challenging because\nthe shape and texture characteristics of a face undergo separate and highly\nnonlinear transformations w.r.t. age. Most recent LFS models are based on\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) whereby age code conditional\ntransformations are applied to a latent face representation. They benefit\ngreatly from the recent advancements of GANs. However, without explicitly\ndisentangling their latent representations into the texture, shape and identity\nfactors, they are fundamentally limited in modeling the nonlinear age-related\ntransformation on texture and shape whilst preserving identity. In this work, a\nnovel LFS model is proposed to disentangle the key face characteristics\nincluding shape, texture and identity so that the unique shape and texture age\ntransformations can be modeled effectively. This is achieved by extracting\nshape, texture and identity features separately from an encoder. Critically,\ntwo transformation modules, one conditional convolution based and the other\nchannel attention based, are designed for modeling the nonlinear shape and\ntexture feature transformations respectively. This is to accommodate their\nrather distinct aging processes and ensure that our synthesized images are both\nage-sensitive and identity preserving. Extensive experiments show that our LFS\nmodel is clearly superior to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

          "description": "In this paper, we present a case study that performs an unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) based fine-scale 3D change detection and monitoring of\nprogressive collapse performance of a building during a demolition event.\nMulti-temporal oblique photogrammetry images are collected with 3D point clouds\ngenerated at different stages of the demolition. The geometric accuracy of the\ngenerated point clouds has been evaluated against both airborne and terrestrial\nLiDAR point clouds, achieving an average distance of 12 cm and 16 cm for roof\nand facade respectively. We propose a hierarchical volumetric change detection\nframework that unifies multi-temporal UAV images for pose estimation (free of\nground control points), reconstruction, and a coarse-to-fine 3D density change\nanalysis. This work has provided a solution capable of addressing change\ndetection on full 3D time-series datasets where dramatic scene content changes\nare presented progressively. Our change detection results on the building\ndemolition event have been evaluated against the manually marked ground-truth\nchanges and have achieved an F-1 score varying from 0.78 to 0.92, with\nconsistently high precision (0.92 - 0.99). Volumetric changes through the\ndemolition progress are derived from change detection and have shown to\nfavorably reflect the qualitative and quantitative building demolition\nprogression.",

Automated segmentation of fundus\nphotographs would improve the quality, capacity, and cost-effectiveness of eye\ncare screening programs.

To overcome these limitations, we utilized\ncontrastive self-supervised learning to exploit the large variety of unlabeled\nfundus images in the publicly available EyePACS dataset. We pre-trained an\nencoder of a U-Net, which we later fine-tuned on several retinal vessel and\nlesion segmentation datasets.

Furthermore, when fine-tuned on a downstream blood vessel\nsegmentation task, such pre-trained networks achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on images from different datasets.

          "description": "Human-robot collaboration is an essential research topic in artificial\nintelligence (AI), enabling researchers to devise cognitive AI systems and\naffords an intuitive means for users to interact with the robot. Of note,\ncommunication plays a central role. To date, prior studies in embodied agent\nnavigation have only demonstrated that human languages facilitate communication\nby instructions in natural languages. Nevertheless, a plethora of other forms\nof communication is left unexplored. In fact, human communication originated in\ngestures and oftentimes is delivered through multimodal cues, e.g. \"go there\"\nwith a pointing gesture. To bridge the gap and fill in the missing dimension of\ncommunication in embodied agent navigation, we propose investigating the\neffects of using gestures as the communicative interface instead of verbal\ncues. Specifically, we develop a VR-based 3D simulation environment, named\nGes-THOR, based on AI2-THOR platform. In this virtual environment, a human\nplayer is placed in the same virtual scene and shepherds the artificial agent\nusing only gestures. The agent is tasked to solve the navigation problem guided\nby natural gestures with unknown semantics; we do not use any predefined\ngestures due to the diversity and versatile nature of human gestures. We argue\nthat learning the semantics of natural gestures is mutually beneficial to\nlearning the navigation task--learn to communicate and communicate to learn. In\na series of experiments, we demonstrate that human gesture cues, even without\npredefined semantics, improve the object-goal navigation for an embodied agent,\noutperforming various state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "With the rapid development of smart mobile devices, the car-hailing platforms\n(e.g., Uber or Lyft) have attracted much attention from both the academia and\nthe industry. In this paper, we consider an important dynamic car-hailing\nproblem, namely \\textit{maximum revenue vehicle dispatching} (MRVD), in which\nrider requests dynamically arrive and drivers need to serve as many riders as\npossible such that the entire revenue of the platform is maximized. We prove\nthat the MRVD problem is NP-hard and intractable. In addition, the dynamic\ncar-hailing platforms have no information of the future riders, which makes the\nproblem even harder. To handle the MRVD problem, we propose a queueing-based\nvehicle dispatching framework, which first uses existing machine learning\nalgorithms to predict the future vehicle demand of each region, then estimates\nthe idle time periods of drivers through a queueing model for each region. With\nthe information of the predicted vehicle demands and estimated idle time\nperiods of drivers, we propose two batch-based vehicle dispatching algorithms\nto efficiently assign suitable drivers to riders such that the expected overall\nrevenue of the platform is maximized during each batch processing. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our\nproposed approaches over both real and synthetic datasets.",

More precisely, we propose a critical embedding such that any\ncritical point, e.g., local or global minima, of a narrower DNN can be embedded\nto a critical point/hyperplane of the target DNN with higher degeneracy and\npreserving the DNN output function. The embedding structure of critical points\nis independent of loss function and training data, showing a stark difference\nfrom other nonconvex problems such as protein-folding. Empirically, we find\nthat a wide DNN is often attracted by highly-degenerate critical points that\nare embedded from narrow DNNs.

However, the signature-based approach\ncannot effectively discover novel and unknown suspicious emails that utilize\nvarious hot topics at present, such as COVID-19 and US election. To address the\nproblem, in this paper, we present Holmes, an efficient and lightweight\nsemantic based engine for anomalous email detection. Holmes can convert each\nevent log of email to a sentence through word embedding then extract\ninteresting items among them by novelty detection. Based on our observations,\nwe claim that, in an enterprise environment, there is a stable relation between\nsenders and receivers, but suspicious emails are commonly from unusual sources,\nwhich can be detected through the rareness selection. We evaluate the\nperformance of Holmes in a real-world enterprise environment, in which it sends\nand receives around 5,000 emails each day. As a result, Holmes can achieve a\nhigh detection rate (output around 200 suspicious emails per day) and maintain\na low false alarm rate for anomaly detection.",

          "description": "In the past decade, contextual bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms\nhave been successfully used in various interactive learning systems such as\nonline advertising, recommender systems, and dynamic pricing. However, they\nhave yet to be widely adopted in high-stakes application domains, such as\nhealthcare. One reason may be that existing approaches assume that the\nunderlying mechanisms are static in the sense that they do not change over\ndifferent environments. In many real world systems, however, the mechanisms are\nsubject to shifts across environments which may invalidate the static\nenvironment assumption. In this paper, we tackle the problem of environmental\nshifts under the framework of offline contextual bandits. We view the\nenvironmental shift problem through the lens of causality and propose\nmulti-environment contextual bandits that allow for changes in the underlying\nmechanisms. We adopt the concept of invariance from the causality literature\nand introduce the notion of policy invariance. We argue that policy invariance\nis only relevant if unobserved confounders are present and show that, in that\ncase, an optimal invariant policy is guaranteed to generalize across\nenvironments under suitable assumptions. Our results may be a first step\ntowards solving the environmental shift problem. They also establish concrete\nconnections among causality, invariance and contextual bandits.",

          "description": "Persistence diagrams have been widely used to quantify the underlying\nfeatures of filtered topological spaces in data visualization. In many\napplications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however,\ncomputing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost.\nIn this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a\nbinary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast\ncomputation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning\nprocess. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into\nbinary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training\nof this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from\nsynthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is\ndirectly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the\nmodel. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better\nmaintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other\nvectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to\nthe problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of\nour approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of\nour approach on a dataset with 10k persistence diagrams, which is not possible\nwith current techniques. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that\nour method is significantly faster with the potential of less memory usage,\nwhile retaining comparable or better quality comparisons.",

          "description": "The control variates (CV) method is widely used in policy gradient estimation\nto reduce the variance of the gradient estimators in practice. A control\nvariate is applied by subtracting a baseline function from the state-action\nvalue estimates. Then the variance-reduced policy gradient presumably leads to\nhigher learning efficiency. Recent research on control variates with deep\nneural net policies mainly focuses on scalar-valued baseline functions. The\neffect of vector-valued baselines is under-explored. This paper investigates\nvariance reduction with coordinate-wise and layer-wise control variates\nconstructed from vector-valued baselines for neural net policies. We present\nexperimental evidence suggesting that lower variance can be obtained with such\nbaselines than with the conventional scalar-valued baseline. We demonstrate how\nto equip the popular Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with these\nnew control variates.

          "description": "Medical images, especially volumetric images, are of high resolution and\noften exceed the capacity of standard desktop GPUs. As a result, most deep\nlearning-based medical image analysis tasks require the input images to be\ndownsampled, often substantially, before these can be fed to a neural network.\nHowever, downsampling can lead to a loss of image quality, which is undesirable\nespecially in reconstruction tasks, where the fine geometric details need to be\npreserved. In this paper, we propose that high-resolution images can be\nreconstructed in a coarse-to-fine fashion, where a deep learning algorithm is\nonly responsible for generating a coarse representation of the image, which\nconsumes moderate GPU memory. For producing the high-resolution outcome, we\npropose two novel methods: learned voxel rearrangement of the coarse output and\nhierarchical image synthesis. Compared to the coarse output, the\nhigh-resolution counterpart allows for smooth surface triangulation, which can\nbe 3D-printed in the highest possible quality. Experiments of this paper are\ncarried out on the dataset of AutoImplant 2021\n(https://autoimplant2021.grand-challenge.org/), a MICCAI challenge on cranial\nimplant design.

The so-called input forgetting property is identified as the\nkey hypothesis that guarantees the existence and uniqueness (up to system\nisomorphisms) of canonical realizations for causal and time-invariant\ninput/output systems with semi-infinite inputs. Additionally, the notion of\noptimal reduction coming from the theory of symmetric Hamiltonian systems is\nimplemented in our setup to construct canonical realizations out of input\nforgetting but not necessarily canonical ones. These two procedures are studied\nin detail in the framework of linear fading memory input/output systems.\nFinally, the notion of implicit reduction using reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspaces (RKHS) is introduced which allows, for systems with linear readouts, to\nachieve dimension reduction without the need to actually compute the reduced\nspaces introduced in the first part of the paper.",

However, the accuracy\nof these approaches heavily depends on their used bug reports. A significant\nnumber of bug reports contain only plain natural language texts. According to\nexisting studies, IR-based approaches cannot perform well when they use these\nbug reports as search queries. On the other hand, there is a piece of recent\nevidence that suggests that even these natural language-only reports contain\nenough good keywords that could help localize the bugs successfully. On one\nhand, these findings suggest that natural language-only bug reports might be a\nsufficient source for good query keywords. On the other hand, they cast serious\ndoubt on the query selection practices in the IR-based bug localization. In\nthis article, we attempted to clear the sky on this aspect by conducting an\nin-depth empirical study that critically examines the state-of-the-art query\nselection practices in IR-based bug localization. In particular, we use a\ndataset of 2,320 bug reports, employ ten existing approaches from the\nliterature, exploit the Genetic Algorithm-based approach to construct optimal,\nnear-optimal search queries from these bug reports, and then answer three\nresearch questions. We confirmed that the state-of-the-art query construction\napproaches are indeed not sufficient for constructing appropriate queries (for\nbug localization) from certain natural language-only bug reports although they\ncontain such queries. We also demonstrate that optimal queries and non-optimal\nqueries chosen from bug report texts are significantly different in terms of\nseveral keyword characteristics, which has led us to actionable insights.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate 27%--34% improvement in the performance of\nnon-optimal queries through the application of our actionable insights to them.",

          "description": "In many domains, data measurements can naturally be associated with the\nleaves of a tree, expressing the relationships among these measurements. For\nexample, companies belong to industries, which in turn belong to ever coarser\ndivisions such as sectors; microbes are commonly arranged in a taxonomic\nhierarchy from species to kingdoms; street blocks belong to neighborhoods,\nwhich in turn belong to larger-scale regions. The problem of tree-based\naggregation that we consider in this paper asks which of these tree-defined\nsubgroups of leaves should really be treated as a single entity and which of\nthese entities should be distinguished from each other.\n\nWe introduce the \"false split rate\", an error measure that describes the\ndegree to which subgroups have been split when they should not have been. We\nthen propose a multiple hypothesis testing algorithm for tree-based\naggregation, which we prove controls this error measure. We focus on two main\nexamples of tree-based aggregation, one which involves aggregating means and\nthe other which involves aggregating regression coefficients. We apply this\nmethodology to aggregate stocks based on their volatility and to aggregate\nneighborhoods of New York City based on taxi fares.",

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated superior capability\nof tackling graph analytical problems in various applications. Nevertheless,\nwith the wide-spreading practice of GNNs in high-stake decision-making\nprocesses, there is an increasing societal concern that GNNs could make\ndiscriminatory decisions that may be illegal towards certain demographic\ngroups. Although some explorations have been made towards developing fair GNNs,\nexisting approaches are tailored for a specific GNN model. However, in\npractical scenarios, myriads of GNN variants have been proposed for different\ntasks, and it is costly to train and fine-tune existing debiasing models for\ndifferent GNNs. Also, bias in a trained model could originate from training\ndata, while how to mitigate bias in the graph data is usually overlooked. In\nthis work, different from existing work, we first propose novel definitions and\nmetrics to measure the bias in an attributed network, which leads to the\noptimization objective to mitigate bias. Based on the optimization objective,\nwe develop a framework named EDITS to mitigate the bias in attributed networks\nwhile preserving useful information. EDITS works in a model-agnostic manner,\nwhich means that it is independent of the specific GNNs applied for downstream\ntasks. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the validity of the proposed bias metrics and the superiority of\nEDITS on both bias mitigation and utility maintenance.

          "description": "Cardinality estimation is a fundamental but long unresolved problem in query\noptimization. Recently, multiple papers from different research groups\nconsistently report that learned models have the potential to replace existing\ncardinality estimators. In this paper, we ask a forward-thinking question: Are\nwe ready to deploy these learned cardinality models in production? Our study\nconsists of three main parts. Firstly, we focus on the static environment\n(i.e., no data updates) and compare five new learned methods with eight\ntraditional methods on four real-world datasets under a unified workload\nsetting. The results show that learned models are indeed more accurate than\ntraditional methods, but they often suffer from high training and inference\ncosts. Secondly, we explore whether these learned models are ready for dynamic\nenvironments (i.e., frequent data updates). We find that they cannot catch up\nwith fast data up-dates and return large errors for different reasons. For less\nfrequent updates, they can perform better but there is no clear winner among\nthemselves. Thirdly, we take a deeper look into learned models and explore when\nthey may go wrong. Our results show that the performance of learned methods can\nbe greatly affected by the changes in correlation, skewness, or domain size.\nMore importantly, their behaviors are much harder to interpret and often\nunpredictable. Based on these findings, we identify two promising research\ndirections (control the cost of learned models and make learned models\ntrustworthy) and suggest a number of research opportunities. We hope that our\nstudy can guide researchers and practitioners to work together to eventually\npush learned cardinality estimators into real database systems.",

Based on that analogy, we propose a new class\nof methods exploiting any plausible modular bound.

          "description": "Detecting drift in performance of Machine Learning (ML) models is an\nacknowledged challenge. For ML models to become an integral part of business\napplications it is essential to detect when an ML model drifts away from\nacceptable operation. However, it is often the case that actual labels are\ndifficult and expensive to get, for example, because they require expert\njudgment. Therefore, there is a need for methods that detect likely degradation\nin ML operation without labels. We propose a method that utilizes feature space\nrules, called data slices, for drift detection. We provide experimental\nindications that our method is likely to identify that the ML model will likely\nchange in performance, based on changes in the underlying data.",

          "description": "Algorithmic fairness has aroused considerable interests in data mining and\nmachine learning communities recently. So far the existing research has been\nmostly focusing on the development of quantitative metrics to measure algorithm\ndisparities across different protected groups, and approaches for adjusting the\nalgorithm output to reduce such disparities. In this paper, we propose to study\nthe problem of identification of the source of model disparities. Unlike\nexisting interpretation methods which typically learn feature importance, we\nconsider the causal relationships among feature variables and propose a novel\nframework to decompose the disparity into the sum of contributions from\nfairness-aware causal paths, which are paths linking the sensitive attribute\nand the final predictions, on the graph. We also consider the scenario when the\ndirections on certain edges within those paths cannot be determined. Our\nframework is also model agnostic and applicable to a variety of quantitative\ndisparity measures. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data\nsets are provided to show that our method can provide precise and comprehensive\nexplanations to the model disparities.",

It\nis a challenging task that has several real-world applications in\nhuman-computer interaction, image-text reference resolution, and video-text\nreference resolution. In the last years, several works have addressed this\nproblem with heavy and complex models that try to capture visual-textual\ndependencies better than before. These models are typically constituted by two\nmain components that focus on how to learn useful multi-modal features for\ngrounding and how to improve the predicted bounding box of the visual mention,\nrespectively. Finding the right learning balance between these two sub-tasks is\nnot easy, and the current models are not necessarily optimal with respect to\nthis issue. In this work, we propose a model that, although using a simple\nmulti-modal feature fusion component, is able to achieve a higher accuracy than\nstate-of-the-art models thanks to the adoption of a more effective loss\nfunction, based on the classes probabilities, that reach, in the considered\ndatasets, a better learning balance between the two sub-tasks mentioned above.",

The growing literature\nnow lists hundreds of optimization methods. In the absence of clear theoretical\nguidance and conclusive empirical evidence, the decision is often made based on\nanecdotes. In this work, we aim to replace these anecdotes, if not with a\nconclusive ranking, then at least with evidence-backed heuristics. To do so, we\nperform an extensive, standardized benchmark of fifteen particularly popular\ndeep learning optimizers while giving a concise overview of the wide range of\npossible choices. Analyzing more than $50,000$ individual runs, we contribute\nthe following three points: (i) Optimizer performance varies greatly across\ntasks. (ii) We observe that evaluating multiple optimizers with default\nparameters works approximately as well as tuning the hyperparameters of a\nsingle, fixed optimizer. (iii) While we cannot discern an optimization method\nclearly dominating across all tested tasks, we identify a significantly reduced\nsubset of specific optimizers and parameter choices that generally lead to\ncompetitive results in our experiments: Adam remains a strong contender, with\nnewer methods failing to significantly and consistently outperform it.

          "description": "Recent progress in scientific visualization has expanded the scope of\nvisualization from being merely a way of presentation to an analysis and\ndiscovery tool. A given visualization result is usually generated by applying a\nseries of transformations or filters to the underlying data. Nowadays, such\nfilters use deterministic algorithms to process the data. In this work, we aim\nat extending this methodology towards data-driven filters, thus filters that\nexpose the abilities of pre-trained machine learning models to the\nvisualization system. The use of such data-driven filters is of particular\ninterest in fields like segmentation, classification, etc., where machine\nlearning models regularly outperform existing algorithmic approaches. To\nshowcase this idea, we couple Paraview, the well-known flow visualization tool,\nwith PyTorch, a deep learning framework. Paraview is extended by plugins that\nallow users to load pre-trained models of their choice in the form of newly\ndeveloped filters. The filters transform the input data by feeding it into the\nmodel and then provide the model's output as input to the remaining\nvisualization pipeline. A series of simplistic use cases for segmentation and\nclassification on image and fluid data is presented to showcase the technical\napplicability of such data-driven transformations in Paraview for future\ncomplex analysis tasks.",

          "description": "Emphatic Temporal Difference (TD) methods are a class of off-policy\nReinforcement Learning (RL) methods involving the use of followon traces.\nDespite the theoretical success of emphatic TD methods in addressing the\nnotorious deadly triad (Sutton and Barto, 2018) of off-policy RL, there are\nstill three open problems. First, the motivation for emphatic TD methods\nproposed by Sutton et al. (2016) does not align with the convergence analysis\nof Yu (2015). Namely, a quantity used by Sutton et al. (2016) that is expected\nto be essential for the convergence of emphatic TD methods is not used in the\nactual convergence analysis of Yu (2015). Second, followon traces typically\nsuffer from large variance, making them hard to use in practice. Third, despite\nthe seminal work of Yu (2015) confirming the asymptotic convergence of some\nemphatic TD methods for prediction problems, there is still no finite sample\nanalysis for any emphatic TD method for prediction, much less control. In this\npaper, we address those three open problems simultaneously via using truncated\nfollowon traces in emphatic TD methods. Unlike the original followon traces,\nwhich depend on all previous history, truncated followon traces depend on only\nfinite history, reducing variance and enabling the finite sample analysis of\nour proposed emphatic TD methods for both prediction and control.",

          "description": "Recently, particle-based variational inference (ParVI) methods have gained\ninterest because they can avoid arbitrary parametric assumptions that are\ncommon in variational inference. However, many ParVI approaches do not allow\narbitrary sampling from the posterior, and the few that do allow such sampling\nsuffer from suboptimality. This work proposes a new method for learning to\napproximately sample from the posterior distribution. We construct a neural\nsampler that is trained with the functional gradient of the KL-divergence\nbetween the empirical sampling distribution and the target distribution,\nassuming the gradient resides within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our\ngenerative ParVI (GPVI) approach maintains the asymptotic performance of ParVI\nmethods while offering the flexibility of a generative sampler. Through\ncarefully constructed experiments, we show that GPVI outperforms previous\ngenerative ParVI methods such as amortized SVGD, and is competitive with ParVI\nas well as gold-standard approaches like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for fitting\nboth exactly known and intractable target distributions.",

          "description": "Neural network (NN) models are increasingly used in scientific simulations,\nAI, and other high performance computing (HPC) fields to extract knowledge from\ndatasets. Each dataset requires tailored NN model architecture, but designing\nstructures by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Neural\narchitecture search (NAS) automates the design of NN architectures. NAS\nattempts to find well-performing NN models for specialized datsets, where\nperformance is measured by key metrics that capture the NN capabilities (e.g.,\naccuracy of classification of samples in a dataset). Existing NAS methods are\nresource intensive, especially when searching for highly accurate models for\nlarger and larger datasets.\n\nTo address this problem, we propose a performance estimation strategy that\nreduces the resources for training NNs and increases NAS throughput without\njeopardizing accuracy. We implement our strategy via an engine called PEng4NN\nthat plugs into existing NAS methods; in doing so, PEng4NN predicts the final\naccuracy of NNs early in the training process, informs the NAS of NN\nperformance, and thus enables the NAS to terminate training NNs early. We\nassess our engine on three diverse datasets (i.e., CIFAR-100, Fashion MNIST,\nand SVHN). By reducing the training epochs needed, our engine achieves\nsubstantial throughput gain; on average, our engine saves 61% to 82% of\ntraining epochs, increasing throughput by a factor of 2.5 to 5 compared to a\nstate-of-the-art NAS method. We achieve this gain without compromising\naccuracy, as we demonstrate with two key outcomes. First, across all our tests,\nbetween 74% and 97% of the ground truth best models lie in our set of predicted\nbest models. Second, the accuracy distributions of the ground truth best models\nand our predicted best models are comparable, with the mean accuracy values\ndiffering by at most .7 percentage points across all tests.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate\nunsupervised machine learning on classifying treatment-resistant phenotypes in\nheterogeneous tumors through analysis of single cell RNA sequencing(scRNAseq)\ndata with a pipeline and evaluation metrics. scRNAseq quantifies mRNA in cells\nand characterizes cell phenotypes. One scRNAseq dataset was analyzed\n(tumor/non-tumor cells of different molecular subtypes and patient\nidentifications). The pipeline consisted of data filtering, dimensionality\nreduction with Principal Component Analysis, projection with Uniform Manifold\nApproximation and Projection, clustering with nine approaches (Ward, BIRCH,\nGaussian Mixture Model, DBSCAN, Spectral, Affinity Propagation, Agglomerative\nClustering, Mean Shift, and K-Means), and evaluation. Seven models divided\ntumor versus non-tumor cells and molecular subtype while six models classified\ndifferent patient identification (13 of which were presented in the dataset);\nK-Means, Ward, and BIRCH often ranked highest with ~80% accuracy on the tumor\nversus non-tumor task and ~60% for molecular subtype and patient ID. An\noptimized classification pipeline using K-Means, Ward, and BIRCH models was\nevaluated to be most effective for further analysis. In clinical research where\nthere is currently no standard protocol for scRNAseq analysis, clusters\ngenerated from this pipeline can be used to understand cancer cell behavior and\nmalignant growth, directly affecting the success of treatment.",

          "description": "The large and still increasing popularity of deep learning clashes with a\nmajor limit of neural network architectures, that consists in their lack of\ncapability in providing human-understandable motivations of their decisions. In\nsituations in which the machine is expected to support the decision of human\nexperts, providing a comprehensible explanation is a feature of crucial\nimportance. The language used to communicate the explanations must be formal\nenough to be implementable in a machine and friendly enough to be\nunderstandable by a wide audience. In this paper, we propose a general approach\nto Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the case of neural architectures,\nshowing how a mindful design of the networks leads to a family of interpretable\ndeep learning models called Logic Explained Networks (LENs). LENs only require\ntheir inputs to be human-understandable predicates, and they provide\nexplanations in terms of simple First-Order Logic (FOL) formulas involving such\npredicates. LENs are general enough to cover a large number of scenarios.\nAmongst them, we consider the case in which LENs are directly used as special\nclassifiers with the capability of being explainable, or when they act as\nadditional networks with the role of creating the conditions for making a\nblack-box classifier explainable by FOL formulas. Despite supervised learning\nproblems are mostly emphasized, we also show that LENs can learn and provide\nexplanations in unsupervised learning settings. Experimental results on several\ndatasets and tasks show that LENs may yield better classifications than\nestablished white-box models, such as decision trees and Bayesian rule lists,\nwhile providing more compact and meaningful explanations.",

However, this progress could not\nshow any promises for fine-grained tasks such as Head Pose estimation. In this\narticle, we have tried to answer a question: How SSL can be used for Head Pose\nestimation? In general, there are two main approaches to use SSL: 1. Using\npre-trained weights which can be done via weights pre-training on ImageNet or\nvia SSL tasks. 2. Leveraging SSL as an auxiliary co-training task besides of\nSupervised Learning (SL) tasks at the same time. In this study, modified\nversions of jigsaw puzzling and rotation as SSL pre-text tasks are used and the\nbest architecture for our proposed Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL) is found.\nFinally, the HopeNet method as a baseline is selected and the impact of SSL\npre-training and ImageNet pre-training on both HMTL and SL are compared. The\nerror rate reduced by the HTML method up to 11% compare to the SL. Moreover,\nHMTL method showed that it was good with all kinds of initial weights: random,\nImageNet and SSL pre-training weights. Also, it was observed, when puzzled\nimages are used for SL alone, the average error rate placed between SL and HMTL\nwhich showed the importance of local spatial features compare to global spatial\nfeatures.",

          "description": "In the era of intelligent transportation, driver behavior profiling has\nbecome a beneficial technology as it provides knowledge regarding the driver's\naggressiveness. Previous approaches achieved promising driver behavior\nprofiling performance through establishing statistical heuristics rules or\nsupervised learning-based models. Still, there exist limits that the\npractitioner should prepare a labeled dataset, and prior approaches could not\nclassify aggressive behaviors which are not known a priori. In pursuit of\nimproving the aforementioned drawbacks, we propose a novel approach to driver\nbehavior profiling leveraging an unsupervised learning paradigm. First, we cast\nthe driver behavior profiling problem as anomaly detection. Second, we\nestablished recurrent neural networks that predict the next feature vector\ngiven a sequence of feature vectors. We trained the model with normal driver\ndata only. As a result, our model yields high regression error given a sequence\nof aggressive driver behavior and low error given at a sequence of normal\ndriver behavior. We figured this difference of error between normal and\naggressive driver behavior can be an adequate flag for driver behavior\nprofiling and accomplished a precise performance in experiments. Lastly, we\nfurther analyzed the optimal level of sequence length for identifying each\naggressive driver behavior. We expect the proposed approach to be a useful\nbaseline for unsupervised driver behavior profiling and contribute to the\nefficient, intelligent transportation ecosystem.",

          "description": "Adversarial patch attack against image classification deep neural networks\n(DNNs), in which the attacker can inject arbitrary distortions within a bounded\nregion of an image, is able to generate adversarial perturbations that are\nrobust (i.e., remain adversarial in physical world) and universal (i.e., remain\nadversarial on any input). It is thus important to detect and mitigate such\nattack to ensure the security of DNNs.\n\nThis work proposes Jujutsu, a technique to detect and mitigate robust and\nuniversal adversarial patch attack. Jujutsu leverages the universal property of\nthe patch attack for detection. It uses explainable AI technique to identify\nsuspicious features that are potentially malicious, and verify their\nmaliciousness by transplanting the suspicious features to new images. An\nadversarial patch continues to exhibit the malicious behavior on the new images\nand thus can be detected based on prediction consistency. Jujutsu leverages the\nlocalized nature of the patch attack for mitigation, by randomly masking the\nsuspicious features to \"remove\" adversarial perturbations. However, the network\nmight fail to classify the images as some of the contents are removed (masked).\nTherefore, Jujutsu uses image inpainting for synthesizing alternative contents\nfrom the pixels that are masked, which can reconstruct the \"clean\" image for\ncorrect prediction. We evaluate Jujutsu on five DNNs on two datasets, and show\nthat Jujutsu achieves superior performance and significantly outperforms\nexisting techniques. Jujutsu can further defend against various variants of the\nbasic attack, including 1) physical-world attack; 2) attacks that target\ndiverse classes; 3) attacks that use patches in different shapes and 4)\nadaptive attacks.",

Existing studies on unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) can\nbe generalized into two families-algorithms that attain unbiasedness with\nlogged data, offline learning, and algorithms that achieve unbiasedness by\nestimating unbiased parameters with real-time user interactions, namely online\nlearning. While there exist many algorithms from both families, there lacks a\nunified way to compare and benchmark them. As a result, it can be challenging\nfor researchers to choose the right technique for their problems or for people\nwho are new to the field to learn and understand existing algorithms. To solve\nthis problem, we introduced ULTRA, which is a flexible, extensible, and easily\nconfigure ULTR toolbox. Its key features include support for multiple ULTR\nalgorithms with configurable hyperparameters, a variety of built-in click\nmodels that can be used separately to simulate clicks, different ranking model\narchitecture and evaluation metrics, and simple learning to rank pipeline\ncreation. In this paper, we discuss the general framework of ULTR, briefly\ndescribe the algorithms in ULTRA, detailed the structure, and pipeline of the\ntoolbox.

          "description": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) watermarking is a method for provenance\nverification of DNN models. Watermarking should be robust against watermark\nremoval attacks that derive a surrogate model that evades provenance\nverification. Many watermarking schemes that claim robustness have been\nproposed, but their robustness is only validated in isolation against a\nrelatively small set of attacks. There is no systematic, empirical evaluation\nof these claims against a common, comprehensive set of removal attacks. This\nuncertainty about a watermarking scheme's robustness causes difficulty to trust\ntheir deployment in practice. In this paper, we evaluate whether recently\nproposed watermarking schemes that claim robustness are robust against a large\nset of removal attacks. We survey methods from the literature that (i) are\nknown removal attacks, (ii) derive surrogate models but have not been evaluated\nas removal attacks, and (iii) novel removal attacks. Weight shifting and smooth\nretraining are novel removal attacks adapted to the DNN watermarking schemes\nsurveyed in this paper. We propose taxonomies for watermarking schemes and\nremoval attacks. Our empirical evaluation includes an ablation study over sets\nof parameters for each attack and watermarking scheme on the CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet datasets. Surprisingly, none of the surveyed watermarking schemes is\nrobust in practice. We find that schemes fail to withstand adaptive attacks and\nknown methods for deriving surrogate models that have not been evaluated as\nremoval attacks. This points to intrinsic flaws in how robustness is currently\nevaluated. We show that watermarking schemes need to be evaluated against a\nmore extensive set of removal attacks with a more realistic adversary model.\nOur source code and a complete dataset of evaluation results are publicly\navailable, which allows to independently verify our conclusions.",

          "description": "Universal adversarial attacks, which hinder most deep neural network (DNN)\ntasks using only a small single perturbation called a universal adversarial\nperturbation (UAP), is a realistic security threat to the practical application\nof a DNN. In particular, such attacks cause serious problems in medical\nimaging. Given that computer-based systems are generally operated under a\nblack-box condition in which only queries on inputs are allowed and outputs are\naccessible, the impact of UAPs seems to be limited because well-used algorithms\nfor generating UAPs are limited to a white-box condition in which adversaries\ncan access the model weights and loss gradients. Nevertheless, we demonstrate\nthat UAPs are easily generatable using a relatively small dataset under\nblack-box conditions. In particular, we propose a method for generating UAPs\nusing a simple hill-climbing search based only on DNN outputs and demonstrate\nthe validity of the proposed method using representative DNN-based medical\nimage classifications. Black-box UAPs can be used to conduct both non-targeted\nand targeted attacks. Overall, the black-box UAPs showed high attack success\nrates (40% to 90%), although some of them had relatively low success rates\nbecause the method only utilizes limited information to generate UAPs. The\nvulnerability of black-box UAPs was observed in several model architectures.\nThe results indicate that adversaries can also generate UAPs through a simple\nprocedure under the black-box condition to foil or control DNN-based medical\nimage diagnoses, and that UAPs are a more realistic security threat.",

The strong discrimination ability on the source dataset does\nnot necessarily translate to high classification accuracy on the target\ndataset. In this work, we address this cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL)\nproblem by boosting the generalization capability of the model. Specifically,\nwe teach the model to capture broader variations of the feature distributions\nwith a novel noise-enhanced supervised autoencoder (NSAE).

Theoretical analysis based on intra-class\ncorrelation (ICC) shows that the feature embeddings learned from NSAE have\nstronger discrimination and generalization abilities in the target domain. We\nalso take advantage of NSAE structure and propose a two-step fine-tuning\nprocedure that achieves better adaption and improves classification performance\nin the target domain.

Traditional planning\nmethods are largely rule-based and scale poorly in these complex dynamic\nscenarios, often leading to reactive or even overly conservative behaviors.\nTherefore, they require tedious human efforts to maintain workability.\nRecently, deep learning-based methods have shown promising results with better\ngeneralization capability but less hand engineering effort.

          "description": "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive and fatal\nneurodegenerative disease, that causes approximately 350 deaths in the United\nStates every year. In specific, it is a prion disease that is caused by a\nmisfolded prion protein, termed $PrP^{Sc}$, which is the infectious form of the\nprion protein $PrP^{C}$. Rather than being recycled by the body, the $PrP^{Sc}$\naggregates in the brain as plaques, leading to neurodegeneration of surrounding\ncells and the spongiform characteristics of the pathology. However, there has\nbeen very little research done into factors that can affect one's chances of\nacquiring $PrP^{Sc}$. In this paper, Elastic Net Regression, Long Short-Term\nMemory Recurrent Neural Network Architectures, and Random Forest have been used\nto predict Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Levels in the United States. New variables\nwere created as data for the models to use on the basis of common factors that\nare known to affect CJD, such as soil, food, and water quality. Based on the\nroot mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), and mean absolute error\n(MAE) values, the study reveals the high impact of unhealthy lifestyle choices,\nCO$_{2}$ Levels, Pesticide Usage, and Potash K$_{2}$O Usage on CJD Levels.

Besides the quadratic computational and memory complexity\nw.r.t the sequence length, the self-attention mechanism only processes\ninformation at the same scale, i.e., all attention heads are in the same\nresolution, resulting in the limited power of the Transformer. To remedy this,\nwe propose a novel and efficient structure named Adaptive Multi-Resolution\nAttention (AdaMRA for short), which scales linearly to sequence length in terms\nof time and space. Specifically, we leverage a multi-resolution multi-head\nattention mechanism, enabling attention heads to capture long-range contextual\ninformation in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, to capture the potential\nrelations between query representation and clues of different attention\ngranularities, we leave the decision of which resolution of attention to use to\nquery, which further improves the model's capacity compared to vanilla\nTransformer. In an effort to reduce complexity, we adopt kernel attention\nwithout degrading the performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model by achieving a\nstate-of-the-art performance-efficiency-memory trade-off.

Based\non the concept of independent component analysis (ICA), this paper proposes an\nextended framework in which the mutual information among the noises is\nminimized. Another significant contribution is to reduce the realization of the\nshortest path problem. The distance between each pair of nodes expresses an\nassociated mutual information value, and the path with the minimum sum (KL\ndivergence) is sought. Although $p!$ mutual information values should be\ncompared, this paper dramatically reduces the computation when no confounding\nis present. The proposed algorithm finds the globally optimal solution, while\nthe existing locally greedily seek the order based on hypothesis testing. We\nuse the best estimator in the sense of Bayes/MDL that correctly detects\nindependence for mutual information estimation.

In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH\nconcepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract\nSBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the\ndifference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured\nEHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the\nInternational Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show\nthat the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of\n0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH\ninformation and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864\npatients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more\ndetailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only\ncaptured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical\nnarratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of\npatients' SBDoH factors.",

Given the fact that the generative distribution may be\ncomplex and intractable, deep latent variable models use probabilistic\nframeworks to learn more expressive joint probability distributions over the\ndata and their low-dimensional hidden variables. Learning complex probability\ndistributions over sequential data without any supervision is a difficult task\nfor deep generative models. Ordinary Differential Equation Variational\nAuto-Encoder (ODE2VAE) is a deep latent variable model that aims to learn\ncomplex distributions over high-dimensional sequential data and their\nlow-dimensional representations. ODE2VAE infers continuous latent dynamics of\nthe high-dimensional input in a low-dimensional hierarchical latent space. The\nhierarchical organization of the continuous latent space embeds a\nphysics-guided inductive bias in the model. In this paper, we analyze the\nlatent representations inferred by the ODE2VAE model over three different\nphysical motion datasets: bouncing balls, projectile motion, and simple\npendulum. Through our experiments, we explore the effects of the physics-guided\ninductive bias of the ODE2VAE model over the learned dynamical latent\nrepresentations.

          "description": "Nonlocal models, including peridynamics, often use integral operators that\nembed lengthscales in their definition. However, the integrands in these\noperators are difficult to define from the data that are typically available\nfor a given physical system, such as laboratory mechanical property tests. In\ncontrast, molecular dynamics (MD) does not require these integrands, but it\nsuffers from computational limitations in the length and time scales it can\naddress. To combine the strengths of both methods and to obtain a\ncoarse-grained, homogenized continuum model that efficiently and accurately\ncaptures materials' behavior, we propose a learning framework to extract, from\nMD data, an optimal Linear Peridynamic Solid (LPS) model as a surrogate for MD\ndisplacements. To maximize the accuracy of the learnt model we allow the\nperidynamic influence function to be partially negative, while preserving the\nwell-posedness of the resulting model. To achieve this, we provide sufficient\nwell-posedness conditions for discretized LPS models with sign-changing\ninfluence functions and develop a constrained optimization algorithm that\nminimizes the equation residual while enforcing such solvability conditions.\nThis framework guarantees that the resulting model is mathematically\nwell-posed, physically consistent, and that it generalizes well to settings\nthat are different from the ones used during training. We illustrate the\nefficacy of the proposed approach with several numerical tests for single layer\ngraphene. Our two-dimensional tests show the robustness of the proposed\nalgorithm on validation data sets that include thermal noise, different domain\nshapes and external loadings, and discretizations substantially different from\nthe ones used for training.",

Since wet-lab\nexperiments are expensive and time-consuming, computational techniques for\nmiRNA-disease association prediction have attracted a lot of attention in\nrecent years. Data scarcity is one of the major challenges in building reliable\nmachine learning models. Data scarcity combined with the use of pre-calculated\nhand-crafted input features has led to problems of overfitting and data\nleakage.\n\nWe overcome the limitations of existing works by proposing a novel\nmulti-tasking convolution-based approach, which we refer to as MuCoMiD. MuCoMiD\nallows automatic feature extraction while incorporating knowledge from 4\nheterogeneous biological information sources (interactions between\nmiRNA/diseases and protein-coding genes (PCG), miRNA family information, and\ndisease ontology) in a multi-task setting which is a novel perspective and has\nnot been studied before. The use of multi-channel convolutions allows us to\nextract expressive representations while keeping the model linear and,\ntherefore, simple. To effectively test the generalization capability of our\nmodel, we construct large-scale experiments on standard benchmark datasets as\nwell as our proposed larger independent test sets and case studies. MuCoMiD\nshows an improvement of at least 5% in 5-fold CV evaluation on HMDDv2.0 and\nHMDDv3.0 datasets and at least 49% on larger independent test sets with unseen\nmiRNA and diseases over state-of-the-art approaches.

          "description": "Ensemble models in E-commerce combine predictions from multiple sub-models\nfor ranking and revenue improvement. Industrial ensemble models are typically\ndeep neural networks, following the supervised learning paradigm to infer\nconversion rate given inputs from sub-models. However, this process has the\nfollowing two problems. Firstly, the point-wise scoring approach disregards the\nrelationships between items and leads to homogeneous displayed results, while\ndiversified display benefits user experience and revenue. Secondly, the\nlearning paradigm focuses on the ranking metrics and does not directly optimize\nthe revenue. In our work, we propose a new Learning-To-Ensemble (LTE) framework\nRAEGO, which replaces the ensemble model with a contextual Rank Aggregator (RA)\nand explores the best weights of sub-models by the Evaluator-Generator\nOptimization (EGO). To achieve the best online performance, we propose a new\nrank aggregation algorithm TournamentGreedy as a refinement of classic rank\naggregators, which also produces the best average weighted Kendall Tau Distance\n(KTD) amongst all the considered algorithms with quadratic time complexity.\nUnder the assumption that the best output list should be Pareto Optimal on the\nKTD metric for sub-models, we show that our RA algorithm has higher efficiency\nand coverage in exploring the optimal weights. Combined with the idea of\nBayesian Optimization and gradient descent, we solve the online contextual\nBlack-Box Optimization task that finds the optimal weights for sub-models given\na chosen RA model. RA-EGO has been deployed in our online system and has\nimproved the revenue significantly.",

          "description": "Greater direct electrification of end-use sectors with a higher share of\nrenewables is one of the pillars to power a carbon-neutral society by 2050.\nHowever, in contrast to conventional power plants, renewable energy is subject\nto uncertainty raising challenges for their interaction with power systems.\nScenario-based probabilistic forecasting models have become an important tool\nto equip decision-makers. This paper proposes to present to the power systems\nforecasting practitioners a recent deep learning technique, the normalizing\nflows, to produce accurate scenario-based probabilistic forecasts that are\ncrucial to face the new challenges in power systems applications. The strength\nof this technique is to directly learn the stochastic multivariate distribution\nof the underlying process by maximizing the likelihood. Through comprehensive\nempirical evaluations using the open data of the Global Energy Forecasting\nCompetition 2014, we demonstrate that this methodology is competitive with\nother state-of-the-art deep learning generative models: generative adversarial\nnetworks and variational autoencoders. The models producing weather-based wind,\nsolar power, and load scenarios are properly compared both in terms of forecast\nvalue, by considering the case study of an energy retailer, and quality using\nseveral complementary metrics. The numerical experiments are simple and easily\nreproducible. Thus, we hope it will encourage other forecasting practitioners\nto test and use normalizing flows in power system applications such as bidding\non electricity markets, scheduling of power systems with high renewable energy\nsources penetration, energy management of virtual power plan or microgrids, and\nunit commitment.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks continue to awe the world with their remarkable\nperformance. Their predictions, however, are prone to be corrupted by\nadversarial examples that are imperceptible to humans. Current efforts to\nimprove the robustness of neural networks against adversarial examples are\nfocused on developing robust training methods, which update the weights of a\nneural network in a more robust direction. In this work, we take a step beyond\ntraining of the weight parameters and consider the problem of designing an\nadversarially robust neural architecture with high intrinsic robustness. We\npropose AdvRush, a novel adversarial robustness-aware neural architecture\nsearch algorithm, based upon a finding that independent of the training method,\nthe intrinsic robustness of a neural network can be represented with the\nsmoothness of its input loss landscape. Through a regularizer that favors a\ncandidate architecture with a smoother input loss landscape, AdvRush\nsuccessfully discovers an adversarially robust neural architecture. Along with\na comprehensive theoretical motivation for AdvRush, we conduct an extensive\namount of experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of AdvRush on various\nbenchmark datasets. Notably, on CIFAR-10, AdvRush achieves 55.91% robust\naccuracy under FGSM attack after standard training and 50.04% robust accuracy\nunder AutoAttack after 7-step PGD adversarial training.",

          "description": "Separating and labeling each instance of a nucleus (instance-aware\nsegmentation) is the key challenge in segmenting single cell nuclei on\nfluorescence microscopy images. Deep Neural Networks can learn the implicit\ntransformation of a nuclear image into a probability map indicating the class\nmembership of each pixel (nucleus or background), but the use of\npost-processing steps to turn the probability map into a labeled object mask is\nerror-prone. This especially accounts for nuclear images of tissue sections and\nnuclear images across varying tissue preparations. In this work, we aim to\nevaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to\nsegment nuclei in fluorescence images of various tissue origins and sample\npreparation types without post-processing. We compare architectures that\noperate on pixel to pixel translation and an architecture that operates on\nobject detection and subsequent locally applied segmentation. In addition, we\npropose a novel strategy to create artificial images to extend the training\nset. We evaluate the influence of ground truth annotation quality, image scale\nand segmentation complexity on segmentation performance. Results show that\nthree out of four deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net with ResNet34\nbackbone, Mask R-CNN) can segment fluorescent nuclear images on most of the\nsample preparation types and tissue origins with satisfactory segmentation\nperformance. Mask R-CNN, an architecture designed to address instance aware\nsegmentation tasks, outperforms other architectures. Equal nuclear mean size,\nconsistent nuclear annotations and the use of artificially generated images\nresult in overall acceptable precision and recall across different tissues and\nsample preparation types.",

          "description": "To reduce the time-to-market and access to state-of-the-art techniques, CNN\nhardware mapping and deployment on embedded accelerators are often outsourced\nto untrusted third parties, which is going to be more prevalent in futuristic\nartificial intelligence of things (AIoT) systems. These AIoT systems anticipate\nhorizontal collaboration among different resource-constrained AIoT node\ndevices, where CNN layers are partitioned and these devices collaboratively\ncompute complex CNN tasks. This horizontal collaboration opens another attack\nsurface to the CNN-based application, like inserting the hardware Trojans (HT)\ninto the embedded accelerators designed for the CNN. Therefore, there is a dire\nneed to explore this attack surface for designing secure embedded hardware\naccelerators for CNNs. Towards this goal, in this paper, we exploited this\nattack surface to propose an HT-based attack called FeSHI. Since in horizontal\ncollaboration of RC AIoT devices different sections of CNN architectures are\noutsourced to different untrusted third parties, the attacker may not know the\ninput image, but it has access to the layer-by-layer output feature maps\ninformation for the assigned sections of the CNN architecture. This attack\nexploits the statistical distribution, i.e., Gaussian distribution, of the\nlayer-by-layer feature maps of the CNN to design two triggers for stealthy HT\nwith a very low probability of triggering.

          "description": "Studying the implicit regularization effect of the nonlinear training\ndynamics of neural networks (NNs) is important for understanding why\nover-parameterized neural networks often generalize well on real dataset.\nEmpirically, for two-layer NN, existing works have shown that input weights of\nhidden neurons (the input weight of a hidden neuron consists of the weight from\nits input layer to the hidden neuron and its bias term) condense on isolated\norientations with a small initialization. The condensation dynamics implies\nthat NNs can learn features from the training data with a network configuration\neffectively equivalent to a much smaller network during the training. In this\nwork, we show that the multiple roots of activation function at origin\n(referred as ``multiplicity'') is a key factor for understanding the\ncondensation at the initial stage of training. Our experiments of multilayer\nnetworks suggest that the maximal number of condensed orientations is twice the\nmultiplicity of the activation function used. Our theoretical analysis of\ntwo-layer networks confirms experiments for two cases, one is for the\nactivation function of multiplicity one, which contains many common activation\nfunctions, and the other is for the one-dimensional input. This work makes a\nstep towards understanding how small initialization implicitly leads NNs to\ncondensation at initial training stage, which lays a foundation for the future\nstudy of the nonlinear dynamics of NNs and its implicit regularization effect\nat a later stage of training.",

Specifically, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is introduced to\nconstrain the posterior class probability consistency between full-net and\nsub-nets, and self-attention distillation on the same resolution feature of\ndifferent depth is addressed to drive more abundant feature representations of\nsub-nets. Thus, we can obtain multiple high-accuracy sub-nets simultaneously in\na DDNN via the online knowledge distillation in each training iteration without\nextra computation cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet\ndatasets demonstrate that sub-nets in DDNN with EKD training achieve better\nperformance than individually training networks while preserving the original\nperformance of full-nets.",

In this work, we propose a method for\ngenerating counterfactual (CF) explanations for GNNs: the minimal perturbation\nto the input (graph) data such that the prediction changes.

In this work we propose NeuralDP, a technique for privatising\nactivations of some layer within a neural network, which by the post-processing\nproperties of differential privacy yields a differentially private network.

          "description": "In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous\ndriving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may\ncompromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have\ndemonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in\ndetection precision of deep learning-based 3D object detection models. Although\ndriving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no\ncomprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning\nmodels and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial\nattacks, perturbation attacks and patch attacks, on the driving safety of\nvision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep\nlearning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in\nvision-based 3D object detection, Stereo R-CNN and DSGN. To evaluate driving\nsafety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving\nsafety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive\nevaluation experiments, we find that (1) the attack's impact on the driving\nsafety of autonomous vehicles and the attack's impact on the precision of 3D\nobject detectors are decoupled, and (2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger\nrobustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we\nfurther investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study.\nThe findings of this paper provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial\nattacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.",

          "description": "Recent research has shown that non-additive image steganographic frameworks\neffectively improve security performance through adjusting distortion\ndistribution. However, as far as we know, all of the existing non-additive\nproposals are based on handcrafted policies, and can only be applied to a\nspecific image domain, which heavily prevent non-additive steganography from\nreleasing its full potentiality. In this paper, we propose an automatic\nnon-additive steganographic distortion learning framework called MCTSteg to\nremove the above restrictions. Guided by the reinforcement learning paradigm,\nwe combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and steganalyzer-based environmental\nmodel to build MCTSteg. MCTS makes sequential decisions to adjust distortion\ndistribution without human intervention. Our proposed environmental model is\nused to obtain feedbacks from each decision. Due to its self-learning\ncharacteristic and domain-independent reward function, MCTSteg has become the\nfirst reported universal non-additive steganographic framework which can work\nin both spatial and JPEG domains. Extensive experimental results show that\nMCTSteg can effectively withstand the detection of both hand-crafted\nfeature-based and deep-learning-based steganalyzers. In both spatial and JPEG\ndomains, the security performance of MCTSteg steadily outperforms the state of\nthe art by a clear margin under different scenarios.",

This is challenging as outcomes of alternative decisions\nare not observed and have to be estimated. Previous methods estimate outcomes\nbased on unconfoundedness but neglect any constraints that unconfoundedness\nimposes on the outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization\nframework for estimating average treatment effects that exploits\nunconfoundedness. To this end, we formalize unconfoundedness as an\northogonality constraint, which ensures that the outcomes are orthogonal to the\ntreatment assignment. This orthogonality constraint is then included in the\nloss function via a regularization. Based on our regularization framework, we\ndevelop deep orthogonal networks for unconfounded treatments (DONUT), which\nlearn outcomes that are orthogonal to the treatment assignment.

          "description": "To enable process analysis based on an event log without compromising the\nprivacy of individuals involved in process execution, a log may be anonymized.\nSuch anonymization strives to transform a log so that it satisfies provable\nprivacy guarantees, while largely maintaining its utility for process analysis.\nExisting techniques perform anonymization using simple, syntactic measures to\nidentify suitable transformation operations. This way, the semantics of the\nactivities referenced by the events in a trace are neglected, potentially\nleading to transformations in which events of unrelated activities are merged.\nTo avoid this and incorporate the semantics of activities during anonymization,\nwe propose to instead incorporate a distance measure based on feature learning.\nSpecifically, we show how embeddings of events enable the definition of a\ndistance measure for traces to guide event log anonymization. Our experiments\nwith real-world data indicate that anonymization using this measure, compared\nto a syntactic one, yields logs that are closer to the original log in various\ndimensions and, hence, have higher utility for process analysis.",

In contrast, data points with low feature diversity may not provide a\nsufficient amount of unique descriptors to make a valid prediction; we refer to\nthem as random predictions. Random predictions can negatively impact the\noptimization process and harm the final performance. This paper proposes\naddressing the problem raised by random predictions by reshaping the standard\ncross-entropy to make it biased toward data points with a limited number of\nunique descriptive features. Our novel Bias Loss focuses the training on a set\nof valuable data points and prevents the vast number of samples with poor\nlearning features from misleading the optimization process. Furthermore, to\nshow the importance of diversity, we present a family of SkipNet models whose\narchitectures are brought to boost the number of unique descriptors in the last\nlayers. Our Skipnet-M can achieve 1% higher classification accuracy than\nMobileNetV3 Large.",

          "description": "Multimodal IR, spanning text corpus, knowledge graph and images, called\noutside knowledge visual question answering (OKVQA), is of much recent\ninterest. However, the popular data set has serious limitations. A surprisingly\nlarge fraction of queries do not assess the ability to integrate cross-modal\ninformation. Instead, some are independent of the image, some depend on\nspeculation, some require OCR or are otherwise answerable from the image alone.\nTo add to the above limitations, frequency-based guessing is very effective\nbecause of (unintended) widespread answer overlaps between the train and test\nfolds. Overall, it is hard to determine when state-of-the-art systems exploit\nthese weaknesses rather than really infer the answers, because they are opaque\nand their 'reasoning' process is uninterpretable. An equally important\nlimitation is that the dataset is designed for the quantitative assessment only\nof the end-to-end answer retrieval task, with no provision for assessing the\ncorrect(semantic) interpretation of the input query. In response, we identify a\nkey structural idiom in OKVQA ,viz., S3 (select, substitute and search), and\nbuild a new data set and challenge around it. Specifically, the questioner\nidentifies an entity in the image and asks a question involving that entity\nwhich can be answered only by consulting a knowledge graph or corpus passage\nmentioning the entity. Our challenge consists of (i)OKVQAS3, a subset of OKVQA\nannotated based on the structural idiom and (ii)S3VQA, a new dataset built from\nscratch. We also present a neural but structurally transparent OKVQA system,\nS3, that explicitly addresses our challenge dataset, and outperforms recent\ncompetitive baselines.",

The SMD kernel is\nconstructed in two steps: first, time delay and phase delay are incorporated\ninto each basis component; next, cross-convolution between a basis component\nand the reversed complex conjugate of another basis component is performed,\nwhich yields a complex-valued and positive definite kernel incorporating\ndependency structures between basis components. The model compression and\ndependency sparsity of the SMD kernel can be obtained by using automatic\npruning in SA.

          "description": "One intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their inherent\nvulnerability to backdoor attacks -- a trojan model responds to\ntrigger-embedded inputs in a highly predictable manner while functioning\nnormally otherwise.

To bridge\nthis gap, we present GTA, the first backdoor attack on GNNs. Compared with\nprior work, GTA departs in significant ways: graph-oriented -- it defines\ntriggers as specific subgraphs, including both topological structures and\ndescriptive features, entailing a large design spectrum for the adversary;\ninput-tailored -- it dynamically adapts triggers to individual graphs, thereby\noptimizing both attack effectiveness and evasiveness; downstream model-agnostic\n-- it can be readily launched without knowledge regarding downstream models or\nfine-tuning strategies; and attack-extensible -- it can be instantiated for\nboth transductive (e.g., node classification) and inductive (e.g., graph\nclassification) tasks, constituting severe threats for a range of\nsecurity-critical applications.

Among the explanatory methods, Shapley values is a\nfeature attribution method favoured for its robust theoretical foundation.\nHowever, the analysis of feature attributions using Shapley values requires\nchoosing a baseline that represents the concept of missingness. An arbitrary\nchoice of baseline could negatively impact the explanatory power of the method\nand possibly lead to incorrect interpretations. In this paper, we present a\nmethod for choosing a baseline according to a neutrality value: as a parameter\nselected by decision-makers, the point at which their choices are determined by\nthe model predictions being either above or below it. Hence, the proposed\nbaseline is set based on a parameter that depends on the actual use of the\nmodel. This procedure stands in contrast to how other baselines are set, i.e.\nwithout accounting for how the model is used. We empirically validate our\nchoice of baseline in the context of binary classification tasks, using two\ndatasets: a synthetic dataset and a dataset derived from the financial domain.",

Also, it is not trivial to generate a reference\nestimate using annotations from multiple experts. Here we present a deep neural\nnetwork, defined as U-Net-and-a-half, which can simultaneously learn from\nannotations performed by multiple experts on the same set of images.\nU-Net-and-a-half contains a convolutional encoder to generate features from the\ninput images, multiple decoders that allow simultaneous learning from image\nmasks obtained from annotations that were independently generated by multiple\nexperts, and a shared low-dimensional feature space. To demonstrate the\napplicability of our framework, we used two distinct datasets from digital\npathology and radiology, respectively.

These methods use the total number of attempts of students to\nmodel students' learning progress and hardly highlight the impact of the most\nrecent relevant practices. Besides, current factor analysis methods ignore rich\ninformation contained in questions. In this paper, we propose Multi-Factors\nAware Dual-Attentional model (MF-DAKT) which enriches question representations\nand utilizes multiple factors to model students' learning progress based on a\ndual-attentional mechanism. More specifically, we propose a novel\nstudent-related factor which records the most recent attempts on relevant\nconcepts of students to highlight the impact of recent exercises. To enrich\nquestions representations, we use a pre-training method to incorporate two\nkinds of question information including questions' relation and difficulty\nlevel. We also add a regularization term about questions' difficulty level to\nrestrict pre-trained question representations to fine-tuning during the process\nof predicting students' performance. Moreover, we apply a dual-attentional\nmechanism to differentiate contributions of factors and factor interactions to\nfinal prediction in different practice records. At last, we conduct experiments\non several real-world datasets and results show that MF-DAKT can outperform\nexisting knowledge tracing methods. We also conduct several studies to validate\nthe effects of each component of MF-DAKT.",

We\npropose a new federated learning algorithm, FedPAGE, able to further reduce the\ncommunication complexity by utilizing the recent optimal PAGE method (Li et\nal., 2021) instead of plain SGD in FedAvg. We show that FedPAGE uses much fewer\ncommunication rounds than previous local methods for both federated convex and\nnonconvex optimization. Concretely, 1) in the convex setting, the number of\ncommunication rounds of FedPAGE is $O(\\frac{N^{3/4}}{S\\epsilon})$, improving\nthe best-known result $O(\\frac{N}{S\\epsilon})$ of SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et\nal.,2020) by a factor of $N^{1/4}$, where $N$ is the total number of clients\n(usually is very large in federated learning), $S$ is the sampled subset of\nclients in each communication round, and $\\epsilon$ is the target error; 2) in\nthe nonconvex setting, the number of communication rounds of FedPAGE is\n$O(\\frac{\\sqrt{N}+S}{S\\epsilon^2})$, improving the best-known result\n$O(\\frac{N^{2/3}}{S^{2/3}\\epsilon^2})$ of SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al.,2020) by\na factor of $N^{1/6}S^{1/3}$, if the sampled clients $S\\leq \\sqrt{N}$.

          "description": "Errors in measurements are key to weighting the value of data, but are often\nneglected in Machine Learning (ML). We show how Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) are able to learn about the context and patterns of signal and noise,\nleading to improvements in the performance of classification methods. We\nconstruct a model whereby two classes of objects follow an underlying Gaussian\ndistribution, and where the features (the input data) have varying, but known,\nlevels of noise. This model mimics the nature of scientific data sets, where\nthe noises arise as realizations of some random processes whose underlying\ndistributions are known. The classification of these objects can then be\nperformed using standard statistical techniques (e.g., least-squares\nminimization or Markov-Chain Monte Carlo), as well as ML techniques. This\nallows us to take advantage of a maximum likelihood approach to object\nclassification, and to measure the amount by which the ML methods are\nincorporating the information in the input data uncertainties. We show that,\nwhen each data point is subject to different levels of noise (i.e., noises with\ndifferent distribution functions), that information can be learned by the CNNs,\nraising the ML performance to at least the same level of the least-squares\nmethod -- and sometimes even surpassing it. Furthermore, we show that, with\nvarying noise levels, the confidence of the ML classifiers serves as a proxy\nfor the underlying cumulative distribution function, but only if the\ninformation about specific input data uncertainties is provided to the CNNs.",

Maintaining this accuracy in\ndynamic environments, where inputs frequently fall outside the fixed set of\ninitially known classes, remains a challenge. The typical approach is to detect\ninputs from novel classes and retrain the classifier on an augmented dataset.\nHowever, not only the classifier but also the detection mechanism needs to\nadapt in order to distinguish between newly learned and yet unknown input\nclasses. To address this challenge, we introduce an algorithmic framework for\nactive monitoring of a neural network. A monitor wrapped in our framework\noperates in parallel with the neural network and interacts with a human user\nvia a series of interpretable labeling queries for incremental adaptation. In\naddition, we propose an adaptive quantitative monitor to improve precision.

Domain adaptation techniques are thus required.\nCovariate shift adaptation yields good generalization performance when domains\ndiffer only by the marginal distribution of features. Covariate shift\nadaptation is usually implemented using importance weighting, which may fail,\naccording to common wisdom, due to small effective sample sizes (ESS). Previous\nresearch argues this scenario is more common in high-dimensional settings.\nHowever, how effective sample size, dimensionality, and model\nperformance/generalization are formally related in supervised learning,\nconsidering the context of covariate shift adaptation, is still somewhat\nobscure in the literature. Thus, a main challenge is presenting a unified\ntheory connecting those points. Hence, in this paper, we focus on building a\nunified view connecting the ESS, data dimensionality, and generalization in the\ncontext of covariate shift adaptation. Moreover, we also demonstrate how\ndimensionality reduction or feature selection can increase the ESS, and argue\nthat our results support dimensionality reduction before covariate shift\nadaptation as a good practice.",

          "description": "Channel attention mechanisms have been commonly applied in many visual tasks\nfor effective performance improvement. It is able to reinforce the informative\nchannels as well as to suppress the useless channels. Recently, different\nchannel attention modules have been proposed and implemented in various ways.\nGenerally speaking, they are mainly based on convolution and pooling\noperations. In this paper, we propose Gaussian process embedded channel\nattention (GPCA) module and further interpret the channel attention schemes in\na probabilistic way. The GPCA module intends to model the correlations among\nthe channels, which are assumed to be captured by beta distributed variables.\nAs the beta distribution cannot be integrated into the end-to-end training of\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a mathematically tractable solution,\nwe utilize an approximation of the beta distribution to solve this problem. To\nspecify, we adapt a Sigmoid-Gaussian approximation, in which the Gaussian\ndistributed variables are transferred into the interval [0,1]. The Gaussian\nprocess is then utilized to model the correlations among different channels. In\nthis case, a mathematically tractable solution is derived. The GPCA module can\nbe efficiently implemented and integrated into the end-to-end training of the\nCNNs. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the\nproposed GPCA module.

Recent studies have often observed that codes having code\nsmells are often prone to a higher probability of change in the software\ndevelopment cycle.

          "description": "Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) recently emerged as a powerful paradigm\nfor recommendation based on implicit feedback collaborative filtering. However,\nstandard CML methods learn fixed user and item representations, which fails to\ncapture the complex interests of users. Existing extensions of CML also either\nignore the heterogeneity of user-item relations, i.e. that a user can\nsimultaneously like very different items, or the latent item-item relations,\ni.e. that a user's preference for an item depends, not only on its intrinsic\ncharacteristics, but also on items they previously interacted with. In this\npaper, we present a hierarchical CML model that jointly captures latent\nuser-item and item-item relations from implicit data. Our approach is inspired\nby translation mechanisms from knowledge graph embedding and leverages\nmemory-based attention networks. We empirically show the relevance of this\njoint relational modeling, by outperforming existing CML models on\nrecommendation tasks on several real-world datasets. Our experiments also\nemphasize the limits of current CML relational models on very sparse datasets.",

          "description": "Class imbalance is a substantial challenge in classifying many real-world\ncases. Synthetic over-sampling methods have been effective to improve the\nperformance of classifiers for imbalance problems. However, most synthetic\nover-sampling methods generate non-diverse synthetic instances within the\nconvex hull formed by the existing minority instances as they only concentrate\non the minority class and ignore the vast information provided by the majority\nclass. They also often do not perform well for extremely imbalanced data as the\nfewer the minority instances, the less information to generate synthetic\ninstances. Moreover, existing methods that generate synthetic instances using\nthe majority class distributional information cannot perform effectively when\nthe majority class has a multi-modal distribution. We propose a new method to\ngenerate diverse and adaptable synthetic instances using Synthetic\nOver-sampling with Minority and Majority classes (SOMM). SOMM generates\nsynthetic instances diversely within the minority data space. It updates the\ngenerated instances adaptively to the neighbourhood including both classes.\nThus, SOMM performs well for both binary and multiclass imbalance problems. We\nexamine the performance of SOMM for binary and multiclass problems using\nbenchmark data sets for different imbalance levels. The empirical results show\nthe superiority of SOMM compared to other existing methods.",

          "description": "The traditional Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) minimizes the\ntotal distance of the routes under the capacity constraints of the vehicles.\nBut more often, the objective involves multiple criteria including not only the\ntotal distance of the tour but also other factors such as travel costs, travel\ntime, and fuel consumption.Moreover, in reality, there are numerous implicit\npreferences ingrained in the minds of the route planners and the drivers.\nDrivers, for instance, have familiarity with certain neighborhoods and\nknowledge of the state of roads, and often consider the best places for rest\nand lunch breaks. This knowledge is difficult to formulate and balance when\noperational routing decisions have to be made. This motivates us to learn the\nimplicit preferences from past solutions and to incorporate these learned\npreferences in the optimization process. These preferences are in the form of\narc probabilities, i.e., the more preferred a route is, the higher is the joint\nprobability. The novelty of this work is the use of a neural network model to\nestimate the arc probabilities, which allows for additional features and\nautomatic parameter estimation. This first requires identifying suitable\nfeatures, neural architectures and loss functions, taking into account that\nthere is typically few data available. We investigate the difference with a\nprior weighted Markov counting approach, and study the applicability of neural\nnetworks in this setting.",

          "description": "Recent years have seen rapid advances in the data-driven analysis of\ndynamical systems based on Koopman operator theory and related approaches. On\nthe other hand, low-rank tensor product approximations -- in particular the\ntensor train (TT) format -- have become a valuable tool for the solution of\nlarge-scale problems in a number of fields. In this work, we combine\nKoopman-based models and the TT format, enabling their application to\nhigh-dimensional problems in conjunction with a rich set of basis functions or\nfeatures. We derive efficient algorithms to obtain a reduced matrix\nrepresentation of the system's evolution operator starting from an appropriate\nlow-rank representation of the data. These algorithms can be applied to both\nstationary and non-stationary systems. We establish the infinite-data limit of\nthese matrix representations, and demonstrate our methods' capabilities using\nseveral benchmark data sets.",

          "description": "Machine learning for procedural content generation has recently become an\nactive area of research. Levels vary in both form and function and are mostly\nunrelated to each other across games. This has made it difficult to assemble\nsuitably large datasets to bring machine learning to level design in the same\nway as it's been used for image generation. Here we propose Generative Playing\nNetworks which design levels for itself to play. The algorithm is built in two\nparts; an agent that learns to play game levels, and a generator that learns\nthe distribution of playable levels. As the agent learns and improves its\nability, the space of playable levels, as defined by the agent, grows. The\ngenerator targets the agent's playability estimates to then update its\nunderstanding of what constitutes a playable level. We call this process of\nlearning the distribution of data found through self-discovery with an\nenvironment, self-supervised inductive learning. Unlike previous approaches to\nprocedural content generation, Generative Playing Networks are end-to-end\ndifferentiable and do not require human-designed examples or domain knowledge.\nWe demonstrate the capability of this framework by training an agent and level\ngenerator for a 2D dungeon crawler game.",

The overwhelming majority of the literature focuses on small graph\nproblems, while several real-world problems are devoted to large graphs. Here,\nwe focus on two such problems that are related: influence estimation, a\n\\#P-hard counting problem, and influence maximization, an NP-hard problem. We\ndevelop GLIE, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that inherently parameterizes an\nupper bound of influence estimation and train it on small simulated graphs.\nExperiments show that GLIE can provide accurate predictions faster than the\nalternatives for graphs 10 times larger than the train set. More importantly,\nit can be used on arbitrary large graphs for influence maximization, as the\npredictions can rank effectively seed sets even when the accuracy deteriorates.\nTo showcase this, we propose a version of a standard Influence Maximization\n(IM) algorithm where we substitute traditional influence estimation with the\npredictions of GLIE.We also transfer GLIE into a reinforcement learning model\nthat learns how to choose seeds to maximize influence sequentially using GLIE's\nhidden representations and predictions.

          "description": "Being able to learn from complex data with phase information is imperative\nfor many signal processing applications. Today' s real-valued deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) have shown efficiency in latent information analysis but fall\nshort when applied to the complex domain. Deep complex networks (DCN), in\ncontrast, can learn from complex data, but have high computational costs;\ntherefore, they cannot satisfy the instant decision-making requirements of many\ndeployable systems dealing with short observations or short signal bursts.\nRecent, Binarized Complex Neural Network (BCNN), which integrates DCNs with\nbinarized neural networks (BNN), shows great potential in classifying complex\ndata in real-time. In this paper, we propose a structural pruning based\naccelerator of BCNN, which is able to provide more than 5000 frames/s inference\nthroughput on edge devices. The high performance comes from both the algorithm\nand hardware sides. On the algorithm side, we conduct structural pruning to the\noriginal BCNN models and obtain 20 $\\times$ pruning rates with negligible\naccuracy loss; on the hardware side, we propose a novel 2D convolution\noperation accelerator for the binary complex neural network. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed design works with over 90% utilization and is\nable to achieve the inference throughput of 5882 frames/s and 4938 frames/s for\ncomplex NIN-Net and ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10 dataset and Alveo U280 Board.",

          "description": "Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous systems which intend to operate\nin the real world. Single task vision networks extract information only based\non some aspects of the scene. In multi-task learning (MTL), on the other hand,\nthese single tasks are jointly learned, thereby providing an opportunity for\ntasks to share information and obtain a more comprehensive understanding. To\nthis end, we develop UniNet, a unified scene understanding network that\naccurately and efficiently infers vital vision tasks including object\ndetection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, monocular depth\nestimation, and monocular instance depth prediction. As these tasks look at\ndifferent semantic and geometric information, they can either complement or\nconflict with each other. Therefore, understanding inter-task relationships can\nprovide useful cues to enable complementary information sharing. We evaluate\nthe task relationships in UniNet through the lens of adversarial attacks based\non the notion that they can exploit learned biases and task interactions in the\nneural network. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset, using\nuntargeted and targeted attacks reveal that semantic tasks strongly interact\namongst themselves, and the same holds for geometric tasks. Additionally, we\nshow that the relationship between semantic and geometric tasks is asymmetric\nand their interaction becomes weaker as we move towards higher-level\nrepresentations.",

          "description": "The Oxford English Dictionary defines precision medicine as \"medical care\ndesigned to optimize efficiency or therapeutic benefit for particular groups of\npatients, especially by using genetic or molecular profiling.\" It is not an\nentirely new idea: physicians from ancient times have recognized that medical\ntreatment needs to consider individual variations in patient characteristics.\nHowever, the modern precision medicine movement has been enabled by a\nconfluence of events: scientific advances in fields such as genetics and\npharmacology, technological advances in mobile devices and wearable sensors,\nand methodological advances in computing and data sciences.\n\nThis chapter is about bandit algorithms: an area of data science of special\nrelevance to precision medicine. With their roots in the seminal work of\nBellman, Robbins, Lai and others, bandit algorithms have come to occupy a\ncentral place in modern data science ( Lattimore and Szepesvari, 2020). Bandit\nalgorithms can be used in any situation where treatment decisions need to be\nmade to optimize some health outcome. Since precision medicine focuses on the\nuse of patient characteristics to guide treatment, contextual bandit algorithms\nare especially useful since they are designed to take such information into\naccount. The role of bandit algorithms in areas of precision medicine such as\nmobile health and digital phenotyping has been reviewed before (Tewari and\nMurphy, 2017; Rabbi et al., 2019). Since these reviews were published, bandit\nalgorithms have continued to find uses in mobile health and several new topics\nhave emerged in the research on bandit algorithms. This chapter is written for\nquantitative researchers in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and\noperations research who might be interested in knowing more about the\nalgorithmic and mathematical details of bandit algorithms that have been used\nin mobile health.",

          "description": "Collaborative training of neural networks leverages distributed data by\nexchanging gradient information between different clients. Although training\ndata entirely resides with the clients, recent work shows that training data\ncan be reconstructed from such exchanged gradient information. To enhance\nprivacy, gradient perturbation techniques have been proposed. However, they\ncome at the cost of reduced model performance, increased convergence time, or\nincreased data demand. In this paper, we introduce PRECODE, a PRivacy EnhanCing\nmODulE that can be used as generic extension for arbitrary model architectures.\nWe propose a simple yet effective realization of PRECODE using variational\nmodeling. The stochastic sampling induced by variational modeling effectively\nprevents privacy leakage from gradients and in turn preserves privacy of data\nowners. We evaluate PRECODE using state of the art gradient inversion attacks\non two different model architectures trained on three datasets. In contrast to\ncommonly used defense mechanisms, we find that our proposed modification\nconsistently reduces the attack success rate to 0% while having almost no\nnegative impact on model training and final performance. As a result, PRECODE\nreveals a promising path towards privacy enhancing model extensions.",

For a broad class of least squares problem instances (that\nare natural in high-dimensional settings), we show: (1) for every problem\ninstance and for every ridge parameter, (unregularized) SGD, when provided with\nlogarithmically more samples than that provided to the ridge algorithm,\ngeneralizes no worse than the ridge solution (provided SGD uses a tuned\nconstant stepsize); (2) conversely, there exist instances (in this wide problem\nclass) where optimally-tuned ridge regression requires quadratically more\nsamples than SGD in order to have the same generalization performance. Taken\ntogether, our results show that, up to the logarithmic factors, the\ngeneralization performance of SGD is always no worse than that of ridge\nregression in a wide range of overparameterized problems, and, in fact, could\nbe much better for some problem instances.

          "description": "Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning framework designed for\ndata privacy preservation i.e., local data remain private throughout the entire\ntraining and testing procedure. Federated Learning is gaining popularity\nbecause it allows one to use machine learning techniques while preserving\nprivacy. However, it inherits the vulnerabilities and susceptibilities raised\nin deep learning techniques. For instance, Federated Learning is particularly\nvulnerable to data poisoning attacks that may deteriorate its performance and\nintegrity due to its distributed nature and inaccessibility to the raw data. In\naddition, it is extremely difficult to correctly identify malicious clients due\nto the non-Independently and/or Identically Distributed (non-IID) data. The\nreal-world data can be complex and diverse, making them hardly distinguishable\nfrom the malicious data without direct access to the raw data. Prior research\nhas focused on detecting malicious clients while treating only the clients\nhaving IID data as benign. In this study, we propose a method that detects and\nclassifies anomalous clients from benign clients when benign ones have non-IID\ndata. Our proposed method leverages feature dimension reduction, dynamic\nclustering, and cosine similarity-based clipping. The experimental results\nvalidates that our proposed method not only classifies the malicious clients\nbut also alleviates their negative influences from the entire procedure. Our\nfindings may be used in future studies to effectively eliminate anomalous\nclients when building a model with diverse data.",

          "description": "Big Data are rapidly produced from various heterogeneous data sources. They\nare of different types (text, image, video or audio) and have different levels\nof reliability and completeness. One of the most interesting architectures that\ndeal with the large amount of emerging data at high velocity is called the\nlambda architecture. In fact, it combines two different processing layers\nnamely batch and speed layers, each providing specific views of data while\nensuring robustness, fast and scalable data processing. However, most papers\ndealing with the lambda architecture are focusing one single type of data\ngenerally produced by a single data source. Besides, the layers of the\narchitecture are implemented independently, or, at best, are combined to\nperform basic processing without assessing either the data reliability or\ncompleteness. Therefore, inspired by the lambda architecture, we propose in\nthis paper a generic multimodal architecture that combines both batch and\nstreaming processing in order to build a complete, global and accurate insight\nin near-real-time based on the knowledge extracted from multiple heterogeneous\nBig Data sources. Our architecture uses batch processing to analyze the data\nstructures and contents, build the learning models and calculate the\nreliability index of the involved sources, while the streaming processing uses\nthe built-in models of the batch layer to immediately process incoming data and\nrapidly provide results. We validate our architecture in the context of urban\ntraffic management systems in order to detect congestions.",

In DDS, a service loop is an\nelemental structure, including its service worker, the service providers and\ncorresponding service targets. The service workers should transport either\nhumans or parcels from the providers to the target locations. Various planning\ntasks within DDS can thus be classified into two individual stages: 1)\nDispatching, which is to form service loops from demand/supply distributions,\nand 2)Routing, which is to decide specific serving orders within the\nconstructed loops. Generating high-quality strategies in both stages is\nimportant to develop DDS but faces several challenging. Meanwhile, deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) has been developed rapidly in recent years. It is\na powerful tool to solve these problems since DRL can learn a parametric model\nwithout relying on too many problem-based assumptions and optimize long-term\neffect by learning sequential decisions. In this survey, we first define DDS,\nthen highlight common applications and important decision/control problems\nwithin.

At the end of the\nsearch phase, the operations with the largest architecture parameters will be\nselected to form the final architecture, with the implicit assumption that the\nvalues of architecture parameters reflect the operation strength. While much\nhas been discussed about the supernet's optimization, the architecture\nselection process has received little attention. We provide empirical and\ntheoretical analysis to show that the magnitude of architecture parameters does\nnot necessarily indicate how much the operation contributes to the supernet's\nperformance. We propose an alternative perturbation-based architecture\nselection that directly measures each operation's influence on the supernet. We\nre-evaluate several differentiable NAS methods with the proposed architecture\nselection and find that it is able to extract significantly improved\narchitectures from the underlying supernets consistently. Furthermore, we find\nthat several failure modes of DARTS can be greatly alleviated with the proposed\nselection method, indicating that much of the poor generalization observed in\nDARTS can be attributed to the failure of magnitude-based architecture\nselection rather than entirely the optimization of its supernet.",

          "description": "Several decades ago the Proximal Point Algorithm (PPA) started to gain much\nattraction for both abstract operator theory and the numerical optimization\ncommunities. Even in modern applications, researchers still use proximal\nminimization theory to design scalable algorithms that overcome nonsmoothness\nin high dimensional models. Several remarkable references as\n\\cite{Fer:91,Ber:82constrained,Ber:89parallel,Tom:11} analyzed the tight local\nrelations between the convergence rate of PPA and the regularity of the\nobjective function. However, without taking into account the concrete\ncomputational effort paid for computing each PPA iteration, any iteration\ncomplexity remains abstract and purely informative. In this manuscript we aim\nto evaluate the computational complexity of practical PPA in terms of\n(proximal) gradient/subgradient iterations, which might allow a fair\npositioning of the famous PPA numerical performance in the class of first order\nmethods. First, we derive nonasymptotic iteration complexity estimates of exact\nand inexact PPA to minimize convex functions under $\\gamma-$Holderian growth:\n$\\BigO{\\log(1/\\epsilon)}$ (for $\\gamma \\in [1,2]$) and\n$\\BigO{1/\\epsilon^{\\gamma - 2}}$ (for $\\gamma > 2$). In particular, we recover\nwell-known results on exact PPA: finite convergence for sharp minima and linear\nconvergence for quadratic growth, even under presence of inexactness. Second,\nassuming that an usual (proximal) gradient/subgradient method subroutine is\nemployed to compute inexact PPA iteration, we show novel computational\ncomplexity bounds on a restarted variant of the inexact PPA, available when no\ninformation on the growth of the objective function is known. In the numerical\nexperiments we confirm the practical performance and implementability of our\nschemes.",

Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) techniques have\nshown promising results in classifying ultrasound images of the breast into\nbenign or malignant. However, CNN inference acts as a black-box model, and as\nsuch, its decision-making is not interpretable. Therefore, increasing effort\nhas been dedicated to explaining this process, most notably through GRAD-CAM\nand other techniques that provide visual explanations into inner workings of\nCNNs. In addition to interpretation, these methods provide clinically important\ninformation, such as identifying the location for biopsy or treatment. In this\nwork, we analyze how adversarial assaults that are practically undetectable may\nbe devised to alter these importance maps dramatically. Furthermore, we will\nshow that this change in the importance maps can come with or without altering\nthe classification result, rendering them even harder to detect. As such, care\nmust be taken when using these importance maps to shed light on the inner\nworkings of deep learning.

          "description": "We study the problem of knowledge tracing (KT) where the goal is to trace the\nstudents' knowledge mastery over time so as to make predictions on their future\nperformance. Owing to the good representation capacity of deep neural networks\n(DNNs), recent advances on KT have increasingly concentrated on exploring DNNs\nto improve the performance of KT. However, we empirically reveal that the DNNs\nbased KT models may run the risk of overfitting, especially on small datasets,\nleading to limited generalization. In this paper, by leveraging the current\nadvances in adversarial training (AT), we propose an efficient AT based KT\nmethod (ATKT) to enhance KT model's generalization and thus push the limit of\nKT. Specifically, we first construct adversarial perturbations and add them on\nthe original interaction embeddings as adversarial examples. The original and\nadversarial examples are further used to jointly train the KT model, forcing it\nis not only to be robust to the adversarial examples, but also to enhance the\ngeneralization over the original ones. To better implement AT, we then present\nan efficient attentive-LSTM model as KT backbone, where the key is a proposed\nknowledge hidden state attention module that adaptively aggregates information\nfrom previous knowledge hidden states while simultaneously highlighting the\nimportance of current knowledge hidden state to make a more accurate\nprediction. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our ATKT achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

          "description": "Radio-frequency fingerprints~(RFFs) are promising solutions for realizing\nlow-cost physical layer authentication. Machine learning-based methods have\nbeen proposed for RFF extraction and discrimination. However, most existing\nmethods are designed for the closed-set scenario where the set of devices is\nremains unchanged. These methods can not be generalized to the RFF\ndiscrimination of unknown devices. To enable the discrimination of RFF from\nboth known and unknown devices, we propose a new end-to-end deep learning\nframework for extracting RFFs from raw received signals. The proposed framework\ncomprises a novel preprocessing module, called neural synchronization~(NS),\nwhich incorporates the data-driven learning with signal processing priors as an\ninductive bias from communication-model based processing. Compared to\ntraditional carrier synchronization techniques, which are static, this module\nestimates offsets by two learnable deep neural networks jointly trained by the\nRFF extractor. Additionally, a hypersphere representation is proposed to\nfurther improve the discrimination of RFF. Theoretical analysis shows that such\na data-and-model framework can better optimize the mutual information between\ndevice identity and the RFF, which naturally leads to better performance.\nExperimental results verify that the proposed RFF significantly outperforms\npurely data-driven DNN-design and existing handcrafted RFF methods in terms of\nboth discrimination and network generalizability.",

The unsupervised open domain\nadaption for generating realistic photos from a hand-drawn sketch is\nchallenging as there is no such sketch of that class for training data. The\nabsence of learning supervision and the huge domain gap between both the\nfreehand drawing and picture domains make it hard. We present an approach that\nlearns both sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation to synthesise the\nmissing freehand drawings from pictures. Due to the domain gap between\nsynthetic sketches and genuine ones, the generator trained on false drawings\nmay produce unsatisfactory results when dealing with drawings of lacking\nclasses. To address this problem, we offer a simple but effective open-domain\nsampling and optimization method that tricks the generator into considering\nfalse drawings as genuine. Our approach generalises the learnt sketch-to-photo\nand photo-to-sketch mappings from in-domain input to open-domain categories.

Experiments on human activity recognition, air quality\nprediction, and financial analysis show that AdaRNN outperforms the latest\nmethods by a classification accuracy of 2.6% and significantly reduces the RMSE\nby 9.0%. We also show that the temporal distribution matching algorithm can be\nextended in Transformer structure to boost its performance.",

          "description": "The task of skeleton-based action recognition remains a core challenge in\nhuman-centred scene understanding due to the multiple granularities and large\nvariation in human motion. Existing approaches typically employ a single neural\nrepresentation for different motion patterns, which has difficulty in capturing\nfine-grained action classes given limited training data. To address the\naforementioned problems, we propose a novel multi-granular spatio-temporal\ngraph network for skeleton-based action classification that jointly models the\ncoarse- and fine-grained skeleton motion patterns. To this end, we develop a\ndual-head graph network consisting of two interleaved branches, which enables\nus to extract features at two spatio-temporal resolutions in an effective and\nefficient manner. Moreover, our network utilises a cross-head communication\nstrategy to mutually enhance the representations of both heads. We conducted\nextensive experiments on three large-scale datasets, namely NTU RGB+D 60, NTU\nRGB+D 120, and Kinetics-Skeleton, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance\non all the benchmarks, which validates the effectiveness of our method.",

          "description": "The CP decomposition for high dimensional non-orthogonal spike tensors is an\nimportant problem with broad applications across many disciplines. However,\nprevious works with theoretical guarantee typically assume restrictive\nincoherence conditions on the basis vectors for the CP components. In this\npaper, we propose new computationally efficient composite PCA and concurrent\northogonalization algorithms for tensor CP decomposition with theoretical\nguarantees under mild incoherence conditions. The composite PCA applies the\nprincipal component or singular value decompositions twice, first to a matrix\nunfolding of the tensor data to obtain singular vectors and then to the matrix\nfolding of the singular vectors obtained in the first step. It can be used as\nan initialization for any iterative optimization schemes for the tensor CP\ndecomposition. The concurrent orthogonalization algorithm iteratively estimates\nthe basis vector in each mode of the tensor by simultaneously applying\nprojections to the orthogonal complements of the spaces generated by others CP\ncomponents in other modes. It is designed to improve the alternating least\nsquares estimator and other forms of the high order orthogonal iteration for\ntensors with low or moderately high CP ranks. Our theoretical investigation\nprovides estimation accuracy and statistical convergence rates for the two\nproposed algorithms. Our implementations on synthetic data demonstrate\nsignificant practical superiority of our approach over existing methods.",

          "description": "Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being adopted in a wide variety of\napplication domains. Usually, a well-performing ML model, especially, emerging\ndeep neural network model, relies on a large volume of training data and\nhigh-powered computational resources. The need for a vast volume of available\ndata raises serious privacy concerns because of the risk of leakage of highly\nprivacy-sensitive information and the evolving regulatory environments that\nincreasingly restrict access to and use of privacy-sensitive data. Furthermore,\na trained ML model may also be vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as\nmembership/property inference attacks and model inversion attacks. Hence,\nwell-designed privacy-preserving ML (PPML) solutions are crucial and have\nattracted increasing research interest from academia and industry. More and\nmore efforts of PPML are proposed via integrating privacy-preserving techniques\ninto ML algorithms, fusing privacy-preserving approaches into ML pipeline, or\ndesigning various privacy-preserving architectures for existing ML systems. In\nparticular, existing PPML arts cross-cut ML, system, security, and privacy;\nhence, there is a critical need to understand state-of-art studies, related\nchallenges, and a roadmap for future research. This paper systematically\nreviews and summarizes existing privacy-preserving approaches and proposes a\nPGU model to guide evaluation for various PPML solutions through elaborately\ndecomposing their privacy-preserving functionalities. The PGU model is designed\nas the triad of Phase, Guarantee, and technical Utility. Furthermore, we also\ndiscuss the unique characteristics and challenges of PPML and outline possible\ndirections of future work that benefit a wide range of research communities\namong ML, distributed systems, security, and privacy areas.",

          "description": "The performance of many medical image analysis tasks are strongly associated\nwith image data quality. When developing modern deep learning algorithms,\nrather than relying on subjective (human-based) image quality assessment (IQA),\ntask amenability potentially provides an objective measure of task-specific\nimage quality. To predict task amenability, an IQA agent is trained using\nreinforcement learning (RL) with a simultaneously optimised task predictor,\nsuch as a classification or segmentation neural network. In this work, we\ndevelop transfer learning or adaptation strategies to increase the adaptability\nof both the IQA agent and the task predictor so that they are less dependent on\nhigh-quality, expert-labelled training data. The proposed transfer learning\nstrategy re-formulates the original RL problem for task amenability in a\nmeta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework. The resulting algorithm\nfacilitates efficient adaptation of the agent to different definitions of image\nquality, each with its own Markov decision process environment including\ndifferent images, labels and an adaptable task predictor. Our work demonstrates\nthat the IQA agents pre-trained on non-expert task labels can be adapted to\npredict task amenability as defined by expert task labels, using only a small\nset of expert labels. Using 6644 clinical ultrasound images from 249 prostate\ncancer patients, our results for image classification and segmentation tasks\nshow that the proposed IQA method can be adapted using data with as few as\nrespective 19.7% and 29.6% expert-reviewed consensus labels and still achieve\ncomparable IQA and task performance, which would otherwise require a training\ndataset with 100% expert labels.",

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches\nleverage small labeled datasets alongside larger unlabeled datasets and offer\npotential for reducing labeling cost. In this work, we introduce NoTeacher, a\nnovel consistency-based SSL framework which incorporates probabilistic\ngraphical models. Unlike Mean Teacher which maintains a teacher network updated\nvia a temporal ensemble, NoTeacher employs two independent networks, thereby\neliminating the need for a teacher network. We demonstrate how NoTeacher can be\ncustomized to handle a range of challenges in radiology image classification.\nSpecifically, we describe adaptations for scenarios with 2D and 3D inputs, uni\nand multi-label classification, and class distribution mismatch between labeled\nand unlabeled portions of the training data. In realistic empirical evaluations\non three public benchmark datasets spanning the workhorse modalities of\nradiology (X-Ray, CT, MRI), we show that NoTeacher achieves over 90-95% of the\nfully supervised AUROC with less than 5-15% labeling budget. Further, NoTeacher\noutperforms established SSL methods with minimal hyperparameter tuning, and has\nimplications as a principled and practical option for semisupervised learning\nin radiology applications.",

          "description": "For the past ten years, CNN has reigned supreme in the world of computer\nvision, but recently, Transformer is on the rise. However, the quadratic\ncomputational cost of self-attention has become a severe problem of practice.\nThere has been much research on architectures without CNN and self-attention in\nthis context. In particular, MLP-Mixer is a simple idea designed using MLPs and\nhit an accuracy comparable to the Vision Transformer. However, the only\ninductive bias in this architecture is the embedding of tokens. Thus, there is\nstill a possibility to build a non-convolutional inductive bias into the\narchitecture itself, and we built in an inductive bias using two simple ideas.\nA way is to divide the token-mixing block vertically and horizontally. Another\nway is to make spatial correlations denser among some channels of token-mixing.\nWith this approach, we were able to improve the accuracy of the MLP-Mixer while\nreducing its parameters and computational complexity. Compared to other\nMLP-based models, the proposed model, named RaftMLP has a good balance of\ncomputational complexity, the number of parameters, and actual memory usage. In\naddition, our work indicates that MLP-based models have the potential to\nreplace CNNs by adopting inductive bias.

          "description": "The neuroimage analysis community has neglected the automated segmentation of\nthe olfactory bulb (OB) despite its crucial role in olfactory function. The\nlack of an automatic processing method for the OB can be explained by its\nchallenging properties. Nonetheless, recent advances in MRI acquisition\ntechniques and resolution have allowed raters to generate more reliable manual\nannotations. Furthermore, the high accuracy of deep learning methods for\nsolving semantic segmentation problems provides us with an option to reliably\nassess even small structures. In this work, we introduce a novel, fast, and\nfully automated deep learning pipeline to accurately segment OB tissue on\nsub-millimeter T2-weighted (T2w) whole-brain MR images. To this end, we\ndesigned a three-stage pipeline: (1) Localization of a region containing both\nOBs using FastSurferCNN, (2) Segmentation of OB tissue within the localized\nregion through four independent AttFastSurferCNN - a novel deep learning\narchitecture with a self-attention mechanism to improve modeling of contextual\ninformation, and (3) Ensemble of the predicted label maps. The OB pipeline\nexhibits high performance in terms of boundary delineation, OB localization,\nand volume estimation across a wide range of ages in 203 participants of the\nRhineland Study. Moreover, it also generalizes to scans of an independent\ndataset never encountered during training, the Human Connectome Project (HCP),\nwith different acquisition parameters and demographics, evaluated in 30 cases\nat the native 0.7mm HCP resolution, and the default 0.8mm pipeline resolution.\nWe extensively validated our pipeline not only with respect to segmentation\naccuracy but also to known OB volume effects, where it can sensitively\nreplicate age effects.",

          "description": "Analysing correlations between streams of events is an important problem. It\narises for example in Neurosciences, when the connectivity of neurons should be\ninferred from spike trains that record neurons' individual spiking activity.\nWhile recently some approaches for inferring delayed synaptic connections have\nbeen proposed, they are limited in the types of connectivities and delays they\nare able to handle, or require computation-intensive procedures. This paper\nproposes a faster and more flexible approach for analysing such delayed\ncorrelated activity: a statistical approach for the Analysis of Connectivity in\nspiking Events (ACE), based on the idea of hypothesis testing. It first\ncomputes for any pair of a source and a target neuron the inter-spike delays\nbetween subsequent source- and target-spikes. Then, it derives a null model for\nthe distribution of inter-spike delays for \\emph{uncorrelated}~neurons.\nFinally, it compares the observed distribution of inter-spike delays to this\nnull model and infers pairwise connectivity based on the Pearson's Chi-squared\ntest statistic. Thus, ACE is capable to detect connections with a priori\nunknown, non-discrete (and potentially large) inter-spike delays, which might\nvary between pairs of neurons. Since ACE works incrementally, it has potential\nfor being used in online processing. In our experiments, we visualise the\nadvantages of ACE in varying experimental scenarios (except for one special\ncase) and in a state-of-the-art dataset which has been generated for\nneuro-scientific research under most realistic conditions.",

          "description": "The Influenza virus can be considered as one of the most severe viruses that\ncan infect multiple species with often fatal consequences to the hosts. The\nHemagglutinin (HA) gene of the virus can be a target for antiviral drug\ndevelopment realised through accurate identification of its sub-types and\npossible the targeted hosts. This paper focuses on accurately predicting if an\nInfluenza type A virus can infect specific hosts, and more specifically, Human,\nAvian and Swine hosts, using only the protein sequence of the HA gene. In more\ndetail, we propose encoding the protein sequences into numerical signals using\nthe Hydrophobicity Index and subsequently utilising a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork-based predictive model. The Influenza HA protein sequences used in the\nproposed work are obtained from the Influenza Research Database (IRD).\nSpecifically, complete and unique HA protein sequences were used for avian,\nhuman and swine hosts. The data obtained for this work was 17999 human-host\nproteins, 17667 avian-host proteins and 9278 swine-host proteins. Given this\nset of collected proteins, the proposed method yields as much as 10% higher\naccuracy for an individual class (namely, Avian) and 5% higher overall accuracy\nthan in an earlier study. It is also observed that the accuracy for each class\nin this work is more balanced than what was presented in this earlier study. As\nthe results show, the proposed model can distinguish HA protein sequences with\nhigh accuracy whenever the virus under investigation can infect Human, Avian or\nSwine hosts.",

If\nsuch surface cracks could be identified in time, it is of great significance\nfor the monitoring and early warning of geohazards. Currently, the most common\nmethod for crack identification is manual detection, which is with low\nefficiency and accuracy. In this paper, a deep transfer learning framework is\nproposed to effectively and efficiently identify slope surface cracks for the\nsake of fast monitoring and early warning of geohazards such as landslides.

In the proposed framework, (1) pretrained cracks identification\nmodels are constructed based on the large sample dataset of concrete cracks;\n(2) refined cracks identification models are further constructed based on the\nsmall sample dataset of soil and rock masses cracks.

In real datasets, the score function diverges\nas the diffusion time ($t$) decreases to zero, and this observation leads an\nargument that the score estimation fails at $t=0$ with any neural network\nstructure. Subsequently, we introduce Unbounded Diffusion Model (UDM) that\nresolves the score diverging problem with an easily applicable modification to\nany diffusion models.

Unfortunately, DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks\nthat affect virtually all state-of-the-art models. These attacks make small\nimperceptible modifications to inputs that are sufficient to induce the DNNs to\nproduce the wrong classification.\n\nIn this paper we propose a novel, lightweight adversarial correction and/or\ndetection mechanism for image classifiers that relies on undervolting (running\na chip at a voltage that is slightly below its safe margin). We propose using\ncontrolled undervolting of the chip running the inference process in order to\nintroduce a limited number of compute errors.

          "description": "The online estimation of rhythmic information, such as beat positions,\ndownbeat positions, and meter, is critical for many real-time music\napplications. Musical rhythm comprises complex hierarchical relationships\nacross time, rendering its analysis intrinsically challenging and at times\nsubjective. Furthermore, systems which attempt to estimate rhythmic information\nin real-time must be causal and must produce estimates quickly and efficiently.\nIn this work, we introduce an online system for joint beat, downbeat, and meter\ntracking, which utilizes causal convolutional and recurrent layers, followed by\na pair of sequential Monte Carlo particle filters applied during inference. The\nproposed system does not need to be primed with a time signature in order to\nperform downbeat tracking, and is instead able to estimate meter and adjust the\npredictions over time. Additionally, we propose an information gate strategy to\nsignificantly decrease the computational cost of particle filtering during the\ninference step, making the system much faster than previous sampling-based\nmethods. Experiments on the GTZAN dataset, which is unseen during training,\nshow that the system outperforms various online beat and downbeat tracking\nsystems and achieves comparable performance to a baseline offline joint method.",

To answer these\nquestions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a\nnew English-French dataset comprising supporting context words for 14K\ntranslations that professional translators found useful for pronoun\ndisambiguation. Using SCAT, we perform an in-depth analysis of the context used\nto disambiguate, examining positional and lexical characteristics of the\nsupporting words.

          "description": "In applied multivariate statistics, estimating the number of latent\ndimensions or the number of clusters is a fundamental and recurring problem.\nOne common diagnostic is the scree plot, which shows the largest eigenvalues of\nthe data matrix; the user searches for a \"gap\" or \"elbow\" in the decreasing\neigenvalues; unfortunately, these patterns can hide beneath the bias of the\nsample eigenvalues. This methodological problem is conceptually difficult\nbecause, in many situations, there is only enough signal to detect a subset of\nthe $k$ population dimensions/eigenvectors. In this situation, one could argue\nthat the correct choice of $k$ is the number of detectable dimensions. We\nalleviate these problems with cross-validated eigenvalues. Under a large class\nof random graph models, without any parametric assumptions, we provide a\np-value for each sample eigenvector. It tests the null hypothesis that this\nsample eigenvector is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the true latent\ndimensions. This approach naturally adapts to problems where some dimensions\nare not statistically detectable. In scenarios where all $k$ dimensions can be\nestimated, we prove that our procedure consistently estimates $k$. In\nsimulations and a data example, the proposed estimator compares favorably to\nalternative approaches in both computational and statistical performance.",

Deep generative models have been adapted to model\ntheir variations typically using a map from a ball-like set of latent\nvariables.

Moreover, a point cloud\nis often composed of multiple subparts, and it is also difficult to express. In\nthis study, we propose ChartPointFlow, a flow-based generative model with\nmultiple latent labels for 3D point clouds. Each label is assigned to points in\nan unsupervised manner. Then, a map conditioned on a label is assigned to a\ncontinuous subset of a point cloud, similar to a chart of a manifold. This\nenables our proposed model to preserve the topological structure with clear\nboundaries, whereas previous approaches tend to generate blurry point clouds\nand fail to generate holes. The experimental results demonstrate that\nChartPointFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of generation and\nreconstruction compared with other point cloud generators.

Then, we developed subtype-specific\nridge regression models for cumulative strain damage (using the threshold of\n15%), which significantly improved the estimation accuracy compared with the\nbaseline method which mixed impacts from different sources and developed one\nmodel (R^2 from 0.7 to 0.9). To investigate the effect of kinematic features,\nwe presented the top three critical features (maximum resultant angular\nacceleration, maximum angular acceleration along the z-axis, maximum linear\nacceleration along the y-axis) based on regression accuracy and used logistic\nregression to find the critical points for each feature that partitioned the\nsubtypes. This study enables researchers to define head impact subtypes in a\ndata-driven manner, which leads to more generalizable brain injury risk\nestimation.",

Therefore,\nit is possible that meaningful patterns for classifying EEG signals are deeply\nhidden. State-of-the-art deep-learning algorithms are successful in learning\nhidden, meaningful patterns. However, the quality and the quantity of the\npresented inputs is pivotal. Here, we propose a novel feature extraction method\ncalled anchored Short Time Fourier Transform (anchored-STFT), which is an\nadvanced version of STFT, as it minimizes the trade-off between temporal and\nspectral resolution presented by STFT. In addition, we propose a novel\naugmentation method, called gradient norm adversarial augmentation (GNAA). GNAA\nis not only an augmentation method but is also used to harness adversarial\ninputs in EEG data, which not only improves the classification accuracy but\nalso enhances the robustness of the classifier. In addition, we also propose a\nnew CNN architecture, namely Skip-Net, for the classification of EEG signals.\nThe proposed pipeline outperforms all state-of-the-art methods and yields an\naverage classification accuracy of 90.7 % and 89.54 % on BCI competition II\ndataset III and BCI competition IV dataset 2b, respectively.",

While recent advances have been made in\nimitation learning and batch (offline) reinforcement learning, a lack of\nopen-source human datasets and reproducible learning methods make assessing the\nstate of the field difficult. In this paper, we conduct an extensive study of\nsix offline learning algorithms for robot manipulation on five simulated and\nthree real-world multi-stage manipulation tasks of varying complexity, and with\ndatasets of varying quality. Our study analyzes the most critical challenges\nwhen learning from offline human data for manipulation. Based on the study, we\nderive a series of lessons including the sensitivity to different algorithmic\ndesign choices, the dependence on the quality of the demonstrations, and the\nvariability based on the stopping criteria due to the different objectives in\ntraining and evaluation. We also highlight opportunities for learning from\nhuman datasets, such as the ability to learn proficient policies on\nchallenging, multi-stage tasks beyond the scope of current reinforcement\nlearning methods, and the ability to easily scale to natural, real-world\nmanipulation scenarios where only raw sensory signals are available.

          "description": "Digital hardware is verified by comparing its behavior against a reference\nmodel on a range of randomly generated input signals. The random generation of\nthe inputs hopes to achieve sufficient coverage of the different parts of the\ndesign. However, such coverage is often difficult to achieve, amounting to\nlarge verification efforts and delays. An alternative is to use Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) to generate the inputs by learning to prioritize those inputs\nwhich can more efficiently explore the design under test. In this work, we\npresent VeRLPy an open-source library to allow RL-driven verification with\nlimited additional engineering overhead. This contributes to two broad\nmovements within the EDA community of (a) moving to open-source toolchains and\n(b) reducing barriers for development with Python support. We also demonstrate\nthe use of VeRLPy for a few designs and establish its value over randomly\ngenerated input signals.",

          "description": "Few-shot learning (FSL) is a central problem in meta-learning, where learners\nmust quickly adapt to new tasks given limited training data. Surprisingly,\nrecent works have outperformed meta-learning methods tailored to FSL by casting\nit as standard supervised learning to jointly classify all classes shared\nacross tasks. However, this approach violates the standard FSL setting by\nrequiring global labels shared across tasks, which are often unavailable in\npractice. In this paper, we show why solving FSL via standard classification is\ntheoretically advantageous. This motivates us to propose Meta Label Learning\n(MeLa), a novel algorithm that infers global labels and obtains robust few-shot\nmodels via standard classification. Empirically, we demonstrate that MeLa\noutperforms meta-learning competitors and is comparable to the oracle setting\nwhere ground truth labels are given. We provide extensive ablation studies to\nhighlight the key properties of the proposed strategy.",

          "description": "While recent studies on semi-supervised learning have shown remarkable\nprogress in leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, most of them presume a\nbasic setting of the model is randomly initialized. In this work, we consider\nsemi-supervised learning and transfer learning jointly, leading to a more\npractical and competitive paradigm that can utilize both powerful pre-trained\nmodels from source domain as well as labeled/unlabeled data in the target\ndomain. To better exploit the value of both pre-trained weights and unlabeled\ntarget examples, we introduce adaptive consistency regularization that consists\nof two complementary components: Adaptive Knowledge Consistency (AKC) on the\nexamples between the source and target model, and Adaptive Representation\nConsistency (ARC) on the target model between labeled and unlabeled examples.\nExamples involved in the consistency regularization are adaptively selected\naccording to their potential contributions to the target task. We conduct\nextensive experiments on popular benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and\nMURA, by fine-tuning the ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-50 model. Results show\nthat our proposed adaptive consistency regularization outperforms\nstate-of-the-art semi-supervised learning techniques such as Pseudo Label, Mean\nTeacher, and FixMatch. Moreover, our algorithm is orthogonal to existing\nmethods and thus able to gain additional improvements on top of MixMatch and\nFixMatch.

However,\nthe transmission line parameters are dynamic and cannot be accurately known\nduring operation and thus the involved modeling errors should not be neglected.\nIn this paper, an illustrative case has revealed that modeling errors in\ntransmission lines significantly weaken the detection effectiveness of\nconventional FDIA approaches. To tackle this issue, we propose an FDIA\ndetection mechanism from the perspective of transfer learning. Specifically,\nthe simulated power system is treated as a source domain, which provides\nabundant simulated normal and attack data. The real world's running system\nwhose transmission line parameters are unknown is taken as a target domain\nwhere sufficient real normal data are collected for tracking the latest system\nstates online. The designed transfer strategy that aims at making full use of\ndata in hand is divided into two optimization stages. In the first stage, a\ndeep neural network (DNN) is built by simultaneously optimizing several\nwell-designed objective terms with both simulated data and real data, and then\nit is fine-tuned via real data in the second stage. Several case studies on the\nIEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nmechanism.",

By performing experiments in their environment, they are able to\ndiscern the causal factors of variation and infer how they affect the world's\ndynamics. Inspired by this, we attempt to equip reinforcement learning agents\nwith the ability to perform experiments that facilitate a categorization of the\nrolled-out trajectories, and to subsequently infer the causal factors of the\nenvironment in a hierarchical manner. We introduce {\\em causal curiosity}, a\nnovel intrinsic reward, and show that it allows our agents to learn optimal\nsequences of actions and discover causal factors in the dynamics of the\nenvironment. The learned behavior allows the agents to infer a binary quantized\nrepresentation for the ground-truth causal factors in every environment.\nAdditionally, we find that these experimental behaviors are semantically\nmeaningful (e.g., our agents learn to lift blocks to categorize them by\nweight), and are learnt in a self-supervised manner with approximately 2.5\ntimes less data than conventional supervised planners. We show that these\nbehaviors can be re-purposed and fine-tuned (e.g., from lifting to pushing or\nother downstream tasks).

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have boosted the performance for many\ngraph-related tasks. Despite the great success, recent studies have shown that\nGNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where adversaries can\nmislead the GNNs' prediction by modifying graphs. On the other hand, the\nexplanation of GNNs (GNNExplainer) provides a better understanding of a trained\nGNN model by generating a small subgraph and features that are most influential\nfor its prediction. In this paper, we first perform empirical studies to\nvalidate that GNNExplainer can act as an inspection tool and have the potential\nto detect the adversarial perturbations for graphs. This finding motivates us\nto further initiate a new problem investigation: Whether a graph neural network\nand its explanations can be jointly attacked by modifying graphs with malicious\ndesires? It is challenging to answer this question since the goals of\nadversarial attacks and bypassing the GNNExplainer essentially contradict each\nother. In this work, we give a confirmative answer to this question by\nproposing a novel attack framework (GEAttack), which can attack both a GNN\nmodel and its explanations by simultaneously exploiting their vulnerabilities.\nExtensive experiments on two explainers (GNNExplainer and PGExplainer) under\nvarious real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.",

          "description": "While the celebrated graph neural networks yield effective representations\nfor individual nodes of a graph, there has been relatively less success in\nextending to the task of graph similarity learning. Recent work on graph\nsimilarity learning has considered either global-level graph-graph interactions\nor low-level node-node interactions, however ignoring the rich cross-level\ninteractions (e.g., between each node of one graph and the other whole graph).\nIn this paper, we propose a multi-level graph matching network (MGMN) framework\nfor computing the graph similarity between any pair of graph-structured objects\nin an end-to-end fashion. In particular, the proposed MGMN consists of a\nnode-graph matching network for effectively learning cross-level interactions\nbetween each node of one graph and the other whole graph, and a siamese graph\nneural network to learn global-level interactions between two input graphs.\nFurthermore, to compensate for the lack of standard benchmark datasets, we have\ncreated and collected a set of datasets for both the graph-graph classification\nand graph-graph regression tasks with different sizes in order to evaluate the\neffectiveness and robustness of our models. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MGMN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models\non both the graph-graph classification and graph-graph regression tasks.\nCompared with previous work, MGMN also exhibits stronger robustness as the\nsizes of the two input graphs increase.",

However, it is\nchallenging to make full use of the complementarity among\nspatial-spectral-temporal domain features for emotion recognition, as well as\nmodel the heterogeneity and correlation among multi-modal signals. In this\npaper, we propose a novel two-stream heterogeneous graph recurrent neural\nnetwork, named HetEmotionNet, fusing multi-modal physiological signals for\nemotion recognition. Specifically, HetEmotionNet consists of the\nspatial-temporal stream and the spatial-spectral stream, which can fuse\nspatial-spectral-temporal domain features in a unified framework. Each stream\nis composed of the graph transformer network for modeling the heterogeneity,\nthe graph convolutional network for modeling the correlation, and the gated\nrecurrent unit for capturing the temporal domain or spectral domain dependency.\nExtensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed\nmodel achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines.",

          "description": "Time-series data are one of the fundamental types of raw data representation\nused in data-driven techniques. In machine condition monitoring, time-series\nvibration data are overly used in data mining for deep neural networks.\nTypically, vibration data is converted into images for classification using\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs), and scalograms are the most effective form of\nimage representation. However, the DNN classifiers require huge labeled\ntraining samples to reach their optimum performance. So, many forms of data\naugmentation techniques are applied to the classifiers to compensate for the\nlack of training samples. However, the scalograms are graphical representations\nwhere the existing augmentation techniques suffer because they either change\nthe graphical meaning or have too much noise in the samples that change the\nphysical meaning. In this study, a data augmentation technique named ensemble\naugmentation is proposed to overcome this limitation. This augmentation method\nuses the power of white noise added in ensembles to the original samples to\ngenerate real-like samples. After averaging the signal with ensembles, a new\nsignal is obtained that contains the characteristics of the original signal.\nThe parameters for the ensemble augmentation are validated using a simulated\nsignal. The proposed method is evaluated using 10 class bearing vibration data\nusing three state-of-the-art Transfer Learning (TL) models, namely,\nInception-V3, MobileNet-V2, and ResNet50. Augmented samples are generated in\ntwo increments: the first increment generates the same number of fake samples\nas the training samples, and in the second increment, the number of samples is\nincreased gradually. The outputs from the proposed method are compared with no\naugmentation, augmentations using deep convolution generative adversarial\nnetwork (DCGAN), and several geometric transformation-based augmentations...",

In this problem, the system comprises multiple agents,\neach having a set of local data points, that are connected to a server. The\ngoal for the agents is to compute a linear mathematical model that optimally\nfits the collective data points held by all the agents, without sharing their\nindividual local data points. This goal can be achieved, in principle, using\nthe server-agent variant of the traditional iterative gradient-descent method.\nThe gradient-descent method converges linearly to a solution, and its rate of\nconvergence is lower bounded by the conditioning of the agents' collective data\npoints. If the data points are ill-conditioned, the gradient-descent method may\nrequire a large number of iterations to converge.\n\nWe propose an iterative pre-conditioning technique that mitigates the\ndeleterious effect of the conditioning of data points on the rate of\nconvergence of the gradient-descent method. We rigorously show that the\nresulting pre-conditioned gradient-descent method, with the proposed iterative\npre-conditioning, achieves superlinear convergence when the least-squares\nproblem has a unique solution. In general, the convergence is linear with\nimproved rate of convergence in comparison to the traditional gradient-descent\nmethod and the state-of-the-art accelerated gradient-descent methods.

          "description": "Deep neural network (DNN) models have achieved phenomenal success for\napplications in many domains, ranging from academic research in science and\nengineering to industry and business. The modeling power of DNN is believed to\nhave come from the complexity and over-parameterization of the model, which on\nthe other hand has been criticized for the lack of interpretation. Although\ncertainly not true for every application, in some applications, especially in\neconomics, social science, healthcare industry, and administrative decision\nmaking, scientists or practitioners are resistant to use predictions made by a\nblack-box system for multiple reasons. One reason is that a major purpose of a\nstudy can be to make discoveries based upon the prediction function, e.g., to\nreveal the relationships between measurements. Another reason can be that the\ntraining dataset is not large enough to make researchers feel completely sure\nabout a purely data-driven result. Being able to examine and interpret the\nprediction function will enable researchers to connect the result with existing\nknowledge or gain insights about new directions to explore. Although classic\nstatistical models are much more explainable, their accuracy often falls\nconsiderably below DNN. In this paper, we propose an approach to fill the gap\nbetween relatively simple explainable models and DNN such that we can more\nflexibly tune the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. Our main\nidea is a mixture of discriminative models that is trained with the guidance\nfrom a DNN. Although mixtures of discriminative models have been studied\nbefore, our way of generating the mixture is quite different.",

          "description": "With the growing use of ML in highly consequential domains, quantifying\ndisparity with respect to protected attributes, e.g., gender, race, etc., is\nimportant. While quantifying disparity is essential, sometimes the needs of an\noccupation may require the use of certain features that are critical in a way\nthat any disparity that can be explained by them might need to be exempted.\nE.g., in hiring a software engineer for a safety-critical application,\ncoding-skills may be weighed strongly, whereas name, zip code, or reference\nletters may be used only to the extent that they do not add disparity. In this\nwork, we propose an information-theoretic decomposition of the total disparity\n(a quantification inspired from counterfactual fairness) into two components: a\nnon-exempt component which quantifies the part that cannot be accounted for by\nthe critical features, and an exempt component that quantifies the remaining\ndisparity. This decomposition allows one to check if the disparity arose purely\ndue to the critical features (inspired from the business necessity defense of\ndisparate impact law) and also enables selective removal of the non-exempt\ncomponent if desired. We arrive at this decomposition through canonical\nexamples that lead to a set of desirable properties (axioms) that a measure of\nnon-exempt disparity should satisfy. Our proposed measure satisfies all of\nthem. Our quantification bridges ideas of causality, Simpson's paradox, and a\nbody of work from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition.\nWe also obtain an impossibility result showing that no observational measure\ncan satisfy all the desirable properties, leading us to relax our goals and\nexamine observational measures that satisfy only some of them.

Bengali texts are first comprehensively preprocessed, before\nclassifying them into political, personal, geopolitical, and religious hates\nusing a neural ensemble method of transformer-based neural architectures (i.e.,\nmonolingual Bangla BERT-base, multilingual BERT-cased/uncased, and\nXLM-RoBERTa). Important(most and least) terms are then identified using\nsensitivity analysis and layer-wise relevance propagation(LRP), before\nproviding human-interpretable explanations. Finally, we compute\ncomprehensiveness and sufficiency scores to measure the quality of explanations\nw.r.t faithfulness. Evaluations against machine learning~(linear and tree-based\nmodels) and neural networks (i.e., CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM with word\nembeddings) baselines yield F1-scores of 78%, 91%, 89%, and 84%, for political,\npersonal, geopolitical, and religious hates, respectively, outperforming both\nML and DNN baselines.",

Most recent waterdrop removal\napproaches take a single image as input and often fail to recover the missing\ncontent behind waterdrops faithfully. Thus, we propose a learning-based model\nfor waterdrop removal with stereo images. To better detect and remove\nwaterdrops from stereo images, we propose a novel row-wise dilated attention\nmodule to enlarge attention's receptive field for effective information\npropagation between the two stereo images. In addition, we propose an attention\nconsistency loss between the ground-truth disparity map and attention scores to\nenhance the left-right consistency in stereo images.

It is particularly\nuseful when the target domain has very few or no labeled data, due to\nannotation expense, privacy concerns, etc. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of\nTL is not always guaranteed. Negative transfer (NT), i.e., leveraging source\ndomain data/knowledge undesirably reduces the learning performance in the\ntarget domain, has been a long-standing and challenging problem in TL. Various\napproaches have been proposed in the literature to handle it. However, there\ndoes not exist a systematic survey on the formulation of NT, the factors\nleading to NT, and the algorithms that mitigate NT. This paper fills this gap,\nby first introducing the definition of NT and its factors, then reviewing about\nfifty representative approaches for overcoming NT, according to four\ncategories: secure transfer, domain similarity estimation, distant transfer,\nand NT mitigation.

New technologies, like network\nfunction virtualization and software-defined networking, have been incorporated\nin the 5G core network (5GCN) architecture to enable this transition. This has\nresulted in significant improvements in efficiency, performance, and robustness\nof the networks. However, this has also made the core network more vulnerable,\nas software systems are generally easier to compromise than hardware systems.\nIn this article, we present a comprehensive security analysis framework for the\n5GCN. The novelty of this approach lies in the creation and analysis of attack\ngraphs of the software-defined and virtualized 5GCN through machine learning.\nThis analysis points to 119 novel possible exploits in the 5GCN. We demonstrate\nthat these possible exploits of 5GCN vulnerabilities generate five novel\nattacks on the 5G Authentication and Key Agreement protocol. We combine the\nattacks at the network, protocol, and the application layers to generate\ncomplex attack vectors. In a case study, we use these attack vectors to find\nfour novel security loopholes in WhatsApp running on a 5G network.",

          "description": "Transformer neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results for\nunstructured data such as text and images but their adoption for\ngraph-structured data has been limited. This is partly due to the difficulty in\nincorporating complex structural information in the basic transformer\nframework. We propose a simple yet powerful extension to the transformer -\nresidual edge channels. The resultant framework, which we call Edge-augmented\nGraph Transformer (EGT), can directly accept, process and output structural\ninformation as well as node information. This simple addition allows us to use\nglobal self-attention, the key element of transformers, directly for graphs and\ncomes with the benefit of long-range interaction among nodes. Moreover, the\nedge channels allow the structural information to evolve from layer to layer,\nand prediction tasks on edges can be derived directly from these channels. In\naddition to that, we introduce positional encodings based on Singular Value\nDecomposition which can improve the performance of EGT. Our framework, which\nrelies on global node feature aggregation, achieves better performance compared\nto Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), which rely on local feature aggregation\nwithin a neighborhood. We verify the performance of EGT in a supervised\nlearning setting on a wide range of experiments on benchmark datasets. Our\nfindings indicate that convolutional aggregation is not an essential inductive\nbias for graphs and global self-attention can serve as a flexible and adaptive\nalternative to graph convolution.",

          "description": "The work of McCloskey and Cohen popularized the concept of catastrophic\ninterference. They used a neural network that tried to learn addition using two\ngroups of examples as two different tasks. In their case, learning the second\ntask rapidly deteriorated the acquired knowledge about the previous one. This\ncould be a symptom of a fundamental problem: addition is an algorithmic task\nthat should not be learned through pattern recognition. We propose to use a\nneural network with a different architecture that can be trained to recover the\ncorrect algorithm for the addition of binary numbers. We test it in the setting\nproposed by McCloskey and Cohen and training on random examples one by one. The\nneural network not only does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting but it\nimproves its predictive power on unseen pairs of numbers as training\nprogresses. This work emphasizes the importance that neural network\narchitecture has for the emergence of catastrophic forgetting and introduces a\nneural network that is able to learn an algorithm.",

The performance of decentralized SGD is jointly\ninfluenced by communication-efficiency and convergence rate. In this paper, we\npropose a general decentralized federated learning framework to strike a\nbalance between communication-efficiency and convergence performance. The\nproposed framework performs both multiple local updates and multiple inter-node\ncommunications periodically, unifying traditional decentralized SGD methods. We\nestablish strong convergence guarantees for the proposed DFL algorithm without\nthe assumption of convex objective function. The balance of communication and\ncomputation rounds is essential to optimize decentralized federated learning\nunder constrained communication and computation resources. For further\nimproving communication-efficiency of DFL, compressed communication is applied\nto DFL, named DFL with compressed communication (C-DFL). The proposed C-DFL\nexhibits linear convergence for strongly convex objectives.

          "description": "Recent studies unveil the vulnerabilities of deep ranking models, where an\nimperceptible perturbation can trigger dramatic changes in the ranking result.\nWhile previous attempts focus on manipulating absolute ranks of certain\ncandidates, the possibility of adjusting their relative order remains\nunder-explored. In this paper, we formulate a new adversarial attack against\ndeep ranking systems, i.e., the Order Attack, which covertly alters the\nrelative order among a selected set of candidates according to an\nattacker-specified permutation, with limited interference to other unrelated\ncandidates. Specifically, it is formulated as a triplet-style loss imposing an\ninequality chain reflecting the specified permutation. However, direct\noptimization of such white-box objective is infeasible in a real-world attack\nscenario due to various black-box limitations. To cope with them, we propose a\nShort-range Ranking Correlation metric as a surrogate objective for black-box\nOrder Attack to approximate the white-box method. The Order Attack is evaluated\non the Fashion-MNIST and Stanford-Online-Products datasets under both white-box\nand black-box threat models. The black-box attack is also successfully\nimplemented on a major e-commerce platform. Comprehensive experimental\nevaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, revealing a\nnew type of ranking model vulnerability.",

          "description": "User response prediction, which aims to predict the probability that a user\nwill provide a predefined positive response in a given context such as clicking\non an ad or purchasing an item, is crucial to many industrial applications such\nas online advertising, recommender systems, and search ranking. However, due to\nthe high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these\ntasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies\nin predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing\nfeature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order\ncross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing\nmethods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model\narchitecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with\nequal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel\narchitecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross\nnetwork's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at\nthe vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of\ndifferent cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head\nattention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to\nperform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed\nmodel can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets. The results have robustly\ndemonstrated that our proposed model DCAP achieves superior prediction\nperformance compared with the state-of-the-art models.",

This paper\npresents an interactive DR framework where we integrate our new DR method,\ncalled ULCA (unified linear comparative analysis), with an interactive visual\ninterface. ULCA unifies two DR schemes, discriminant analysis and contrastive\nlearning, to support various comparative analysis tasks. To provide flexibility\nfor comparative analysis, we develop an optimization algorithm that enables\nanalysts to interactively refine ULCA results.

The network is trained without ground truth information, based on the\ndifference between the model prediction and the individual time frames of the\nshort-time Fourier transform. Since some of the model parameters do not yield a\nuseful backpropagation gradient, we model them stochastically and employ the\npolicy gradient instead. To provide phase information and account for\ninaccuracies in the dictionary-based representation, we also let the network\noutput a direct prediction, which we then use to resynthesize the audio signals\nfor the individual instruments. Due to the flexibility of the neural network,\ninharmonicity can be incorporated seamlessly and no preprocessing of the input\nspectra is required. Our algorithm yields high-quality separation results with\nparticularly low interference on a variety of different audio samples, both\nacoustic and synthetic, provided that the sample contains enough data for the\ntraining and that the spectral characteristics of the musical instruments are\nsufficiently stable to be approximated by the dictionary.",

Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring\nquality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this\nwork, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe\nthat load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,\ncontrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely\nactivated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can\nsignificantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step\nforward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits\nexperts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This\nstrategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,\nand our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is\nmore effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$\ntrillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in\ncomparison with the recent SOTAs on $2048$ TPU cores.

          "description": "Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws\nincreasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem\nby trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead\nof the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting\nmight make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely\nimbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a\nnovel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP),\nwhich always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all\nintervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably\nintroduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose\nanother criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects\nthe best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during\ninference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly\nnegligible. As far as we are aware, this work is the first to delve into such a\nclassification task and ends up with a promising solution for count interval\npartition.

Our analysis is based on the use of a hyperparameters-dependent\nstochastic differential equation (hp-dependent SDE) that serves as a continuous\nsurrogate for SGD with momentum.

          "description": "Many internet platforms that collect behavioral big data use it to predict\nuser behavior for internal purposes and for their business customers (e.g.,\nadvertisers, insurers, security forces, governments, political consulting\nfirms) who utilize the predictions for personalization, targeting, and other\ndecision-making. Improving predictive accuracy is therefore extremely valuable.\nData science researchers design algorithms, models, and approaches to improve\nprediction. Prediction is also improved with larger and richer data. Beyond\nimproving algorithms and data, platforms can stealthily achieve better\nprediction accuracy by \"pushing\" users' behaviors towards their predicted\nvalues, using behavior modification techniques, thereby demonstrating more\ncertain predictions. Such apparent \"improved\" prediction can unintentionally\nresult from employing reinforcement learning algorithms that combine prediction\nand behavior modification. This strategy is absent from the machine learning\nand statistics literature. Investigating its properties requires integrating\ncausal with predictive notation. To this end, we incorporate Pearl's causal\ndo(.) operator into the predictive vocabulary. We then decompose the expected\nprediction error given behavior modification, and identify the components\nimpacting predictive power. Our derivation elucidates implications of such\nbehavior modification to data scientists, platforms, their customers, and the\nhumans whose behavior is manipulated. Behavior modification can make users'\nbehavior more predictable and even more homogeneous; yet this apparent\npredictability might not generalize when customers use predictions in practice.\nOutcomes pushed towards their predictions can be at odds with customers'\nintentions, and harmful to manipulated users.",

In this paper,\nwe examine the convergence rate of the projected gradient descent (PGD)\nalgorithm for the BP objective. Our analysis allows to identify an inherent\nsource for its faster convergence compared to using the LS objective, while\nmaking only mild assumptions. We also analyze the more general proximal\ngradient method under a relaxed contraction condition on the proximal mapping\nof the prior.

          "description": "Recent studies in multi-agent communicative reinforcement learning (MACRL)\ndemonstrate that multi-agent coordination can be significantly improved when\ncommunication between agents is allowed. Meanwhile, advances in adversarial\nmachine learning (ML) have shown that ML and reinforcement learning (RL) models\nare vulnerable to a variety of attacks that significantly degrade the\nperformance of learned behaviours. However, despite the obvious and growing\nimportance, the combination of adversarial ML and MACRL remains largely\nuninvestigated. In this paper, we make the first step towards conducting\nmessage attacks on MACRL methods. In our formulation, one agent in the\ncooperating group is taken over by an adversary and can send malicious messages\nto disrupt a deployed MACRL-based coordinated strategy during the deployment\nphase. We further our study by developing a defence method via message\nreconstruction. Finally, we address the resulting arms race, i.e., we consider\nthe ability of the malicious agent to adapt to the changing and improving\ndefensive communicative policies of the benign agents. Specifically, we model\nthe adversarial MACRL problem as a two-player zero-sum game and then utilize\nPolicy-Space Response Oracle to achieve communication robustness.

In this\nwork, we demonstrate that convolutional neural network (CNN) can learn from the\ncoefficients of local reduced density matrices to estimate the physical\nparameters of the many-body Hamiltonians, such as coupling strengths and\nmagnetic fields, provided the states as the ground states. We propose QubismNet\nthat consists of two main parts: the Qubism map that visualizes the ground\nstates (or the purified reduced density matrices) as images, and a CNN that\nmaps the images to the target physical parameters. By assuming certain\nconstraints on the training set for the sake of balance, QubismNet exhibits\nimpressive powers of learning and generalization on several quantum spin\nmodels. While the training samples are restricted to the states from certain\nranges of the parameters, QubismNet can accurately estimate the parameters of\nthe states beyond such training regions. For instance, our results show that\nQubismNet can estimate the magnetic fields near the critical point by learning\nfrom the states away from the critical vicinity.

          "description": "The stochastic nature of photovoltaic (PV) power has led both academia and\nindustry to a large amount of research work aiming at the development of\naccurate PV power forecasting models. However, most of those models are based\non machine learning algorithms and are considered as black boxes which do not\nprovide any insight or explanation about their predictions. Therefore, their\ndirect implementation in environments, where transparency is required, and the\ntrust associated with their predictions may be questioned. To this end, we\npropose a two stage probabilistic forecasting framework able to generate highly\naccurate, reliable, and sharp forecasts yet offering full transparency on both\nthe point forecasts and the prediction intervals (PIs). In the first stage, we\nexploit natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) for yielding probabilistic\nforecasts while in the second stage, we calculate the Shapley additive\nexplanation (SHAP) values in order to fully understand why a prediction was\nmade. To highlight the performance and the applicability of the proposed\nframework, real data from two PV parks located in Southern Germany are\nemployed. Initially, the natural gradient boosting is thoroughly compared with\ntwo state-of-the-art algorithms, namely Gaussian process and lower upper bound\nestimation, in a wide range of forecasting metrics. Secondly, a detailed\nanalysis of the model's complex nonlinear relationships and interaction effects\nbetween the various features is presented. The latter allows us to interpret\nthe model, identify some learned physical properties, explain individual\npredictions, reduce the computational requirements for the training without\njeopardizing the model accuracy, detect possible bugs, and gain trust in the\nmodel. Finally, we conclude that the model was able to develop nonlinear\nrelationships following human logic and intuition based on learned physical\nproperties.",

The ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) Kaggle competition\nwas the largest building energy meter machine learning competition ever held\nwith 4,370 participants who submitted 39,403 predictions. The test data set\nincluded two years of hourly electricity, hot water, chilled water, and steam\nreadings from 2,380 meters in 1,448 buildings at 16 locations. This paper\nanalyzes the various sources and types of residual model error from an\naggregation of the competition's top 50 solutions. This analysis reveals the\nlimitations for machine learning using the standard model inputs of historical\nmeter, weather, and basic building metadata. The types of error are classified\naccording to the amount of time errors occur in each instance, abrupt versus\ngradual behavior, the magnitude of error, and whether the error existed on\nsingle buildings or several buildings at once from a single location. The\nresults show machine learning models have errors within a range of\nacceptability on 79.1% of the test data. Lower magnitude model errors occur in\n16.1% of the test data. These discrepancies can likely be addressed through\nadditional training data sources or innovations in machine learning. Higher\nmagnitude errors occur in 4.8% of the test data and are unlikely to be\naccurately predicted regardless of innovation. There is a diversity of error\nbehavior depending on the energy meter type (electricity prediction models have\nunacceptable error in under 10% of test data, while hot water is over 60%) and\nbuilding use type (public service less than 14%, while technology/science is\njust over 46%).",

          "description": "Strategic behavior against sequential learning methods, such as \"click\nframing\" in real recommendation systems, has been widely observed. Motivated by\nsuch behavior we study the problem of combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB)\nunder strategic manipulations of rewards, where each arm can modify the emitted\nreward signals for its own interest. This characterization of the adversarial\nbehavior is a relaxation of previously well-studied settings such as\nadversarial attacks and adversarial corruption. We propose a strategic variant\nof the combinatorial UCB algorithm, which has a regret of at most $O(m\\log T +\nm B_{max})$ under strategic manipulations, where $T$ is the time horizon, $m$\nis the number of arms, and $B_{max}$ is the maximum budget of an arm. We\nprovide lower bounds on the budget for arms to incur certain regret of the\nbandit algorithm. Extensive experiments on online worker selection for\ncrowdsourcing systems, online influence maximization and online recommendations\nwith both synthetic and real datasets corroborate our theoretical findings on\nrobustness and regret bounds, in a variety of regimes of manipulation budgets.",

          "description": "Training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a strict Lipschitz\nconstraint under the l_{2} norm is useful for provable adversarial robustness,\ninterpretable gradients and stable training. While 1-Lipschitz CNNs can be\ndesigned by enforcing a 1-Lipschitz constraint on each layer, training such\nnetworks requires each layer to have an orthogonal Jacobian matrix (for all\ninputs) to prevent gradients from vanishing during backpropagation. A layer\nwith this property is said to be Gradient Norm Preserving (GNP). To construct\nexpressive GNP activation functions, we first prove that the Jacobian of any\nGNP piecewise linear function is only allowed to change via Householder\ntransformations for the function to be continuous. Building on this result, we\nintroduce a class of nonlinear GNP activations with learnable Householder\ntransformations called Householder activations. A householder activation\nparameterized by the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ outputs $(\\mathbf{I} -\n2\\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{v}^{T})\\mathbf{z}$ for its input $\\mathbf{z}$ if\n$\\mathbf{v}^{T}\\mathbf{z} \\leq 0$; otherwise it outputs $\\mathbf{z}$. Existing\nGNP activations such as $\\mathrm{MaxMin}$ can be viewed as special cases of\n$\\mathrm{HH}$ activations for certain settings of these transformations. Thus,\nnetworks with $\\mathrm{HH}$ activations have higher expressive power than those\nwith $\\mathrm{MaxMin}$ activations. Although networks with $\\mathrm{HH}$\nactivations have nontrivial provable robustness against adversarial attacks, we\nfurther boost their robustness by (i) introducing a certificate regularization\nand (ii) relaxing orthogonalization of the last layer of the network. Our\nexperiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our regularized networks with\n$\\mathrm{HH}$ activations lead to significant improvements in both the standard\nand provable robust accuracy over the prior works (gain of 3.65\\% and 4.46\\% on\nCIFAR-100 respectively).",

          "description": "Nowadays many financial derivatives, such as American or Bermudan options,\nare of early exercise type. Often the pricing of early exercise options gives\nrise to high-dimensional optimal stopping problems, since the dimension\ncorresponds to the number of underlying assets. High-dimensional optimal\nstopping problems are, however, notoriously difficult to solve due to the\nwell-known curse of dimensionality. In this work, we propose an algorithm for\nsolving such problems, which is based on deep learning and computes, in the\ncontext of early exercise option pricing, both approximations of an optimal\nexercise strategy and the price of the considered option. The proposed\nalgorithm can also be applied to optimal stopping problems that arise in other\nareas where the underlying stochastic process can be efficiently simulated. We\npresent numerical results for a large number of example problems, which include\nthe pricing of many high-dimensional American and Bermudan options, such as\nBermudan max-call options in up to 5000 dimensions. Most of the obtained\nresults are compared to reference values computed by exploiting the specific\nproblem design or, where available, to reference values from the literature.\nThese numerical results suggest that the proposed algorithm is highly effective\nin the case of many underlyings, in terms of both accuracy and speed.",

This paper proposes a Swarm-Federated Deep Learning\nframework in the IoV system (IoV-SFDL) that integrates SL into the FDL\nframework. The IoV-SFDL organizes vehicles to generate local SL models with\nadjacent vehicles based on the blockchain empowered SL, then aggregates the\nglobal FDL model among different SL groups with a proposed credibility weights\nprediction algorithm. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared\nwith the baseline frameworks, the proposed IoV-SFDL framework achieves a 16.72%\nreduction in edge-to-global communication overhead while improving about 5.02%\nin model performance with the same training iterations.",

          "description": "In this paper, we study PAC learnability and certification of predictions\nunder instance-targeted poisoning attacks, where the adversary who knows the\ntest instance may change a fraction of the training set with the goal of\nfooling the learner at the test instance. Our first contribution is to\nformalize the problem in various settings and to explicitly model subtle\naspects such as the proper or improper nature of the learning, learner's\nrandomness, and whether (or not) adversary's attack can depend on it. Our main\nresult shows that when the budget of the adversary scales sublinearly with the\nsample complexity, (improper) PAC learnability and certification are\nachievable; in contrast, when the adversary's budget grows linearly with the\nsample complexity, the adversary can potentially drive up the expected 0-1 loss\nto one. We also study distribution-specific PAC learning in the same attack\nmodel and show that proper learning with certification is possible for learning\nhalf spaces under natural distributions. Finally, we empirically study the\nrobustness of K nearest neighbour, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron,\nand convolutional neural network on real data sets against targeted-poisoning\nattacks. Our experimental results show that many models, especially\nstate-of-the-art neural networks, are indeed vulnerable to these strong\nattacks.

          "description": "Using simulation to predict the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous\nmaterials has applications ranging from topology optimization to multi-scale\nstructural analysis. However, full-fidelity simulation techniques such as\nFinite Element Analysis can be prohibitively computationally expensive when\nthey are used to explore the massive input parameter space of heterogeneous\nmaterials. Therefore, there has been significant recent interest in machine\nlearning-based models that, once trained, can predict mechanical behavior at a\nfraction of the computational cost. Over the past several years, research in\nthis area has been focused mainly on predicting single Quantities of Interest\n(QoIs). However, there has recently been an increased interest in a more\nchallenging problem: predicting full-field QoI (e.g., displacement/strain\nfields, damage fields) for mechanical problems. Due to the added complexity of\nfull-field information, network architectures that perform well on single QoI\nproblems may perform poorly in the full-field QoI problem setting. The work\npresented in this paper is twofold. First, we made a significant extension to\nthe Mechanical MNIST dataset designed to enable the investigation of full field\nQoI prediction. Specifically, we added Finite Element simulation results of\nquasi-static brittle fracture in a heterogeneous material captured with the\nphase-field method. Second, we established strong baseline performance for\npredicting full-field QoI with MultiRes-WNet architecture. In addition to\npresenting the results in this paper, we have released our model implementation\nand the Mechanical MNIST Crack Path dataset under open-source licenses. We\nanticipate that future researchers will directly use our model architecture on\nrelated datasets and potentially design models that exceed the baseline\nperformance for predicting full-field QoI established in this paper.",

          "description": "Scientific machine learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems\nand PDE discoveries in computational physics. One caveat of current methods\nhowever is the need for large amounts of (clean) data in order to recover full\nsystem responses or underlying physical models. Bayesian methods may be\nparticularly promising to overcome these challenges as they are naturally less\nsensitive to sparse and noisy data. In this paper, we propose to use Bayesian\nneural networks (BNN) in order to: 1) Recover the full system states from\nmeasurement data (e.g. temperature, velocity field, etc.). We use Hamiltonian\nMonte-Carlo to sample the posterior distribution of a deep and dense BNN, and\nshow that it is possible to accurately capture physics of varying complexity\nwithout overfitting. 2) Recover the parameters in the underlying partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) governing the physical system. Using the trained\nBNN as a surrogate of the system response, we generate datasets of derivatives\npotentially comprising the latent PDE of the observed system and perform a\nBayesian linear regression (BLR) between the successive derivatives in space\nand time to recover the original PDE parameters. We take advantage of the\nconfidence intervals on the BNN outputs and introduce the spatial derivative\nvariance into the BLR likelihood to discard the influence of highly uncertain\nsurrogate data points, which allows for more accurate parameter discovery. We\ndemonstrate our approach on a handful of example applied to physics and\nnon-linear dynamics.",

          "description": "In this paper, we revisit the problem of Differentially Private Stochastic\nConvex Optimization (DP-SCO) and provide excess population risks for some\nspecial classes of functions that are faster than the previous results of\ngeneral convex and strongly convex functions. In the first part of the paper,\nwe study the case where the population risk function satisfies the Tysbakov\nNoise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\\theta>1$. Specifically, we first\nshow that under some mild assumptions on the loss functions, there is an\nalgorithm whose output could achieve an upper bound of\n$\\tilde{O}((\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}+\\frac{\\sqrt{d\\log\n\\frac{1}{\\delta}}}{n\\epsilon})^\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta-1})$ for $(\\epsilon,\n\\delta)$-DP when $\\theta\\geq 2$, here $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the\ndimension of the space. Then we address the inefficiency issue, improve the\nupper bounds by $\\text{Poly}(\\log n)$ factors and extend to the case where\n$\\theta\\geq \\bar{\\theta}>1$ for some known $\\bar{\\theta}$. Next we show that\nthe excess population risk of population functions satisfying TNC with\nparameter $\\theta>1$ is always lower bounded by\n$\\Omega((\\frac{d}{n\\epsilon})^\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta-1}) $ and\n$\\Omega((\\frac{\\sqrt{d\\log\n\\frac{1}{\\delta}}}{n\\epsilon})^\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta-1})$ for $\\epsilon$-DP and\n$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP, respectively. In the second part, we focus on a\nspecial case where the population risk function is strongly convex. Unlike the\nprevious studies, here we assume the loss function is {\\em non-negative} and\n{\\em the optimal value of population risk is sufficiently small}. With these\nadditional assumptions, we propose a new method whose output could achieve an\nupper bound of\n$O(\\frac{d\\log\\frac{1}{\\delta}}{n^2\\epsilon^2}+\\frac{1}{n^{\\tau}})$ for any\n$\\tau\\geq 1$ in $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP model if the sample size $n$ is\nsufficiently large.",

          "description": "Incremental learning of semantic segmentation has emerged as a promising\nstrategy for visual scene interpretation in the open- world setting. However,\nit remains challenging to acquire novel classes in an online fashion for the\nsegmentation task, mainly due to its continuously-evolving semantic label\nspace, partial pixelwise ground-truth annotations, and constrained data\navailability. To ad- dress this, we propose an incremental learning strategy\nthat can fast adapt deep segmentation models without catastrophic forgetting,\nusing a streaming input data with pixel annotations on the novel classes only.\nTo this end, we develop a uni ed learning strategy based on the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) framework, which integrates an iterative\nrelabeling strategy that lls in the missing labels and a rehearsal-based\nincremental learning step that balances the stability-plasticity of the model.\nMoreover, our EM algorithm adopts an adaptive sampling method to select\ninformative train- ing data and a class-balancing training strategy in the\nincremental model updates, both improving the e cacy of model learning.

          "description": "In the current deep learning based recommendation system, the embedding\nmethod is generally employed to complete the conversion from the\nhigh-dimensional sparse feature vector to the low-dimensional dense feature\nvector. However, as the dimension of the input vector of the embedding layer is\ntoo large, the addition of the embedding layer significantly slows down the\nconvergence speed of the entire neural network, which is not acceptable in\nreal-world scenarios. In addition, as the interaction between users and items\nincreases and the relationship between items becomes more complicated, the\nembedding method proposed for sequence data is no longer suitable for graphic\ndata in the current real environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the\nDual-modal Graph Embedding Method (DGEM) to solve these problems. DGEM includes\ntwo modes, static and dynamic. We first construct the item graph to extract the\ngraph structure and use random walk of unequal probability to capture the\nhigh-order proximity between the items. Then we generate the graph embedding\nvector through the Skip-Gram model, and finally feed the downstream deep neural\nnetwork for the recommendation task. The experimental results show that DGEM\ncan mine the high-order proximity between items and enhance the expression\nability of the recommendation model. Meanwhile it also improves the\nrecommendation performance by utilizing the time dependent relationship between\nitems.",

To this\nend, this paper develops a distributed and privacy-preserving federated deep\nlearning framework for NILM (FederatedNILM), which combines federated learning\nwith a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture to conduct NILM for the\nclassification of typical states of household appliances.

          "description": "Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) on the graph with real-life\napplications are canonical challenges in Computer Science. The difficulty of\nfinding quality labels for problem instances holds back leveraging supervised\nlearning across combinatorial problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms\nhave recently been adopted to solve this challenge automatically. The\nunderlying principle of this approach is to deploy a graph neural network (GNN)\nfor encoding both the local information of the nodes and the graph-structured\ndata in order to capture the current state of the environment. Then, it is\nfollowed by the actor to learn the problem-specific heuristics on its own and\nmake an informed decision at each state for finally reaching a good solution.\nRecent studies on this subject mainly focus on a family of combinatorial\nproblems on the graph, such as the travel salesman problem, where the proposed\nmodel aims to find an ordering of vertices that optimizes a given objective\nfunction. We use the security-aware phone clone allocation in the cloud as a\nclassical quadratic assignment problem (QAP) to investigate whether or not deep\nRL-based model is generally applicable to solve other classes of such hard\nproblems. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that existing RL-based model may\nnot generalize to QAP.",

However, the\ncomplexity-accuracy-delay dilemma persists: complex DNN models offer higher\naccuracy, but typical IoT devices can barely afford the computation load, and\nthe remedy of offloading the load to the cloud incurs long delay. In this\npaper, we address this challenge by proposing an adaptive anomaly detection\nscheme with hierarchical edge computing (HEC). Specifically, we first construct\nmultiple anomaly detection DNN models with increasing complexity, and associate\neach of them to a corresponding HEC layer. Then, we design an adaptive model\nselection scheme that is formulated as a contextual-bandit problem and solved\nby using a reinforcement learning policy network. We also incorporate a\nparallelism policy training method to accelerate the training process by taking\nadvantage of distributed models. We build an HEC testbed using real IoT\ndevices, implement and evaluate our contextual-bandit approach with both\nunivariate and multivariate IoT datasets. In comparison with both baseline and\nstate-of-the-art schemes, our adaptive approach strikes the best accuracy-delay\ntradeoff on the univariate dataset, and achieves the best accuracy and F1-score\non the multivariate dataset with only negligibly longer delay than the best\n(but inflexible) scheme.",

          "description": "With outstanding features, Machine Learning (ML) has been the backbone of\nnumerous applications in wireless networks. However, the conventional ML\napproaches have been facing many challenges in practical implementation, such\nas the lack of labeled data, the constantly changing wireless environments, the\nlong training process, and the limited capacity of wireless devices. These\nchallenges, if not addressed, will impede the effectiveness and applicability\nof ML in future wireless networks. To address these problems, Transfer Learning\n(TL) has recently emerged to be a very promising solution. The core idea of TL\nis to leverage and synthesize distilled knowledge from similar tasks as well as\nfrom valuable experiences accumulated from the past to facilitate the learning\nof new problems. Doing so, TL techniques can reduce the dependence on labeled\ndata, improve the learning speed, and enhance the ML methods' robustness to\ndifferent wireless environments. This article aims to provide a comprehensive\nsurvey on applications of TL in wireless networks. Particularly, we first\nprovide an overview of TL including formal definitions, classification, and\nvarious types of TL techniques. We then discuss diverse TL approaches proposed\nto address emerging issues in wireless networks. The issues include spectrum\nmanagement, localization, signal recognition, security, human activity\nrecognition and caching, which are all important to next-generation networks\nsuch as 5G and beyond. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues,\nand future research directions of TL in future wireless networks.",

          "description": "As one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning, statistics and\ndifferential privacy, Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization\n(DP-SCO) has been extensively studied in recent years. However, most of the\nprevious work can only handle either regular data distribution or irregular\ndata in the low dimensional space case. To better understand the challenges\narising from irregular data distribution, in this paper we provide the first\nstudy on the problem of DP-SCO with heavy-tailed data in the high dimensional\nspace. In the first part we focus on the problem over some polytope constraint\n(such as the $\\ell_1$-norm ball). We show that if the loss function is smooth\nand its gradient has bounded second order moment, it is possible to get a (high\nprobability) error bound (excess population risk) of $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{\\log\nd}{(n\\epsilon)^\\frac{1}{3}})$ in the $\\epsilon$-DP model, where $n$ is the\nsample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the underlying space. Next, for\nLASSO, if the data distribution that has bounded fourth-order moments, we\nimprove the bound to $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{\\log d}{(n\\epsilon)^\\frac{2}{5}})$ in the\n$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP model. In the second part of the paper, we study sparse\nlearning with heavy-tailed data. We first revisit the sparse linear model and\npropose a truncated DP-IHT method whose output could achieve an error of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{s^{*2}\\log d}{n\\epsilon})$, where $s^*$ is the sparsity of the\nunderlying parameter. Then we study a more general problem over the sparsity\n({\\em i.e.,} $\\ell_0$-norm) constraint, and show that it is possible to achieve\nan error of $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{s^{*\\frac{3}{2}}\\log d}{n\\epsilon})$, which is\nalso near optimal up to a factor of $\\tilde{O}{(\\sqrt{s^*})}$, if the loss\nfunction is smooth and strongly convex.",

          "description": "The activation function is at the heart of a deep neural networks\nnonlinearity; the choice of the function has great impact on the success of\ntraining. Currently, many practitioners prefer the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)\ndue to its simplicity and reliability, despite its few drawbacks. While most\nprevious functions proposed to supplant ReLU have been hand-designed, recent\nwork on learning the function during training has shown promising results. In\nthis paper we propose an adaptive piecewise linear activation function, the\nPiecewise Linear Unit (PiLU), which can be learned independently for each\ndimension of the neural network. We demonstrate how PiLU is a generalised\nrectifier unit and note its similarities with the Adaptive Piecewise Linear\nUnits, namely adaptive and piecewise linear. Across a distribution of 30\nexperiments, we show that for the same model architecture, hyperparameters, and\npre-processing, PiLU significantly outperforms ReLU: reducing classification\nerror by 18.53% on CIFAR-10 and 13.13% on CIFAR-100, for a minor increase in\nthe number of neurons. Further work should be dedicated to exploring\ngeneralised piecewise linear units, as well as verifying these results across\nother challenging domains and larger problems.",

          "description": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are formulated as minimax game\nproblems, whereby generators attempt to approach real data distributions by\nvirtue of adversarial learning against discriminators. The intrinsic problem\ncomplexity poses the challenge to enhance the performance of generative\nnetworks. In this work, we aim to boost model learning from the perspective of\nnetwork architectures, by incorporating recent progress on automated\narchitecture search into GANs. To this end, we propose a fully differentiable\nsearch framework for generative adversarial networks, dubbed alphaGAN. The\nsearching process is formalized as solving a bi-level minimax optimization\nproblem, in which the outer-level objective aims for seeking a suitable network\narchitecture towards pure Nash Equilibrium conditioned on the generator and the\ndiscriminator network parameters optimized with a traditional GAN loss in the\ninner level. The entire optimization performs a first-order method by\nalternately minimizing the two-level objective in a fully differentiable\nmanner, enabling architecture search to be completed in an enormous search\nspace. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets show that our\nalgorithm can obtain high-performing architectures only with 3-GPU hours on a\nsingle GPU in the search space comprised of approximate 2 ? 1011 possible\nconfigurations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis on the behavior of the\nsearching process and the properties of searched architectures, which would\nbenefit further research on architectures for generative models.

Feature similarity includes both the\ninvariance of marginal distributions and the closeness of conditional\ndistributions given the desired response $y$ (e.g., class labels).\nUnfortunately, traditional methods always learn such features without fully\ntaking into consideration the information in $y$, which in turn may lead to a\nmismatch of the conditional distributions or the mix-up of discriminative\nstructures underlying data distributions. In this work, we introduce the\nrecently proposed von Neumann conditional divergence to improve the\ntransferability across multiple domains.

We conjecture that at least part of the\nreason for this is that the input to Networks is not simply the feature\nmagnitudes, but also their indices. In contrast, naive Forest implementations\nfail to explicitly consider feature indices. A recently proposed Forest\napproach demonstrates that Forests, for each node, implicitly sample a random\nmatrix from some specific distribution. These Forests, like some classes of\nNetworks, learn by partitioning the feature space into convex polytopes\ncorresponding to linear functions. We build on that approach and show that one\ncan choose distributions in a manifold-aware fashion to incorporate feature\nlocality. We demonstrate the empirical performance on data whose features live\non three different manifolds: a torus, images, and time-series. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate its strength in multivariate simulated settings and also show\nsuperiority in predicting surgical outcome in epilepsy patients and predicting\nmovement direction from raw stereotactic EEG data from non-motor brain regions.\nIn all simulations and real data, Manifold Oblique Random Forest (MORF)\nalgorithm outperforms approaches that ignore feature space structure and\nchallenges the performance of ConvNets. Moreover, MORF runs fast and maintains\ninterpretability and theoretical justification.",

By means of\nan extensive literature review this study therefore offers the first\ntheoretically principled and domain-independent typology of data anomalies and\npresents a full overview of anomaly types and subtypes. To concretely define\nthe concept of the anomaly and its different manifestations, the typology\nemploys five dimensions: data type, cardinality of relationship, anomaly level,\ndata structure, and data distribution. These fundamental and data-centric\ndimensions naturally yield 3 broad groups, 9 basic types, and 63 subtypes of\nanomalies. The typology facilitates the evaluation of the functional\ncapabilities of anomaly detection algorithms, contributes to explainable data\nscience, and provides insights into relevant topics such as local versus global\nanomalies.",

Intraoperative diagnosis\ncan be challenging due to tumor diversity and lack of intraoperative pathology\nresources.\n\nObjective: To develop an independent and parallel intraoperative pathology\nworkflow that can provide rapid and accurate skull base tumor diagnoses using\nlabel-free optical imaging and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMethod: We used a fiber laser-based, label-free, non-consumptive,\nhigh-resolution microscopy method ($<$ 60 sec per 1 $\\times$ 1 mm$^\\text{2}$),\ncalled stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a consecutive, multicenter\ncohort of skull base tumor patients. SRH images were then used to train a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) model using three representation learning\nstrategies: cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised\ncontrastive learning. Our trained CNN models were tested on a held-out,\nmulticenter SRH dataset.\n\nResults: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of both benign and\nmalignant skull base tumors. Of the three representation learning strategies,\nsupervised contrastive learning most effectively learned the distinctive and\ndiagnostic SRH image features for each of the skull base tumor types. In our\nmulticenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy\nof 91.5%, self-supervised contrastive learning 83.9%, and supervised\ncontrastive learning 96.6%.

This results in a large\nperformance boost to distinguish between standard model (SM) only and SM plus\nnew physics signals. We use the kinematic monojet features as input data which\nallow us to describe families of models with a single data sample.

Domain experts are interested in error measures\nrelevant for their decision making needs. Such measures may produce unreliable\nresults. Although reliability properties of several metrics have already been\ndiscussed, it has hardly been quantified in an objective way. We propose a\nmeasure named Rank Stability, which evaluates how much the rankings of an\nexperiment differ in between similar datasets, when the models and errors are\nconstant. We use this to study the evaluation setup of the M5. We find that the\nevaluation setup of the M5 is less reliable than other measures. The main\ndrivers of instability are hierarchical aggregation and scaling.\nPrice-weighting reduces the stability of all tested error measures. Scale\nnormalization of the M5 error measure results in less stability than other\nscale-free errors. Hierarchical levels taken separately are less stable with\nmore aggregation, and their combination is even less stable than individual\nlevels. We also show positive tradeoffs of retaining aggregation importance\nwithout affecting stability. Aggregation and stability can be linked to the\ninfluence of much debated magic numbers.

          "description": "Quantization is a technique for reducing deep neural networks (DNNs) training\nand inference times, which is crucial for training in resource constrained\nenvironments or time critical inference applications. State-of-the-art (SOTA)\nquantization approaches focus on post-training quantization, i.e. quantization\nof pre-trained DNNs for speeding up inference. Very little work on quantized\ntraining exists, which neither al-lows dynamic intra-epoch precision switches\nnor em-ploys an information theory based switching heuristic. Usually, existing\napproaches require full precision refinement afterwards and enforce a global\nword length across the whole DNN. This leads to suboptimal quantization\nmappings and resource usage. Recognizing these limits, we introduce MARViN, a\nnew quantized training strategy using information theory-based intra-epoch\nprecision switching, which decides on a per-layer basis which precision should\nbe used in order to minimize quantization-induced information loss. Note that\nany quantization must leave enough precision such that future learning steps do\nnot suffer from vanishing gradients.

The amount of sensors in novel industry systems makes the anomaly\ndetection process quite difficult for humans. Algorithms which automates the\nprocess of detecting anomalies are crucial in modern failure-prevention\nsystems. Therefore, many machine and deep learning models have been designed to\naddress this problem. Mostly, they are autoencoder-based architectures with\nsome generative adversarial elements. In this work, a framework is shown which\nincorporates neuroevolution methods to boost the anomaly-detection scores of\nnew and already known models. The presented approach adapts evolution\nstrategies for evolving ensemble model, in which every single model works on a\nsubgroup of data sensors. The next goal of neuroevolution is to optimise\narchitecture and hyperparameters like window size, the number of layers, layer\ndepths, etc. The proposed framework shows that it is possible to boost most of\nthe anomaly detection deep learning models in a reasonable time and a fully\nautomated mode. The tests were run on SWAT and WADI datasets. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first approach in which an ensemble deep learning anomaly detection\nmodel is built in a fully automatic way using a neuroevolution strategy.",

Multiple defenses have been proposed to increase the robustness of\nDNNs. In general, these defenses have high overhead, some require\nattack-specific re-training of the model or careful tuning to adapt to\ndifferent attacks.\n\nThis paper presents HASI, a hardware-accelerated defense that uses a process\nwe call stochastic inference to detect adversarial inputs. We show that by\ncarefully injecting noise into the model at inference time, we can\ndifferentiate adversarial inputs from benign ones. HASI uses the output\ndistribution characteristics of noisy inference compared to a non-noisy\nreference to detect adversarial inputs. We show an adversarial detection rate\nof 86% when applied to VGG16 and 93% when applied to ResNet50, which exceeds\nthe detection rate of the state of the art approaches, with a much lower\noverhead.

          "description": "As people spend up to 87% of their time indoors, intelligent Heating,\nVentilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings are essential for\nmaintaining occupant comfort and reducing energy consumption. These HVAC\nsystems in smart buildings rely on real-time sensor readings, which in practice\noften suffer from various faults and could also be vulnerable to malicious\nattacks. Such faulty sensor inputs may lead to the violation of indoor\nenvironment requirements (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) and the increase\nof energy consumption. While many model-based approaches have been proposed in\nthe literature for building HVAC control, it is costly to develop accurate\nphysical models for ensuring their performance and even more challenging to\naddress the impact of sensor faults. In this work, we present a novel\nlearning-based framework for sensor fault-tolerant HVAC control, which includes\nthree deep learning based components for 1) generating temperature proposals\nwith the consideration of possible sensor faults, 2) selecting one of the\nproposals based on the assessment of their accuracy, and 3) applying\nreinforcement learning with the selected temperature proposal. Moreover, to\naddress the challenge of training data insufficiency in building-related tasks,\nwe propose a model-assisted learning method leveraging an abstract model of\nbuilding physical dynamics. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\nthe proposed fault-tolerant HVAC control framework can significantly reduce\nbuilding temperature violations under a variety of sensor fault patterns while\nmaintaining energy efficiency.",

          "description": "A basic requirement for a mathematical model is often that its solution\n(output) shouldn't change much if the model's parameters (input) are perturbed.\nThis is important because the exact values of parameters may not be known and\none would like to avoid being mislead by an output obtained using incorrect\nvalues. Thus, it's rarely enough to address an application by formulating a\nmodel, solving the resulting optimization problem and presenting the solution\nas the answer. One would need to confirm that the model is suitable, i.e.,\n\"good,\" and this can, at least in part, be achieved by considering a family of\noptimization problems constructed by perturbing parameters of concern. The\nresulting sensitivity analysis uncovers troubling situations with unstable\nsolutions, which we referred to as \"bad\" models, and indicates better model\nformulations. Embedding an actual problem of interest within a family of\nproblems is also a primary path to optimality conditions as well as\ncomputationally attractive, alternative problems, which under ideal\ncircumstances, and when properly tuned, may even furnish the minimum value of\nthe actual problem. The tuning of these alternative problems turns out to be\nintimately tied to finding multipliers in optimality conditions and thus\nemerges as a main component of several optimization algorithms. In fact, the\ntuning amounts to solving certain dual optimization problems. In this tutorial,\nwe'll discuss the opportunities and insights afforded by this broad\nperspective.",

          "description": "In CS literature, the efforts can be divided into two groups: finding a\nmeasurement matrix that preserves the compressed information at the maximum\nlevel, and finding a reconstruction algorithm for the compressed information.\nIn the traditional CS setup, the measurement matrices are selected as random\nmatrices, and optimization-based iterative solutions are used to recover the\nsignals. However, when we handle large signals, using random matrices become\ncumbersome especially when it comes to iterative optimization-based solutions.\nEven though recent deep learning-based solutions boost the reconstruction\naccuracy performance while speeding up the recovery, still jointly learning the\nwhole measurement matrix is a difficult process. In this work, we introduce a\nseparable multi-linear learning of the CS matrix by representing it as the\nsummation of arbitrary number of tensors. For a special case where the CS\noperation is set as a single tensor multiplication, the model is reduced to the\nlearning-based separable CS; while a dense CS matrix can be approximated and\nlearned as the summation of multiple tensors. Both cases can be used in CS of\ntwo or multi-dimensional signals e.g., images, multi-spectral images, videos,\netc. Structural CS matrices can also be easily approximated and learned in our\nmulti-linear separable learning setup with structural tensor sum\nrepresentation. Hence, our learnable generalized tensor summation CS operation\nencapsulates most CS setups including separable CS, non-separable CS\n(traditional vector-matrix multiplication), structural CS, and CS of the\nmulti-dimensional signals. For both gray-scale and RGB images, the proposed\nscheme surpasses most state-of-the-art solutions, especially in lower\nmeasurement rates. Although the performance gain remains limited from tensor to\nthe sum of tensor representation for gray-scale images, it becomes significant\nin the RGB case.",

          "description": "Active learning (AL) aims at reducing labeling effort by identifying the most\nvaluable unlabeled data points from a large pool. Traditional AL frameworks\nhave two limitations: First, they perform data selection in a multi-round\nmanner, which is time-consuming and impractical. Second, they usually assume\nthat there are a small amount of labeled data points available in the same\ndomain as the data in the unlabeled pool. Recent work proposes a solution for\none-round active learning based on data utility learning and optimization,\nwhich fixes the first issue but still requires the initially labeled data\npoints in the same domain. In this paper, we propose $\\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ as a\nsolution that solves both issues. Specifically, $\\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ leverages the\nidea of domain adaptation (DA) to train a data utility model which can\neffectively predict the utility for any given unlabeled data in the target\ndomain once labeled. The trained data utility model can then be used to select\nhigh-utility data and at the same time, provide an estimate for the utility of\nthe selected data. Our algorithm does not rely on any feedback from annotators\nin the target domain and hence, can be used to perform zero-round active\nlearning or warm-start existing multi-round active learning strategies. Our\nexperiments show that $\\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ outperforms the existing\nstate-of-the-art AL strategies equipped with domain adaptation over various\ndomain shift settings (e.g., real-to-real data and synthetic-to-real data).\nParticularly, $\\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ is applicable to the scenario where source and\ntarget labels have mismatches, which is not supported by the existing works.",

          "description": "The goal of representation learning is different from the ultimate objective\nof machine learning such as decision making, it is therefore very difficult to\nestablish clear and direct objectives for training representation learning\nmodels. It has been argued that a good representation should disentangle the\nunderlying variation factors, yet how to translate this into training\nobjectives remains unknown. This paper presents an attempt to establish direct\ntraining criterions and design principles for developing good representation\nlearning models. We propose that a good representation learning model should be\nmaximally expressive, i.e., capable of distinguishing the maximum number of\ninput configurations. We formally define expressiveness and introduce the\nmaximum expressiveness (MEXS) theorem of a general learning model. We propose\nto train a model by maximizing its expressiveness while at the same time\nincorporating general priors such as model smoothness. We present a conscience\ncompetitive learning algorithm which encourages the model to reach its MEXS\nwhilst at the same time adheres to model smoothness prior. We also introduce a\nlabel consistent training (LCT) technique to boost model smoothness by\nencouraging it to assign consistent labels to similar samples. We present\nextensive experimental results to show that our method can indeed design\nrepresentation learning models capable of developing representations that are\nas good as or better than state of the art. We also show that our technique is\ncomputationally efficient, robust against different parameter settings and can\nwork effectively on a variety of datasets.

Therefore, the information present in a speech such\nas message, emotion, language, speaker is due to the combined effect of both\nexcitation source and vocal tract system. However, there is very less\nutilization of excitation source features to recognize emotion. In our earlier\nwork, we have proposed a novel method to extract glottal closure instants\n(GCIs) known as epochs.

DNN-HMM speaker adaptive models\nhave been developed using MFCC, epoch and combined features. IEMOCAP emotional\ndatabase has been used to evaluate the models.

The Fisheries and Aquatic Department (FAD) of\nthe United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) issued a report\nwhich indicated that the annual losses due to IUU fishing reached $25 Billion.\nThis imposes negative impacts on the future-biodiversity of the marine\necosystem and domestic Gross National Product (GNP). Hence, robust interception\nmechanisms are increasingly needed for detecting and pursuing the unrelenting\nillegal fishing incidents in maritime territories. This article addresses the\nproblem of coordinating the motion of a fleet of marine vessels (pursuers) to\ncatch an IUU vessel while still in local waters. The problem is formulated as a\npursuer-evader problem that is tackled within an ML framework. One or more\npursuers, such as law enforcement vessels, intercept an evader (i.e., the\nillegal fishing ship) using an online reinforcement learning mechanism that is\nbased on a value iteration process. It employs real-time navigation\nmeasurements of the evader ship as well as those of the pursuing vessels and\nreturns back model-free interception strategies.",

          "description": "In many sequence learning tasks, such as program synthesis and document\nsummarization, a key problem is searching over a large space of possible output\nsequences. We propose to learn representations of the outputs that are\nspecifically meant for search: rich enough to specify the desired output but\ncompact enough to make search more efficient. Discrete latent codes are\nappealing for this purpose, as they naturally allow sophisticated combinatorial\nsearch strategies. The latent codes are learned using a self-supervised\nlearning principle, in which first a discrete autoencoder is trained on the\noutput sequences, and then the resulting latent codes are used as intermediate\ntargets for the end-to-end sequence prediction task. Based on these insights,\nwe introduce the \\emph{Latent Programmer}, a program synthesis method that\nfirst predicts a discrete latent code from input/output examples, and then\ngenerates the program in the target language. We evaluate the Latent Programmer\non two domains: synthesis of string transformation programs, and generation of\nprograms from natural language descriptions. We demonstrate that the discrete\nlatent representation significantly improves synthesis accuracy.",

Recent work has studied approximate gradient coding, which\nconcerns coding schemes where the replication factor of the data is too low to\nrecover the full gradient exactly. Our work is motivated by the challenge of\ncreating approximate gradient coding schemes that simultaneously work well in\nboth the adversarial and stochastic models. To that end, we introduce novel\napproximate gradient codes based on expander graphs, in which each machine\nreceives exactly two blocks of data points. We analyze the decoding error both\nin the random and adversarial straggler setting, when optimal decoding\ncoefficients are used. We show that in the random setting, our schemes achieve\nan error to the gradient that decays exponentially in the replication factor.\nIn the adversarial setting, the error is nearly a factor of two smaller than\nany existing code with similar performance in the random setting. We show\nconvergence bounds both in the random and adversarial setting for gradient\ndescent under standard assumptions using our codes. In the random setting, our\nconvergence rate improves upon block-box bounds. In the adversarial setting, we\nshow that gradient descent can converge down to a noise floor that scales\nlinearly with the adversarial error to the gradient.

          "description": "Random reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) digital rocks from\ntwo-dimensional (2D) slices is crucial for elucidating the microstructure of\nrocks and its effects on pore-scale flow in terms of numerical modeling, since\nmassive samples are usually required to handle intrinsic uncertainties. Despite\nremarkable advances achieved by traditional process-based methods, statistical\napproaches and recently famous deep learning-based models, few works have\nfocused on producing several kinds of rocks with one trained model and allowing\nthe reconstructed samples to satisfy certain given properties, such as\nporosity. To fill this gap, we propose a new framework, named RockGPT, which is\ncomposed of VQ-VAE and conditional GPT, to synthesize 3D samples based on a\nsingle 2D slice from the perspective of video generation. The VQ-VAE is\nutilized to compress high-dimensional input video, i.e., the sequence of\ncontinuous rock slices, to discrete latent codes and reconstruct them. In order\nto obtain diverse reconstructions, the discrete latent codes are modeled using\nconditional GPT in an autoregressive manner, while incorporating conditional\ninformation from a given slice, rock type, and porosity. We conduct two\nexperiments on five kinds of rocks, and the results demonstrate that RockGPT\ncan produce different kinds of rocks with the same model, and the reconstructed\nsamples can successfully meet certain specified porosities. In a broader sense,\nthrough leveraging the proposed conditioning scheme, RockGPT constitutes an\neffective way to build a general model to produce multiple kinds of rocks\nsimultaneously that also satisfy user-defined properties.",

Most of these ML techniques employ\ncentralized learning (CL) schemes and assume the availability of datasets at a\nparameter server (PS), demanding the transmission of data from edge devices,\nsuch as mobile phones, to the PS.

This article presents the recent advances in\nFL-based training for physical layer design problems.

          "description": "Adversarial robustness of deep learning models has gained much traction in\nthe last few years. Various attacks and defenses are proposed to improve the\nadversarial robustness of modern-day deep learning architectures. While all\nthese approaches help improve the robustness, one promising direction for\nimproving adversarial robustness is un-explored, i.e., the complex topology of\nthe neural network architecture. In this work, we answer the following\nquestion: \"Can the complex topology of a neural network give adversarial\nrobustness without any form of adversarial training?\" empirically by\nexperimenting with different hand-crafted and NAS based architectures. Our\nfindings show that, for small-scale attacks, NAS-based architectures are more\nrobust for small-scale datasets and simple tasks than hand-crafted\narchitectures. However, as the dataset's size or the task's complexity\nincrease, hand-crafted architectures are more robust than NAS-based\narchitectures. We perform the first large scale study to understand adversarial\nrobustness purely from an architectural perspective. Our results show that\nrandom sampling in the search space of DARTS (a popular NAS method) with simple\nensembling can improve the robustness to PGD attack by nearly ~12\\%. We show\nthat NAS, which is popular for SoTA accuracy, can provide adversarial accuracy\nas a free add-on without any form of adversarial training. Our results show\nthat leveraging the power of neural network topology with methods like\nensembles can be an excellent way to achieve adversarial robustness without any\nform of adversarial training. We also introduce a metric that can be used to\ncalculate the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness.",

There is an extensive amount of\nprevious work focusing on leveraging noisy labels. Most notably, recent work\nhas shown impressive gains by using a meta-learned instance re-weighting\napproach where a meta-learning framework is used to assign instance weights to\nnoisy labels. In this paper, we extend this approach via posing the problem as\nlabel correction problem within a meta-learning framework. We view the label\ncorrection procedure as a meta-process and propose a new meta-learning based\nframework termed MLC (Meta Label Correction) for learning with noisy labels.\nSpecifically, a label correction network is adopted as a meta-model to produce\ncorrected labels for noisy labels while the main model is trained to leverage\nthe corrected labeled. Both models are jointly trained by solving a bi-level\noptimization problem. We run extensive experiments with different label noise\nlevels and types on both image recognition and text classification tasks. We\ncompare the reweighing and correction approaches showing that the correction\nframing addresses some of the limitation of reweighting. We also show that the\nproposed MLC approach achieves large improvements over previous methods in many\nsettings.",

Our goal is to give a rigorous introduction to the\nreaders with prior exposure to ordinary least squares. In machine learning, the\noutput is usually a nonlinear function of the input. Deep learning even aims to\nfind a nonlinear dependence with many layers which require a large amount of\ncomputation. However, most of these algorithms build upon simple linear models.\nWe then describe linear models from different views and find the properties and\ntheories behind the models. The linear model is the main technique in\nregression problems and the primary tool for it is the least squares\napproximation which minimizes a sum of squared errors. This is a natural choice\nwhen we're interested in finding the regression function which minimizes the\ncorresponding expected squared error. This survey is primarily a summary of\npurpose, significance of important theories behind linear models, e.g.,\ndistribution theory, minimum variance estimator. We first describe ordinary\nleast squares from three different points of view upon which we disturb the\nmodel with random noise and Gaussian noise. By Gaussian noise, the model gives\nrise to the likelihood so that we introduce a maximum likelihood estimator. It\nalso develops some distribution theories via this Gaussian disturbance. The\ndistribution theory of least squares will help us answer various questions and\nintroduce related applications. We then prove least squares is the best\nunbiased linear model in the sense of mean squared error and most importantly,\nit actually approaches the theoretical limit. We end up with linear models with\nthe Bayesian approach and beyond.",

Recently, transfer learning has been used\nfor Covid-19 detection using X-ray, ultrasound, and CT scans. One of the major\nlimitations inherent to these proposed methods is limited labeled dataset size\nthat affects the reliability of Covid-19 diagnosis and disease progression. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that how we can augment limited X-ray images data by\nusing Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to train the\nlast layer of the pre-trained deep learning models to mitigate the bias of\ntransfer learning for Covid-19 detection. We transfer learned various\npre-trained deep learning models including AlexNet, ZFNet, VGG-16, ResNet-18,\nand GoogLeNet, and fine-tune the last layer by using CLAHE-augmented dataset.\nThe experiment results reveal that the CLAHE-based augmentation to various\npre-trained deep learning models significantly improves the model efficiency.\nThe pre-trained VCG-16 model with CLAHEbased augmented images achieves a\nsensitivity of 95% using 15 epochs. AlexNet works show good sensitivity when\ntrained on non-augmented data. Other models demonstrate a value of less than\n60% when trained on non-augmented data.

          "description": "Recent works in self-supervised learning have advanced the state-of-the-art\nby relying on the contrastive learning paradigm, which learns representations\nby pushing positive pairs, or similar examples from the same class, closer\ntogether while keeping negative pairs far apart. Despite the empirical\nsuccesses, theoretical foundations are limited -- prior analyses assume\nconditional independence of the positive pairs given the same class label, but\nrecent empirical applications use heavily correlated positive pairs (i.e., data\naugmentations of the same image). Our work analyzes contrastive learning\nwithout assuming conditional independence of positive pairs using a novel\nconcept of the augmentation graph on data. Edges in this graph connect\naugmentations of the same data, and ground-truth classes naturally form\nconnected sub-graphs. We propose a loss that performs spectral decomposition on\nthe population augmentation graph and can be succinctly written as a\ncontrastive learning objective on neural net representations. Minimizing this\nobjective leads to features with provable accuracy guarantees under linear\nprobe evaluation. By standard generalization bounds, these accuracy guarantees\nalso hold when minimizing the training contrastive loss. Empirically, the\nfeatures learned by our objective can match or outperform several strong\nbaselines on benchmark vision datasets. In all, this work provides the first\nprovable analysis for contrastive learning where guarantees for linear probe\nevaluation can apply to realistic empirical settings.",

Recent progress on node embedding shows that proximity matrix\nfactorization methods gain superb performance and scale to large graphs with\nmillions of nodes. Existing approaches first define a proximity matrix and then\nlearn the embeddings that fit the proximity by matrix factorization. Most\nexisting matrix factorization methods adopt the same proximity for different\ntasks, while it is observed that different tasks and datasets may require\ndifferent proximity, limiting their representation power.\n\nMotivated by this, we propose {\\em Lemane}, a framework with trainable\nproximity measures, which can be learned to best suit the datasets and tasks at\nhand automatically. Our method is end-to-end, which incorporates differentiable\nSVD in the pipeline so that the parameters can be trained via backpropagation.\nHowever, this learning process is still expensive on large graphs. To improve\nthe scalability, we train proximity measures only on carefully subsampled\ngraphs, and then apply standard proximity matrix factorization on the original\ngraph using the learned proximity. Note that, computing the learned proximities\nfor each pair is still expensive for large graphs, and existing techniques for\ncomputing proximities are not applicable to the learned proximities. Thus, we\npresent generalized push techniques to make our solution scalable to large\ngraphs with millions of nodes.

          "description": "The aortic vessel tree is composed of the aorta and its branching arteries,\nand plays a key role in supplying the whole body with blood. Aortic diseases,\nlike aneurysms or dissections, can lead to an aortic rupture, whose treatment\nwith open surgery is highly risky. Therefore, patients commonly undergo drug\ntreatment under constant monitoring, which requires regular inspections of the\nvessels through imaging. The standard imaging modality for diagnosis and\nmonitoring is computed tomography (CT), which can provide a detailed picture of\nthe aorta and its branching vessels if combined with a contrast agent,\nresulting in a CT angiography (CTA). Optimally, the whole aortic vessel tree\ngeometry from consecutive CTAs, are overlaid and compared. This allows to not\nonly detect changes in the aorta, but also more peripheral vessel tree changes,\ncaused by the primary pathology or newly developed. When performed manually,\nthis reconstruction requires slice by slice contouring, which could easily take\na whole day for a single aortic vessel tree and, hence, is not feasible in\nclinical practice. Automatic or semi-automatic vessel tree segmentation\nalgorithms, on the other hand, can complete this task in a fraction of the\nmanual execution time and run in parallel to the clinical routine of the\nclinicians. In this paper, we systematically review computing techniques for\nthe automatic and semi-automatic segmentation of the aortic vessel tree.

          "description": "Quantum classification and hypothesis testing are two tightly related\nsubjects, the main difference being that the former is data driven: how to\nassign to quantum states $\\rho(x)$ the corresponding class $c$ (or hypothesis)\nis learnt from examples during training, where $x$ can be either tunable\nexperimental parameters or classical data \"embedded\" into quantum states. Does\nthe model generalize? This is the main question in any data-driven strategy,\nnamely the ability to predict the correct class even of previously unseen\nstates. Here we establish a link between quantum machine learning\nclassification and quantum hypothesis testing (state and channel\ndiscrimination) and then show that the accuracy and generalization capability\nof quantum classifiers depend on the (R\\'enyi) mutual informations $I(C{:}Q)$\nand $I_2(X{:}Q)$ between the quantum state space $Q$ and the classical\nparameter space $X$ or class space $C$. Based on the above characterization, we\nthen show how different properties of $Q$ affect classification accuracy and\ngeneralization, such as the dimension of the Hilbert space, the amount of\nnoise, and the amount of neglected information from $X$ via, e.g., pooling\nlayers. Moreover, we introduce a quantum version of the Information Bottleneck\nprinciple that allows us to explore the various tradeoffs between accuracy and\ngeneralization. Finally, in order to check our theoretical predictions, we\nstudy the classification of the quantum phases of an Ising spin chain, and we\npropose the Variational Quantum Information Bottleneck (VQIB) method to\noptimize quantum embeddings of classical data to favor generalization.",

          "description": "Coronaviruses constitute a family of viruses that gives rise to respiratory\ndiseases. As COVID-19 is highly contagious, early diagnosis of COVID-19 is\ncrucial for an effective treatment strategy. However, the RT-PCR test which is\nconsidered to be a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suffers from a\nhigh false-negative rate. Chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis has emerged as a\nfeasible and effective diagnostic technique towards this objective. In this\nwork, we propose the COVID-19 classification problem as a three-class\nclassification problem to distinguish between COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia\nclasses. We propose a three-stage framework, named COV-ELM. Stage one deals\nwith preprocessing and transformation while stage two deals with feature\nextraction. These extracted features are passed as an input to the ELM at the\nthird stage, resulting in the identification of COVID-19. The choice of ELM in\nthis work has been motivated by its faster convergence, better generalization\ncapability, and shorter training time in comparison to the conventional\ngradient-based learning algorithms. As bigger and diverse datasets become\navailable, ELM can be quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based\ncompetitor models. The proposed model achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95\nand the overall sensitivity of ${0.94 \\pm 0.02} at a 95% confidence interval.\nWhen compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the COV-ELM is\nfound to outperform its competitors in this three-class classification\nscenario. Further, LIME has been integrated with the proposed COV-ELM model to\ngenerate annotated CXR images. The annotations are based on the superpixels\nthat have contributed to distinguish between the different classes. It was\nobserved that the superpixels correspond to the regions of the human lungs that\nare clinically observed in COVID-19 and Pneumonia cases.",

          "description": "While classic control theory offers state of the art solutions in many\nproblem scenarios, it is often desired to improve beyond the structure of such\nsolutions and surpass their limitations. To this end, residual policy learning\n(RPL) offers a formulation to improve existing controllers with reinforcement\nlearning (RL) by learning an additive \"residual\" to the output of a given\ncontroller. However, the applicability of such an approach highly depends on\nthe structure of the controller. Often, internal feedback signals of the\ncontroller limit an RL algorithm to adequately change the policy and, hence,\nlearn the task. We propose a new formulation that addresses these limitations\nby also modifying the feedback signals to the controller with an RL policy and\nshow superior performance of our approach on a contact-rich peg-insertion task\nunder position and orientation uncertainty. In addition, we use a recent\nCartesian impedance control architecture as the control framework which can be\navailable to us as a black-box while assuming no knowledge about its\ninput/output structure, and show the difficulties of standard RPL. Furthermore,\nwe introduce an adaptive curriculum for the given task to gradually increase\nthe task difficulty in terms of position and orientation uncertainty.

          "description": "Optimizing economic and public policy is critical to address socioeconomic\nissues and trade-offs, e.g., improving equality, productivity, or wellness, and\nposes a complex mechanism design problem. A policy designer needs to consider\nmultiple objectives, policy levers, and behavioral responses from strategic\nactors who optimize for their individual objectives. Moreover, real-world\npolicies should be explainable and robust to simulation-to-reality gaps, e.g.,\ndue to calibration issues. Existing approaches are often limited to a narrow\nset of policy levers or objectives that are hard to measure, do not yield\nexplicit optimal policies, or do not consider strategic behavior, for example.\nHence, it remains challenging to optimize policy in real-world scenarios. Here\nwe show that the AI Economist framework enables effective, flexible, and\ninterpretable policy design using two-level reinforcement learning (RL) and\ndata-driven simulations. We validate our framework on optimizing the stringency\nof US state policies and Federal subsidies during a pandemic, e.g., COVID-19,\nusing a simulation fitted to real data. We find that log-linear policies\ntrained using RL significantly improve social welfare, based on both public\nhealth and economic outcomes, compared to past outcomes. Their behavior can be\nexplained, e.g., well-performing policies respond strongly to changes in\nrecovery and vaccination rates. They are also robust to calibration errors,\ne.g., infection rates that are over or underestimated. As of yet, real-world\npolicymaking has not seen adoption of machine learning methods at large,\nincluding RL and AI-driven simulations. Our results show the potential of AI to\nguide policy design and improve social welfare amidst the complexity of the\nreal world.",

          "description": "Requirements Engineering (RE) is the initial step towards building a software\nsystem. The success or failure of a software project is firmly tied to this\nphase, based on communication among stakeholders using natural language. The\nproblem with natural language is that it can easily lead to different\nunderstandings if it is not expressed precisely by the stakeholders involved,\nwhich results in building a product different from the expected one. Previous\nwork proposed to enhance the quality of the software requirements detecting\nlanguage errors based on ISO 29148 requirements language criteria. The existing\nsolutions apply classical Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect them. NLP\nhas some limitations, such as domain dependability which results in poor\ngeneralization capability. Therefore, this work aims to improve the previous\nwork by creating a manually labeled dataset and using ensemble learning, Deep\nLearning (DL), and techniques such as word embeddings and transfer learning to\novercome the generalization problem that is tied with classical NLP and improve\nprecision and recall metrics using a manually labeled dataset. The current\nfindings show that the dataset is unbalanced and which class examples should be\nadded more. It is tempting to train algorithms even if the dataset is not\nconsiderably representative. Whence, the results show that models are\noverfitting; in Machine Learning this issue is solved by adding more instances\nto the dataset, improving label quality, removing noise, and reducing the\nlearning algorithms complexity, which is planned for this research.",

          "description": "System identification aims to build models of dynamical systems from data.\nTraditionally, choosing the model requires the designer to balance between two\ngoals of conflicting nature; the model must be rich enough to capture the\nsystem dynamics, but not so flexible that it learns spurious random effects\nfrom the dataset. It is typically observed that the model validation\nperformance follows a U-shaped curve as the model complexity increases. Recent\ndevelopments in machine learning and statistics, however, have observed\nsituations where a \"double-descent\" curve subsumes this U-shaped\nmodel-performance curve. With a second decrease in performance occurring beyond\nthe point where the model has reached the capacity of interpolating - i.e.,\n(near) perfectly fitting - the training data. To the best of our knowledge,\nsuch phenomena have not been studied within the context of dynamic systems. The\npresent paper aims to answer the question: \"Can such a phenomenon also be\nobserved when estimating parameters of dynamic systems?\" We show that the\nanswer is yes, verifying such behavior experimentally both for artificially\ngenerated and real-world datasets.",

          "description": "Extreme Learning Machine is a powerful classification method very competitive\nexisting classification methods. It is extremely fast at training.\nNevertheless, it cannot perform face verification tasks properly because face\nverification tasks require comparison of facial images of two individuals at\nthe same time and decide whether the two faces identify the same person. The\nstructure of Extreme Leaning Machine was not designed to feed two input data\nstreams simultaneously, thus, in 2-input scenarios Extreme Learning Machine\nmethods are normally applied using concatenated inputs. However, this setup\nconsumes two times more computational resources and it is not optimized for\nrecognition tasks where learning a separable distance metric is critical. For\nthese reasons, we propose and develop a Siamese Extreme Learning Machine\n(SELM). SELM was designed to be fed with two data streams in parallel\nsimultaneously. It utilizes a dual-stream Siamese condition in the extra\nSiamese layer to transform the data before passing it along to the hidden\nlayer. Moreover, we propose a Gender-Ethnicity-Dependent triplet feature\nexclusively trained on a variety of specific demographic groups. This feature\nenables learning and extracting of useful facial features of each group.\nExperiments were conducted to evaluate and compare the performances of SELM,\nExtreme Learning Machine, and DCNN. The experimental results showed that the\nproposed feature was able to perform correct classification at 97.87% accuracy\nand 99.45% AUC. They also showed that using SELM in conjunction with the\nproposed feature provided 98.31% accuracy and 99.72% AUC. They outperformed the\nwell-known DCNN and Extreme Leaning Machine methods by a wide margin.",

          "description": "The elastic properties of materials derive from their electronic and atomic\nnature. However, simulating bulk materials fully at these scales is not\nfeasible, so that typically homogenized continuum descriptions are used\ninstead. A seamless and lossless transition of the constitutive description of\nthe elastic response of materials between these two scales has been so far\nelusive. Here we show how this problem can be overcome by using Artificial\nIntelligence (AI). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained, by\ntaking the structure image of a nanoporous material as input and the\ncorresponding elasticity tensor, calculated from Molecular Statics (MS), as\noutput. Trained with the atomistic data, the CNN model captures the size- and\npore-dependency of the material's elastic properties which, on the physics\nside, can stem from surfaces and non-local effects. Such effects are often\nignored in upscaling from atomistic to classical continuum theory. To\ndemonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the trained CNN model, a Finite\nElement Method (FEM) based result of an elastically deformed nanoporous beam\nequipped with the CNN as constitutive law is compared with that by a full\natomistic simulation. The good agreement between the atomistic simulations and\nthe FEM-AI combination for a system with size and surface effects establishes a\nnew lossless scale bridging approach to such problems. The trained CNN model\ndeviates from the atomistic result by 9.6\\% for porosity scenarios of up to\n90\\% but it is about 230 times faster than the MS calculation and does not\nrequire to change simulation methods between different scales. The efficiency\nof the CNN evaluation together with the preservation of important atomistic\neffects makes the trained model an effective atomistically-informed\nconstitutive model for macroscopic simulations of nanoporous materials and\nsolving of inverse problems.",

          "description": "Annotating the driving scenario trajectories based only on explicit rules\n(i.e., knowledge-based methods) can be subject to errors, such as false\npositive/negative classification of scenarios that lie on the border of two\nscenario classes, missing unknown scenario classes, and also anomalies. On the\nother side, verifying the labels by the annotators is not cost-efficient. For\nthis purpose, active learning (AL) could potentially improve the annotation\nprocedure by inclusion of an annotator/expert in an efficient way. In this\nstudy, we develop an active learning framework to annotate driving trajectory\ntime-series data. At the first step, we compute an embedding of the time-series\ntrajectories into a latent space in order to extract the temporal nature. For\nthis purpose, we study three different latent space representations:\nmultivariate Time Series t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (mTSNE),\nRecurrent Auto-Encoder (RAE) and Variational Recurrent Auto-Encoder (VRAE). We\nthen apply different active learning paradigms with different classification\nmodels to the embedded data. In particular, we study the two classifiers Neural\nNetwork (NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), with three active learning\nquery strategies (i.e., entropy, margin and random). In the following, we\nexplore the possibilities of the framework to discover unknown classes and\ndemonstrate how it can be used to identify the out-of-class trajectories.",

To find these waveforms we apply a shift-invariant\nk-means algorithm to segments of spatially filtered signals to learn codebooks\nof prototypical waveforms.

          "description": "Euler k-means (EulerK) first maps data onto the unit hyper-sphere surface of\nequi-dimensional space via a complex mapping which induces the robust Euler\nkernel and next employs the popular $k$-means. Consequently, besides enjoying\nthe virtues of k-means such as simplicity and scalability to large data sets,\nEulerK is also robust to noises and outliers. Although so, the centroids\ncaptured by EulerK deviate from the unit hyper-sphere surface and thus in\nstrict distributional sense, actually are outliers. This weird phenomenon also\noccurs in some generic kernel clustering methods. Intuitively, using such\noutlier-like centroids should not be quite reasonable but it is still seldom\nattended. To eliminate the deviation, we propose two Rectified Euler k-means\nmethods, i.e., REK1 and REK2, which retain the merits of EulerK while acquire\nreal centroids residing on the mapped space to better characterize the data\nstructures. Specifically, REK1 rectifies EulerK by imposing the constraint on\nthe centroids while REK2 views each centroid as the mapped image from a\npre-image in the original space and optimizes these pre-images in Euler kernel\ninduced space. Undoubtedly, our proposed REKs can methodologically be extended\nto solve problems of such a category. Finally, the experiments validate the\neffectiveness of REK1 and REK2.",

However, most studies are oriented toward\nmonolingual data in languages with abundant training samples. This has left the\nmore common multilingual settings and lesser-spoken languages relatively\nunexplored. Thus, we present a GNN that incorporates cross-lingual word\nembeddings for detecting events in multilingual data streams. The first exploit\nis to make the GNN work with multilingual data. For this, we outline a\nconstruction strategy that aligns messages in different languages at both the\nnode and semantic levels. Relationships between messages are established by\nmerging entities that are the same but are referred to in different languages.\nNon-English message representations are converted into English semantic space\nvia the cross-lingual word embeddings. The resulting message graph is then\nuniformly encoded by a GNN model. In special cases where a lesser-spoken\nlanguage needs to be detected, a novel cross-lingual knowledge distillation\nframework, called CLKD, exploits prior knowledge learned from similar threads\nin English to make up for the paucity of annotated data. Experiments on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets show the framework to be highly effective at\ndetection in both multilingual data and in languages where training samples are\nscarce.",

Of note,\ncommunication plays a central role. To date, prior studies in embodied agent\nnavigation have only demonstrated that human languages facilitate communication\nby instructions in natural languages. Nevertheless, a plethora of other forms\nof communication is left unexplored. In fact, human communication originated in\ngestures and oftentimes is delivered through multimodal cues, e.g. \"go there\"\nwith a pointing gesture. To bridge the gap and fill in the missing dimension of\ncommunication in embodied agent navigation, we propose investigating the\neffects of using gestures as the communicative interface instead of verbal\ncues. Specifically, we develop a VR-based 3D simulation environment, named\nGes-THOR, based on AI2-THOR platform. In this virtual environment, a human\nplayer is placed in the same virtual scene and shepherds the artificial agent\nusing only gestures. The agent is tasked to solve the navigation problem guided\nby natural gestures with unknown semantics; we do not use any predefined\ngestures due to the diversity and versatile nature of human gestures. We argue\nthat learning the semantics of natural gestures is mutually beneficial to\nlearning the navigation task--learn to communicate and communicate to learn.

If we do not\nhave a model of the dynamics of the world, which is often the case in complex\ndomains, we may need to approximate a performance function of the robot based\non its interaction with the environment. Such a performance function gives us\ninsights into the behaviour of the robot, allowing us to fine-tune the\ncontroller with manual interventions. In high-dimensionality systems, where the\nactionstate space is large, fine-tuning a controller is non-trivial. To\novercome this problem, we propose a performance function whose domain is\ndefined by external features and parameters of the controller. Attainment\nregions are defined over such a domain defined by feature-parameter pairs, and\nserve the purpose of enabling prediction of successful execution of the task.\nThe use of the feature-parameter space -in contrast to the action-state space-\nallows us to adapt, explain and finetune the controller over a simpler (i.e.,\nlower dimensional space). When the robot successfully executes the task, we use\nthe attainment regions to gain insights into the limits of the controller, and\nits robustness. When the robot fails to execute the task, we use the regions to\ndebug the controller and find adaptive and counterfactual changes to the\nsolutions. Another advantage of this approach is that we can generalise through\nthe use of Gaussian processes regression of the performance function in the\nhigh-dimensional space. To test our approach, we demonstrate learning an\napproximation to the performance function in simulation, with a mobile robot\ntraversing different terrain conditions. Then, with a sample-efficient method,\nwe propagate the attainment regions to a physical robot in a similar\nenvironment.",

          "description": "Stress is a physiological state that hampers mental health and has serious\nconsequences to physical health. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased\nstress levels among people across the globe. Therefore, continuous monitoring\nand detection of stress are necessary. The recent advances in wearable devices\nhave allowed the monitoring of several physiological signals related to stress.\nAmong them, wrist-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are most popular due\nto their convenient usage. And the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is the\nmost prevalent sensor in almost all consumer-grade wrist-worn smartwatches.\nTherefore, this paper focuses on using a wrist-based PPG sensor that collects\nBlood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals to detect stress which may be applicable for\nconsumer-grade wristwatches. Moreover, state-of-the-art works have used either\nclassical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted\nfeatures or have used deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) which automatically extracts features. This paper proposes a\nnovel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features\nand the automatically extracted features by CNN to detect stress using the BVP\nsignal. Evaluation on the benchmark WESAD dataset shows that, for 3-class\nclassification (Baseline vs. Stress vs. Amusement), our proposed H-CNN\noutperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 5% and 7% accuracy, and\n10% and 7% macro F1 score, respectively. Also for 2-class classification\n(Stress vs. Non-stress), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers\nand normal CNN by 3% and ~5% accuracy, and ~3% and ~7% macro F1 score,\nrespectively.",

          "description": "A new machine learning (ML) technique termed as federated learning (FL) aims\nto preserve data at the edge devices and to only exchange ML model parameters\nin the learning process.

Although FL has these advantages, it can\nstill experience large communication latency when there are massive edge\ndevices connected to the central parameter server (PS) and/or millions of model\nparameters involved in the learning process. Over-the-air computation (AirComp)\nis capable of computing while transmitting data by allowing multiple devices to\nsend data simultaneously by using analog modulation. To achieve good\nperformance in FL through AirComp, user scheduling plays a critical role. In\nthis paper, we investigate and compare different user scheduling policies,\nwhich are based on various criteria such as wireless channel conditions and the\nsignificance of model updates. Receiver beamforming is applied to minimize the\nmean-square-error (MSE) of the distortion of function aggregation result via\nAirComp.

          "description": "The merit of ensemble learning lies in having different outputs from many\nindividual models on a single input, i.e., the diversity of the base models.\nThe high quality of diversity can be achieved when each model is specialized to\ndifferent subsets of the whole dataset. Moreover, when each model explicitly\nknows to which subsets it is specialized, more opportunities arise to improve\ndiversity. In this paper, we propose an advanced ensemble method, called\nAuxiliary class based Multiple Choice Learning (AMCL), to ultimately specialize\neach model under the framework of multiple choice learning (MCL). The\nadvancement of AMCL is originated from three novel techniques which control the\nframework from different directions: 1) the concept of auxiliary class to\nprovide more distinct information through the labels, 2) the strategy, named\nmemory-based assignment, to determine the association between the inputs and\nthe models, and 3) the feature fusion module to achieve generalized features.\nTo demonstrate the performance of our method compared to all variants of MCL\nmethods, we conduct extensive experiments on the image classification and\nsegmentation tasks. Overall, the performance of AMCL exceeds all others in most\nof the public datasets trained with various networks as members of the\nensembles.",

          "description": "Since the rapid outbreak of Covid-19 and with no approved vaccines to date,\nprofound research interest has emerged to understand the innate immune response\nto viruses. This understanding can help to inhibit virus replication, prolong\nadaptive immune response, accelerated virus clearance, and tissue recovery, a\nkey milestone to propose a vaccine to combat coronaviruses (CoVs), e.g.,\nCovid-19. Although an innate immune system triggers inflammatory responses\nagainst CoVs upon recognition of viruses, however, a vaccine is the ultimate\nprotection against CoV spread. The development of this vaccine is\ntime-consuming and requires a deep understanding of the innate immune response\nsystem. In this work, we propose a graph neural network-based model that\nexploits the interactions between pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), i.e.,\nthe human immune response system. These interactions can help to recognize\npathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to predict the activation\nrequirements of each PRR. The immune response information of each PRR is\nderived from combining its historical PAMPs activation coupled with the modeled\neffect on the same from PRRs in its neighborhood. On one hand, this work can\nhelp to understand how long Covid-19 can confer immunity where a strong immune\nresponse means people already been infected can safely return to work. On the\nother hand, this GNN-based understanding can also abode well for vaccine\ndevelopment efforts. Our proposal has been evaluated using CoVs immune response\ndataset, with results showing an average IFNs activation prediction accuracy of\n90%, compared to 85% using feed-forward neural networks.",

          "description": "Recent work has shown the efficiency of deep learning models such as Fully\nConvolutional Networks (FCN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to deal with\nTime Series Regression (TSR) problems. These models sometimes need a lot of\ndata to be able to generalize, yet the time series are sometimes not long\nenough to be able to learn patterns. Therefore, it is important to make use of\ninformation across time series to improve learning. In this paper, we will\nexplore the idea of using meta-learning for quickly adapting model parameters\nto new short-history time series by modifying the original idea of Model\nAgnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) \\cite{finn2017model}. Moreover, based on prior\nwork on multimodal MAML \\cite{vuorio2019multimodal}, we propose a method for\nconditioning parameters of the model through an auxiliary network that encodes\nglobal information of the time series to extract meta-features. Finally, we\napply the data to time series of different domains, such as pollution\nmeasurements, heart-rate sensors, and electrical battery data. We show\nempirically that our proposed meta-learning method learns TSR with few data\nfast and outperforms the baselines in 9 of 12 experiments.",

          "description": "The need of predictive maintenance comes with an increasing number of\nincidents reported by monitoring systems and equipment/software users. In the\nfront line, on-call engineers (OCEs) have to quickly assess the degree of\nseverity of an incident and decide which service to contact for corrective\nactions. To automate these decisions, several predictive models have been\nproposed, but the most efficient models are opaque (say, black box), strongly\nlimiting their adoption. In this paper, we propose an efficient black box model\nbased on 170K incidents reported to our company over the last 7 years and\nemphasize on the need of automating triage when incidents are massively\nreported on thousands of servers running our product, an ERP. Recent\ndevelopments in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) help in providing\nglobal explanations to the model, but also, and most importantly, with local\nexplanations for each model prediction/outcome. Sadly, providing a human with\nan explanation for each outcome is not conceivable when dealing with an\nimportant number of daily predictions. To address this problem, we propose an\noriginal data-mining method rooted in Subgroup Discovery, a pattern mining\ntechnique with the natural ability to group objects that share similar\nexplanations of their black box predictions and provide a description for each\ngroup. We evaluate this approach and present our preliminary results which give\nus good hope towards an effective OCE's adoption. We believe that this approach\nprovides a new way to address the problem of model agnostic outcome\nexplanation.",

The\nformer improves the feature relevancy for subsequent chunks, and the latter, a\nnew paradigm, increases accuracy during training by determining the optimal\nnetwork architecture dynamically for each new chunk.

          "description": "Institutional investors have been increasing the allocation of the illiquid\nalternative assets such as private equity funds in their portfolios, yet there\nexists a very limited literature on cash flow forecasting of illiquid\nalternative assets. The net cash flow of private equity funds typically follow\na J-curve pattern, however the timing and the size of the contributions and\ndistributions depend on the investment opportunities. In this paper, we develop\na benchmark model and present two novel approaches (direct vs. indirect) to\npredict the cash flows of private equity funds. We introduce a sliding window\napproach to apply on our cash flow data because different vintage year funds\ncontain different lengths of cash flow information. We then pass the data to an\nLSTM/ GRU model to predict the future cash flows either directly or indirectly\n(based on the benchmark model). We further integrate macroeconomic indicators\ninto our data, which allows us to consider the impact of market environment on\ncash flows and to apply stress testing. Our results indicate that the direct\nmodel is easier to implement compared to the benchmark model and the indirect\nmodel, but still the predicted cash flows align better with the actual cash\nflows. We also show that macroeconomic variables improve the performance of the\ndirect model whereas the impact is not obvious on the indirect model.",

In this\npaper, we demonstrate an effective framework for mitigating OCR errors for any\ndownstream NLP task, using Named Entity Recognition (NER) as an example. We\nfirst address the data scarcity problem for model training by constructing a\ndocument synthesis pipeline, generating realistic but degraded data with NER\nlabels.

In particular, to the best of\nour knowledge, no study has been conducted for hate speech detection in Roman\nUrdu text, which is widely used in the sub-continent. In this study, we have\nscrapped more than 90,000 tweets and manually parsed them to identify 5,000\nRoman Urdu tweets.

As another\ncontribution, we have used five supervised learning techniques, including a\ndeep learning technique, to evaluate and compare their effectiveness for hate\nspeech detection. The results show that Logistic Regression outperformed all\nother techniques, including deep learning techniques for the two levels of\nclassification, by achieved an F1 score of 0.906 for distinguishing between\nNeutral-Hostile tweets, and 0.756 for distinguishing between Offensive-Hate\nspeech tweets.",

          "description": "Quantum computing offers the potential of exponential speedups for certain\nclassical computations. Over the last decade, many quantum machine learning\n(QML) algorithms have been proposed as candidates for such exponential\nimprovements. However, two issues unravel the hope of exponential speedup for\nsome of these QML algorithms: the data-loading problem and, more recently, the\nstunning dequantization results of Tang et al. A third issue, namely the\nfault-tolerance requirements of most QML algorithms, has further hindered their\npractical realization. The quantum topological data analysis (QTDA) algorithm\nof Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi was one of the first QML algorithms that\nconvincingly offered an expected exponential speedup. From the outset, it did\nnot suffer from the data-loading problem. A recent result has also shown that\nthe generalized problem solved by this algorithm is likely classically\nintractable, and would therefore be immune to any dequantization efforts.\nHowever, the QTDA algorithm of Lloyd et~al. has a time complexity of\n$O(n^4/(\\epsilon^2 \\delta))$ (where $n$ is the number of data points,\n$\\epsilon$ is the error tolerance, and $\\delta$ is the smallest nonzero\neigenvalue of the restricted Laplacian) and requires fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputing, which has not yet been achieved. In this paper, we completely\noverhaul the QTDA algorithm to achieve an improved exponential speedup and\ndepth complexity of $O(n\\log(1/(\\delta\\epsilon)))$. Our approach includes three\nkey innovations: (a) an efficient realization of the combinatorial Laplacian as\na sum of Pauli operators; (b) a quantum rejection sampling approach to restrict\nthe superposition to the simplices in the complex; and (c) a stochastic rank\nestimation method to estimate the Betti numbers. We present a theoretical error\nanalysis, and the circuit and computational time and depth complexities for\nBetti number estimation.",

          "description": "Fundus photography is the primary method for retinal imaging and essential\nfor diabetic retinopathy prevention. Automated segmentation of fundus\nphotographs would improve the quality, capacity, and cost-effectiveness of eye\ncare screening programs. However, current segmentation methods are not robust\ntowards the diversity in imaging conditions and pathologies typical for\nreal-world clinical applications. To overcome these limitations, we utilized\ncontrastive self-supervised learning to exploit the large variety of unlabeled\nfundus images in the publicly available EyePACS dataset. We pre-trained an\nencoder of a U-Net, which we later fine-tuned on several retinal vessel and\nlesion segmentation datasets. We demonstrate for the first time that by using\ncontrastive self-supervised learning, the pre-trained network can recognize\nblood vessels, optic disc, fovea, and various lesions without being provided\nany labels. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on a downstream blood vessel\nsegmentation task, such pre-trained networks achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on images from different datasets. Additionally, the pre-training\nalso leads to shorter training times and an improved few-shot performance on\nboth blood vessel and lesion segmentation tasks. Altogether, our results\nshowcase the benefits of contrastive self-supervised pre-training which can\nplay a crucial role in real-world clinical applications requiring robust models\nable to adapt to new devices with only a few annotated samples.",
