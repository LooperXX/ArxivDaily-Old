          "description": "MICE is a corpus of emotion words in four languages which is currently\nworking progress. There are two sections to this study, Part I: Emotion word\ncorpus and Part II: Emotion word survey. In Part 1, the method of how the\nemotion data is culled for each of the four languages will be described and\nvery preliminary data will be presented. In total, we identified 3,750 emotion\nexpressions in Malay, 6,657 in Indonesian, 3,347 in Mandarin Chinese and 8,683\nin English. We are currently evaluating and double checking the corpus and\ndoing further analysis on the distribution of these emotion expressions. Part\nII Emotion word survey involved an online language survey which collected\ninformation on how speakers assigned the emotion words into basic emotion\ncategories, the rating for valence and intensity as well as biographical\ninformation of all the respondents.",

          "description": "Most neural Information Retrieval (Neu-IR) models derive query-to-document\nranking scores based on term-level matching. Inspired by TileBars, a classical\nterm distribution visualization method, in this paper, we propose a novel\nNeu-IR model that handles query-to-document matching at the subtopic and higher\nlevels. Our system first splits the documents into topical segments,\n\"visualizes\" the matchings between the query and the segments, and then feeds\nan interaction matrix into a Neu-IR model, DeepTileBars, to obtain the final\nranking scores. DeepTileBars models the relevance signals occurring at\ndifferent granularities in a document's topic hierarchy. It better captures the\ndiscourse structure of a document and thus the matching patterns. Although its\ndesign and implementation are light-weight, DeepTileBars outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art Neu-IR models on benchmark datasets including the Text\nREtrieval Conference (TREC) 2010-2012 Web Tracks and LETOR 4.0.",

          "description": "The success of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) largely depends on the\navailability of large bitext training corpora. Due to the lack of such large\ncorpora in low-resource language pairs, NMT systems often exhibit poor\nperformance. Extra relevant monolingual data often helps, but acquiring it\ncould be quite expensive, especially for low-resource languages. Moreover,\ndomain mismatch between bitext (train/test) and monolingual data might degrade\nthe performance. To alleviate such issues, we propose AUGVIC, a novel data\naugmentation framework for low-resource NMT which exploits the vicinal samples\nof the given bitext without using any extra monolingual data explicitly. It can\ndiversify the in-domain bitext data with finer level control. Through extensive\nexperiments on four low-resource language pairs comprising data from different\ndomains, we have shown that our method is comparable to the traditional\nback-translation that uses extra in-domain monolingual data. When we combine\nthe synthetic parallel data generated from AUGVIC with the ones from the extra\nmonolingual data, we achieve further improvements. We show that AUGVIC helps to\nattenuate the discrepancies between relevant and distant-domain monolingual\ndata in traditional back-translation. To understand the contributions of\ndifferent components of AUGVIC, we perform an in-depth framework analysis.",

          "description": "Large generative language models have been very successful for English, but\nother languages lag behind, in part due to data and computational limitations.\nWe propose a method that may overcome these problems by adapting existing\npre-trained models to new languages. Specifically, we describe the adaptation\nof English GPT-2 to Italian and Dutch by retraining lexical embeddings without\ntuning the Transformer layers. As a result, we obtain lexical embeddings for\nItalian and Dutch that are aligned with the original English lexical\nembeddings. Additionally, we scale up complexity by transforming relearned\nlexical embeddings of GPT-2 small to the GPT-2 medium embedding space. This\nmethod minimises the amount of training and prevents losing information during\nadaptation that was learned by GPT-2. English GPT-2 models with relearned\nlexical embeddings can generate realistic sentences in Italian and Dutch.\nThough on average these sentences are still identifiable as artificial by\nhumans, they are assessed on par with sentences generated by a GPT-2 model\nfully trained from scratch.",

          "description": "Recent advances in Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation (UNMT) have\nminimized the gap between supervised and unsupervised machine translation\nperformance for closely related language pairs. However, the situation is very\ndifferent for distant language pairs. Lack of lexical overlap and low syntactic\nsimilarities such as between English and Indo-Aryan languages leads to poor\ntranslation quality in existing UNMT systems. In this paper, we show that\ninitializing the embedding layer of UNMT models with cross-lingual embeddings\nshows significant improvements in BLEU score over existing approaches with\nembeddings randomly initialized. Further, static embeddings (freezing the\nembedding layer weights) lead to better gains compared to updating the\nembedding layer weights during training (non-static). We experimented using\nMasked Sequence to Sequence (MASS) and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) UNMT\napproaches for three distant language pairs. The proposed cross-lingual\nembedding initialization yields BLEU score improvement of as much as ten times\nover the baseline for English-Hindi, English-Bengali, and English-Gujarati. Our\nanalysis shows the importance of cross-lingual embedding, comparisons between\napproaches, and the scope of improvements in these systems.",

In this work, we propose\nRealTranS, an end-to-end model for SST. To bridge the modality gap between\nspeech and text, RealTranS gradually downsamples the input speech with\ninterleaved convolution and unidirectional Transformer layers for acoustic\nmodeling, and then maps speech features into text space with a\nweighted-shrinking operation and a semantic encoder. Besides, to improve the\nmodel performance in simultaneous scenarios, we propose a blank penalty to\nenhance the shrinking quality and a Wait-K-Stride-N strategy to allow local\nreranking during decoding.

Using appropriate regularization, the prediction\nnetwork can be adapted to new domains while still retaining good generalization\ncapabilities.

This paper aims to figure out what is a good vocabulary and\nwhether one can find the optimal vocabulary without trial training. To answer\nthese questions, we first provide an alternative understanding of the role of\nvocabulary from the perspective of information theory. Motivated by this, we\nformulate the quest of vocabularization -- finding the best token dictionary\nwith a proper size -- as an optimal transport (OT) problem.We We propose VOLT,\na simple and efficient solution without trial training. Empirical results show\nthat VOLT outperforms widely-used vocabularies in diverse scenarios, including\nWMT-14 English-German and TED's 52 translation directions. For example, VOLT\nachieves 70% vocabulary size reduction and 0.5 BLEU gain on English-German\ntranslation. Also, compared to BPE-search, VOLT reduces the search time from\n384 GPU hours to 30 GPU hours on English-German translation. Codes are\navailable at https://github.com/Jingjing-NLP/VOLT .",

          "description": "Language is an outcome of our complex and dynamic human-interactions and the\ntechnique of natural language processing (NLP) is hence built on human\nlinguistic activities. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n(BERT) has recently gained its popularity by establishing the state-of-the-art\nscores in several NLP benchmarks. A Lite BERT (ALBERT) is literally\ncharacterized as a lightweight version of BERT, in which the number of BERT\nparameters is reduced by repeatedly applying the same neural network called\nTransformer's encoder layer. By pre-training the parameters with a massive\namount of natural language data, ALBERT can convert input sentences into\nversatile high-dimensional vectors potentially capable of solving multiple NLP\ntasks. In that sense, ALBERT can be regarded as a well-designed\nhigh-dimensional dynamical system whose operator is the Transformer's encoder,\nand essential structures of human language are thus expected to be encapsulated\nin its dynamics. In this study, we investigated the embedded properties of\nALBERT to reveal how NLP tasks are effectively solved by exploiting its\ndynamics. We thereby aimed to explore the nature of human language from the\ndynamical expressions of the NLP model. Our short-term analysis clarified that\nthe pre-trained model stably yields trajectories with higher dimensionality,\nwhich would enhance the expressive capacity required for NLP tasks. Also, our\nlong-term analysis revealed that ALBERT intrinsically shows transient chaos, a\ntypical nonlinear phenomenon showing chaotic dynamics only in its transient,\nand the pre-trained ALBERT model tends to produce the chaotic trajectory for a\nsignificantly longer time period compared to a randomly-initialized one. Our\nresults imply that local chaoticity would contribute to improving NLP\nperformance, uncovering a novel aspect in the role of chaotic dynamics in human\nlanguage behaviors.",

          "description": "Many task-oriented dialogue systems use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to\nlearn policies that respond to the user appropriately and complete the tasks\nsuccessfully. Training DRL agents with diverse dialogue trajectories prepare\nthem well for rare user requests and unseen situations. One effective\ndiversification method is to let the agent interact with a diverse set of\nlearned user models. However, trajectories created by these artificial user\nmodels may contain generation errors, which can quickly propagate into the\nagent's policy. It is thus important to control the quality of the\ndiversification and resist the noise. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndialogue diversification method for task-oriented dialogue systems trained in\nsimulators. Our method, Intermittent Short Extension Ensemble (I-SEE),\nconstrains the intensity to interact with an ensemble of diverse user models\nand effectively controls the quality of the diversification.

          "description": "End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) has recently attracted\nincreasing interest. Compared to the conventional tandem-based approach that\ncombines speech recognition and language understanding as separate modules, the\nnew approach extracts users' intentions directly from the speech signals,\nresulting in joint optimization and low latency. Such an approach, however, is\ntypically designed to process one intention at a time, which leads users to\ntake multiple rounds to fulfill their requirements while interacting with a\ndialogue system. In this paper, we propose a streaming end-to-end framework\nthat can process multiple intentions in an online and incremental way. The\nbackbone of our framework is a unidirectional RNN trained with the\nconnectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an\nintention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and\nmultiple intentions can be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on\nthe Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the intent detection accuracy is\nabout 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the\nperformance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an\nonline and incremental way.

In reality, a truly useful VidL system\nis expected to be easily generalizable to diverse tasks, domains, and datasets.\nTo facilitate the evaluation of such systems, we introduce Video-And-Language\nUnderstanding Evaluation (VALUE) benchmark, an assemblage of 11 VidL datasets\nover 3 popular tasks: (i) text-to-video retrieval; (ii) video question\nanswering; and (iii) video captioning. VALUE benchmark aims to cover a broad\nrange of video genres, video lengths, data volumes, and task difficulty levels.\nRather than focusing on single-channel videos with visual information only,\nVALUE promotes models that leverage information from both video frames and\ntheir associated subtitles, as well as models that share knowledge across\nmultiple tasks. We evaluate various baseline methods with and without\nlarge-scale VidL pre-training, and systematically investigate the impact of\nvideo input channels, fusion methods, and different video representations. We\nalso study the transferability between tasks, and conduct multi-task learning\nunder different settings. The significant gap between our best model and human\nperformance calls for future study for advanced VidL models. VALUE is available\nat https://value-leaderboard.github.io/.",

          "description": "Attention-based neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results on a\nwide range of tasks. Most such models use deterministic attention while\nstochastic attention is less explored due to the optimization difficulties or\ncomplicated model design. This paper introduces Bayesian attention belief\nnetworks, which construct a decoder network by modeling unnormalized attention\nweights with a hierarchy of gamma distributions, and an encoder network by\nstacking Weibull distributions with a deterministic-upward-stochastic-downward\nstructure to approximate the posterior. The resulting auto-encoding networks\ncan be optimized in a differentiable way with a variational lower bound. It is\nsimple to convert any models with deterministic attention, including pretrained\nones, to the proposed Bayesian attention belief networks. On a variety of\nlanguage understanding tasks, we show that our method outperforms deterministic\nattention and state-of-the-art stochastic attention in accuracy, uncertainty\nestimation, generalization across domains, and robustness to adversarial\nattacks. We further demonstrate the general applicability of our method on\nneural machine translation and visual question answering, showing great\npotential of incorporating our method into various attention-related tasks.",

          "description": "Zero-shot intent detection (ZSID) aims to deal with the continuously emerging\nintents without annotated training data. However, existing ZSID systems suffer\nfrom two limitations: 1) They are not good at modeling the relationship between\nseen and unseen intents. 2) They cannot effectively recognize unseen intents\nunder the generalized intent detection (GZSID) setting. A critical problem\nbehind these limitations is that the representations of unseen intents cannot\nbe learned in the training stage. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nframework that utilizes unseen class labels to learn Class-Transductive Intent\nRepresentations (CTIR). Specifically, we allow the model to predict unseen\nintents during training, with the corresponding label names serving as input\nutterances. On this basis, we introduce a multi-task learning objective, which\nencourages the model to learn the distinctions among intents, and a similarity\nscorer, which estimates the connections among intents more accurately. CTIR is\neasy to implement and can be integrated with existing methods. Experiments on\ntwo real-world datasets show that CTIR brings considerable improvement to the\nbaseline systems.",

Keywords are terms that describe the most relevant\ninformation in a document. The main problem that researchers are facing is how\nto efficiently and accurately extract the core keywords from a document.\nHowever, previous keyword extraction approaches have utilized the text and\ngraph features, there is the lack of models that can properly learn and combine\nthese features in a best way.\n\nMethods: In this paper, we develop a multimodal Key-phrase extraction\napproach, namely Phraseformer, using transformer and graph embedding\ntechniques. In Phraseformer, each keyword candidate is presented by a vector\nwhich is the concatenation of the text and structure learning representations.\nPhraseformer takes the advantages of recent researches such as BERT and ExEm to\npreserve both representations. Also, the Phraseformer treats the key-phrase\nextraction task as a sequence labeling problem solved using classification\ntask.\n\nResults: We analyze the performance of Phraseformer on three datasets\nincluding Inspec, SemEval2010 and SemEval 2017 by F1-score. Also, we\ninvestigate the performance of different classifiers on Phraseformer method\nover Inspec dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nPhraseformer method over the three datasets used. Additionally, the Random\nForest classifier gain the highest F1-score among all classifiers.\n\nConclusions: Due to the fact that the combination of BERT and ExEm is more\nmeaningful and can better represent the semantic of words. Hence, Phraseformer\nsignificantly outperforms single-modality methods.",

          "description": "After their successful debut in natural language processing, Transformer\narchitectures are now becoming the de-facto standard in many domains. An\nobstacle for their deployment over new modalities is the architectural\nconfiguration: the optimal depth-to-width ratio has been shown to dramatically\nvary across data types (e.g., $10$x larger over images than over language). We\ntheoretically predict the existence of an embedding rank bottleneck that limits\nthe contribution of self-attention width to the Transformer expressivity. We\nthus directly tie the input vocabulary size and rank to the optimal\ndepth-to-width ratio, since a small vocabulary size or rank dictates an added\nadvantage of depth over width. We empirically demonstrate the existence of this\nbottleneck and its implications on the depth-to-width interplay of Transformer\narchitectures, linking the architecture variability across domains to the often\nglossed-over usage of different vocabulary sizes or embedding ranks in\ndifferent domains. As an additional benefit, our rank bottlenecking framework\nallows us to identify size redundancies of $25\\%-50\\%$ in leading NLP models\nsuch as ALBERT and T5.",

We propose diff\npruning as a simple approach to enable parameter-efficient transfer learning\nwithin the pretrain-finetune framework. This approach views finetuning as\nlearning a task-specific diff vector that is applied on top of the pretrained\nparameter vector, which remains fixed and is shared across different tasks. The\ndiff vector is adaptively pruned during training with a differentiable\napproximation to the L0-norm penalty to encourage sparsity. Diff pruning\nbecomes parameter-efficient as the number of tasks increases, as it requires\nstoring only the nonzero positions and weights of the diff vector for each\ntask, while the cost of storing the shared pretrained model remains constant.\nIt further does not require access to all tasks during training, which makes it\nattractive in settings where tasks arrive in stream or the set of tasks is\nunknown.

Notably, TL is widely used for neural domain\nadaptation to transfer valuable knowledge from high-resource to low-resource\ndomains. In the standard fine-tuning scheme of TL, a model is initially\npre-trained on a source domain and subsequently fine-tuned on a target domain\nand, therefore, source and target domains are trained using the same\narchitecture. In this paper, we show through interpretation methods that such\nscheme, despite its efficiency, is suffering from a main limitation. Indeed,\nalthough capable of adapting to new domains, pre-trained neurons struggle with\nlearning certain patterns that are specific to the target domain. Moreover, we\nshed light on the hidden negative transfer occurring despite the high\nrelatedness between source and target domains, which may mitigate the final\ngain brought by transfer learning. To address these problems, we propose to\naugment the pre-trained model with normalised, weighted and randomly\ninitialised units that foster a better adaptation while maintaining the\nvaluable source knowledge.

Our\nexperiments demonstrate a relationship between model parameters such as size\nand temperature and their propensity to generate conspiracy theory text.

One\nof the most well-adopted approaches for model interpretability is feature-based\ninterpretability, i.e., ranking the features in terms of their impact on model\npredictions. Several prior studies have focused on assessing the fidelity of\nfeature-based interpretability methods, i.e., measuring the impact of dropping\nthe top-ranked features on the model output. However, relatively little work\nhas been conducted on quantifying the robustness of interpretations. In this\nwork, we assess the robustness of interpretations of neural text classifiers,\nspecifically, those based on pretrained Transformer encoders, using two\nrandomization tests. The first compares the interpretations of two models that\nare identical except for their initializations. The second measures whether the\ninterpretations differ between a model with trained parameters and a model with\nrandom parameters. Both tests show surprising deviations from expected\nbehavior, raising questions about the extent of insights that practitioners may\ndraw from interpretations.",

SAD optimizes the online inference efficiency for GEC\nby two innovations: 1) it aggressively decodes as many tokens as possible in\nparallel instead of always decoding only one token in each step to improve\ncomputational parallelism; 2) it uses a shallow decoder instead of the\nconventional Transformer architecture with balanced encoder-decoder depth to\nreduce the computational cost during inference. Experiments in both English and\nChinese GEC benchmarks show that aggressive decoding could yield the same\npredictions as greedy decoding but with a significant speedup for online\ninference. Its combination with the shallow decoder could offer an even higher\nonline inference speedup over the powerful Transformer baseline without quality\nloss. Not only does our approach allow a single model to achieve the\nstate-of-the-art results in English GEC benchmarks: 66.4 F0.5 in the CoNLL-14\nand 72.9 F0.5 in the BEA-19 test set with an almost 10x online inference\nspeedup over the Transformer-big model, but also it is easily adapted to other\nlanguages.

          "description": "Sentence embeddings encode sentences in fixed dense vectors and have played\nan important role in various NLP tasks and systems. Methods for building\nsentence embeddings include unsupervised learning such as Quick-Thoughts and\nsupervised learning such as InferSent. With the success of pretrained NLP\nmodels, recent research shows that fine-tuning pretrained BERT on SNLI and\nMulti-NLI data creates state-of-the-art sentence embeddings, outperforming\nprevious sentence embeddings methods on various evaluation benchmarks. In this\npaper, we propose a new method to build sentence embeddings by doing supervised\ncontrastive learning. Specifically our method fine-tunes pretrained BERT on\nSNLI data, incorporating both supervised crossentropy loss and supervised\ncontrastive loss. Compared with baseline where fine-tuning is only done with\nsupervised cross-entropy loss similar to current state-of-the-art method SBERT,\nour supervised contrastive method improves 2.8% in average on Semantic Textual\nSimilarity (STS) benchmarks and 1.05% in average on various sentence transfer\ntasks.",

          "description": "Sexism has become an increasingly major problem on social networks during the\nlast years. The first shared task on sEXism Identification in Social neTworks\n(EXIST) at IberLEF 2021 is an international competition in the field of Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) with the aim to automatically identify sexism in\nsocial media content by applying machine learning methods. Thereby sexism\ndetection is formulated as a coarse (binary) classification problem and a\nfine-grained classification task that distinguishes multiple types of sexist\ncontent (e.g., dominance, stereotyping, and objectification). This paper\npresents the contribution of the AIT_FHSTP team at the EXIST2021 benchmark for\nboth tasks. To solve the tasks we applied two multilingual transformer models,\none based on multilingual BERT and one based on XLM-R. Our approach uses two\ndifferent strategies to adapt the transformers to the detection of sexist\ncontent: first, unsupervised pre-training with additional data and second,\nsupervised fine-tuning with additional and augmented data. For both tasks our\nbest model is XLM-R with unsupervised pre-training on the EXIST data and\nadditional datasets and fine-tuning on the provided dataset. The best run for\nthe binary classification (task 1) achieves a macro F1-score of 0.7752 and\nscores 5th rank in the benchmark; for the multiclass classification (task 2)\nour best submission scores 6th rank with a macro F1-score of 0.5589.",

Keeping the\nbalance between freedom of speech and respecting each other dignity is a major\nconcern of social media platform regulators. Although, automatic detection of\noffensive content using deep learning approaches seems to provide encouraging\nresults, training deep learning-based models requires large amounts of\nhigh-quality labeled data, which is often missing. In this regard, we present\nin this paper a new deep learning-based method that fuses a Back Translation\nmethod, and a Paraphrasing technique for data augmentation. Our pipeline\ninvestigates different word-embedding-based architectures for classification of\nhate speech. The back translation technique relies on an encoder-decoder\narchitecture pre-trained on a large corpus and mostly used for machine\ntranslation. In addition, paraphrasing exploits the transformer model and the\nmixture of experts to generate diverse paraphrases. Finally, LSTM, and CNN are\ncompared to seek enhanced classification results. We evaluate our proposal on\nfive publicly available datasets; namely, AskFm corpus, Formspring dataset,\nWarner and Waseem dataset, Olid, and Wikipedia toxic comments dataset.

          "description": "Understanding product attributes plays an important role in improving online\nshopping experience for customers and serves as an integral part for\nconstructing a product knowledge graph. Most existing methods focus on\nattribute extraction from text description or utilize visual information from\nproduct images such as shape and color. Compared to the inputs considered in\nprior works, a product image in fact contains more information, represented by\na rich mixture of words and visual clues with a layout carefully designed to\nimpress customers. This work proposes a more inclusive framework that fully\nutilizes these different modalities for attribute extraction. Inspired by\nrecent works in visual question answering, we use a transformer based sequence\nto sequence model to fuse representations of product text, Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) tokens and visual objects detected in the product image. The\nframework is further extended with the capability to extract attribute value\nacross multiple product categories with a single model, by training the decoder\nto predict both product category and attribute value and conditioning its\noutput on product category. The model provides a unified attribute extraction\nsolution desirable at an e-commerce platform that offers numerous product\ncategories with a diverse body of product attributes. We evaluated the model on\ntwo product attributes, one with many possible values and one with a small set\nof possible values, over 14 product categories and found the model could\nachieve 15% gain on the Recall and 10% gain on the F1 score compared to\nexisting methods using text-only features.",

          "description": "Adapting large-scale pretrained language models to downstream tasks via\nfine-tuning is the standard method for achieving state-of-the-art performance\non NLP benchmarks. However, fine-tuning all weights of models with millions or\nbillions of parameters is sample-inefficient, unstable in low-resource\nsettings, and wasteful as it requires storing a separate copy of the model for\neach task. Recent work has developed parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,\nbut these approaches either still require a relatively large number of\nparameters or underperform standard fine-tuning. In this work, we propose\nCompacter, a method for fine-tuning large-scale language models with a better\ntrade-off between task performance and the number of trainable parameters than\nprior work. Compacter accomplishes this by building on top of ideas from\nadapters, low-rank optimization, and parameterized hypercomplex multiplication\nlayers.\n\nSpecifically, Compacter inserts task-specific weight matrices into a\npretrained model's weights, which are computed efficiently as a sum of\nKronecker products between shared ``slow'' weights and ``fast'' rank-one\nmatrices defined per Compacter layer. By only training 0.047% of a pretrained\nmodel's parameters, Compacter performs on par with standard fine-tuning on GLUE\nand outperforms fine-tuning in low-resource settings.

          "description": "Human-computer interaction (HCI) is significantly impacted by delayed\nresponses from a spoken dialogue system. Hence, end-to-end (e2e) spoken\nlanguage understanding (SLU) solutions have recently been proposed to decrease\nlatency. Such approaches allow for the extraction of semantic information\ndirectly from the speech signal, thus bypassing the need for a transcript from\nan automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. In this paper, we propose a\ncompact e2e SLU architecture for streaming scenarios, where chunks of the\nspeech signal are processed continuously to predict intent and slot values. Our\nmodel is based on a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) and a\nunidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). We compare the performance of two\nalignment-free losses: the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) method\nand its adapted version, namely connectionist temporal localization (CTL). The\nlatter performs not only the classification but also localization of sequential\naudio events. The proposed solution is evaluated on the Fluent Speech Command\ndataset and results show our model ability to process incoming speech signal,\nreaching accuracy as high as 98.97 % for CTC and 98.78 % for CTL on\nsingle-label classification, and as high as 95.69 % for CTC and 95.28 % for CTL\non two-label prediction.",

Training an ordinary neural sequence model on a\ndataset augmented with recombined and resampled examples significantly improves\ngeneralization in two language processing problems -- instruction following\n(SCAN) and morphological analysis (SIGMORPHON 2018) -- where R&R enables\nlearning of new constructions and tenses from as few as eight initial examples.",

          "description": "Despite success in many domains, neural models struggle in settings where\ntrain and test examples are drawn from different distributions. In particular,\nin contrast to humans, conventional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models fail\nto generalize systematically, i.e., interpret sentences representing novel\ncombinations of concepts (e.g., text segments) seen in training. Traditional\ngrammar formalisms excel in such settings by implicitly encoding alignments\nbetween input and output segments, but are hard to scale and maintain. Instead\nof engineering a grammar, we directly model segment-to-segment alignments as\ndiscrete structured latent variables within a neural seq2seq model. To\nefficiently explore the large space of alignments, we introduce a reorder-first\nalign-later framework whose central component is a neural reordering module\nproducing {\\it separable} permutations. We present an efficient dynamic\nprogramming algorithm performing exact marginal inference of separable\npermutations, and, thus, enabling end-to-end differentiable training of our\nmodel. The resulting seq2seq model exhibits better systematic generalization\nthan standard models on synthetic problems and NLP tasks (i.e., semantic\nparsing and machine translation).",

However,\ntheir memory footprint, inference latency, and power consumption are\nprohibitive efficient inference at the edge, and even at the data center. While\nquantization can be a viable solution for this, previous work on quantizing\nTransformer based models use floating-point arithmetic during inference, which\ncannot efficiently utilize integer-only logical units such as the recent Turing\nTensor Cores, or traditional integer-only ARM processors. In this work, we\npropose I-BERT, a novel quantization scheme for Transformer based models that\nquantizes the entire inference with integer-only arithmetic. Based on\nlightweight integer-only approximation methods for nonlinear operations, e.g.,\nGELU, Softmax, and Layer Normalization, I-BERT performs an end-to-end\ninteger-only BERT inference without any floating point calculation. We evaluate\nour approach on GLUE downstream tasks using RoBERTa-Base/Large. We show that\nfor both cases, I-BERT achieves similar (and slightly higher) accuracy as\ncompared to the full-precision baseline. Furthermore, our preliminary\nimplementation of I-BERT shows a speedup of 2.4-4.0x for INT8 inference on a T4\nGPU system as compared to FP32 inference.

Using the STREUSLE corpus, we train a neural CRF sequence\ntagger and evaluate its performance along various axes of annotation. As the\nlabel set generalizes that of previous tasks (PARSEME, DiMSUM), we additionally\nevaluate how well the model generalizes to those test sets, finding that it\napproaches or surpasses existing models despite training only on STREUSLE.

          "description": "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis suggests that an over-parametrized network\nconsists of ``lottery tickets'', and training a certain collection of them\n(i.e., a subnetwork) can match the performance of the full model. In this\npaper, we study such a collection of tickets, which is referred to as ``winning\ntickets'', in extremely over-parametrized models, e.g., pre-trained language\nmodels. We observe that at certain compression ratios, the generalization\nperformance of the winning tickets can not only match but also exceed that of\nthe full model. In particular, we observe a phase transition phenomenon: As the\ncompression ratio increases, generalization performance of the winning tickets\nfirst improves then deteriorates after a certain threshold. We refer to the\ntickets on the threshold as ``super tickets''. We further show that the phase\ntransition is task and model dependent -- as the model size becomes larger and\nthe training data set becomes smaller, the transition becomes more pronounced.\nOur experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that the super tickets improve\nsingle task fine-tuning by $0.9$ points on BERT-base and $1.0$ points on\nBERT-large, in terms of task-average score. We also demonstrate that adaptively\nsharing the super tickets across tasks benefits multi-task learning.",

In this work, we analyze this problem\nfrom a novel cognition perspective: automatically building a hierarchical\ncognitive structure from the biased predictions and navigating that hierarchy\nto locate the relationships, making the tail relationships receive more\nattention in a coarse-to-fine mode. To this end, we propose a novel debiasing\nCognition Tree (CogTree) loss for unbiased SGG. We first build a cognitive\nstructure CogTree to organize the relationships based on the prediction of a\nbiased SGG model. The CogTree distinguishes remarkably different relationships\nat first and then focuses on a small portion of easily confused ones. Then, we\npropose a debiasing loss specially for this cognitive structure, which supports\ncoarse-to-fine distinction for the correct relationships.

The concept of lifelong\nlearning (LLL) aiming to enable a machine to sequentially learn new tasks from\nnew datasets describing the changing real world without forgetting the\npreviously learned knowledge is thus brought to attention. This paper reports,\nto our knowledge, the first effort to extensively consider and analyze the use\nof various approaches of LLL in end-to-end (E2E) ASR, including proposing novel\nmethods in saving data for past domains to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting\nproblem. An overall relative reduction of 28.7% in WER was achieved compared to\nthe fine-tuning baseline when sequentially learning on three very different\nbenchmark corpora.

          "description": "Attention mechanisms have become a standard tool for sequence modeling tasks,\nin particular by stacking self-attention layers over the entire input sequence\nas in the Transformer architecture. In this work we introduce a novel attention\nprocedure called staircase attention that, unlike self-attention, operates\nacross the sequence (in time) recurrently processing the input by adding\nanother step of processing. A step in the staircase comprises of backward\ntokens (encoding the sequence so far seen) and forward tokens (ingesting a new\npart of the sequence), or an extreme Ladder version with a forward step of zero\nthat simply repeats the Transformer on each step of the ladder, sharing the\nweights. We thus describe a family of such models that can trade off\nperformance and compute, by either increasing the amount of recurrence through\ntime, the amount of sequential processing via recurrence in depth, or both.\nStaircase attention is shown to be able to solve tasks that involve tracking\nthat conventional Transformers cannot, due to this recurrence. Further, it is\nshown to provide improved modeling power for the same size model (number of\nparameters) compared to self-attentive Transformers on large language modeling\nand dialogue tasks, yielding significant perplexity gains.",

          "description": "Disfluencies is an under-studied topic in NLP, even though it is ubiquitous\nin human conversation. This is largely due to the lack of datasets containing\ndisfluencies. In this paper, we present a new challenge question answering\ndataset, Disfl-QA, a derivative of SQuAD, where humans introduce contextual\ndisfluencies in previously fluent questions. Disfl-QA contains a variety of\nchallenging disfluencies that require a more comprehensive understanding of the\ntext than what was necessary in prior datasets. Experiments show that the\nperformance of existing state-of-the-art question answering models degrades\nsignificantly when tested on Disfl-QA in a zero-shot setting.We show data\naugmentation methods partially recover the loss in performance and also\ndemonstrate the efficacy of using gold data for fine-tuning.

          "description": "Multilingual transformers (XLM, mT5) have been shown to have remarkable\ntransfer skills in zero-shot settings. Most transfer studies, however, rely on\nautomatically translated resources (XNLI, XQuAD), making it hard to discern the\nparticular linguistic knowledge that is being transferred, and the role of\nexpert annotated monolingual datasets when developing task-specific models. We\ninvestigate the cross-lingual transfer abilities of XLM-R for Chinese and\nEnglish natural language inference (NLI), with a focus on the recent\nlarge-scale Chinese dataset OCNLI. To better understand linguistic transfer, we\ncreated 4 categories of challenge and adversarial tasks (totaling 17 new\ndatasets) for Chinese that build on several well-known resources for English\n(e.g., HANS, NLI stress-tests). We find that cross-lingual models trained on\nEnglish NLI do transfer well across our Chinese tasks (e.g., in 3/4 of our\nchallenge categories, they perform as well/better than the best monolingual\nmodels, even on 3/5 uniquely Chinese linguistic phenomena such as idioms, pro\ndrop). These results, however, come with important caveats: cross-lingual\nmodels often perform best when trained on a mixture of English and high-quality\nmonolingual NLI data (OCNLI), and are often hindered by automatically\ntranslated resources (XNLI-zh). For many phenomena, all models continue to\nstruggle, highlighting the need for our new diagnostics to help benchmark\nChinese and cross-lingual models.

To better\naccommodate such training, we also propose new pretext tasks for learning\nmathematical rules. We call them (Neighbor) Reasoning Order Prediction (ROP or\nNROP).

However,\nincorporating a new language in an LM still remains a challenge, particularly\nfor languages with limited corpora and in unseen scripts. In this paper we\nargue that relatedness among languages in a language family may be exploited to\novercome some of the corpora limitations of LRLs, and propose RelateLM. We\nfocus on Indian languages, and exploit relatedness along two dimensions: (1)\nscript (since many Indic scripts originated from the Brahmic script), and (2)\nsentence structure. RelateLM uses transliteration to convert the unseen script\nof limited LRL text into the script of a Related Prominent Language (RPL)\n(Hindi in our case). While exploiting similar sentence structures, RelateLM\nutilizes readily available bilingual dictionaries to pseudo translate RPL text\ninto LRL corpora. Experiments on multiple real-world benchmark datasets provide\nvalidation to our hypothesis that using a related language as pivot, along with\ntransliteration and pseudo translation based data augmentation, can be an\neffective way to adapt LMs for LRLs, rather than direct training or pivoting\nthrough English.",

A key\nchallenge for this ultra-fine entity typing task is that human annotated data\nare extremely scarce, and the annotation ability of existing distant or weak\nsupervision approaches is very limited. To remedy this problem, in this paper,\nwe propose to obtain training data for ultra-fine entity typing by using a BERT\nMasked Language Model (MLM). Given a mention in a sentence, our approach\nconstructs an input for the BERT MLM so that it predicts context dependent\nhypernyms of the mention, which can be used as type labels. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that, with the help of these automatically generated\nlabels, the performance of an ultra-fine entity typing model can be improved\nsubstantially.

However, the reward\nfunction to be used within the reinforcement learning approach can play a key\nrole for performance and is still partially unexplored. For this reason, in\nthis paper, we propose two reward functions for the task of abstractive\nsummarisation: the first function, referred to as RwB-Hinge, dynamically\nselects the samples for the gradient update. The second function, nicknamed\nRISK, leverages a small pool of strong candidates to inform the reward.

This year's\nshared task on robust spoken language identification sought to investigate just\nthis scenario: systems were to be trained on largely single-speaker speech from\none domain, but evaluated on data in other domains recorded from speakers under\ndifferent recording circumstances, mimicking realistic low-resource scenarios.\nWe see that domain and speaker mismatch proves very challenging for current\nmethods which can perform above 95% accuracy in-domain, which domain adaptation\ncan address to some degree, but that these conditions merit further\ninvestigation to make spoken language identification accessible in many\nscenarios.",

          "description": "We release a new benchmark for lexical substitution, the task of finding\nappropriate substitutes for a target word in a context. To assist humans with\nwriting, lexical substitution systems can suggest words that humans cannot\neasily think of. However, existing benchmarks depend on human recall as the\nonly source of data, and therefore lack coverage of the substitutes that would\nbe most helpful to humans. Furthermore, annotators often provide substitutes of\nlow quality, which are not actually appropriate in the given context. We\ncollect higher-coverage and higher-quality data by framing lexical substitution\nas a classification problem, guided by the intuition that it is easier for\nhumans to judge the appropriateness of candidate substitutes than conjure them\nfrom memory. To this end, we use a context-free thesaurus to produce candidates\nand rely on human judgement to determine contextual appropriateness. Compared\nto the previous largest benchmark, our Swords benchmark has 4.1x more\nsubstitutes per target word for the same level of quality, and its substitutes\nare 1.5x more appropriate (based on human judgement) for the same number of\nsubstitutes.",

          "description": "In conversation, uptake happens when a speaker builds on the contribution of\ntheir interlocutor by, for example, acknowledging, repeating or reformulating\nwhat they have said. In education, teachers' uptake of student contributions\nhas been linked to higher student achievement. Yet measuring and improving\nteachers' uptake at scale is challenging, as existing methods require expensive\nannotation by experts. We propose a framework for computationally measuring\nuptake, by (1) releasing a dataset of student-teacher exchanges extracted from\nUS math classroom transcripts annotated for uptake by experts; (2) formalizing\nuptake as pointwise Jensen-Shannon Divergence (pJSD), estimated via next\nutterance classification; (3) conducting a linguistically-motivated comparison\nof different unsupervised measures and (4) correlating these measures with\neducational outcomes. We find that although repetition captures a significant\npart of uptake, pJSD outperforms repetition-based baselines, as it is capable\nof identifying a wider range of uptake phenomena like question answering and\nreformulation. We apply our uptake measure to three different educational\ndatasets with outcome indicators. Unlike baseline measures, pJSD correlates\nsignificantly with instruction quality in all three, providing evidence for its\ngeneralizability and for its potential to serve as an automated professional\ndevelopment tool for teachers.",

In this paper, we first propose a novel\nmetric, Intra-modal Self-attention Distance (ISD), to quantify the relation\nconsistency by measuring the semantic distance between linguistic and visual\nrelations. In response, we present Inter-modal Alignment on Intra-modal\nSelf-attentions (IAIS), a regularized training method to optimize the ISD and\ncalibrate intra-modal self-attentions from the two modalities mutually via\ninter-modal alignment. The IAIS regularizer boosts the performance of\nprevailing models on Flickr30k and MS COCO datasets by a considerable margin,\nwhich demonstrates the superiority of our approach.",

However, one of the major challenges in \\emph{neural}\nkeyphrase generation is processing long documents using deep neural networks.\nGenerally, documents are truncated before given as inputs to neural networks.\nConsequently, the models may miss essential points conveyed in the target\ndocument. To overcome this limitation, we propose \\emph{SEG-Net}, a neural\nkeyphrase generation model that is composed of two major components, (1) a\nselector that selects the salient sentences in a document and (2) an\nextractor-generator that jointly extracts and generates keyphrases from the\nselected sentences. SEG-Net uses Transformer, a self-attentive architecture, as\nthe basic building block with a novel \\emph{layer-wise} coverage attention to\nsummarize most of the points discussed in the document. The experimental\nresults on seven keyphrase generation benchmarks from scientific and web\ndocuments demonstrate that SEG-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art neural\ngenerative methods by a large margin.",

We propose a two-stage approach: the first stage learns a\nsubword-discriminative feature representation and the second stage applies\nclustering to the learned representation and obtains phone-like clusters as the\ndiscovered acoustic units. In the first stage, a recently proposed method in\nthe task of unsupervised subword modeling is improved by replacing a\nmonolingual out-of-domain (OOD) ASR system with a multilingual one to create a\nsubword-discriminative representation that is more language-independent. In the\nsecond stage, segment-level k-means is adopted, and two methods to represent\nthe variable-length speech segments as fixed-dimension feature vectors are\ncompared. Experiments on a very low-resource Mboshi language corpus show that\nour approach outperforms state-of-the-art AUD in both normalized mutual\ninformation (NMI) and F-score. The multilingual ASR improved upon the\nmonolingual ASR in providing OOD phone labels and in estimating the phone\nboundaries. A comparison of our systems with and without knowing the\nground-truth phone boundaries showed a 16% NMI performance gap, suggesting that\nthe current approach can significantly benefit from improved phone boundary\nestimation.",

In the implementation, we first specifically design an input tag to\nemphasize the target word in the contexts. Second, we construct a new vector on\nthe fine-tuned embeddings from XLM-RoBERTa and feed it to a fully-connected\nnetwork to output the probability of whether the target word in the context has\nthe same meaning or not. The new vector is attained by concatenating the\nembedding of the [CLS] token and the embeddings of the target word in the\ncontexts.

          "description": "Probing complex language models has recently revealed several insights into\nlinguistic and semantic patterns found in the learned representations. In this\narticle, we probe BERT specifically to understand and measure the relational\nknowledge it captures in its parametric memory. While probing for linguistic\nunderstanding is commonly applied to all layers of BERT as well as fine-tuned\nmodels, this has not been done for factual knowledge. We utilize existing\nknowledge base completion tasks (LAMA) to probe every layer of pre-trained as\nwell as fine-tuned BERT models(ranking, question answering, NER). Our findings\nshow that knowledge is not just contained in BERT's final layers. Intermediate\nlayers contribute a significant amount (17-60%) to the total knowledge found.\nProbing intermediate layers also reveals how different types of knowledge\nemerge at varying rates. When BERT is fine-tuned, relational knowledge is\nforgotten. The extent of forgetting is impacted by the fine-tuning objective\nand the training data. We found that ranking models forget the least and retain\nmore knowledge in their final layer compared to masked language modeling and\nquestion-answering. However, masked language modeling performed the best at\nacquiring new knowledge from the training data. When it comes to learning\nfacts, we found that capacity and fact density are key factors. We hope this\ninitial work will spur further research into understanding the parametric\nmemory of language models and the effect of training objectives on factual\nknowledge. The code to repeat the experiments is publicly available on GitHub.",

          "description": "Aiming at expanding few-shot relations' coverage in knowledge graphs (KGs),\nfew-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) has recently gained more research\ninterests. Some existing models employ a few-shot relation's multi-hop neighbor\ninformation to enhance its semantic representation. However, noise neighbor\ninformation might be amplified when the neighborhood is excessively sparse and\nno neighbor is available to represent the few-shot relation. Moreover, modeling\nand inferring complex relations of one-to-many (1-N), many-to-one (N-1), and\nmany-to-many (N-N) by previous knowledge graph completion approaches requires\nhigh model complexity and a large amount of training instances. Thus, inferring\ncomplex relations in the few-shot scenario is difficult for FKGC models due to\nlimited training instances. In this paper, we propose a few-shot relational\nlearning with global-local framework to address the above issues. At the global\nstage, a novel gated and attentive neighbor aggregator is built for accurately\nintegrating the semantics of a few-shot relation's neighborhood, which helps\nfiltering the noise neighbors even if a KG contains extremely sparse\nneighborhoods. For the local stage, a meta-learning based TransH (MTransH)\nmethod is designed to model complex relations and train our model in a few-shot\nlearning fashion. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art FKGC approaches on the frequently-used benchmark datasets\nNELL-One and Wiki-One. Compared with the strong baseline model MetaR, our model\nachieves 5-shot FKGC performance improvements of 8.0% on NELL-One and 2.8% on\nWiki-One by the metric Hits@10.",

          "description": "Transformer has become ubiquitous in the deep learning field. One of the key\ningredients that destined its success is the self-attention mechanism, which\nallows fully-connected contextual encoding over input tokens. However, despite\nits effectiveness in modeling short sequences, self-attention suffers when\nhandling inputs with extreme long-range dependencies, as its complexity grows\nquadratically with respect to the sequence length. Therefore, long sequences\nare often encoded by Transformer in chunks using a sliding window.

          "description": "Document-level Relation Extraction (RE) requires extracting relations\nexpressed within and across sentences. Recent works show that graph-based\nmethods, usually constructing a document-level graph that captures\ndocument-aware interactions, can obtain useful entity representations thus\nhelping tackle document-level RE. These methods either focus more on the entire\ngraph, or pay more attention to a part of the graph, e.g., paths between the\ntarget entity pair. However, we find that document-level RE may benefit from\nfocusing on both of them simultaneously. Therefore, to obtain more\ncomprehensive entity representations, we propose the Coarse-to-Fine Entity\nRepresentation model (CFER) that adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy involving two\nphases. First, CFER uses graph neural networks to integrate global information\nin the entire graph at a coarse level. Next, CFER utilizes the global\ninformation as a guidance to selectively aggregate path information between the\ntarget entity pair at a fine level. In classification, we combine the entity\nrepresentations from both two levels into more comprehensive representations\nfor relation extraction. Experimental results on two document-level RE\ndatasets, DocRED and CDR, show that CFER outperforms existing models and is\nrobust to the uneven label distribution.",

          "description": "We introduce Lookup-Table Language Models (LookupLM), a method for scaling up\nthe size of RNN language models with only a constant increase in the floating\npoint operations, by increasing the expressivity of the embedding table. In\nparticular, we instantiate an (additional) embedding table which embeds the\nprevious n-gram token sequence, rather than a single token. This allows the\nembedding table to be scaled up arbitrarily -- with a commensurate increase in\nperformance -- without changing the token vocabulary. Since embeddings are\nsparsely retrieved from the table via a lookup; increasing the size of the\ntable adds neither extra operations to each forward pass nor extra parameters\nthat need to be stored on limited GPU/TPU memory. We explore scaling n-gram\nembedding tables up to nearly a billion parameters. When trained on a 3-billion\nsentence corpus, we find that LookupLM improves long tail log perplexity by\n2.44 and long tail WER by 23.4% on a downstream speech recognition task over a\nstandard RNN language model baseline, an improvement comparable to a scaling up\nthe baseline by 6.2x the number of floating point operations.",

We demonstrate the\napplicability of our framework in a practical setting by leveraging\npre-existing teacher LMs and training student LMs that perform competitively\nwith or even outperform teacher LMs trained on several orders of magnitude more\ndata and with a fixed model capacity.

          "description": "Recurrent neural networks are widely used in speech and language processing.\nDue to dependency on the past, standard algorithms for training these models,\nsuch as back-propagation through time (BPTT), cannot be efficiently\nparallelised. Furthermore, applying these models to more complex structures\nthan sequences requires inference time approximations, which introduce\ninconsistency between inference and training. This paper shows that recurrent\nneural networks can be reformulated as fixed-points of non-linear equation\nsystems. These fixed-points can be computed using an iterative algorithm\nexactly and in as many iterations as the length of any given sequence. Each\niteration of this algorithm adds one additional Markovian-like order of\ndependencies such that upon termination all dependencies modelled by the\nrecurrent neural networks have been incorporated. Although exact fixed-points\ninherit the same parallelization and inconsistency issues, this paper shows\nthat approximate fixed-points can be computed in parallel and used consistently\nin training and inference including tasks such as lattice rescoring.\nExperimental validation is performed in two tasks, Penn Tree Bank and\nWikiText-2, and shows that approximate fixed-points yield competitive\nprediction performance to recurrent neural networks trained using the BPTT\nalgorithm.",

          "description": "Question answering (QA) models for reading comprehension have achieved\nhuman-level accuracy on in-distribution test sets. However, they have been\ndemonstrated to lack robustness to challenge sets, whose distribution is\ndifferent from that of training sets. Existing data augmentation methods\nmitigate this problem by simply augmenting training sets with synthetic\nexamples sampled from the same distribution as the challenge sets. However,\nthese methods assume that the distribution of a challenge set is known a\npriori, making them less applicable to unseen challenge sets. In this study, we\nfocus on question-answer pair generation (QAG) to mitigate this problem. While\nmost existing QAG methods aim to improve the quality of synthetic examples, we\nconjecture that diversity-promoting QAG can mitigate the sparsity of training\nsets and lead to better robustness.

          "description": "Natural language processing (NLP) systems have been proven to be vulnerable\nto backdoor attacks, whereby hidden features (backdoors) are trained into a\nlanguage model and may only be activated by specific inputs (called triggers),\nto trick the model into producing unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we\ncreate covert and natural triggers for textual backdoor attacks, \\textit{hidden\nbackdoors}, where triggers can fool both modern language models and human\ninspection. We deploy our hidden backdoors through two state-of-the-art trigger\nembedding methods. The first approach via homograph replacement, embeds the\ntrigger into deep neural networks through the visual spoofing of lookalike\ncharacter replacement. The second approach uses subtle differences between text\ngenerated by language models and real natural text to produce trigger sentences\nwith correct grammar and high fluency. We demonstrate that the proposed hidden\nbackdoors can be effective across three downstream security-critical NLP tasks,\nrepresentative of modern human-centric NLP systems, including toxic comment\ndetection, neural machine translation (NMT), and question answering (QA). Our\ntwo hidden backdoor attacks can achieve an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of at\nleast $97\\%$ with an injection rate of only $3\\%$ in toxic comment detection,\n$95.1\\%$ ASR in NMT with less than $0.5\\%$ injected data, and finally $91.12\\%$\nASR against QA updated with only 27 poisoning data samples on a model\npreviously trained with 92,024 samples (0.029\\%).

          "description": "The states of a deterministic finite automaton A can be identified with\ncollections of words in Pf(L(A)) -- the set of prefixes of words belonging to\nthe regular language accepted by A. But words can be ordered and among the many\npossible orders a very natural one is the co-lexicographic one. Such\nnaturalness stems from the fact that it suggests a transfer of the order from\nwords to the automaton's states. In a number of papers automata admitting a\ntotal ordering of states coherent with the ordering of the set of words\nreaching them have been proposed. Such class of ordered automata -- the Wheeler\nautomata -- turned out to be efficiently stored/searched using an index.\nUnfortunately not all automata can be totally ordered as previously outlined.\nHowever, automata can always be partially ordered and an intrinsic measure of\ntheir complexity can be defined and effectively determined, as the minimum\nwidth of one of their admissible partial orders. As shown in previous works,\nthis new concept of width of an automaton has useful consequences in the fields\nof graph compression, indexing data structures, and automata theory. In this\npaper we prove that a canonical, minimum-width, partially-ordered automaton\naccepting a language L -- dubbed the Hasse automaton H of L -- can be\nexhibited. H provides, in a precise sense, the best possible way to (partially)\norder the states of any automaton accepting L, as long as we want to maintain\nan operational link with the (co-lexicographic) order of Pf(L(A)). Using H we\nprove that the width of the language can be effectively computed from the\nminimum automaton recognizing the language. Finally, we explore the\nrelationship between two (often conflicting) objectives: minimizing the width\nand minimizing the number of states of an automaton.",

We also create a new benchmark with human\nannotations that cover four different text genres to evaluate monolingual word\nalignment models in more realistic settings. Experimental results show that our\nproposed model outperforms all previous approaches for monolingual word\nalignment as well as a competitive QA-based baseline, which was previously only\napplied to bilingual data. Our model demonstrates good generalizability to\nthree out-of-domain datasets and shows great utility in two downstream\napplications: automatic text simplification and sentence pair classification\ntasks.",

          "description": "A continuous constraint satisfaction problem (CCSP) is a constraint\nsatisfaction problem (CSP) with a domain $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}$. We engage in a\nsystematic study to classify CCSPs that are complete of the Existential Theory\nof the Reals, i.e., ER-complete. To define this class, we first consider the\nproblem ETR, which also stands for Existential Theory of the Reals. In an\ninstance of this problem we are given some sentence of the form $\\exists x_1,\n\\ldots, x_n \\in \\mathbb{R} : \\Phi(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$, where $\\Phi$ is a\nwell-formed quantifier-free formula consisting of the symbols $\\{0, 1, +,\n\\cdot, \\geq, >, \\wedge, \\vee, \\neg\\}$, the goal is to check whether this\nsentence is true. Now the class ER is the family of all problems that admit a\npolynomial-time reduction to ETR. It is known that NP $\\subseteq$ ER\n$\\subseteq$ PSPACE.\n\nWe restrict our attention on CCSPs with addition constraints ($x + y = z$)\nand some other mild technical condition. Previously, it was shown that\nmultiplication constraints ($x \\cdot y = z$), squaring constraints ($x^2 = y$),\nor inversion constraints ($x\\cdot y = 1$) are sufficient to establish\nER-completeness. We extend this in the strongest possible sense for equality\nconstraints as follows. We show that CCSPs (with addition constraints and some\nother mild technical condition) that have any one well-behaved curved equality\nconstraint ($f(x,y) = 0$) are ER-complete. We further extend our results to\ninequality constraints. We show that any well-behaved convexly curved and any\nwell-behaved concavely curved inequality constraint ($f(x,y) \\geq 0$ and\n$g(x,y) \\geq 0$) imply ER-completeness on the class of such CCSPs.\n\nWe apply our findings to geometric packing and answer an open question by\nAbrahamsen et al. [FOCS 2020]. Namely, we establish ER-completeness of packing\nconvex pieces into a square container under rotations and translations.",

          "description": "Negation is both an operation in formal logic and in natural language by\nwhich a proposition is replaced by one stating the opposite, as by the addition\nof \"not\" or another negation cue. Treating negation in an adequate way is\nrequired for cognitive reasoning, which aims at modeling the human ability to\ndraw meaningful conclusions despite incomplete and inconsistent knowledge. One\ntask of cognitive reasoning is answering questions given by sentences in\nnatural language. There are tools based on discourse representation theory to\nconvert sentences automatically into a formal logic representation, and\nadditional knowledge can be added using the predicate names in the formula and\nknowledge databases. However, the knowledge in logic databases in practice\nalways is incomplete. Hence, forward reasoning of automated reasoning systems\nalone does not suffice to derive answers to questions because, instead of\ncomplete proofs, often only partial positive knowledge can be derived, while\nnegative knowledge is used only during the reasoning process. In consequence,\nwe aim at eliminating syntactic negation, strictly speaking, the negated event\nor property. In this paper, we describe an effective procedure to determine the\nnegated event or property in order to replace it by its inverse. This lays the\nbasis of cognitive reasoning, employing both logic and machine learning for\ngeneral question answering. We evaluate our procedure by several benchmarks and\ndemonstrate its practical usefulness in our cognitive reasoning system.",

The framework can opt to abstain from predicting\nalignment for the detected dangling entities. We propose three techniques for\ndangling entity detection that are based on the distribution of\nnearest-neighbor distances, i.e., nearest neighbor classification, marginal\nranking and background ranking. After detecting and removing dangling entities,\nan incorporated entity alignment model in our framework can provide more robust\nalignment for remaining entities.

          "description": "Transformers have been shown to emulate logical deduction over natural\nlanguage theories (logical rules expressed in natural language), reliably\nassigning true/false labels to candidate implications. However, their ability\nto generate implications of a theory has not yet been demonstrated, and methods\nfor reconstructing proofs of answers are imperfect. In this work we show that a\ngenerative model, called ProofWriter, can reliably generate both implications\nof a theory and the natural language proof(s) that support them. In particular,\niterating a 1-step implication generator results in proofs that are highly\nreliable, and represent actual model decisions (rather than post-hoc\nrationalizations). On the RuleTaker dataset, the accuracy of ProofWriter's\nproofs exceed previous methods by +9% absolute, and in a way that generalizes\nto proof depths unseen in training and on out-of-domain problems. We also show\nthat generative techniques can perform a type of abduction with high precision:\nGiven a theory and an unprovable conclusion, identify a missing fact that\nallows the conclusion to be proved, along with a proof. These results\nsignificantly improve the viability of neural methods for systematically\nreasoning over natural language.",

          "description": "Analysing whether neural language models encode linguistic information has\nbecome popular in NLP. One method of doing so, which is frequently cited to\nsupport the claim that models like BERT encode syntax, is called probing;\nprobes are small supervised models trained to extract linguistic information\nfrom another model's output. If a probe is able to predict a particular\nstructure, it is argued that the model whose output it is trained on must have\nimplicitly learnt to encode it. However, drawing a generalisation about a\nmodel's linguistic knowledge about a specific phenomena based on what a probe\nis able to learn may be problematic: in this work, we show that semantic cues\nin training data means that syntactic probes do not properly isolate syntax. We\ngenerate a new corpus of semantically nonsensical but syntactically well-formed\nJabberwocky sentences, which we use to evaluate two probes trained on normal\ndata. We train the probes on several popular language models (BERT, GPT, and\nRoBERTa), and find that in all settings they perform worse when evaluated on\nthese data, for one probe by an average of 15.4 UUAS points absolute. Although\nin most cases they still outperform the baselines, their lead is reduced\nsubstantially, e.g. by 53% in the case of BERT for one probe. This begs the\nquestion: what empirical scores constitute knowing syntax?",

          "description": "Despite superior performance on various natural language processing tasks,\npre-trained models such as BERT are challenged by deploying on\nresource-constraint devices.

This practically limits the further application of model\ncompression. Moreover, the ineffective training and searching process of\nexisting elastic compression paradigms[4,27] prevents the direct migration to\nBERT compression. Motivated by the necessity of efficient inference across\nvarious constraints on BERT, we propose a novel approach, YOCO-BERT, to achieve\ncompress once and deploy everywhere. Specifically, we first construct a huge\nsearch space with 10^13 architectures, which covers nearly all configurations\nin BERT model. Then, we propose a novel stochastic nature gradient optimization\nmethod to guide the generation of optimal candidate architecture which could\nkeep a balanced trade-off between explorations and exploitation. When a certain\nresource constraint is given, a lightweight distribution optimization approach\nis utilized to obtain the optimal network for target deployment without\nfine-tuning.

In this paper we present COINS, a recursive inference\nframework that i) iteratively reads context sentences, ii) dynamically\ngenerates contextualized inference rules, encodes them, and iii) uses them to\nguide task-specific output generation. We apply COINS to a Narrative Story\nCompletion task that asks a model to complete a story with missing sentences,\nto produce a coherent story with plausible logical connections, causal\nrelationships, and temporal dependencies. By modularizing inference and\nsentence generation steps in a recurrent model, we aim to make reasoning steps\nand their effects on next sentence generation transparent. Our automatic and\nmanual evaluations show that the model generates better story sentences than\nSOTA baselines, especially in terms of coherence.

The SCM proposes that stereotypes can be understood along two\nprimary dimensions: warmth and competence. We present a method for defining\nwarmth and competence axes in semantic embedding space, and show that the four\nquadrants defined by this subspace accurately represent the warmth and\ncompetence concepts, according to annotated lexicons. We then apply our\ncomputational SCM model to textual stereotype data and show that it compares\nfavourably with survey-based studies in the psychological literature.\nFurthermore, we explore various strategies to counter stereotypical beliefs\nwith anti-stereotypes. It is known that countering stereotypes with\nanti-stereotypical examples is one of the most effective ways to reduce biased\nthinking, yet the problem of generating anti-stereotypes has not been\npreviously studied.

          "description": "The major paradigm of applying a pre-trained language model to downstream\ntasks is to fine-tune it on labeled task data, which often suffers instability\nand low performance when the labeled examples are scarce.~One way to alleviate\nthis problem is to apply post-training on unlabeled task data before\nfine-tuning, adapting the pre-trained model to target domains by contrastive\nlearning that considers either token-level or sequence-level similarity.\nInspired by the success of sequence masking, we argue that both token-level and\nsequence-level similarities can be captured with a pair of masked\nsequences.~Therefore, we propose complementary random masking (CRM) to generate\na pair of masked sequences from an input sequence for sequence-level\ncontrastive learning and then develop contrastive masked language modeling\n(CMLM) for post-training to integrate both token-level and sequence-level\ncontrastive learnings.~Empirical results show that CMLM surpasses several\nrecent post-training methods in few-shot settings without the need for data\naugmentation.",

While of central importance to the study of\nlanguage, it is commonly approximated by each word's sample frequency in the\ncorpus. This approach, being highly dependent on sample size, assigns zero\nprobability to any out-of-vocabulary (oov) word form.

          "description": "Pretrained language models (PLMs) such as BERT adopt a training paradigm\nwhich first pretrain the model in general data and then finetune the model on\ntask-specific data, and have recently achieved great success. However, PLMs are\nnotorious for their enormous parameters and hard to be deployed on real-life\napplications. Knowledge distillation has been prevailing to address this\nproblem by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a much smaller\nstudent over a set of data. We argue that the selection of thee three key\ncomponents, namely teacher, training data, and learning objective, is crucial\nto the effectiveness of distillation. We, therefore, propose a four-stage\nprogressive distillation framework ERNIE-Tiny to compress PLM, which varies the\nthree components gradually from general level to task-specific level.\nSpecifically, the first stage, General Distillation, performs distillation with\nguidance from pretrained teacher, gerenal data and latent distillation loss.\nThen, General-Enhanced Distillation changes teacher model from pretrained\nteacher to finetuned teacher. After that, Task-Adaptive Distillation shifts\ntraining data from general data to task-specific data. In the end,\nTask-Specific Distillation, adds two additional losses, namely Soft-Label and\nHard-Label loss onto the last stage. Empirical results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework and generalization gain brought by ERNIE-Tiny.In\nparticular, experiments show that a 4-layer ERNIE-Tiny maintains over\n98.0%performance of its 12-layer teacher BERT base on GLUE benchmark,\nsurpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 1.0% GLUE score with the same amount of\nparameters. Moreover, ERNIE-Tiny achieves a new compression SOTA on five\nChinese NLP tasks, outperforming BERT base by 0.4% accuracy with 7.5x fewer\nparameters and9.4x faster inference speed.",

Second NER evaluation is based on both strict\nde-identification of entities (a person must be suppressed as a person) and\nthird evaluation on a loose sense of de-identification (no matter what how a\nperson is suppressed, as long it is suppressed). In the fourth and last step a\nnew kind of NER dataset is tested for recognising job titles in texts.",

Current\napproaches mostly employ end-to-end models and consequently face two\nchallenges. First, dialogue history modeling and Text-to-SQL parsing are\nimplicitly combined, hence it is hard to carry out interpretable analysis and\nobtain targeted improvement. Second, SQL annotation of multi-turn dialogue is\nvery expensive, leading to training data sparsity. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel decoupled multi-turn Text-to-SQL framework, where an utterance rewrite\nmodel first explicitly solves completion of dialogue context, and then a\nsingle-turn Text-to-SQL parser follows. A dual learning approach is also\nproposed for the utterance rewrite model to address the data sparsity problem.\nCompared with end-to-end approaches, the proposed decoupled method can achieve\nexcellent performance without any annotated in-domain data.

Recent attempts employ\nself-supervised training methods, such as contrastive predictive coding (CPC),\nwhere the next frame is predicted given past context. However, CPC only looks\nat the audio signal's frame-level structure. We overcome this limitation with a\nsegmental contrastive predictive coding (SCPC) framework that can model the\nsignal structure at a higher level e.g. at the phoneme level. In this\nframework, a convolutional neural network learns frame-level representation\nfrom the raw waveform via noise-contrastive estimation (NCE). A differentiable\nboundary detector finds variable-length segments, which are then used to\noptimize a segment encoder via NCE to learn segment representations. The\ndifferentiable boundary detector allows us to train frame-level and\nsegment-level encoders jointly. Typically, phoneme and word segmentation are\ntreated as separate tasks. We unify them and experimentally show that our\nsingle model outperforms existing phoneme and word segmentation methods on\nTIMIT and Buckeye datasets.

          "description": "A good open-domain chatbot should avoid presenting contradictory responses\nabout facts or opinions in a conversational session, known as its consistency\ncapacity. However, evaluating the consistency capacity of a chatbot is still\nchallenging. Employing human judges to interact with chatbots on purpose to\ncheck their capacities is costly and low-efficient, and difficult to get rid of\nsubjective bias. In this paper, we propose the Addressing Inquiries about\nHistory (AIH), an efficient and practical framework for the consistency\nevaluation. At the conversation stage, AIH attempts to address appropriate\ninquiries about the dialogue history to induce the chatbot to redeclare the\nhistorical facts or opinions. We carry out the conversation between chatbots,\nwhich is more efficient than the human-bot interaction and can also alleviate\nthe subjective bias. In this way, we manage to rapidly obtain a dialog session\nthat contains responses with high contradiction possibilities. At the\ncontradiction recognition stage, we can either employ human judges or a natural\nlanguage inference (NLI) model to recognize whether the answers to the\ninquiries are contradictory with history. Finally, we are able to rank chatbots\naccording to the contradiction statistics. Experiments on open-domain chatbots\nshow that our approach can efficiently and reliably assess the consistency\ncapacity of chatbots and achieve a high ranking correlation with the human\nevaluation. We release the framework and hope to help improve the consistency\ncapacity of chatbots. \\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/ictnlp/AIH}}",

In this work, we\ntransfer supervision from high resource language (HRL) to multiple low-resource\nlanguages (LRLs) for natural language generation (NLG). We consider four NLG\ntasks (text summarization, question generation, news headline generation, and\ndistractor generation) and three syntactically diverse languages, i.e.,\nEnglish, Hindi, and Japanese. We propose an unsupervised cross-lingual language\ngeneration framework (called ZmBART) that does not use any parallel or\npseudo-parallel/back-translated data. In this framework, we further pre-train\nmBART sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder model with an auxiliary task\nusing monolingual data of three languages. The objective function of the\nauxiliary task is close to the target tasks which enriches the multi-lingual\nlatent representation of mBART and provides good initialization for target\ntasks. Then, this model is fine-tuned with task-specific supervised English\ndata and directly evaluated with low-resource languages in the Zero-shot\nsetting. To overcome catastrophic forgetting and spurious correlation issues,\nwe applied freezing model component and data argumentation approaches\nrespectively. This simple modeling approach gave us promising results.We\nexperimented with few-shot training (with 1000 supervised data points) which\nboosted the model performance further. We performed several ablations and\ncross-lingual transferability analyses to demonstrate the robustness of ZmBART.",

          "description": "Incorporating syntax into neural approaches in NLP has a multitude of\npractical and scientific benefits. For instance, a language model that is\nsyntax-aware is likely to be able to produce better samples; even a\ndiscriminative model like BERT with a syntax module could be used for core NLP\ntasks like unsupervised syntactic parsing. Rapid progress in recent years was\narguably spurred on by the empirical success of the Parsing-Reading-Predict\narchitecture of (Shen et al., 2018a), later simplified by the Order Neuron LSTM\nof (Shen et al., 2019). Most notably, this is the first time neural approaches\nwere able to successfully perform unsupervised syntactic parsing (evaluated by\nvarious metrics like F-1 score).\n\nHowever, even heuristic (much less fully mathematical) understanding of why\nand when these architectures work is lagging severely behind. In this work, we\nanswer representational questions raised by the architectures in (Shen et al.,\n2018a, 2019), as well as some transition-based syntax-aware language models\n(Dyer et al., 2016): what kind of syntactic structure can current neural\napproaches to syntax represent? Concretely, we ground this question in the\nsandbox of probabilistic context-free-grammars (PCFGs), and identify a key\naspect of the representational power of these approaches: the amount and\ndirectionality of context that the predictor has access to when forced to make\nparsing decision. We show that with limited context (either bounded, or\nunidirectional), there are PCFGs, for which these approaches cannot represent\nthe max-likelihood parse; conversely, if the context is unlimited, they can\nrepresent the max-likelihood parse of any PCFG.",

          "description": "In task-oriented dialogue (ToD), a user holds a conversation with an\nartificial agent to complete a concrete task. Although this technology\nrepresents one of the central objectives of AI and has been the focus of ever\nmore intense research and development efforts, it is currently limited to a few\nnarrow domains (e.g., food ordering, ticket booking) and a handful of languages\n(e.g., English, Chinese). This work provides an extensive overview of existing\nmethods and resources in multilingual ToD as an entry point to this exciting\nand emerging field. We find that the most critical factor preventing the\ncreation of truly multilingual ToD systems is the lack of datasets in most\nlanguages for both training and evaluation. In fact, acquiring annotations or\nhuman feedback for each component of modular systems or for data-hungry\nend-to-end systems is expensive and tedious. Hence, state-of-the-art approaches\nto multilingual ToD mostly rely on (zero- or few-shot) cross-lingual transfer\nfrom resource-rich languages (almost exclusively English), either by means of\nmachine translation or multilingual representations. These approaches are\ncurrently viable only for typologically similar languages and languages with\nparallel / monolingual corpora available. On the other hand, their\neffectiveness beyond these boundaries is doubtful or hard to assess due to the\nlack of linguistically diverse benchmarks (especially for natural language\ngeneration and end-to-end evaluation). To overcome this limitation, we draw\nparallels between components of the ToD pipeline and other NLP tasks, which can\ninspire solutions for learning in low-resource scenarios. Finally, we list\nadditional challenges that multilinguality poses for related areas (such as\nspeech and human-centred evaluation), and indicate future directions that hold\npromise to further expand language coverage and dialogue capabilities of\ncurrent ToD systems.",

          "description": "Intent detection is a key component of modern goal-oriented dialog systems\nthat accomplish a user task by predicting the intent of users' text input.\nThere are three primary challenges in designing robust and accurate intent\ndetection models. First, typical intent detection models require a large amount\nof labeled data to achieve high accuracy. Unfortunately, in practical scenarios\nit is more common to find small, unbalanced, and noisy datasets. Secondly, even\nwith large training data, the intent detection models can see a different\ndistribution of test data when being deployed in the real world, leading to\npoor accuracy. Finally, a practical intent detection model must be\ncomputationally efficient in both training and single query inference so that\nit can be used continuously and re-trained frequently. We benchmark intent\ndetection methods on a variety of datasets. Our results show that Watson\nAssistant's intent detection model outperforms other commercial solutions and\nis comparable to large pretrained language models while requiring only a\nfraction of computational resources and training data. Watson Assistant\ndemonstrates a higher degree of robustness when the training and test\ndistributions differ.",

          "description": "Task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems often need to formulate knowledge base\n(KB) queries corresponding to the user intent and use the query results to\ngenerate system responses. Existing approaches require dialog datasets to\nexplicitly annotate these KB queries -- these annotations can be time\nconsuming, and expensive. In response, we define the novel problems of\npredicting the KB query and training the dialog agent, without explicit KB\nquery annotation. For query prediction, we propose a reinforcement learning\n(RL) baseline, which rewards the generation of those queries whose KB results\ncover the entities mentioned in subsequent dialog. Further analysis reveals\nthat correlation among query attributes in KB can significantly confuse memory\naugmented policy optimization (MAPO), an existing state of the art RL agent. To\naddress this, we improve the MAPO baseline with simple but important\nmodifications suited to our task. To train the full TOD system for our setting,\nwe propose a pipelined approach: it independently predicts when to make a KB\nquery (query position predictor), then predicts a KB query at the predicted\nposition (query predictor), and uses the results of predicted query in\nsubsequent dialog (next response predictor). Overall, our work proposes first\nsolutions to our novel problem, and our analysis highlights the research\nchallenges in training TOD systems without query annotation.",

We identify conditions where shorter inputs are not\nharmful, and achieve perplexity and efficiency improvements through two new\nmethods that decrease input length. First, we show that initially training a\nmodel on short subsequences before moving on to longer ones both reduces\noverall training time and, surprisingly, substantially improves perplexity.\nSecond, we show how to improve the efficiency of recurrence methods in\ntransformers, which let models condition on previously processed tokens when\ngenerating sequences that exceed the maximal length the transformer can handle\nat once. Existing methods require computationally expensive relative position\nembeddings; we introduce a simple alternative of adding absolute position\nembeddings to queries and keys instead of to word embeddings, which efficiently\nproduces superior results. We show that these recurrent models also benefit\nfrom short input lengths. Combining these techniques speeds up training by a\nfactor of 1.65, reduces memory usage, and substantially improves perplexity on\nWikiText-103, without adding any parameters.",

          "description": "Document-level relation extraction has attracted much attention in recent\nyears. It is usually formulated as a classification problem that predicts\nrelations for all entity pairs in the document. However, previous works\nindiscriminately represent intra- and inter-sentential relations in the same\nway, confounding the different patterns for predicting them. Besides, they\ncreate a document graph and use paths between entities on the graph as clues\nfor logical reasoning. However, not all entity pairs can be connected with a\npath and have the correct logical reasoning paths in their graph. Thus many\ncases of logical reasoning cannot be covered. This paper proposes an effective\narchitecture, SIRE, to represent intra- and inter-sentential relations in\ndifferent ways. We design a new and straightforward form of logical reasoning\nmodule that can cover more logical reasoning chains. Experiments on the public\ndatasets show SIRE outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods. Further\nanalysis shows that our predictions are reliable and explainable.

In this work, we propose\nnovel Contextual Reasoning Networks (DialogueCRN) to fully understand the\nconversational context from a cognitive perspective. Inspired by the Cognitive\nTheory of Emotion, we design multi-turn reasoning modules to extract and\nintegrate emotional clues.

          "description": "The ability to learn from limited data, or few-shot learning, is a desirable\nand often critical requirement for NLP systems. While many existing methods do\npoorly at learning from a handful of examples, large pretrained language models\nhave recently been shown to be efficient few-shot learners. One approach to\nfew-shot learning, which does not require finetuning of model parameters, is to\naugment the language model's input with priming text which is typically\nconstructed using task specific descriptions and examples. In this work, we\nfurther explore priming-based few-shot learning, with focus on using examples\nas prompts. We show that presenting examples in the right order is key for\ngeneralization. We introduce PERO (Prompting with Examples in the Right Order),\nwhere we formulate few-shot learning as search over the set of permutations of\nthe training examples. We show that PERO can learn to generalize efficiently\nusing as few as 10 examples, in contrast to existing approaches. While the\nnewline token is a natural choice for separating the examples in the prompt, we\nshow that learning a new separator token can potentially provide further gains\nin performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the\ntasks of sentiment classification, natural language inference and fact\nretrieval.

We\nintroduce CLIME, an interactive system to quickly refine cross-lingual word\nembeddings for a given classification problem. First, CLIME ranks words by\ntheir salience to the downstream task. Then, users mark similarity between\nkeywords and their nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Finally, CLIME\nupdates the embeddings using the annotations. We evaluate CLIME on identifying\nhealth-related text in four low-resource languages: Ilocano, Sinhalese,\nTigrinya, and Uyghur. Embeddings refined by CLIME capture more nuanced word\nsemantics and have higher test accuracy than the original embeddings.

Emotion recognition\nfrom brief contents should embrace the contrast between authors where the\ndifferences in personality and cognition can be traced within emotional\nexpressions. To tackle this challenge, we devise a framework that, on the one\nhand, infers latent individual aspects, from brief contents and, on the other\nhand, presents a novel ensemble classifier equipped with dynamic dropout\nconvnets to extract emotions from textual context. To categorize short text\ncontents, our proposed method conjointly leverages cognitive factors and\nexploits hidden information. We utilize the outcome vectors in a novel\nembedding model to foster emotion-pertinent features that are collectively\nassembled by lexicon inductions.

          "description": "There are concerns that the ability of language models (LMs) to generate high\nquality synthetic text can be misused to launch spam, disinformation, or\npropaganda. Therefore, the research community is actively working on developing\napproaches to detect whether a given text is organic or synthetic. While this\nis a useful first step, it is important to be able to further fingerprint the\nauthor LM to attribute its origin. Prior work on fingerprinting LMs is limited\nto attributing synthetic text generated by a handful (usually < 10) of\npre-trained LMs. However, LMs such as GPT2 are commonly fine-tuned in a myriad\nof ways (e.g., on a domain-specific text corpus) before being used to generate\nsynthetic text. It is challenging to fingerprinting fine-tuned LMs because the\nuniverse of fine-tuned LMs is much larger in realistic scenarios. To address\nthis challenge, we study the problem of large-scale fingerprinting of\nfine-tuned LMs in the wild. Using a real-world dataset of synthetic text\ngenerated by 108 different fine-tuned LMs, we conduct comprehensive experiments\nto demonstrate the limitations of existing fingerprinting approaches. Our\nresults show that fine-tuning itself is the most effective in attributing the\nsynthetic text generated by fine-tuned LMs.",

Existing methods use a similarity-based metric.\nHowever, they cannot make full use of knowledge transfer in NER model\nparameters. To address the issue, we propose a template-based method for NER,\ntreating NER as a language model ranking problem in a sequence-to-sequence\nframework, where original sentences and statement templates filled by candidate\nnamed entity span are regarded as the source sequence and the target sequence,\nrespectively. For inference, the model is required to classify each candidate\nspan based on the corresponding template scores. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed method achieves 92.55% F1 score on the CoNLL03 (rich-resource\ntask), and significantly better than fine-tuning BERT 10.88%, 15.34%, and\n11.73% F1 score on the MIT Movie, the MIT Restaurant, and the ATIS\n(low-resource task), respectively.",

          "description": "Many processes in psychology are complex, such as dyadic interactions between\ntwo interacting partners (e.g. patient-therapist, intimate relationship\npartners). Nevertheless, many basic questions about interactions are difficult\nto investigate because dyadic processes can be within a person and between\npartners, they are based on multimodal aspects of behavior and unfold rapidly.\nCurrent analyses are mainly based on the behavioral coding method, whereby\nhuman coders annotate behavior based on a coding schema. But coding is\nlabor-intensive, expensive, slow, focuses on few modalities. Current approaches\nin psychology use LIWC for analyzing couples' interactions. However, advances\nin natural language processing such as BERT could enable the development of\nsystems to potentially automate behavioral coding, which in turn could\nsubstantially improve psychological research. In this work, we train machine\nlearning models to automatically predict positive and negative communication\nbehavioral codes of 368 German-speaking Swiss couples during an 8-minute\nconflict interaction on a fine-grained scale (10-seconds sequences) using\nlinguistic features and paralinguistic features derived with openSMILE.

          "description": "How romantic partners interact with each other during a conflict influences\nhow they feel at the end of the interaction and is predictive of whether the\npartners stay together in the long term. Hence understanding the emotions of\neach partner is important. Yet current approaches that are used include\nself-reports which are burdensome and hence limit the frequency of this data\ncollection. Automatic emotion prediction could address this challenge. Insights\nfrom psychology research indicate that partners' behaviors influence each\nother's emotions in conflict interaction and hence, the behavior of both\npartners could be considered to better predict each partner's emotion. However,\nit is yet to be investigated how doing so compares to only using each partner's\nown behavior in terms of emotion prediction performance. In this work, we used\nBERT to extract linguistic features (i.e., what partners said) and openSMILE to\nextract paralinguistic features (i.e., how they said it) from a data set of 368\nGerman-speaking Swiss couples (N = 736 individuals) which were videotaped\nduring an 8-minutes conflict interaction in the laboratory. Based on those\nfeatures, we trained machine learning models to predict if partners feel\npositive or negative after the conflict interaction. Our results show that\nincluding the behavior of the other partner improves the prediction\nperformance. Furthermore, for men, considering how their female partners spoke\nis most important and for women considering what their male partner said is\nmost important in getting better prediction performance. This work is a step\ntowards automatically recognizing each partners' emotion based on the behavior\nof both, which would enable a better understanding of couples in research,\ntherapy, and the real world.",

After isolating decisions that do\ndepend on the input, we explore interpreting these decisions using several\ndifferent attribution methods. We compare these techniques based on their\nability to select content and reconstruct the model's predicted token from\nperturbations of the input, thus revealing whether highlighted attributions are\ntruly important for the generation of the next token.

          "description": "Among ubiquitous multimodal data in the real world, text is the modality\ngenerated by human, while image reflects the physical world honestly. In a\nvisual understanding application, machines are expected to understand images\nlike human. Inspired by this, we propose a novel self-supervised learning\nmethod, named Text-enhanced Visual Deep InfoMax (TVDIM), to learn better visual\nrepresentations by fully utilizing the naturally-existing multimodal data. Our\ncore idea of self-supervised learning is to maximize the mutual information\nbetween features extracted from multiple views of a shared context to a\nrational degree. Different from previous methods which only consider multiple\nviews from a single modality, our work produces multiple views from different\nmodalities, and jointly optimizes the mutual information for features pairs of\nintra-modality and inter-modality. Considering the information gap between\ninter-modality features pairs from data noise, we adopt a \\emph{ranking-based}\ncontrastive learning to optimize the mutual information. During evaluation, we\ndirectly use the pre-trained visual representations to complete various image\nclassification tasks. Experimental results show that, TVDIM significantly\noutperforms previous visual self-supervised methods when processing the same\nset of images.",

          "description": "Spoken term discovery from untranscribed speech audio could be achieved via a\ntwo-stage process. In the first stage, the unlabelled speech is decoded into a\nsequence of subword units that are learned and modelled in an unsupervised\nmanner. In the second stage, partial sequence matching and clustering are\nperformed on the decoded subword sequences, resulting in a set of discovered\nwords or phrases. A limitation of this approach is that the results of subword\ndecoding could be erroneous, and the errors would impact the subsequent steps.\nWhile Siamese/Triplet network is one approach to learn segment representations\nthat can improve the discovery process, the challenge in spoken term discovery\nunder a complete unsupervised scenario is that training examples are\nunavailable. In this paper, we propose to generate training examples from\ninitial hypothesized sequence clusters. The Siamese/Triplet network is trained\non the hypothesized examples to measure the similarity between two speech\nsegments and hereby perform re-clustering of all hypothesized subword sequences\nto achieve spoken term discovery. Experimental results show that the proposed\napproach is effective in obtaining training examples for Siamese and Triplet\nnetworks, improving the efficacy of spoken term discovery as compared with the\noriginal two-stage method.",

          "description": "Recommendation models can effectively estimate underlying user interests and\npredict one's future behaviors by factorizing an observed user-item rating\nmatrix into products of two sets of latent factors. However, the user-specific\nembedding factors can only be learned in a transductive way, making it\ndifficult to handle new users on-the-fly. In this paper, we propose an\ninductive collaborative filtering framework that contains two representation\nmodels. The first model follows conventional matrix factorization which\nfactorizes a group of key users' rating matrix to obtain meta latents. The\nsecond model resorts to attention-based structure learning that estimates\nhidden relations from query to key users and learns to leverage meta latents to\ninductively compute embeddings for query users via neural message passing. Our\nmodel enables inductive representation learning for users and meanwhile\nguarantees equivalent representation capacity as matrix factorization.\nExperiments demonstrate that our model achieves promising results for\nrecommendation on few-shot users with limited training ratings and new unseen\nusers which are commonly encountered in open-world recommender systems.",

To successfully\napply RL methods to IIR, one challenge is to obtain sufficient relevance labels\nto train the RL agents, which are infamously known as sample inefficient.\nHowever, in a text corpus annotated for a given query, it is not the relevant\ndocuments but the irrelevant documents that predominate. This would cause very\nunbalanced training experiences for the agent and prevent it from learning any\npolicy that is effective. Our paper addresses this issue by using domain\nrandomization to synthesize more relevant documents for the training.

          "description": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) is a challenging task, which aims at\nrecommending items based on anonymous behavior sequences. Almost all the\nexisting solutions for SBR model user preference only based on the current\nsession without exploiting the other sessions, which may contain both relevant\nand irrelevant item-transitions to the current session. This paper proposes a\nnovel approach, called Global Context Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (GCE-GNN)\nto exploit item transitions over all sessions in a more subtle manner for\nbetter inferring the user preference of the current session. Specifically,\nGCE-GNN learns two levels of item embeddings from session graph and global\ngraph, respectively: (i) Session graph, which is to learn the session-level\nitem embedding by modeling pairwise item-transitions within the current\nsession; and (ii) Global graph, which is to learn the global-level item\nembedding by modeling pairwise item-transitions over all sessions. In GCE-GNN,\nwe propose a novel global-level item representation learning layer, which\nemploys a session-aware attention mechanism to recursively incorporate the\nneighbors' embeddings of each node on the global graph. We also design a\nsession-level item representation learning layer, which employs a GNN on the\nsession graph to learn session-level item embeddings within the current\nsession. Moreover, GCE-GNN aggregates the learnt item representations in the\ntwo levels with a soft attention mechanism. Experiments on three benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that GCE-GNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\nconsistently.",

          "description": "Recommender systems are often asked to serve multiple recommendation\nscenarios or domains. Fine-tuning a pre-trained CTR model from source domains\nand adapting it to a target domain allows knowledge transferring. However,\noptimizing all the parameters of the pre-trained network may result in\nover-fitting if the target dataset is small and the number of parameters is\nlarge. This leads us to think of directly reusing parameters in the pre-trained\nmodel which represent more general features learned from multiple domains.\nHowever, the design of freezing or fine-tuning layers of parameters requires\nmuch manual effort since the decision highly depends on the pre-trained model\nand target instances. In this work, we propose an end-to-end transfer learning\nframework, called Automatic Fine-Tuning (AutoFT), for CTR prediction. AutoFT\nconsists of a field-wise transfer policy and a layer-wise transfer policy. The\nfield-wise transfer policy decides how the pre-trained embedding\nrepresentations are frozen or fine-tuned based on the given instance from the\ntarget domain. The layer-wise transfer policy decides how the high?order\nfeature representations are transferred layer by layer. Extensive experiments\non two public benchmark datasets and one private industrial dataset demonstrate\nthat AutoFT can significantly improve the performance of CTR prediction\ncompared with state-of-the-art transferring approaches.",

In this problem, there is a user\nthat wishes to obtain $L$ independent linear combinations of a $D$-subset of\nmessages belonging to a dataset of $K$ messages stored on a single server. The\ngoal is to minimize the download cost while keeping the identity of each\nmessage required for the computation individually private. The individual\nprivacy requirement ensures that the identity of each individual message\nrequired for the computation is kept private. This is in contrast to the\nstricter notion of joint privacy that protects the entire set of identities of\nall messages used for the computation, including the correlations between these\nidentities. The notion of individual privacy captures a broad set of practical\napplications. For example, such notion is relevant when the dataset contains\ninformation about individuals, each of them requires privacy guarantees for\ntheir data access patterns. We focus on the setting in which the required\nlinear transformation is associated with a maximum distance separable (MDS)\nmatrix. In particular, we require that the matrix of coefficients pertaining to\nthe required linear combinations is the generator matrix of an MDS code.

Visualizations of feature relationships aid data\nscientists in finding meaningful dependence among features, which can engender\nfurther analysis for feature selection, feature extraction, projection,\nidentification of proxy variables, or insight into temporal variation at the\nmacro scale.

          "description": "Domain experts often need to extract structured information from large\ncorpora. We advocate for a search paradigm called ``extractive search'', in\nwhich a search query is enriched with capture-slots, to allow for such rapid\nextraction. Such an extractive search system can be built around syntactic\nstructures, resulting in high-precision, low-recall results. We show how the\nrecall can be improved using neural retrieval and alignment. The goals of this\npaper are to concisely introduce the extractive-search paradigm; and to\ndemonstrate a prototype neural retrieval system for extractive search and its\nbenefits and potential. Our prototype is available at\n\\url{https://spike.neural-sim.apps.allenai.org/} and a video demonstration is\navailable at \\url{https://vimeo.com/559586687}.",

          "description": "Proper initialization is crucial to the optimization and the generalization\nof neural networks. However, most existing neural recommendation systems\ninitialize the user and item embeddings randomly. In this work, we propose a\nnew initialization scheme for user and item embeddings called Laplacian\nEigenmaps with Popularity-based Regularization for Isolated Data (LEPORID).\nLEPORID endows the embeddings with information regarding multi-scale\nneighborhood structures on the data manifold and performs adaptive\nregularization to compensate for high embedding variance on the tail of the\ndata distribution. Exploiting matrix sparsity, LEPORID embeddings can be\ncomputed efficiently. We evaluate LEPORID in a wide range of neural\nrecommendation models. In contrast to the recent surprising finding that the\nsimple K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) method often outperforms neural recommendation\nsystems, we show that existing neural systems initialized with LEPORID often\nperform on par or better than KNN. To maximize the effects of the\ninitialization, we propose the Dual-Loss Residual Recommendation (DLR2)\nnetwork, which, when initialized with LEPORID, substantially outperforms both\ntraditional and state-of-the-art neural recommender systems.",

          "description": "CTR prediction, which aims to estimate the probability that a user will click\nan item, plays a crucial role in online advertising and recommender system.\nFeature interaction modeling based and user interest mining based methods are\nthe two kinds of most popular techniques that have been extensively explored\nfor many years and have made great progress for CTR prediction. However, (1)\nfeature interaction based methods which rely heavily on the co-occurrence of\ndifferent features, may suffer from the feature sparsity problem (i.e., many\nfeatures appear few times); (2) user interest mining based methods which need\nrich user behaviors to obtain user's diverse interests, are easy to encounter\nthe behavior sparsity problem (i.e., many users have very short behavior\nsequences). To solve these problems, we propose a novel module named Dual Graph\nenhanced Embedding, which is compatible with various CTR prediction models to\nalleviate these two problems. We further propose a Dual Graph enhanced\nEmbedding Neural Network (DG-ENN) for CTR prediction. Dual Graph enhanced\nEmbedding exploits the strengths of graph representation with two carefully\ndesigned learning strategies (divide-and-conquer, curriculum-learning-inspired\norganized learning) to refine the embedding. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world industrial datasets. The experimental results\nshow that our proposed DG-ENN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CTR\nprediction models. Moreover, when applying to state-of-the-art CTR prediction\nmodels, Dual graph enhanced embedding always obtains better performance.\nFurther case studies prove that our proposed dual graph enhanced embedding\ncould alleviate the feature sparsity and behavior sparsity problems. Our\nframework will be open-source based on MindSpore in the near future.",

Previous queries in the user session can provide useful context for the\nuser's intent and can be leveraged to suggest auto-completions that are more\nrelevant while adhering to the user's prefix. Such session-aware QACs can be\ngenerated by recent sequence-to-sequence deep learning models; however, these\ngenerative approaches often do not meet the stringent latency requirements of\nresponding to each user keystroke. Moreover, these generative approaches pose\nthe risk of showing nonsensical queries.\n\nIn this paper, we provide a solution to this problem: we take the novel\napproach of modeling session-aware QAC as an eXtreme Multi-Label Ranking (XMR)\nproblem where the input is the previous query in the session and the user's\ncurrent prefix, while the output space is the set of tens of millions of\nqueries entered by users in the recent past. We adapt a popular XMR algorithm\nfor this purpose by proposing several modifications to the key steps in the\nalgorithm. The proposed modifications yield a 10x improvement in terms of Mean\nReciprocal Rank (MRR) over the baseline XMR approach on a public search logs\ndataset. We are able to maintain an inference latency of less than 10 ms while\nstill using session context. When compared against baseline models of\nacceptable latency, we observed a 33% improvement in MRR for short prefixes of\nup to 3 characters.

          "description": "The advent of cost effective cloud computing over the past decade and\never-growing accumulation of high-fidelity clinical data in a modern hospital\nsetting is leading to new opportunities for translational medicine. Machine\nlearning is driving the appetite of the research community for various types of\nsignal data such as patient vitals. Health care systems, however, are ill\nsuited for massive processing of large volumes of data. In addition, due to the\nsheer magnitude of the data being collected, it is not feasible to retain all\nof the data in health care systems in perpetuity. This gold mine of information\ngets purged periodically thereby losing invaluable future research\nopportunities. We have developed a highly scalable solution that: a) siphons\noff patient vital data on a nightly basis from on-premises bio-medical systems\nto a cloud storage location as a permanent archive, b) reconstructs the\ndatabase in the cloud, c) generates waveforms, alarms and numeric data in a\nresearch-ready format, and d) uploads the processed data to a storage location\nin the cloud ready for research.\n\nThe data is de-identified and catalogued such that it can be joined with\nElectronic Medical Records (EMR) and other ancillary data types such as\nelectroencephalogram (EEG), radiology, video monitoring etc. This technique\neliminates the research burden from health care systems. This highly scalable\nsolution is used to process high density patient monitoring data aggregated by\nthe Philips Patient Information Center iX (PIC iX) hospital surveillance system\nfor archival storage in the Philips Data Warehouse Connect enterprise-level\ndatabase. The solution is part of a broader platform that supports a secure\nhigh performance clinical data science platform.",

          "description": "Static recommendation methods like collaborative filtering suffer from the\ninherent limitation of performing real-time personalization for cold-start\nusers. Online recommendation, e.g., multi-armed bandit approach, addresses this\nlimitation by interactively exploring user preference online and pursuing the\nexploration-exploitation (EE) trade-off. However, existing bandit-based methods\nmodel recommendation actions homogeneously. Specifically, they only consider\nthe items as the arms, being incapable of handling the item attributes, which\nnaturally provide interpretable information of user's current demands and can\neffectively filter out undesired items. In this work, we consider the\nconversational recommendation for cold-start users, where a system can both ask\nthe attributes from and recommend items to a user interactively. This important\nscenario was studied in a recent work. However, it employs a hand-crafted\nfunction to decide when to ask attributes or make recommendations. Such\nseparate modeling of attributes and items makes the effectiveness of the system\nhighly rely on the choice of the hand-crafted function, thus introducing\nfragility to the system. To address this limitation, we seamlessly unify\nattributes and items in the same arm space and achieve their EE trade-offs\nautomatically using the framework of Thompson Sampling. Our Conversational\nThompson Sampling (ConTS) model holistically solves all questions in\nconversational recommendation by choosing the arm with the maximal reward to\nplay. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that ConTS\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods Conversational UCB (ConUCB) and\nEstimation-Action-Reflection model in both metrics of success rate and average\nnumber of conversation turns.",

          "description": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been integrated in several models of\nrecommendation to augment the informational value of an item by means of its\nrelated entities in the graph. Yet, existing datasets only provide explicit\nratings on items and no information is provided about user opinions of other\n(non-recommendable) entities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new\ndataset, called the MindReader, providing explicit user ratings both for items\nand for KG entities. In this first version, the MindReader dataset provides\nmore than 102 thousands explicit ratings collected from 1,174 real users on\nboth items and entities from a KG in the movie domain. This dataset has been\ncollected through an online interview application that we also release open\nsource. As a demonstration of the importance of this new dataset, we present a\ncomparative study of the effect of the inclusion of ratings on non-item KG\nentities in a variety of state-of-the-art recommendation models. In particular,\nwe show that most models, whether designed specifically for graph data or not,\nsee improvements in recommendation quality when trained on explicit non-item\nratings. Moreover, for some models, we show that non-item ratings can\neffectively replace item ratings without loss of recommendation quality. This\nfinding, thanks also to an observed greater familiarity of users towards common\nKG entities than towards long-tail items, motivates the use of KG entities for\nboth warm and cold-start recommendations.",

          "description": "With the popularity of Machine Learning (ML) solutions, algorithms and data\nhave been released faster than the capacity of processing them. In this\ncontext, the problem of Algorithm Recommendation (AR) is receiving a\nsignificant deal of attention recently. This problem has been addressed in the\nliterature as a learning task, often as a Meta-Learning problem where the aim\nis to recommend the best alternative for a specific dataset. For such, datasets\nencoded by meta-features are explored by ML algorithms that try to learn the\nmapping between meta-representations and the best technique to be used. One of\nthe challenges for the successful use of ML is to define which features are the\nmost valuable for a specific dataset since several meta-features can be used,\nwhich increases the meta-feature dimension. This paper presents an empirical\nanalysis of Feature Selection and Feature Extraction in the meta-level for the\nAR problem. The present study was focused on three criteria: predictive\nperformance, dimensionality reduction, and pipeline runtime. As we verified,\napplying Dimensionality Reduction (DR) methods did not improve predictive\nperformances in general. However, DR solutions reduced about 80% of the\nmeta-features, obtaining pretty much the same performance as the original setup\nbut with lower runtimes. The only exception was PCA, which presented about the\nsame runtime as the original meta-features. Experimental results also showed\nthat various datasets have many non-informative meta-features and that it is\npossible to obtain high predictive performance using around 20% of the original\nmeta-features. Therefore, due to their natural trend for high dimensionality,\nDR methods should be used for Meta-Feature Selection and Meta-Feature\nExtraction.",

          "description": "With the development of Edge Computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI)\ntechnologies, edge devices are witnessed to generate data at unprecedented\nvolume. The Edge Intelligence (EI) has led to the emergence of edge devices in\nvarious application domains. The EI can provide efficient services to\ndelay-sensitive applications, where the edge devices are deployed as edge nodes\nto host the majority of execution, which can effectively manage services and\nimprove service discovery efficiency. The multilevel index model is a\nwell-known model used for indexing service, such a model is being introduced\nand optimized in the edge environments to efficiently services discovery whilst\nmanaging large volumes of data. However, effectively updating the multilevel\nindex model by adding new services timely and precisely in the dynamic Edge\nComputing environments is still a challenge. Addressing this issue, this paper\nproposes a designated key selection method to improve the efficiency of adding\nservices in the multilevel index models. Our experimental results show that in\nthe partial index and the full index of multilevel index model, our method\nreduces the service addition time by around 84% and 76%, respectively when\ncompared with the original key selection method and by around 78% and 66%,\nrespectively when compared with the random selection method. Our proposed\nmethod significantly improves the service addition efficiency in the multilevel\nindex model, when compared with existing state-of-the-art key selection\nmethods, without compromising the service retrieval stability to any notable\nlevel.",

          "description": "Utilizing review information to enhance recommendation, the de facto\nreview-involved recommender systems, have received increasing interests over\nthe past few years. Thereinto, one advanced branch is to extract salient\naspects from textual reviews (i.e., the item attributes that users express) and\ncombine them with the matrix factorization technique. However, existing\napproaches all ignore the fact that semantically different reviews often\ninclude opposite aspect information. In particular, positive reviews usually\nexpress aspects that users prefer, while negative ones describe aspects that\nusers reject. As a result, it may mislead the recommender systems into making\nincorrect decisions pertaining to user preference modeling. Towards this end,\nin this paper, we propose a Review Polarity-wise Recommender model, dubbed as\nRPR, to discriminately treat reviews with different polarities. To be specific,\nin this model, positive and negative reviews are separately gathered and\nutilized to model the user-preferred and user-rejected aspects, respectively.\nBesides, in order to overcome the imbalance problem of semantically different\nreviews, we also develop an aspect-aware importance weighting approach to align\nthe aspect importance for these two kinds of reviews. Extensive experiments\nconducted on eight benchmark datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our\nmodel as compared to a series of state-of-the-art review-involved baselines.\nMoreover, our method can provide certain explanations to the real-world rating\nprediction scenarios.",

          "description": "Despite the achievements of large-scale multimodal pre-training approaches,\ncross-modal retrieval, e.g., image-text retrieval, remains a challenging task.\nTo bridge the semantic gap between the two modalities, previous studies mainly\nfocus on word-region alignment at the object level, lacking the matching\nbetween the linguistic relation among the words and the visual relation among\nthe regions. The neglect of such relation consistency impairs the\ncontextualized representation of image-text pairs and hinders the model\nperformance and the interpretability. In this paper, we first propose a novel\nmetric, Intra-modal Self-attention Distance (ISD), to quantify the relation\nconsistency by measuring the semantic distance between linguistic and visual\nrelations. In response, we present Inter-modal Alignment on Intra-modal\nSelf-attentions (IAIS), a regularized training method to optimize the ISD and\ncalibrate intra-modal self-attentions from the two modalities mutually via\ninter-modal alignment. The IAIS regularizer boosts the performance of\nprevailing models on Flickr30k and MS COCO datasets by a considerable margin,\nwhich demonstrates the superiority of our approach.",

Recent works show that graph-based\nmethods, usually constructing a document-level graph that captures\ndocument-aware interactions, can obtain useful entity representations thus\nhelping tackle document-level RE. These methods either focus more on the entire\ngraph, or pay more attention to a part of the graph, e.g., paths between the\ntarget entity pair. However, we find that document-level RE may benefit from\nfocusing on both of them simultaneously. Therefore, to obtain more\ncomprehensive entity representations, we propose the Coarse-to-Fine Entity\nRepresentation model (CFER) that adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy involving two\nphases. First, CFER uses graph neural networks to integrate global information\nin the entire graph at a coarse level. Next, CFER utilizes the global\ninformation as a guidance to selectively aggregate path information between the\ntarget entity pair at a fine level. In classification, we combine the entity\nrepresentations from both two levels into more comprehensive representations\nfor relation extraction.

          "description": "The general aim of the recommender system is to provide personalized\nsuggestions to users, which is opposed to suggesting popular items. However,\nthe normal training paradigm, i.e., fitting a recommender model to recover the\nuser behavior data with pointwise or pairwise loss, makes the model biased\ntowards popular items. This results in the terrible Matthew effect, making\npopular items be more frequently recommended and become even more popular.\nExisting work addresses this issue with Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW),\nwhich decreases the impact of popular items on the training and increases the\nimpact of long-tail items. Although theoretically sound, IPW methods are highly\nsensitive to the weighting strategy, which is notoriously difficult to tune. In\nthis work, we explore the popularity bias issue from a novel and fundamental\nperspective -- cause-effect. We identify that popularity bias lies in the\ndirect effect from the item node to the ranking score, such that an item's\nintrinsic property is the cause of mistakenly assigning it a higher ranking\nscore. To eliminate popularity bias, it is essential to answer the\ncounterfactual question that what the ranking score would be if the model only\nuses item property. To this end, we formulate a causal graph to describe the\nimportant cause-effect relations in the recommendation process. During\ntraining, we perform multi-task learning to achieve the contribution of each\ncause; during testing, we perform counterfactual inference to remove the effect\nof item popularity. Remarkably, our solution amends the learning process of\nrecommendation which is agnostic to a wide range of models -- it can be easily\nimplemented in existing methods. We demonstrate it on Matrix Factorization (MF)\nand LightGCN [20]. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method.",

          "description": "Embedding learning of categorical features (e.g. user/item IDs) is at the\ncore of various recommendation models including matrix factorization and neural\ncollaborative filtering. The standard approach creates an embedding table where\neach row represents a dedicated embedding vector for every unique feature\nvalue. However, this method fails to efficiently handle high-cardinality\nfeatures and unseen feature values (e.g. new video ID) that are prevalent in\nreal-world recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose an alternative\nembedding framework Deep Hash Embedding (DHE), replacing embedding tables by a\ndeep embedding network to compute embeddings on the fly. DHE first encodes the\nfeature value to a unique identifier vector with multiple hashing functions and\ntransformations, and then applies a DNN to convert the identifier vector to an\nembedding. The encoding module is deterministic, non-learnable, and free of\nstorage, while the embedding network is updated during the training time to\nlearn embedding generation. Empirical results show that DHE achieves comparable\nAUC against the standard one-hot full embedding, with smaller model sizes. Our\nwork sheds light on the design of DNN-based alternative embedding schemes for\ncategorical features without using embedding table lookup.",

Although Social Media are increasingly\nbeing used as information source, Web Search Engines, like Google or Yahoo!,\nstill represent a powerful and trustworthy resource for finding information on\nthe Web.

This study aims\nto detect potential misleading and fake contents by capturing and analysing\ntextual information, which flow through Search Engines. By using a real-world\ndataset associated with recent CoViD-19 pandemic, we first apply re-sampling\ntechniques for class imbalance, then we use existing Machine Learning\nalgorithms for classification of not reliable news. By extracting lexical and\nhost-based features of associated Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for news\narticles, we show that the proposed methods, so common in phishing and\nmalicious URLs detection, can improve the efficiency and performance of\nclassifiers.

          "description": "Direct optimization of IR metrics has often been adopted as an approach to\ndevise and develop ranking-based recommender systems. Most methods following\nthis approach aim at optimizing the same metric being used for evaluation,\nunder the assumption that this will lead to the best performance. A number of\nstudies of this practice bring this assumption, however, into question. In this\npaper, we dig deeper into this issue in order to learn more about the effects\nof the choice of the metric to optimize on the performance of a ranking-based\nrecommender system. We present an extensive experimental study conducted on\ndifferent datasets in both pairwise and listwise learning-to-rank scenarios, to\ncompare the relative merit of four popular IR metrics, namely RR, AP, nDCG and\nRBP, when used for optimization and assessment of recommender systems in\nvarious combinations. For the first three, we follow the practice of loss\nfunction formulation available in literature. For the fourth one, we propose\nnovel loss functions inspired by RBP for both the pairwise and listwise\nscenario. Our results confirm that the best performance is indeed not\nnecessarily achieved when optimizing the same metric being used for evaluation.\nIn fact, we find that RBP-inspired losses perform at least as well as other\nmetrics in a consistent way, and offer clear benefits in several cases.\nInteresting to see is that RBP-inspired losses, while improving the\nrecommendation performance for all uses, may lead to an individual performance\ngain that is correlated with the activity level of a user in interacting with\nitems. The more active the users, the more they benefit. Overall, our results\nchallenge the assumption behind the current research practice of optimizing and\nevaluating the same metric, and point to RBP-based optimization instead as a\npromising alternative when learning to rank in the recommendation context.",

Most existing personalized product models follow the paradigm of\nrepresenting and matching user intents and items in the semantic space, where\nfiner-grained matching is totally discarded and the ranking of an item cannot\nbe explained further than just user/item level similarity. In addition, while\nsome models in existing studies have created dynamic user representations based\non search context, their representations for items are static across all search\nsessions. This makes every piece of information about the item always equally\nimportant in representing the item during matching with various user intents.\nAware of the above limitations, we propose a review-based transformer model\n(RTM) for personalized product search, which encodes the sequence of query,\nuser reviews, and item reviews with a transformer architecture. RTM conducts\nreview-level matching between the user and item, where each review has a\ndynamic effect according to the context in the sequence. This makes it possible\nto identify useful reviews to explain the scoring. Experimental results show\nthat RTM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalized product search\nbaselines.",

          "description": "In today's context, deploying data-driven services like recommendation on\nedge devices instead of cloud servers becomes increasingly attractive due to\nprivacy and network latency concerns. A common practice in building compact\non-device recommender systems is to compress their embeddings which are\nnormally the cause of excessive parameterization. However, despite the vast\nvariety of devices and their associated memory constraints, existing\nmemory-efficient recommender systems are only specialized for a fixed memory\nbudget in every design and training life cycle, where a new model has to be\nretrained to obtain the optimal performance while adapting to a smaller/larger\nmemory budget. In this paper, we present a novel lightweight recommendation\nparadigm that allows a well-trained recommender to be customized for arbitrary\ndevice-specific memory constraints without retraining. The core idea is to\ncompose elastic embeddings for each item, where an elastic embedding is the\nconcatenation of a set of embedding blocks that are carefully chosen by an\nautomated search function. Correspondingly, we propose an innovative approach,\nnamely recommendation with universally learned elastic embeddings (RULE). To\nensure the expressiveness of all candidate embedding blocks, RULE enforces a\ndiversity-driven regularization when learning different embedding blocks. Then,\na performance estimator-based evolutionary search function is designed,\nallowing for efficient specialization of elastic embeddings under any memory\nconstraint for on-device recommendation. Extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets reveal the superior performance of RULE under tight memory budgets.",

In this paper, we propose a\ngeneral method for event detection on social media that makes few assumptions.\nThe main assumption we make is that when an event occurs, affected semantic\naspects will behave differently from its usual behavior. We generalize the\nrepresentation of time units based on word embeddings of social media text, and\npropose an algorithm to detect events in time series in a general sense. In the\nexperimental evaluation, we use a novel setting to test if our method and\nbaseline methods can exhaustively catch all real-world news in the test period.\nThe evaluation results show that when the event is quite unusual with regard to\nthe base social media discussion, it can be captured more effectively with our\nmethod.

          "description": "Based on the success of recommender systems in e-commerce, there is growing\ninterest in their use in matching markets (e.g., labor). While this holds\npotential for improving market fluidity and fairness, we show in this paper\nthat naively applying existing recommender systems to matching markets is\nsub-optimal. Considering the standard process where candidates apply and then\nget evaluated by employers, we present a new recommendation framework to model\nthis interaction mechanism and propose efficient algorithms for computing\npersonalized rankings in this setting. We show that the optimal rankings need\nto not only account for the potentially divergent preferences of candidates and\nemployers, but they also need to account for capacity constraints. This makes\nconventional ranking systems that merely rank by some local score (e.g.,\none-sided or reciprocal relevance) highly sub-optimal -- not only for an\nindividual user, but also for societal goals (e.g., low unemployment). To\naddress this shortcoming, we propose the first method for jointly optimizing\nthe rankings for all candidates in the market to explicitly maximize social\nwelfare. In addition to the theoretical derivation, we evaluate the method both\non simulated environments and on data from a real-world\nnetworking-recommendation system that we built and fielded at a large computer\nscience conference.",

The textual contents convey hidden information\nsuch as personality and cognition about corresponding authors that can\ndetermine both correlations and variations between users. Emotion recognition\nfrom brief contents should embrace the contrast between authors where the\ndifferences in personality and cognition can be traced within emotional\nexpressions. To tackle this challenge, we devise a framework that, on the one\nhand, infers latent individual aspects, from brief contents and, on the other\nhand, presents a novel ensemble classifier equipped with dynamic dropout\nconvnets to extract emotions from textual context. To categorize short text\ncontents, our proposed method conjointly leverages cognitive factors and\nexploits hidden information. We utilize the outcome vectors in a novel\nembedding model to foster emotion-pertinent features that are collectively\nassembled by lexicon inductions.

          "description": "In modern internet industries, deep learning based recommender systems have\nbecame an indispensable building block for a wide spectrum of applications,\nsuch as search engine, news feed, and short video clips. However, it remains\nchallenging to carry the well-trained deep models for online real-time\ninference serving, with respect to the time-varying web-scale traffics from\nbillions of users, in a cost-effective manner. In this work, we present JIZHI -\na Model-as-a-Service system - that per second handles hundreds of millions of\nonline inference requests to huge deep models with more than trillions of\nsparse parameters, for over twenty real-time recommendation services at Baidu,\nInc. In JIZHI, the inference workflow of every recommendation request is\ntransformed to a Staged Event-Driven Pipeline (SEDP), where each node in the\npipeline refers to a staged computation or I/O intensive task processor. With\ntraffics of real-time inference requests arrived, each modularized processor\ncan be run in a fully asynchronized way and managed separately. Besides, JIZHI\nintroduces heterogeneous and hierarchical storage to further accelerate the\nonline inference process by reducing unnecessary computations and potential\ndata access latency induced by ultra-sparse model parameters. Moreover, an\nintelligent resource manager has been deployed to maximize the throughput of\nJIZHI over the shared infrastructure by searching the optimal resource\nallocation plan from historical logs and fine-tuning the load shedding policies\nover intermediate system feedback. Extensive experiments have been done to\ndemonstrate the advantages of JIZHI from the perspectives of end-to-end service\nlatency, system-wide throughput, and resource consumption.

For example, do the mobile usage\ncontexts (e.g.,~time of day) in which users access mobile apps impact their\ndwell time? Answers to such questions could help mobile operating system and\npublishers to optimize advertising and service placement. In this paper, we\nfirst conduct an empirical study for assessing how user characteristics,\ntemporal features, and the short/long-term contexts contribute to gains in\npredicting users' app dwell time on the population level. The comprehensive\nanalysis is conducted on large app usage logs collected through a mobile\nadvertising company. The dataset covers more than 12K anonymous users and 1.3\nmillion log events. Based on the analysis, we further investigate a novel\nmobile app engagement prediction problem -- can we predict simultaneously what\napp the user will use next and how long he/she will stay on that app? We\npropose several strategies for this joint prediction problem and demonstrate\nthat our model can improve the performance significantly when compared with the\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

          "description": "Recapturing attack can be employed as a simple but effective anti-forensic\ntool for digital document images. Inspired by the document inspection process\nthat compares a questioned document against a reference sample, we proposed a\ndocument recapture detection scheme by employing Siamese network to compare and\nextract distinct features in a recapture document image. The proposed algorithm\ntakes advantages of both metric learning and image forensic techniques. Instead\nof adopting Euclidean distance-based loss function, we integrate the forensic\nsimilarity function with a triplet loss and a normalized softmax loss. After\ntraining with the proposed triplet selection strategy, the resulting feature\nembedding clusters the genuine samples near the reference while pushes the\nrecaptured samples apart. In the experiment, we consider practical domain\ngeneralization problems, such as the variations in printing/imaging devices,\nsubstrates, recapturing channels, and document types. To evaluate the\nrobustness of different approaches, we benchmark some popular off-the-shelf\nmachine learning-based approaches, a state-of-the-art document image detection\nscheme, and the proposed schemes with different network backbones under various\nexperimental protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed schemes\nwith different network backbones have consistently outperformed the\nstate-of-the-art approaches under different experimental settings.\nSpecifically, under the most challenging scenario in our experiment, i.e.,\nevaluation across different types of documents that produced by different\ndevices, we have achieved less than 5.00% APCER (Attack Presentation\nClassification Error Rate) and 5.56% BPCER (Bona Fide Presentation\nClassification Error Rate) by the proposed network with ResNeXt101 backbone at\n5% BPCER decision threshold.",

In this work, we analyze this problem\nfrom a novel cognition perspective: automatically building a hierarchical\ncognitive structure from the biased predictions and navigating that hierarchy\nto locate the relationships, making the tail relationships receive more\nattention in a coarse-to-fine mode. To this end, we propose a novel debiasing\nCognition Tree (CogTree) loss for unbiased SGG. We first build a cognitive\nstructure CogTree to organize the relationships based on the prediction of a\nbiased SGG model. The CogTree distinguishes remarkably different relationships\nat first and then focuses on a small portion of easily confused ones. Then, we\npropose a debiasing loss specially for this cognitive structure, which supports\ncoarse-to-fine distinction for the correct relationships.

          "description": "In this paper, we are tackling the weakly-supervised referring expression\ngrounding task, for the localization of a referent object in an image according\nto a query sentence, where the mapping between image regions and queries are\nnot available during the training stage. In traditional methods, an object\nregion that best matches the referring expression is picked out, and then the\nquery sentence is reconstructed from the selected region, where the\nreconstruction difference serves as the loss for back-propagation. The existing\nmethods, however, conduct both the matching and the reconstruction\napproximately as they ignore the fact that the matching correctness is unknown.\nTo overcome this limitation, a discriminative triad is designed here as the\nbasis to the solution, through which a query can be converted into one or\nmultiple discriminative triads in a very scalable way. Based on the\ndiscriminative triad, we further propose the triad-level matching and\nreconstruction modules which are lightweight yet effective for the\nweakly-supervised training, making it three times lighter and faster than the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods. One important merit of our work is its\nsuperior performance despite the simple and neat design.

          "description": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to generalize the knowledge learned\nfrom a well-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recently,\nadversarial domain adaptation with two distinct classifiers (bi-classifier) has\nbeen introduced into UDA which is effective to align distributions between\ndifferent domains. Previous bi-classifier adversarial learning methods only\nfocus on the similarity between the outputs of two distinct classifiers.\nHowever, the similarity of the outputs cannot guarantee the accuracy of target\nsamples, i.e., target samples may match to wrong categories even if the\ndiscrepancy between two classifiers is small. To challenge this issue, in this\npaper, we propose a cross-domain gradient discrepancy minimization (CGDM)\nmethod which explicitly minimizes the discrepancy of gradients generated by\nsource samples and target samples. Specifically, the gradient gives a cue for\nthe semantic information of target samples so it can be used as a good\nsupervision to improve the accuracy of target samples. In order to compute the\ngradient signal of target samples, we further obtain target pseudo labels\nthrough a clustering-based self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on\nthree widely used UDA datasets show that our method surpasses many previous\nstate-of-the-arts. Codes are available at https://github.com/lijin118/CGDM.",

          "description": "How to extract effective expression representations that invariant to the\nidentity-specific attributes is a long-lasting problem for facial expression\nrecognition (FER). Most of the previous methods process the RGB images of a\nsequence, while we argue that the off-the-shelf and valuable expression-related\nmuscle movement is already embedded in the compression format. In this paper,\nwe target to explore the inter-subject variations eliminated facial expression\nrepresentation in the compressed video domain. In the up to two orders of\nmagnitude compressed domain, we can explicitly infer the expression from the\nresidual frames and possibly extract identity factors from the I frame with a\npre-trained face recognition network. By enforcing the marginal independence of\nthem, the expression feature is expected to be purer for the expression and be\nrobust to identity shifts. Specifically, we propose a novel collaborative\nmin-min game for mutual information (MI) minimization in latent space. We do\nnot need the identity label or multiple expression samples from the same person\nfor identity elimination. Moreover, when the apex frame is annotated in the\ndataset, the complementary constraint can be further added to regularize the\nfeature-level game. In testing, only the compressed residual frames are\nrequired to achieve expression prediction. Our solution can achieve comparable\nor better performance than the recent decoded image-based methods on the\ntypical FER benchmarks with about 3 times faster inference.",

          "description": "Versatile Video Coding (VVC), as the latest standard, significantly improves\nthe coding efficiency over its ancestor standard High Efficiency Video Coding\n(HEVC), but at the expense of sharply increased complexity. In VVC, the\nquad-tree plus multi-type tree (QTMT) structure of coding unit (CU) partition\naccounts for over 97% of the encoding time, due to the brute-force search for\nrecursive rate-distortion (RD) optimization. Instead of the brute-force QTMT\nsearch, this paper proposes a deep learning approach to predict the QTMT-based\nCU partition, for drastically accelerating the encoding process of intra-mode\nVVC. First, we establish a large-scale database containing sufficient CU\npartition patterns with diverse video content, which can facilitate the\ndata-driven VVC complexity reduction. Next, we propose a multi-stage exit CNN\n(MSE-CNN) model with an early-exit mechanism to determine the CU partition, in\naccord with the flexible QTMT structure at multiple stages. Then, we design an\nadaptive loss function for training the MSE-CNN model, synthesizing both the\nuncertain number of split modes and the target on minimized RD cost. Finally, a\nmulti-threshold decision scheme is developed, achieving desirable trade-off\nbetween complexity and RD performance. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour approach can reduce the encoding time of VVC by 44.65%-66.88% with the\nnegligible Bj{\\o}ntegaard delta bit-rate (BD-BR) of 1.322%-3.188%, which\nsignificantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.",

          "description": "Researchers working on computational analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in\nhistopathology have primarily resorted to patch-based modelling due to large\nresolution of each WSI. The large resolution makes WSIs infeasible to be fed\ndirectly into the machine learning models due to computational constraints.\nHowever, due to patch-based analysis, most of the current methods fail to\nexploit the underlying spatial relationship among the patches. In our work, we\nhave tried to integrate this relationship along with feature-based correlation\namong the extracted patches from the particular tumorous region. For the given\ntask of classification, we have used BiLSTMs to model both forward and backward\ncontextual relationship. RNN based models eliminate the limitation of sequence\nsize by allowing the modelling of variable size images within a deep learning\nmodel. We have also incorporated the effect of spatial continuity by exploring\ndifferent scanning techniques used to sample patches. To establish the\nefficiency of our approach, we trained and tested our model on two datasets,\nmicroscopy images and WSI tumour regions. After comparing with contemporary\nliterature we achieved the better performance with accuracy of 90% for\nmicroscopy image dataset. For WSI tumour region dataset, we compared the\nclassification results with deep learning networks such as ResNet, DenseNet,\nand InceptionV3 using maximum voting technique. We achieved the highest\nperformance accuracy of 84%. We found out that BiLSTMs with CNN features have\nperformed much better in modelling patches into an end-to-end Image\nclassification network. Additionally, the variable dimensions of WSI tumour\nregions were used for classification without the need for resizing. This\nsuggests that our method is independent of tumour image size and can process\nlarge dimensional images without losing the resolution details.",

In this work, we propose a novel neural scene\nrepresentation, Light Field Networks or LFNs, which represent both geometry and\nappearance of the underlying 3D scene in a 360-degree, four-dimensional light\nfield parameterized via a neural implicit representation. Rendering a ray from\nan LFN requires only a *single* network evaluation, as opposed to hundreds of\nevaluations per ray for ray-marching or volumetric based renderers in\n3D-structured neural scene representations. In the setting of simple scenes, we\nleverage meta-learning to learn a prior over LFNs that enables multi-view\nconsistent light field reconstruction from as little as a single image\nobservation. This results in dramatic reductions in time and memory complexity,\nand enables real-time rendering. The cost of storing a 360-degree light field\nvia an LFN is two orders of magnitude lower than conventional methods such as\nthe Lumigraph. Utilizing the analytical differentiability of neural implicit\nrepresentations and a novel parameterization of light space, we further\ndemonstrate the extraction of sparse depth maps from LFNs.",

Second, we use machine learning to build\nforecasting models that proactively predict the approximate transcoding\nresources to be reserved at each cloud site ahead of time.

The proposed method\nallows us to separately estimate a spectral distribution of illumination,\nreflectance, or camera sensitivity, while recent hyperspectral cameras are\nlimited to capturing a joint spectral distribution from a scene. In addition,\nthe use of Bayesian inference makes it possible to take into account prior\ninformation of both spectral distributions and image noise as probability\ndistributions. As a result, the proposed method can estimate spectral\ndistributions in a unified way, and it can enhance the robustness of the\nestimation against noise, which conventional spectral-distribution estimation\nmethods cannot. The use of Bayesian inference also enables us to obtain the\nconfidence of estimation results.

          "description": "Self-supervised representation learning has shown remarkable success in a\nnumber of domains. A common practice is to perform data augmentation via\nhand-crafted transformations intended to leave the semantics of the data\ninvariant. We seek to understand the empirical success of this approach from a\ntheoretical perspective. We formulate the augmentation process as a latent\nvariable model by postulating a partition of the latent representation into a\ncontent component, which is assumed invariant to augmentation, and a style\ncomponent, which is allowed to change. Unlike prior work on disentanglement and\nindependent component analysis, we allow for both nontrivial statistical and\ncausal dependencies in the latent space. We study the identifiability of the\nlatent representation based on pairs of views of the observations and prove\nsufficient conditions that allow us to identify the invariant content partition\nup to an invertible mapping in both generative and discriminative settings. We\nfind numerical simulations with dependent latent variables are consistent with\nour theory. Lastly, we introduce Causal3DIdent, a dataset of high-dimensional,\nvisually complex images with rich causal dependencies, which we use to study\nthe effect of data augmentations performed in practice.",

          "description": "Understanding product attributes plays an important role in improving online\nshopping experience for customers and serves as an integral part for\nconstructing a product knowledge graph.

Compared to the inputs considered in\nprior works, a product image in fact contains more information, represented by\na rich mixture of words and visual clues with a layout carefully designed to\nimpress customers. This work proposes a more inclusive framework that fully\nutilizes these different modalities for attribute extraction. Inspired by\nrecent works in visual question answering, we use a transformer based sequence\nto sequence model to fuse representations of product text, Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) tokens and visual objects detected in the product image. The\nframework is further extended with the capability to extract attribute value\nacross multiple product categories with a single model, by training the decoder\nto predict both product category and attribute value and conditioning its\noutput on product category. The model provides a unified attribute extraction\nsolution desirable at an e-commerce platform that offers numerous product\ncategories with a diverse body of product attributes. We evaluated the model on\ntwo product attributes, one with many possible values and one with a small set\nof possible values, over 14 product categories and found the model could\nachieve 15% gain on the Recall and 10% gain on the F1 score compared to\nexisting methods using text-only features.",

In reality, a truly useful VidL system\nis expected to be easily generalizable to diverse tasks, domains, and datasets.\nTo facilitate the evaluation of such systems, we introduce Video-And-Language\nUnderstanding Evaluation (VALUE) benchmark, an assemblage of 11 VidL datasets\nover 3 popular tasks: (i) text-to-video retrieval; (ii) video question\nanswering; and (iii) video captioning. VALUE benchmark aims to cover a broad\nrange of video genres, video lengths, data volumes, and task difficulty levels.\nRather than focusing on single-channel videos with visual information only,\nVALUE promotes models that leverage information from both video frames and\ntheir associated subtitles, as well as models that share knowledge across\nmultiple tasks. We evaluate various baseline methods with and without\nlarge-scale VidL pre-training, and systematically investigate the impact of\nvideo input channels, fusion methods, and different video representations. We\nalso study the transferability between tasks, and conduct multi-task learning\nunder different settings. The significant gap between our best model and human\nperformance calls for future study for advanced VidL models. VALUE is available\nat https://value-leaderboard.github.io/.",

          "description": "As a generic modeling tool, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been\nwidely employed in image generation and translation tasks. However, when fed\nwith a flat input, current CNN models may fail to generate vivid results due to\nthe spatially shared convolution kernels. We call it the flatness degradation\nof CNNs. Unfortunately, such degradation is the greatest obstacles to generate\na spatially-variant output from a flat input, which has been barely discussed\nin the previous literature. To tackle this problem, we propose a model agnostic\nsolution, i.e. Noise Incentive Block (NIB), which serves as a generic plug-in\nfor any CNN generation model. The key idea is to break the flat input condition\nwhile keeping the intactness of the original information. Specifically, the NIB\nperturbs the input data symmetrically with a noise map and reassembles them in\nthe feature domain as driven by the objective function. Extensive experiments\nshow that existing CNN models equipped with NIB survive from the flatness\ndegradation and are able to generate visually better results with richer\ndetails in some specific image generation tasks given flat inputs, e.g.\nsemantic image synthesis, data-hidden image generation, and deep neural\ndithering.",

Recently there has been a renaissance in identifiability results in\ndeep generative models, not least for non-linear ICA. These prior works,\nhowever, have assumed access to a sufficiently-informative auxiliary set of\nobservations, denoted $\\mathbf{u}$. We show here how identifiability can be\nobtained in the absence of this side-information, rendering possible\nfully-unsupervised identifiable non-linear ICA. While previous theoretical\nresults have established the impossibility of identifiable non-linear ICA in\nthe presence of infinitely-flexible universal function approximators, here we\nrely on the intrinsically-finite modelling capacity of any particular chosen\nparameterisation of a deep generative model. In particular, we focus on\ngenerative models which perform clustering in their latent space -- a model\nstructure which matches previous identifiable models, but with the learnt\nclustering providing a synthetic form of auxiliary information. We evaluate our\nproposals using VAEs, on synthetic and image datasets, and find that the\nlearned clusterings function effectively: deep generative models with latent\nclusterings are empirically identifiable, to the same degree as models which\nrely on side information.",

          "description": "Multispectral and multimodal image processing is important in the community\nof computer vision and computational photography. As the acquired multispectral\nand multimodal data are generally misaligned due to the alternation or movement\nof the image device, the image registration procedure is necessary. The\nregistration of multispectral or multimodal image is challenging due to the\nnon-linear intensity and gradient variation. To cope with this challenge, we\npropose the phase congruency network (PCNet), which is able to enhance the\nstructure similarity and alleviate the non-linear intensity and gradient\nvariation. The images can then be aligned using the similarity enhanced\nfeatures produced by the network. PCNet is constructed under the guidance of\nthe phase congruency prior. The network contains three trainable layers\naccompany with the modified learnable Gabor kernels according to the phase\ncongruency theory. Thanks to the prior knowledge, PCNet is extremely\nlight-weight and can be trained on quite a small amount of multispectral data.\nPCNet can be viewed to be fully convolutional and hence can take input of\narbitrary sizes. Once trained, PCNet is applicable on a variety of\nmultispectral and multimodal data such as RGB/NIR and flash/no-flash images\nwithout additional further tuning. Experimental results validate that PCNet\noutperforms current state-of-the-art registration algorithms, including the\ndeep-learning based ones that have the number of parameters hundreds times\ncompared to PCNet. Thanks to the similarity enhancement training, PCNet\noutperforms the original phase congruency algorithm with two-thirds less\nfeature channels.",

It is completely curable if diagnosed in an early stage, but the\ntedious and costly detection procedure makes it unviable to conduct\npopulation-wise screening. Thus, to augment the effort of the clinicians, in\nthis paper, we propose a fully automated framework that utilizes Deep Learning\nand feature selection using evolutionary optimization for cytology image\nclassification. The proposed framework extracts Deep feature from several\nConvolution Neural Network models and uses a two-step feature reduction\napproach to ensure reduction in computation cost and faster convergence. The\nfeatures extracted from the CNN models form a large feature space whose\ndimensionality is reduced using Principal Component Analysis while preserving\n99% of the variance. A non-redundant, optimal feature subset is selected from\nthis feature space using an evolutionary optimization algorithm, the Grey Wolf\nOptimizer, thus improving the classification performance. Finally, the selected\nfeature subset is used to train an SVM classifier for generating the final\npredictions. The proposed framework is evaluated on three publicly available\nbenchmark datasets: Mendeley Liquid Based Cytology (4-class) dataset, Herlev\nPap Smear (7-class) dataset, and the SIPaKMeD Pap Smear (5-class) dataset\nachieving classification accuracies of 99.47%, 98.32% and 97.87% respectively,\nthus justifying the reliability of the approach.

These\nfeatures are then used to identify the body-parts with the greatest\ncontribution towards a classification decision and highlight the related\nbody-part segment providing visual feedback to the user.\n\nWe quantitatively compare the proposed framework's classification performance\nwith several other methods from the literature and qualitatively evaluate the\nvisualization's veracity. Our experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod performs more robustly than comparable techniques in this setting whilst\nsimultaneously providing relevant visual interpretability.",

          "description": "In this paper, we present CLCC, a novel contrastive learning framework for\ncolor constancy. Contrastive learning has been applied for learning\nhigh-quality visual representations for image classification. One key aspect to\nyield useful representations for image classification is to design illuminant\ninvariant augmentations. However, the illuminant invariant assumption conflicts\nwith the nature of the color constancy task, which aims to estimate the\nilluminant given a raw image. Therefore, we construct effective contrastive\npairs for learning better illuminant-dependent features via a novel raw-domain\ncolor augmentation. On the NUS-8 dataset, our method provides $17.5\\%$ relative\nimprovements over a strong baseline, reaching state-of-the-art performance\nwithout increasing model complexity. Furthermore, our method achieves\ncompetitive performance on the Gehler dataset with $3\\times$ fewer parameters\ncompared to top-ranking deep learning methods.

The core approach is to render individual rays by\nquerying a neural network at points sampled along the ray to obtain the density\nand colour of the sampled points, and integrating this information using the\nrendering equation. Since dense sampling is computationally prohibitive, a\ncommon solution is to perform coarse-to-fine sampling.\n\nIn this work we address a clear limitation of the vanilla coarse-to-fine\napproach -- that it is based on a heuristic and not trained end-to-end for the\ntask at hand. We introduce a differentiable module that learns to propose\nsamples and their importance for the fine network, and consider and compare\nmultiple alternatives for its neural architecture. Training the proposal module\nfrom scratch can be unstable due to lack of supervision, so an effective\npre-training strategy is also put forward. The approach, named `NeRF in detail'\n(NeRF-ID), achieves superior view synthesis quality over NeRF and the\nstate-of-the-art on the synthetic Blender benchmark and on par or better\nperformance on the real LLFF-NeRF scenes. Furthermore, by leveraging the\npredicted sample importance, a 25% saving in computation can be achieved\nwithout significantly sacrificing the rendering quality.",

Although the local and\nglobal structures often depend on each other and their simultaneous modeling is\nimportant, many convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches interchange\nrepresentations in different resolutions only a few times. In this paper, we\nclaim the importance of a dense simultaneous modeling of multiresolution\nrepresentation and propose a novel CNN architecture called densely connected\nmultidilated DenseNet (D3Net). D3Net involves a novel multidilated convolution\nthat has different dilation factors in a single layer to model different\nresolutions simultaneously. By combining the multidilated convolution with the\nDenseNet architecture, D3Net incorporates multiresolution learning with an\nexponentially growing receptive field in almost all layers, while avoiding the\naliasing problem that occurs when we naively incorporate the dilated\nconvolution in DenseNet.

Furthermore, current few-shot learning models capture only the\nsimilarity via relation labels, but they are not exposed to class concepts\nassociated with objects, which is likely detrimental to the classification\nperformance due to underutilization of the available class labels. To\nparaphrase, children learn the concept of tiger from a few of actual examples\nas well as from comparisons of tiger to other animals.

We argue that fine-grained visual categorization\nproblems, such as plant and animal species classification, provide an\ninformative testbed for self-supervised learning. In order to facilitate\nprogress in this area we present two new natural world visual classification\ndatasets, iNat2021 and NeWT.

We designed the latter, NeWT, in collaboration with domain experts\nwith the aim of benchmarking the performance of representation learning\nalgorithms on a suite of challenging natural world binary classification tasks\nthat go beyond standard species classification. These two new datasets allow us\nto explore questions related to large-scale representation and transfer\nlearning in the context of fine-grained categories. We provide a comprehensive\nanalysis of feature extractors trained with and without supervision on ImageNet\nand iNat2021, shedding light on the strengths and weaknesses of different\nlearned features across a diverse set of tasks. We find that features produced\nby standard supervised methods still outperform those produced by\nself-supervised approaches such as SimCLR.

However, biological\nneurons have an internal state governed by complex dynamics that plays a\ncrucial role in learning, adaptation and the overall network activity and\nbehaviour. This paper presents the Membrane Potential and Activation Threshold\nHomeostasis (MPATH) neuron model, which combines several biologically inspired\nmechanisms to efficiently simulate internal neuron dynamics with a single\nparameter analogous to the membrane time constant in biological neurons. The\nmodel allows neurons to maintain a form of dynamic equilibrium by automatically\nregulating their activity when presented with fluctuating input. One\nconsequence of the MPATH model is that it imbues neurons with a sense of time\nwithout recurrent connections, paving the way for modelling processes that\ndepend on temporal aspects of neuron activity.

In this paper, we introduce\nMulti-Facet Clustering Variational Autoencoders (MFCVAE), a novel class of\nvariational autoencoders with a hierarchy of latent variables, each with a\nMixture-of-Gaussians prior, that learns multiple clusterings simultaneously,\nand is trained fully unsupervised and end-to-end.

We provide novel theoretical results for optimising the ELBO\nanalytically with respect to the categorical variational posterior\ndistribution, and corrects earlier influential theoretical work.

          "description": "Adversarial learning has emerged as one of the successful techniques to\ncircumvent the susceptibility of existing methods against adversarial\nperturbations. However, the majority of existing defense methods are tailored\nto defend against a single category of adversarial perturbation (e.g.\n$\\ell_\\infty$-attack). In safety-critical applications, this makes these\nmethods extraneous as the attacker can adopt diverse adversaries to deceive the\nsystem. Moreover, training on multiple perturbations simultaneously\nsignificantly increases the computational overhead during training. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that explicitly\nlearns to generate noise to improve the model's robustness against multiple\ntypes of attacks. Its key component is Meta Noise Generator (MNG) that outputs\noptimal noise to stochastically perturb a given sample, such that it helps\nlower the error on diverse adversarial perturbations. By utilizing samples\ngenerated by MNG, we train a model by enforcing the label consistency across\nmultiple perturbations.

          "description": "Recently, the object detection based on deep learning has proven to be\nvulnerable to adversarial patch attacks. The attackers holding a specially\ncrafted patch can hide themselves from the state-of-the-art person detectors,\ne.g., YOLO, even in the physical world. This kind of attack can bring serious\nsecurity threats, such as escaping from surveillance cameras. In this paper, we\ndeeply explore the detection problems about the adversarial patch attacks to\nthe object detection. First, we identify a leverageable signature of existing\nadversarial patches from the point of the visualization explanation. A fast\nsignature-based defense method is proposed and demonstrated to be effective.\nSecond, we design an improved patch generation algorithm to reveal the risk\nthat the signature-based way may be bypassed by the techniques emerging in the\nfuture. The newly generated adversarial patches can successfully evade the\nproposed signature-based defense. Finally, we present a novel\nsignature-independent detection method based on the internal content semantics\nconsistency rather than any attack-specific prior knowledge. The fundamental\nintuition is that the adversarial object can appear locally but disappear\nglobally in an input image. The experiments demonstrate that the\nsignature-independent method can effectively detect the existing and improved\nattacks. It has also proven to be a general method by detecting unforeseen and\neven other types of attacks without any attack-specific prior knowledge. The\ntwo proposed detection methods can be adopted in different scenarios, and we\nbelieve that combining them can offer a comprehensive protection.",

          "description": "Generative models are now capable of producing highly realistic images that\nlook nearly indistinguishable from the data on which they are trained. This\nraises the question: if we have good enough generative models, do we still need\ndatasets? We investigate this question in the setting of learning\ngeneral-purpose visual representations from a black-box generative model rather\nthan directly from data. Given an off-the-shelf image generator without any\naccess to its training data, we train representations from the samples output\nby this generator. We compare several representation learning methods that can\nbe applied to this setting, using the latent space of the generator to generate\nmultiple \"views\" of the same semantic content. We show that for contrastive\nmethods, this multiview data can naturally be used to identify positive pairs\n(nearby in latent space) and negative pairs (far apart in latent space). We\nfind that the resulting representations rival those learned directly from real\ndata, but that good performance requires care in the sampling strategy applied\nand the training method. Generative models can be viewed as a compressed and\norganized copy of a dataset, and we envision a future where more and more\n\"model zoos\" proliferate while datasets become increasingly unwieldy, missing,\nor private. This paper suggests several techniques for dealing with visual\nrepresentation learning in such a future. Code is released on our project page:\nhttps://ali-design.github.io/GenRep/",

          "description": "In this work, we investigate the use of three information-theoretic\nquantities -- entropy, mutual information with the class variable, and a class\nselectivity measure based on Kullback-Leibler divergence -- to understand and\nstudy the behavior of already trained fully-connected feed-forward neural\nnetworks. We analyze the connection between these information-theoretic\nquantities and classification performance on the test set by cumulatively\nablating neurons in networks trained on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10. Our\nresults parallel those recently published by Morcos et al., indicating that\nclass selectivity is not a good indicator for classification performance.\nHowever, looking at individual layers separately, both mutual information and\nclass selectivity are positively correlated with classification performance, at\nleast for networks with ReLU activation functions. We provide explanations for\nthis phenomenon and conclude that it is ill-advised to compare the proposed\ninformation-theoretic quantities across layers. Furthermore, we show that\ncumulative ablation of neurons with ascending or descending\ninformation-theoretic quantities can be used to formulate hypotheses regarding\nthe joint behavior of multiple neurons, such as redundancy and synergy, with\ncomparably low computational cost. We also draw connections to the information\nbottleneck theory for neural networks.",

          "description": "Transfer learning aims to exploit pre-trained models for more efficient\nfollow-up training on wide range of downstream tasks and datasets, enabling\nsuccessful training also on small data. Recent line of work posits strong\nbenefits for model generalization and transfer when model size, data size, and\ncompute budget are increased for the pre-training. It remains however still\nlargely unclear whether the observed transfer improvement due to increase in\nscale also holds when source and target data distributions are far apart from\neach other. In this work we conduct large-scale pre-training on large source\ndatasets of either natural (ImageNet-21k/1k) or medical chest X-Ray images and\ncompare full and few-shot transfer using different target datasets from both\nnatural and medical imaging domains. Our observations provide evidence that\nwhile pre-training and transfer on closely related datasets do show clear\nbenefit of increasing model and data size during pre-training, such benefits\nare not clearly visible when source and target datasets are further apart.\nThese observations hold across both full and few-shot transfer and indicate\nthat scaling laws pointing to improvement of generalization and transfer with\nincreasing model and data size are incomplete and should be revised by taking\ninto account the type and proximity of the source and target data, to correctly\npredict the effect of model and data scale during pre-training on transfer.\nRemarkably, in full shot transfer to a large X-Ray chest imaging target\n(PadChest), the largest model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k slightly outperforms\nbest models pre-trained on large X-Ray chest imaging data. This indicates\npossibility to obtain high quality models for domain-specific transfer even\nwithout access to large domain-specific data, by pre-training instead on\ncomparably very large, generic source data.",

          "description": "Hierarchy and compositionality are common latent properties in many natural\nand scientific datasets. Determining when a deep network's hidden activations\nrepresent hierarchy and compositionality is important both for understanding\ndeep representation learning and for applying deep networks in domains where\ninterpretability is crucial. However, current benchmark machine learning\ndatasets either have little hierarchical or compositional structure, or the\nstructure is not known. This gap impedes precise analysis of a network's\nrepresentations and thus hinders development of new methods that can learn such\nproperties. To address this gap, we developed a new benchmark dataset with\nknown hierarchical and compositional structure. The Hangul Fonts Dataset (HFD)\nis comprised of 35 fonts from the Korean writing system (Hangul), each with\n11,172 blocks (syllables) composed from the product of initial consonant,\nmedial vowel, and final consonant glyphs. All blocks can be grouped into a few\ngeometric types which induces a hierarchy across blocks. In addition, each\nblock is composed of individual glyphs with rotations, translations, scalings,\nand naturalistic style variation across fonts. We find that both shallow and\ndeep unsupervised methods only show modest evidence of hierarchy and\ncompositionality in their representations of the HFD compared to supervised\ndeep networks. Supervised deep network representations contain structure\nrelated to the geometrical hierarchy of the characters, but the compositional\nstructure of the data is not evident. Thus, HFD enables the identification of\nshortcomings in existing methods, a critical first step toward developing new\nmachine learning algorithms to extract hierarchical and compositional structure\nin the context of naturalistic variability.",

          "description": "This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to modeling space-time\ncorrespondences in the context of video object segmentation. Unlike most\nexisting approaches, we establish correspondences directly between frames\nwithout re-encoding the mask features for every object, leading to a highly\nefficient and robust framework. With the correspondences, every node in the\ncurrent query frame is inferred by aggregating features from the past in an\nassociative fashion. We cast the aggregation process as a voting problem and\nfind that the existing inner-product affinity leads to poor use of memory with\na small (fixed) subset of memory nodes dominating the votes, regardless of the\nquery. In light of this phenomenon, we propose using the negative squared\nEuclidean distance instead to compute the affinities. We validated that every\nmemory node now has a chance to contribute, and experimentally showed that such\ndiversified voting is beneficial to both memory efficiency and inference\naccuracy. The synergy of correspondence networks and diversified voting works\nexceedingly well, achieves new state-of-the-art results on both DAVIS and\nYouTubeVOS datasets while running significantly faster at 20+ FPS for multiple\nobjects without bells and whistles.",

          "description": "In this paper, we present token labeling -- a new training objective for\ntraining high-performance vision transformers (ViTs). Different from the\nstandard training objective of ViTs that computes the classification loss on an\nadditional trainable class token, our proposed one takes advantage of all the\nimage patch tokens to compute the training loss in a dense manner.\nSpecifically, token labeling reformulates the image classification problem into\nmultiple token-level recognition problems and assigns each patch token with an\nindividual location-specific supervision generated by a machine annotator.\nExperiments show that token labeling can clearly and consistently improve the\nperformance of various ViT models across a wide spectrum. For a vision\ntransformer with 26M learnable parameters serving as an example, with token\nlabeling, the model can achieve 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. The result\ncan be further increased to 86.4% by slightly scaling the model size up to\n150M, delivering the minimal-sized model among previous models (250M+) reaching\n86%. We also show that token labeling can clearly improve the generalization\ncapability of the pre-trained models on downstream tasks with dense prediction,\nsuch as semantic segmentation.

          "description": "In the past few years, significant advancements were made in reconstruction\nof observed natural images from fMRI brain recordings using deep-learning\ntools. Here, for the first time, we show that dense 3D depth maps of observed\n2D natural images can also be recovered directly from fMRI brain recordings. We\nuse an off-the-shelf method to estimate the unknown depth maps of natural\nimages. This is applied to both: (i) the small number of images presented to\nsubjects in an fMRI scanner (images for which we have fMRI recordings -\nreferred to as \"paired\" data), and (ii) a very large number of natural images\nwith no fMRI recordings (\"unpaired data\"). The estimated depth maps are then\nused as an auxiliary reconstruction criterion to train for depth reconstruction\ndirectly from fMRI. We propose two main approaches: Depth-only recovery and\njoint image-depth RGBD recovery. Because the number of available \"paired\"\ntraining data (images with fMRI) is small, we enrich the training data via\nself-supervised cycle-consistent training on many \"unpaired\" data (natural\nimages & depth maps without fMRI). This is achieved using our newly defined and\ntrained Depth-based Perceptual Similarity metric as a reconstruction criterion.\nWe show that predicting the depth map directly from fMRI outperforms its\nindirect sequential recovery from the reconstructed images. We further show\nthat activations from early cortical visual areas dominate our depth\nreconstruction results, and propose means to characterize fMRI voxels by their\ndegree of depth-information tuning. This work adds an important layer of\ndecoded information, extending the current envelope of visual brain decoding\ncapabilities.",

Directly combining two tasks by\npost-processing also leads to poor performance. There is a lack of research on\nrelative saliency at present, limiting the practical applications such as\ncontent-aware image cropping, video summary, and image labeling.\n\nIn this paper, we study the Salient Object Ranking (SOR) task, which manages\nto assign a ranking order of each detected object according to its visual\nsaliency. We propose the first end-to-end framework of the SOR task and solve\nit in a multi-task learning fashion. The framework handles instance\nsegmentation and salient object ranking simultaneously.

          "description": "3D snapshot microscopy enables fast volumetric imaging by capturing a 3D\nvolume in a single 2D camera image, and has found a variety of biological\napplications such as whole brain imaging of fast neural activity in larval\nzebrafish. The optimal microscope design for this optical 3D-to-2D encoding is\nboth sample- and task-dependent, with no general solution known. Highly\nprogrammable optical elements create new possibilities for sample-specific\ncomputational optimization of microscope parameters, e.g. tuning the collection\nof light for a given sample structure. We perform such optimization with deep\nlearning, using a differentiable wave-optics simulation of light propagation\nthrough a programmable microscope and a neural network to reconstruct volumes\nfrom the microscope image. We introduce a class of global kernel Fourier\nconvolutional neural networks which can efficiently decode information from\nmultiple depths in the volume, globally encoded across a 3D snapshot image. We\nshow that our proposed networks succeed in large field of view volume\nreconstruction and microscope parameter optimization where traditional networks\nfail. We also show that our networks outperform the state-of-the-art learned\nreconstruction algorithms for lensless computational photography.",

          "description": "Wide-field and high-resolution (HR) imaging is essential for various\napplications such as aviation reconnaissance, topographic mapping and safety\nmonitoring. The existing techniques require a large-scale detector array to\ncapture HR images of the whole field, resulting in high complexity and heavy\ncost. In this work, we report an agile wide-field imaging framework with\nselective high resolution that requires only two detectors. It builds on the\nstatistical sparsity prior of natural scenes that the important targets locate\nonly at small regions of interests (ROI), instead of the whole field. Under\nthis assumption, we use a short-focal camera to image wide field with a certain\nlow resolution, and use a long-focal camera to acquire the HR images of ROI. To\nautomatically locate ROI in the wide field in real time, we propose an\nefficient deep-learning based multiscale registration method that is robust and\nblind to the large setting differences (focal, white balance, etc) between the\ntwo cameras. Using the registered location, the long-focal camera mounted on a\ngimbal enables real-time tracking of the ROI for continuous HR imaging. We\ndemonstrated the novel imaging framework by building a proof-of-concept setup\nwith only 1181 gram weight, and assembled it on an unmanned aerial vehicle for\nair-to-ground monitoring. Experiments show that the setup maintains\n120$^{\\circ}$ wide field-of-view (FOV) with selective 0.45$mrad$ instantaneous\nFOV.",

          "description": "Traffic anomaly detection has played a crucial role in Intelligent\nTransportation System (ITS). The main challenges of this task lie in the highly\ndiversified anomaly scenes and variational lighting conditions. Although much\nwork has managed to identify the anomaly in homogenous weather and scene, few\nresolved to cope with complex ones. In this paper, we proposed a dual-modality\nmodularized methodology for the robust detection of abnormal vehicles. We\nintroduced an integrated anomaly detection framework comprising the following\nmodules: background modeling, vehicle tracking with detection, mask\nconstruction, Region of Interest (ROI) backtracking, and dual-modality tracing.\nConcretely, we employed background modeling to filter the motion information\nand left the static information for later vehicle detection. For the vehicle\ndetection and tracking module, we adopted YOLOv5 and multi-scale tracking to\nlocalize the anomalies. Besides, we utilized the frame difference and tracking\nresults to identify the road and obtain the mask. In addition, we introduced\nmultiple similarity estimation metrics to refine the anomaly period via\nbacktracking. Finally, we proposed a dual-modality bilateral tracing module to\nrefine the time further. The experiments conducted on the Track 4 testset of\nthe NVIDIA 2021 AI City Challenge yielded a result of 0.9302 F1-Score and\n3.4039 root mean square error (RMSE), indicating the effectiveness of our\nframework.",

          "description": "Traditional self-supervised learning requires CNNs using external pretext\ntasks (i.e., image- or video-based tasks) to encode high-level semantic visual\nrepresentations. In this paper, we show that feature transformations within\nCNNs can also be regarded as supervisory signals to construct the\nself-supervised task, called \\emph{internal pretext task}. And such a task can\nbe applied for the enhancement of supervised learning. Specifically, we first\ntransform the internal feature maps by discarding different channels, and then\ndefine an additional internal pretext task to identify the discarded channels.\nCNNs are trained to predict the joint labels generated by the combination of\nself-supervised labels and original labels. By doing so, we let CNNs know which\nchannels are missing while classifying in the hope to mine richer feature\ninformation. Extensive experiments show that our approach is effective on\nvarious models and datasets. And it's worth noting that we only incur\nnegligible computational overhead.

Every year there are\nmore than 4 million victims of child trafficking around the world, many of them\nfor the purposes of child sexual exploitation. In collaboration with UK Police\nand a non-profit focused on child abuse prevention, Global Emancipation\nNetwork, we developed a proof-of-concept machine learning pipeline to aid the\nidentification of children from intercepted images. In this work, we focus on\nimages that contain children wearing school uniforms to identify the school of\norigin. In the absence of a machine learning pipeline, this hugely time\nconsuming and labor intensive task is manually conducted by law enforcement\npersonnel. Thus, by automating aspects of the school identification process, we\nhope to significantly impact the speed of this portion of child identification.\nOur proposed pipeline consists of two machine learning models: i) to identify\nwhether an image of a child contains a school uniform in it, and ii)\nidentification of attributes of different school uniform items (such as\ncolor/texture of shirts, sweaters, blazers etc.). We describe the data\ncollection, labeling, model development and validation process, along with\nstrategies for efficient searching of schools using the model predictions.",

However, the most advanced semantic\nsegmentation methods rely on deep learning and require a huge amount of labeled\nimages, which are rarely available due to both the high cost of human resources\nand the time required for labeling. In this paper, we present a novel\nmulti-stage generation algorithm based on Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) that can produce synthetic images along with their semantic labels and\ncan be used for data augmentation. The main feature of the method is that,\nunlike other approaches, generation occurs in several stages, which simplifies\nthe procedure and allows it to be used on very small datasets. The method has\nbeen evaluated on the segmentation of chest radiographic images, showing\npromising results.

Since\nthe core issue in semi-supervised setting lies in effective and efficient\nutilization of unlabeled data, we notice that increasing the diversity and\nhardness of unlabeled data is crucial to performance improvement. Being aware\nof this fact, we propose to adopt the most plain self-training scheme coupled\nwith appropriate strong data augmentations on unlabeled data (namely ST) for\nthis task, which surprisingly outperforms previous methods under various\nsettings without any bells and whistles. Moreover, to alleviate the negative\nimpact of the wrongly pseudo labeled images, we further propose an advanced\nself-training framework (namely ST++), that performs selective re-training via\nselecting and prioritizing the more reliable unlabeled images. As a result, the\nproposed ST++ boosts the performance of semi-supervised model significantly and\nsurpasses existing methods by a large margin on the Pascal VOC 2012 and\nCityscapes benchmark.

We propose a novel loss function exploiting geometric\nknowledge of lanes in Hough space, where a lane can be identified as a local\nmaximum. By splitting lanes into separate channels, we can localize each lane\nvia simple global max-pooling. The location of the maximum encodes the layout\nof a lane, while the intensity indicates the the probability of a lane being\npresent. Maximizing the log-probability of the maximal bins helps neural\nnetworks find lanes without labels.

          "description": "Accurate segmentation for medical images is important for clinical diagnosis.\nExisting automatic segmentation methods are mainly based on fully supervised\nlearning and have an extremely high demand for precise annotations, which are\nvery costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this problem, we proposed\nan automatic CT segmentation method based on weakly supervised learning, by\nwhich one could train an accurate segmentation model only with weak annotations\nin the form of bounding boxes. The proposed method is composed of two steps: 1)\ngenerating pseudo masks with bounding box annotations by k-means clustering,\nand 2) iteratively training a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network as a\nsegmentation model. Some data pre-processing methods are used to improve\nperformance. The method was validated on four datasets containing three types\nof organs with a total of 627 CT volumes.

          "description": "3D image scans are an assessment tool for neurological damage in Parkinson's\ndisease (PD) patients. This diagnosis process can be automatized to help\nmedical staff through Decision Support Systems (DSSs), and Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) are good candidates, because they are effective when applied to\nspatial data. This paper proposes a 3D CNN ordinal model for assessing the\nlevel or neurological damage in PD patients. Given that CNNs need large\ndatasets to achieve acceptable performance, a data augmentation method is\nadapted to work with spatial data. We consider the Ordinal Graph-based\nOversampling via Shortest Paths (OGO-SP) method, which applies a gamma\nprobability distribution for inter-class data generation. A modification of\nOGO-SP is proposed, the OGO-SP-$\\beta$ algorithm, which applies the beta\ndistribution for generating synthetic samples in the inter-class region, a\nbetter suited distribution when compared to gamma. The evaluation of the\ndifferent methods is based on a novel 3D image dataset provided by the Hospital\nUniversitario 'Reina Sof\\'ia' (C\\'ordoba, Spain).

We demonstrate that, when performed correctly,\nknowledge distillation can be a powerful tool for reducing the size of large\nmodels without compromising their performance. In particular, we uncover that\nthere are certain implicit design choices, which may drastically affect the\neffectiveness of distillation. Our key contribution is the explicit\nidentification of these design choices, which were not previously articulated\nin the literature.

          "description": "The self-attention mechanism has attracted wide publicity for its most\nimportant advantage of modeling long dependency, and its variations in computer\nvision tasks, the non-local block tries to model the global dependency of the\ninput feature maps. Gathering global contextual information will inevitably\nneed a tremendous amount of memory and computing resources, which has been\nextensively studied in the past several years. However, there is a further\nproblem with the self-attention scheme: is all information gathered from the\nglobal scope helpful for the contextual modelling? To our knowledge, few\nstudies have focused on the problem. Aimed at both questions this paper\nproposes the salient positions-based attention scheme SPANet, which is inspired\nby some interesting observations on the attention maps and affinity matrices\ngenerated in self-attention scheme. We believe these observations are\nbeneficial for better understanding of the self-attention. SPANet uses the\nsalient positions selection algorithm to select only a limited amount of\nsalient points to attend in the attention map computing. This approach will not\nonly spare a lot of memory and computing resources, but also try to distill the\npositive information from the transformation of the input feature maps. In the\nimplementation, considering the feature maps with channel high dimensions,\nwhich are completely different from the general visual image, we take the\nsquared power of the feature maps along the channel dimension as the saliency\nmetric of the positions. In general, different from the non-local block method,\nSPANet models the contextual information using only the selected positions\ninstead of all, along the channel dimension instead of space dimension.

While prior work has focused on synthetic data, we attempt here\nto characterize the factors of variation in a real dataset, ImageNet, and study\nthe invariance of both standard residual networks and the recently proposed\nvision transformer with respect to changes in these factors. We show standard\naugmentation relies on a precise combination of translation and scale, with\ntranslation recapturing most of the performance improvement -- despite the\n(approximate) translation invariance built in to convolutional architectures,\nsuch as residual networks. In fact, we found that scale and translation\ninvariance was similar across residual networks and vision transformer models\ndespite their markedly different inductive biases. We show the training data\nitself is the main source of invariance, and that data augmentation only\nfurther increases the learned invariances. Interestingly, the invariances\nbrought from the training process align with the ImageNet factors of variation\nwe found. Finally, we find that the main factors of variation in ImageNet\nmostly relate to appearance and are specific to each class.",

          "description": "A central challenge in training classification models in the real-world\nfederated system is learning with non-IID data. To cope with this, most of the\nexisting works involve enforcing regularization in local optimization or\nimproving the model aggregation scheme at the server. Other works also share\npublic datasets or synthesized samples to supplement the training of\nunder-represented classes or introduce a certain level of personalization.\nThough effective, they lack a deep understanding of how the data heterogeneity\naffects each layer of a deep classification model. In this paper, we bridge\nthis gap by performing an experimental analysis of the representations learned\nby different layers. Our observations are surprising: (1) there exists a\ngreater bias in the classifier than other layers, and (2) the classification\nperformance can be significantly improved by post-calibrating the classifier\nafter federated training. Motivated by the above findings, we propose a novel\nand simple algorithm called Classifier Calibration with Virtual Representations\n(CCVR), which adjusts the classifier using virtual representations sampled from\nan approximated gaussian mixture model. Experimental results demonstrate that\nCCVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular federated learning\nbenchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10.

          "description": "Metric learning involves learning a discriminative representation such that\nembeddings of similar classes are encouraged to be close, while embeddings of\ndissimilar classes are pushed far apart. State-of-the-art methods focus mostly\non sophisticated loss functions or mining strategies. On the one hand, metric\nlearning losses consider two or more examples at a time. On the other hand,\nmodern data augmentation methods for classification consider two or more\nexamples at a time. The combination of the two ideas is under-studied.\n\nIn this work, we aim to bridge this gap and improve representations using\nmixup, which is a powerful data augmentation approach interpolating two or more\nexamples and corresponding target labels at a time. This task is challenging\nbecause, unlike classification, the loss functions used in metric learning are\nnot additive over examples, so the idea of interpolating target labels is not\nstraightforward.

We propose a sparse and efficient fusion\nof a parametric body prior with a non-parametric peeled depth map\nrepresentation of clothed models. The parametric body prior constraints our\nmodel in two ways: first, the network retains geometrically consistent body\nparts that are not occluded by clothing, and second, it provides a body shape\ncontext that improves prediction of the peeled depth maps. This enables SHARP\nto recover fine-grained 3D geometrical details with just L1 losses on the 2D\nmaps, given an input image.

          "description": "Sequential whole-body 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission\ntomography (PET) scans are regarded as the imaging modality of choice for the\nassessment of treatment response in the lymphomas because they detect treatment\nresponse when there may not be changes on anatomical imaging. Any computerized\nanalysis of lymphomas in whole-body PET requires automatic segmentation of the\nstudies so that sites of disease can be quantitatively monitored over time.\nState-of-the-art PET image segmentation methods are based on convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) given their ability to leverage annotated datasets to\nderive high-level features about the disease process. Such methods, however,\nfocus on PET images from a single time-point and discard information from other\nscans or are targeted towards specific organs and cannot cater for the multiple\nstructures in whole-body PET images. In this study, we propose a\nspatio-temporal 'dual-stream' neural network (ST-DSNN) to segment sequential\nwhole-body PET scans. Our ST-DSNN learns and accumulates image features from\nthe PET images done over time.

Previous works have focused on\nad-hoc methods to select frames from a video or use face image quality\nassessment (FIQA) methods, which consider only a particular or combination of\nseveral distortions.\n\nIn this work, we present an efficient non-reference image quality assessment\nfor FR that directly links image quality assessment (IQA) and FR.

This paper explores the capabilities of deep\nlearning to leverage computational ghost imaging when there is a lack of paired\ntraining images. The deep learning approach proposed here enables fast ghost\nimaging through reconstruction of high SNR images from faint and hastily shot\nghost images using a constrained Wasserstein generative adversarial network. In\nthe proposed approach, the objective function is regularized to enforce the\ngeneration of faithful and relevant high SNR images to the ghost copies. This\nregularization measures the distance between reconstructed images and the faint\nghost images in a low-noise manifold generated by a shadow network. The\nperformance of the constrained network is shown to be particularly important\nfor ghost images with low SNR. The proposed pipeline is able to reconstruct\nhigh-quality images from the ghost images with SNR values not necessarily equal\nto the SNR of the training set.",

          "description": "Despite the increasing interest in neural architecture search (NAS), the\nsignificant computational cost of NAS is a hindrance to researchers. Hence, we\npropose to reduce the cost of NAS using proxy data, i.e., a representative\nsubset of the target data, without sacrificing search performance. Even though\ndata selection has been used across various fields, our evaluation of existing\nselection methods for NAS algorithms offered by NAS-Bench-1shot1 reveals that\nthey are not always appropriate for NAS and a new selection method is\nnecessary. By analyzing proxy data constructed using various selection methods\nthrough data entropy, we propose a novel proxy data selection method tailored\nfor NAS. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness, we conduct thorough\nexperiments across diverse datasets, search spaces, and NAS algorithms.\nConsequently, NAS algorithms with the proposed selection discover architectures\nthat are competitive with those obtained using the entire dataset. It\nsignificantly reduces the search cost: executing DARTS with the proposed\nselection requires only 40 minutes on CIFAR-10 and 7.5 hours on ImageNet with a\nsingle GPU. Additionally, when the architecture searched on ImageNet using the\nproposed selection is inversely transferred to CIFAR-10, a state-of-the-art\ntest error of 2.4\\% is yielded.

As such, deploying DL models across mobile\nplatforms is vital to enable the development and broad availability of the\nnext-generation intelligent apps. Nevertheless, the wide and optimised\ndeployment of DL models is currently hindered by the vast system heterogeneity\nof mobile devices, the varying computational cost of different DL models and\nthe variability of performance needs across DL applications. This paper\nproposes OODIn, a framework for the optimised deployment of DL apps across\nheterogeneous mobile devices. OODIn comprises a novel DL-specific software\narchitecture together with an analytical framework for modelling DL\napplications that: (1) counteract the variability in device resources and DL\nmodels by means of a highly parametrised multi-layer design; and (2) perform a\nprincipled optimisation of both model- and system-level parameters through a\nmulti-objective formulation, designed for DL inference apps, in order to adapt\nthe deployment to the user-specified performance requirements and device\ncapabilities. Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed framework\nconsistently outperforms status-quo designs across heterogeneous devices and\ndelivers up to 4.3x and 3.5x performance gain over highly optimised platform-\nand model-aware designs respectively, while effectively adapting execution to\ndynamic changes in resource availability.",

          "description": "Existing deep learning methods for diagnosis of gastric cancer commonly use\nconvolutional neural network. Recently, the Visual Transformer has attracted\ngreat attention because of its performance and efficiency, but its applications\nare mostly in the field of computer vision. In this paper, a multi-scale visual\ntransformer model, referred to as GasHis-Transformer, is proposed for Gastric\nHistopathological Image Classification (GHIC), which enables the automatic\nclassification of microscopic gastric images into abnormal and normal cases.\nThe GasHis-Transformer model consists of two key modules: A global information\nmodule and a local information module to extract histopathological features\neffectively. In our experiments, a public hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained\ngastric histopathological dataset with 280 abnormal and normal images are\ndivided into training, validation and test sets by a ratio of 1 : 1 : 2. The\nGasHis-Transformer model is applied to estimate precision, recall, F1-score and\naccuracy on the test set of gastric histopathological dataset as 98.0%, 100.0%,\n96.0% and 98.0%, respectively. Furthermore, a critical study is conducted to\nevaluate the robustness of GasHis-Transformer, where ten different noises\nincluding four adversarial attack and six conventional image noises are added.\nIn addition, a clinically meaningful study is executed to test the\ngastrointestinal cancer identification performance of GasHis-Transformer with\n620 abnormal images and achieves 96.8% accuracy. Finally, a comparative study\nis performed to test the generalizability with both H&E and immunohistochemical\nstained images on a lymphoma image dataset and a breast cancer dataset,\nproducing comparable F1-scores (85.6% and 82.8%) and accuracies (83.9% and\n89.4%), respectively. In conclusion, GasHisTransformer demonstrates high\nclassification performance and shows its significant potential in the GHIC\ntask.",

          "description": "Recently, there has been considerable research interest in graph clustering\naimed at data partition using the graph information. However, one limitation of\nthe most of graph-based methods is that they assume the graph structure to\noperate is fixed and reliable. And there are inevitably some edges in the graph\nthat are not conducive to graph clustering, which we call spurious edges. This\npaper is the first attempt to employ graph pooling technique for node\nclustering and we propose a novel dual graph embedding network (DGEN), which is\ndesigned as a two-step graph encoder connected by a graph pooling layer to\nlearn the graph embedding. In our model, it is assumed that if a node and its\nnearest neighboring node are close to the same clustering center, this node is\nan informative node and this edge can be considered as a cluster-friendly edge.\nBased on this assumption, the neighbor cluster pooling (NCPool) is devised to\nselect the most informative subset of nodes and the corresponding edges based\non the distance of nodes and their nearest neighbors to the cluster centers.\nThis can effectively alleviate the impact of the spurious edges on the\nclustering. Finally, to obtain the clustering assignment of all nodes, a\nclassifier is trained using the clustering results of the selected nodes.\nExperiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed method over state-of-the-art algorithms.",

          "description": "The goal of image style transfer is to render an image with artistic features\nguided by a style reference while maintaining the original content. Due to the\nlocality and spatial invariance in CNNs, it is difficult to extract and\nmaintain the global information of input images. Therefore, traditional neural\nstyle transfer methods are usually biased and content leak can be observed by\nrunning several times of the style transfer process with the same reference\nstyle image. To address this critical issue, we take long-range dependencies of\ninput images into account for unbiased style transfer by proposing a\ntransformer-based approach, namely StyTr^2. In contrast with visual\ntransformers for other vision tasks, our StyTr^2 contains two different\ntransformer encoders to generate domain-specific sequences for content and\nstyle, respectively. Following the encoders, a multi-layer transformer decoder\nis adopted to stylize the content sequence according to the style sequence. In\naddition, we analyze the deficiency of existing positional encoding methods and\npropose the content-aware positional encoding (CAPE) which is scale-invariant\nand more suitable for image style transfer task. Qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed StyTr^2 compared to\nstate-of-the-art CNN-based and flow-based approaches.",

          "description": "Domain generalization (DG) methods aim to achieve generalizability to an\nunseen target domain by using only training data from the source domains.\nAlthough a variety of DG methods have been proposed, a recent study shows that\nunder a fair evaluation protocol, called DomainBed, the simple empirical risk\nminimization (ERM) approach works comparable to or even outperforms previous\nmethods. Unfortunately, simply solving ERM on a complex, non-convex loss\nfunction can easily lead to sub-optimal generalizability by seeking sharp\nminima. In this paper, we theoretically show that finding flat minima results\nin a smaller domain generalization gap.

We also compare SWAD with\nconventional generalization methods, such as data augmentation and consistency\nregularization methods, to verify that the remarkable performance improvements\nare originated from by seeking flat minima, not from better in-domain\ngeneralizability.

          "description": "Changing environments poses a great challenge on the outdoor visual\nperception and scene understanding for robust long-term autonomous driving and\nmobile robots, where depth-auxiliary geometric information plays an essential\nrole to the robustness under challenging scenes. Although monocular depth\nprediction has been well studied recently, there are few work focusing on the\ndepth prediction across multiple environmental conditions, e.g. changing\nillumination and seasons, owing to the lack of such a real-world dataset and\nbenchmark. In this work, a new cross-season monocular depth prediction dataset\nSeasonDepth (available on https://seasondepth.github.io) is derived from CMU\nVisual Localization dataset through structure from motion. To benchmark the\ndepth estimation performance under different environments, we investigate\nrepresentative and recent state-of-the-art open-source supervised,\nself-supervised and domain adaptation depth prediction methods from KITTI\nbenchmark using several newly-formulated metrics. Through extensive\nexperimental evaluation on the proposed dataset without fine-tuning, the\ninfluence of multiple environments on performance and robustness is analyzed\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively, showing that the long-term monocular\ndepth prediction is far from solved. We further give promising solutions\nespecially with stereo geometry and multi-task sequential self-supervised\ntraining to enhance the robustness to changing environments.",

          "description": "Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across\nvarious machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head\nself-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image\npatches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such\nflexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can\nfacilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain\nshifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We\nsystematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments\nencompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following\nintriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe\nocclusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.\n(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local\ntextures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to\nCNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate\nshape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,\npreviously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape\nrepresentation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic\nsegmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a\nsingle ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high\naccuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional\nand few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to\nflexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention\nmechanism.",

          "description": "Although great progress has been made on adversarial attacks for deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs), their transferability is still unsatisfactory, especially for\ntargeted attacks. There are two problems behind that have been long overlooked:\n1) the conventional setting of $T$ iterations with the step size of\n$\\epsilon/T$ to comply with the $\\epsilon$-constraint. In this case, most of\nthe pixels are allowed to add very small noise, much less than $\\epsilon$; and\n2) usually manipulating pixel-wise noise. However, features of a pixel\nextracted by DNNs are influenced by its surrounding regions, and different DNNs\ngenerally focus on different discriminative regions in recognition. To tackle\nthese issues, our previous work proposes a patch-wise iterative method (PIM)\naimed at crafting adversarial examples with high transferability. Specifically,\nwe introduce an amplification factor to the step size in each iteration, and\none pixel's overall gradient overflowing the $\\epsilon$-constraint is properly\nassigned to its surrounding regions by a project kernel. But targeted attacks\naim to push the adversarial examples into the territory of a specific class,\nand the amplification factor may lead to underfitting. Thus, we introduce the\ntemperature and propose a patch-wise++ iterative method (PIM++) to further\nimprove transferability without significantly sacrificing the performance of\nthe white-box attack. Our method can be generally integrated to any\ngradient-based attack methods. Compared with the current state-of-the-art\nattack methods, we significantly improve the success rate by 33.1\\% for defense\nmodels and 31.4\\% for normally trained models on average.",

However, recent advances in fast\nimage segmentation make these solutions less attractive. To leverage fast image\nsegmentation for furthering video segmentation, we propose a simple yet\nefficient propagation framework. Specifically, we perform lightweight flow\nestimation in 1/8-downscaled image space for temporal warping in segmentation\noutpace space. Moreover, we introduce a guided spatially-varying convolution\nfor fusing segmentations derived from the previous and current frames, to\nmitigate propagation error and enable lightweight feature extraction on\nnon-keyframes.

          "description": "Batch Normalization (BN) is a popular technique for training Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs). BN uses scaling and shifting to normalize activations of\nmini-batches to accelerate convergence and improve generalization. The recently\nproposed Iterative Normalization (IterNorm) method improves these properties by\nwhitening the activations iteratively using Newton's method. However, since\nNewton's method initializes the whitening matrix independently at each training\nstep, no information is shared between consecutive steps. In this work, instead\nof exact computation of whitening matrix at each time step, we estimate it\ngradually during training in an online fashion, using our proposed Stochastic\nWhitening Batch Normalization (SWBN) algorithm. We show that while SWBN\nimproves the convergence rate and generalization of DNNs, its computational\noverhead is less than that of IterNorm. Due to the high efficiency of the\nproposed method, it can be easily employed in most DNN architectures with a\nlarge number of layers. We provide comprehensive experiments and comparisons\nbetween BN, IterNorm, and SWBN layers to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed technique in conventional (many-shot) image classification and\nfew-shot classification tasks.",

          "description": "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) raises keen attention to identifying sparse\ntrainable subnetworks, or winning tickets, of training, which can be trained in\nisolation to achieve similar or even better performance compared to the full\nmodels. Despite many efforts being made, the most effective method to identify\nsuch winning tickets is still Iterative Magnitude-based Pruning (IMP), which is\ncomputationally expensive and has to be run thoroughly for every different\nnetwork. A natural question that comes in is: can we \"transform\" the winning\nticket found in one network to another with a different architecture, yielding\na winning ticket for the latter at the beginning, without re-doing the\nexpensive IMP? Answering this question is not only practically relevant for\nefficient \"once-for-all\" winning ticket finding, but also theoretically\nappealing for uncovering inherently scalable sparse patterns in networks. We\nconduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and propose a variety\nof strategies to tweak the winning tickets found from different networks of the\nsame model family (e.g., ResNets). Based on these results, we articulate the\nElastic Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (E-LTH): by mindfully replicating (or\ndropping) and re-ordering layers for one network, its corresponding winning\nticket could be stretched (or squeezed) into a subnetwork for another deeper\n(or shallower) network from the same family, whose performance is nearly the\nsame competitive as the latter's winning ticket directly found by IMP.

          "description": "Despite their impressive performance in object recognition and other tasks\nunder standard testing conditions, deep networks often fail to generalize to\nout-of-distribution (o.o.d.) samples. One cause for this shortcoming is that\nmodern architectures tend to rely on \"shortcuts\" - superficial features that\ncorrelate with categories without capturing deeper invariants that hold across\ncontexts. Real-world concepts often possess a complex structure that can vary\nsuperficially across contexts, which can make the most intuitive and promising\nsolutions in one context not generalize to others. One potential way to improve\no.o.d. generalization is to assume simple solutions are unlikely to be valid\nacross contexts and avoid them, which we refer to as the too-good-to-be-true\nprior. A low-capacity network (LCN) with a shallow architecture should only be\nable to learn surface relationships, including shortcuts. We find that LCNs can\nserve as shortcut detectors. Furthermore, an LCN's predictions can be used in a\ntwo-stage approach to encourage a high-capacity network (HCN) to rely on deeper\ninvariant features that should generalize broadly. In particular, items that\nthe LCN can master are downweighted when training the HCN. Using a modified\nversion of the CIFAR-10 dataset in which we introduced shortcuts, we found that\nthe two-stage LCN-HCN approach reduced reliance on shortcuts and facilitated\no.o.d. generalization.",

          "description": "Noise and low quality of ECG signals acquired from Holter or wearable devices\ndeteriorate the accuracy and robustness of R-peak detection algorithms. This\npaper presents a generic and robust system for R-peak detection in Holter ECG\nsignals. While many proposed algorithms have successfully addressed the problem\nof ECG R-peak detection, there is still a notable gap in the performance of\nthese detectors on such low-quality ECG records. Therefore, in this study, a\nnovel implementation of the 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used\nintegrated with a verification model to reduce the number of false alarms. This\nCNN architecture consists of an encoder block and a corresponding decoder block\nfollowed by a sample-wise classification layer to construct the 1D segmentation\nmap of R- peaks from the input ECG signal. Once the proposed model has been\ntrained, it can solely be used to detect R-peaks possibly in a single channel\nECG data stream quickly and accurately, or alternatively, such a solution can\nbe conveniently employed for real-time monitoring on a lightweight portable\ndevice. The model is tested on two open-access ECG databases: The China\nPhysiological Signal Challenge (2020) database (CPSC-DB) with more than one\nmillion beats, and the commonly used MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MIT-DB).\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed systematic approach achieves\n99.30% F1-score, 99.69% recall, and 98.91% precision in CPSC-DB, which is the\nbest R-peak detection performance ever achieved. Compared to all competing\nmethods, the proposed approach can reduce the false-positives and\nfalse-negatives in Holter ECG signals by more than 54% and 82%, respectively.\nResults also demonstrate similar or better performance than most competing\nalgorithms on MIT-DB with 99.83% F1-score, 99.85% recall, and 99.82% precision.",

Most\nrecent efforts in visual navigation have typically focused on generalizing to\nnovel target environments with similar appearance and dynamics characteristics.\nWith RobustNav, we find that some standard embodied navigation agents\nsignificantly underperform (or fail) in the presence of visual or dynamics\ncorruptions. We systematically analyze the kind of idiosyncrasies that emerge\nin the behavior of such agents when operating under corruptions. Finally, for\nvisual corruptions in RobustNav, we show that while standard techniques to\nimprove robustness such as data-augmentation and self-supervised adaptation\noffer some zero-shot resistance and improvements in navigation performance,\nthere is still a long way to go in terms of recovering lost performance\nrelative to clean \"non-corrupt\" settings, warranting more research in this\ndirection.

Traditionally, these tasks are implemented\nusing separate deep learning models for separate tasks, which is not efficient\nbecause it involves unnecessary training repetitions, demands greater\ncomputational resources, and requires a relatively large amount of labeled\ndata. In this paper, we propose a multi-task training approach for medical\nimage analysis, where individual tasks are fine-tuned simultaneously through\nrelevant knowledge transfer using a unified modality-specific feature\nrepresentation (UMS-Rep). We explore different fine-tuning strategies to\ndemonstrate the impact of the strategy on the performance of target medical\nimage tasks. We experiment with different visual tasks (e.g., image denoising,\nsegmentation, and classification) to highlight the advantages offered with our\napproach for two imaging modalities, chest X-ray and Doppler echocardiography.\nOur results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the overall demand\nfor computational resources and improves target task generalization and\nperformance.

          "description": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to generalize the knowledge learned\nfrom a well-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recently,\nadversarial domain adaptation with two distinct classifiers (bi-classifier) has\nbeen introduced into UDA which is effective to align distributions between\ndifferent domains. Previous bi-classifier adversarial learning methods only\nfocus on the similarity between the outputs of two distinct classifiers.\nHowever, the similarity of the outputs cannot guarantee the accuracy of target\nsamples, i.e., target samples may match to wrong categories even if the\ndiscrepancy between two classifiers is small. To challenge this issue, in this\npaper, we propose a cross-domain gradient discrepancy minimization (CGDM)\nmethod which explicitly minimizes the discrepancy of gradients generated by\nsource samples and target samples. Specifically, the gradient gives a cue for\nthe semantic information of target samples so it can be used as a good\nsupervision to improve the accuracy of target samples. In order to compute the\ngradient signal of target samples, we further obtain target pseudo labels\nthrough a clustering-based self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on\nthree widely used UDA datasets show that our method surpasses many previous\nstate-of-the-arts. Codes are available at https://github.com/lijin118/CGDM.",

The highlight is that the\nannotations from different domains can be efficiently reused and consistently\nboost performance for each specific domain. This is achieved by first\npretraining the network via the proposed pixel-to-prototype contrastive loss\nover multiple datasets regardless of their taxonomy labels, and followed by\nfine-tuning the pretrained model over specific dataset as usual. In order to\nbetter model the relationship among images and classes from different datasets,\nwe extend the pixel level embeddings via cross dataset mixing and propose a\npixel-to-class sparse coding strategy that explicitly models the pixel-class\nsimilarity over the manifold embedding space. In this way, we are able to\nincrease intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, as well as\nconsidering inter-class similarity across different datasets for better\ntransferability.

          "description": "Vision Transformer (ViT) attains state-of-the-art performance in visual\nrecognition, and the variant, Local Vision Transformer, makes further\nimprovements. The major component in Local Vision Transformer, local attention,\nperforms the attention separately over small local windows. We rephrase local\nattention as a channel-wise locally-connected layer and analyze it from two\nnetwork regularization manners, sparse connectivity and weight sharing, as well\nas weight computation. Sparse connectivity: there is no connection across\nchannels, and each position is connected to the positions within a small local\nwindow. Weight sharing: the connection weights for one position are shared\nacross channels or within each group of channels. Dynamic weight: the\nconnection weights are dynamically predicted according to each image instance.\nWe point out that local attention resembles depth-wise convolution and its\ndynamic version in sparse connectivity. The main difference lies in weight\nsharing - depth-wise convolution shares connection weights (kernel weights)\nacross spatial positions. We empirically observe that the models based on\ndepth-wise convolution and the dynamic variant with lower computation\ncomplexity perform on-par with or sometimes slightly better than Swin\nTransformer, an instance of Local Vision Transformer, for ImageNet\nclassification, COCO object detection and ADE semantic segmentation.

In the 1990's it was discovered, that conversational speech between two\nhumans turns out to be considerably more difficult than read speech as\nhesitations, disfluencies, false starts and sloppy articulation complicate\nacoustic processing and require robust handling of acoustic, lexical and\nlanguage context, jointly. Early attempts with statistical models could only\nreach error rates over 50% and far from human performance (WER of around 5.5%).\nNeural hybrid models and recent attention-based encoder-decoder models have\nconsiderably improved performance as such contexts can now be learned in an\nintegral fashion. However, processing such contexts requires an entire\nutterance presentation and thus introduces unwanted delays before a recognition\nresult can be output. In this paper, we address performance as well as latency.\nWe present results for a system that can achieve super-human performance (at a\nWER of 5.0%, over the Switchboard conversational benchmark) at a word based\nlatency of only 1 second behind a speaker's speech.

Our experiments demonstrate that by training with our synthetic\nreferring expressions one can improve the ability of a model to generalize\nacross different datasets, without any additional annotation cost.

In this context, the latest\nadvances have focused on recurrent structures, establishing the social\ninteraction between the agents involved in the scene. More recently, simpler\nstructures have also been introduced for predicting pedestrian trajectories,\nbased on Transformer Networks, and using positional information. They allow the\nindividual modelling of each agent's trajectory separately without any complex\ninteraction terms. Our model exploits these simple structures by adding\naugmented data (position and heading), and adapting their use to the problem of\nvehicle trajectory prediction in urban scenarios in prediction horizons up to 5\nseconds. In addition, a cross-performance analysis is performed between\ndifferent types of scenarios, including highways, intersections and\nroundabouts, using recent datasets (inD, rounD, highD and INTERACTION).

In this paper, we\nintroduce Neural Motion Consensus Flow (MoCo-Flow), a representation that\nmodels the dynamic scene using a 4D continuous time-variant function. The\nproposed representation is learned by an optimization which models a dynamic\nscene that minimizes the error of rendering all observation images. At the\nheart of our work lies a novel optimization formulation, which is constrained\nby a motion consensus regularization on the motion flow.

          "description": "The latent space of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been shown to\nencode rich semantics within some subspaces. To identify these subspaces,\nresearchers typically analyze the statistical information from a collection of\nsynthesized data, and the identified subspaces tend to control image attributes\nglobally (i.e., manipulating an attribute causes the change of an entire\nimage). By contrast, this work introduces low-rank subspaces that enable more\nprecise control of GAN generation. Concretely, given an arbitrary image and a\nregion of interest (e.g., eyes of face images), we manage to relate the latent\nspace to the image region with the Jacobian matrix and then use low-rank\nfactorization to discover steerable latent subspaces. There are three\ndistinguishable strengths of our approach that can be aptly called LowRankGAN.\nFirst, compared to analytic algorithms in prior work, our low-rank\nfactorization of Jacobians is able to find the low-dimensional representation\nof attribute manifold, making image editing more precise and controllable.\nSecond, low-rank factorization naturally yields a null space of attributes such\nthat moving the latent code within it only affects the outer region of\ninterest. Therefore, local image editing can be simply achieved by projecting\nan attribute vector into the null space without relying on a spatial mask as\nexisting methods do. Third, our method can robustly work with a local region\nfrom one image for analysis yet well generalize to other images, making it much\neasy to use in practice. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art GAN models\n(including StyleGAN2 and BigGAN) trained on various datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our LowRankGAN.",

However, these end-to-end approaches require\nre-training every time there is a distribution shift in the inputs (e.g., night\nimages vs daylight) or relevant latent variables (e.g., camera blur or hand\nmotion). In this work, we leverage state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models\n(here StyleGAN2) for building powerful image priors, which enable application\nof Bayes' theorem for many downstream reconstruction tasks. Our method,\nBayesian Reconstruction through Generative Models (BRGM), uses a single\npre-trained generator model to solve different image restoration tasks, i.e.,\nsuper-resolution and in-painting, by combining it with different forward\ncorruption models. We keep the weights of the generator model fixed, and\nreconstruct the image by estimating the Bayesian maximum a-posteriori (MAP)\nestimate over the input latent vector that generated the reconstructed image.\nWe further use variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution\nover the latent vectors, from which we sample multiple solutions.

          "description": "Digitization, i.e., the process of converting information into a digital\nformat, may provide various opportunities (e.g., increase in productivity,\ndisaster recovery, and environmentally friendly solutions) and challenges for\nbusinesses. In this context, one of the main challenges would be to accurately\nclassify numerous scanned documents uploaded every day by customers as usual\nbusiness processes. For example, processes in banking (e.g., applying for\nloans) or the Government Registry of BDM (Births, Deaths, and Marriages)\napplications may involve uploading several documents such as a driver's license\nand passport. There are not many studies available to address the challenge as\nan application of image classification. Although some studies are available\nwhich used various methods, a more accurate model is still required. The\ncurrent study has proposed a robust fusion model to define the type of identity\ndocuments accurately. The proposed approach is based on two different methods\nin which images are classified based on their visual features and text\nfeatures. A novel model based on statistics and regression has been proposed to\ncalculate the confidence level for the feature-based classifier. A fuzzy-mean\nfusion model has been proposed to combine the classifier results based on their\nconfidence score. The proposed approach has been implemented using Python and\nexperimentally validated on synthetic and real-world datasets. The performance\nof the proposed model is evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic\n(ROC) curve analysis.",

          "description": "The increasing level of marine plastic pollution poses severe threats to the\nmarine ecosystem and biodiversity. The present study attempted to explore the\nfull functionality of open Sentinel satellite data and ML models for detecting\nand classifying floating plastic debris in Mytilene (Greece), Limassol\n(Cyprus), Calabria (Italy), and Beirut (Lebanon). Two ML models, i.e. Support\nVector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) were utilized to carry out the\nclassification analysis. In-situ plastic location data was collected from the\ncontrol experiment conducted in Mytilene, Greece and Limassol, Cyprus, and the\nsame was considered for training the models. Both remote sensing bands and\nspectral indices were used for developing the ML models. A spectral signature\nprofile for plastic was created for discriminating the floating plastic from\nother marine debris. A newly developed index, kernel Normalized Difference\nVegetation Index (kNDVI), was incorporated into the modelling to examine its\ncontribution to model performances. Both SVM and RF were performed well in five\nmodels and test case combinations. Among the two ML models, the highest\nperformance was measured for the RF. The inclusion of kNDVI was found effective\nand increased the model performances, reflected by high balanced accuracy\nmeasured for model 2 (~80% to ~98 % for SVM and ~87% to ~97 % for RF). Using\nthe best-performed model, an automated floating plastic detection system was\ndeveloped and tested in Calabria and Beirut. For both sites, the trained model\nhad detected the floating plastic with ~99% accuracy. Among the six predictors,\nthe FDI was found the most important variable for detecting marine floating\nplastic. These findings collectively suggest that high-resolution remote\nsensing imagery and the automated ML models can be an effective alternative for\nthe cost-effective detection of marine floating plastic.",

          "description": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently received explosive popularity, but\ntheir enormous model sizes and training costs remain daunting. Conventional\npost-training pruning often incurs higher training budgets. In contrast, this\npaper aims to trim down both the training memory overhead and the inference\ncomplexity, without scarifying the achievable accuracy. We launch and report\nthe first-of-its-kind comprehensive exploration, on taking a unified approach\nof integrating sparsity in ViTs \"from end to end\". Specifically, instead of\ntraining full ViTs, we dynamically extract and train sparse subnetworks, while\nsticking to a fixed small parameter budget. Our approach jointly optimizes\nmodel parameters and explores connectivity throughout training, ending up with\none sparse network as the final output. The approach is seamlessly extended\nfrom unstructured to structured sparsity, the latter by considering to guide\nthe prune-and-grow of self-attention heads inside ViTs. For additional\nefficiency gains, we further co-explore data and architecture sparsity, by\nplugging in a novel learnable token selector to adaptively determine the\ncurrently most vital patches. Extensive results validate the effectiveness of\nour proposals on ImageNet with diverse ViT backbones. For instance, at 40%\nstructured sparsity, our sparsified DeiT-Base can achieve 0.42% accuracy gain,\nat 33.13% and 24.70% running time} savings, compared to its dense counterpart.\nPerhaps most surprisingly, we find that the proposed sparse (co-)training can\neven improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it, making sparsity a\ntantalizing \"free lunch\". For example, our sparsified DeiT-Small at 5%, 50%\nsparsity for (data, architecture), improves 0.28% top-1 accuracy and meanwhile\nenjoys 49.32% FLOPs and 4.40% running time savings.",

In\nreference to biomedical image analysis, the advances in image acquisition\nmodalities and high-throughput imaging experiments are creating new challenges.\nThis huge information ensemble could overwhelm the analytic capabilities needed\nby physicians in their daily decision-making tasks as well as by biologists\ninvestigating complex biochemical systems. In particular, quantitative imaging\nmethods convey scientifically and clinically relevant information in\nprediction, prognosis or treatment response assessment, by also considering\nradiomics approaches.

However, an essential problem remains\nunsolved: most of the methods require large computational cost and memory usage\nfor training. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating future\nprediction videos with less memory usage than the conventional methods. This is\na critical stepping stone in the path towards generating videos with high image\nquality, similar to that of generated images in the latest works in the field\nof image generation. We achieve high-efficiency by training our method in two\nstages: (1) image reconstruction to encode video frames into latent variables,\nand (2) latent variable prediction to generate the future sequence. Our method\nachieves an efficient compression of video into low-dimensional latent\nvariables by decomposing each frame according to its hierarchical structure.\nThat is, we consider that video can be separated into background and foreground\nobjects, and that each object holds time-varying and time-independent\ninformation independently.

When the detector succeeds, it can detect\nfaces that cannot be recognized, no matter how capable the recognition system.\nRecognizability, a latent variable, should therefore be factored into the\ndesign and implementation of face recognition systems. We propose a measure of\nrecognizability of a face image that leverages a key empirical observation: an\nembedding of face images, implemented by a deep neural network trained using\nmostly recognizable identities, induces a partition of the hypersphere whereby\nunrecognizable identities cluster together. This occurs regardless of the\nphenomenon that causes a face to be unrecognizable, it be optical or motion\nblur, partial occlusion, spatial quantization, poor illumination. Therefore, we\nuse the distance from such an \"unrecognizable identity\" as a measure of\nrecognizability, and incorporate it in the design of the over-all system. We\nshow that accounting for recognizability reduces error rate of single-image\nface recognition by 58% at FAR=1e-5 on the IJB-C Covariate Verification\nbenchmark, and reduces verification error rate by 24% at FAR=1e-5 in set-based\nrecognition on the IJB-C benchmark.",

To help human experts better find the AI algorithms'\nbiases, we study a new problem in this work -- for a classifier that predicts a\ntarget attribute of the input image, discover its unknown biased attribute.\n\nTo solve this challenging problem, we use a hyperplane in the generative\nmodel's latent space to represent an image attribute; thus, the original\nproblem is transformed to optimizing the hyperplane's normal vector and offset.\nWe propose a novel total-variation loss within this framework as the objective\nfunction and a new orthogonalization penalty as a constraint.

Extensive\nexperiments on both disentanglement datasets and real-world datasets show that\nour method can discover biased attributes and achieve better disentanglement\nw.r.t. target attributes.

The risks\ninvolved in such failures can be loss of profits, loss of time or even loss of\nlife in certain critical applications. In order to alleviate this issue,\nsimulators can be controlled in a fine-grained manner using interpretable\nparameters to explore the semantic image manifold. In this work, we propose a\nframework for learning how to test machine learning algorithms using simulators\nin an adversarial manner in order to find weaknesses in the model before\ndeploying it in critical scenarios. We apply this model in a face recognition\nscenario. We are the first to show that weaknesses of models trained on real\ndata can be discovered using simulated samples. Using our proposed method, we\ncan find adversarial synthetic faces that fool contemporary face recognition\nmodels. This demonstrates the fact that these models have weaknesses that are\nnot measured by commonly used validation datasets. We hypothesize that this\ntype of adversarial examples are not isolated, but usually lie in connected\ncomponents in the latent space of the simulator. We present a method to find\nthese adversarial regions as opposed to the typical adversarial points found in\nthe adversarial example literature.",

          "description": "Brain-inspired machine learning is gaining increasing consideration,\nparticularly in computer vision. Several studies investigated the inclusion of\ntop-down feedback connections in convolutional networks; however, it remains\nunclear how and when these connections are functionally helpful. Here we\naddress this question in the context of object recognition under noisy\nconditions. We consider deep convolutional networks (CNNs) as models of\nfeed-forward visual processing and implement Predictive Coding (PC) dynamics\nthrough feedback connections (predictive feedback) trained for reconstruction\nor classification of clean images. To directly assess the computational role of\npredictive feedback in various experimental situations, we optimize and\ninterpret the hyper-parameters controlling the network's recurrent dynamics.\nThat is, we let the optimization process determine whether top-down connections\nand predictive coding dynamics are functionally beneficial. Across different\nmodel depths and architectures (3-layer CNN, ResNet18, and EfficientNetB0) and\nagainst various types of noise (CIFAR100-C), we find that the network\nincreasingly relies on top-down predictions as the noise level increases; in\ndeeper networks, this effect is most prominent at lower layers. In addition,\nthe accuracy of the network implementing PC dynamics significantly increases\nover time-steps, compared to its equivalent forward network. All in all, our\nresults provide novel insights relevant to Neuroscience by confirming the\ncomputational role of feedback connections in sensory systems, and to Machine\nLearning by revealing how these can improve the robustness of current vision\nmodels.",

          "description": "Unsupervised pretraining has recently proven beneficial for computer vision\ntasks, including object detection. However, previous self-supervised approaches\nare not designed to handle a key aspect of detection: localizing objects. Here,\nwe present DETReg, an unsupervised pretraining approach for object DEtection\nwith TRansformers using Region priors. Motivated by the two tasks underlying\nobject detection: localization and categorization, we combine two complementary\nsignals for self-supervision. For an object localization signal, we use pseudo\nground truth object bounding boxes from an off-the-shelf unsupervised region\nproposal method, Selective Search, which does not require training data and can\ndetect objects at a high recall rate and very low precision. The categorization\nsignal comes from an object embedding loss that encourages invariant object\nrepresentations, from which the object category can be inferred. We show how to\ncombine these two signals to train the Deformable DETR detection architecture\nfrom large amounts of unlabeled data. DETReg improves the performance over\ncompetitive baselines and previous self-supervised methods on standard\nbenchmarks like MS COCO and PASCAL VOC. DETReg also outperforms previous\nsupervised and unsupervised baseline approaches on low-data regime when trained\nwith only 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% of the labeled data on MS COCO.

          "description": "While driving on highways, every driver tries to be aware of the behavior of\nsurrounding vehicles, including possible emergency braking, evasive maneuvers\ntrying to avoid obstacles, unexpected lane changes, or other emergencies that\ncould lead to an accident. In this paper, human's ability to predict lane\nchanges in highway scenarios is analyzed through the use of video sequences\nextracted from the PREVENTION dataset, a database focused on the development of\nresearch on vehicle intention and trajectory prediction. Thus, users had to\nindicate the moment at which they considered that a lane change maneuver was\ntaking place in a target vehicle, subsequently indicating its direction: left\nor right. The results retrieved have been carefully analyzed and compared to\nground truth labels, evaluating statistical models to understand whether humans\ncan actually predict. The study has revealed that most participants are unable\nto anticipate lane-change maneuvers, detecting them after they have started.\nThese results might serve as a baseline for AI's prediction ability evaluation,\ngrading if those systems can outperform human skills by analyzing hidden cues\nthat seem unnoticed, improving the detection time, and even anticipating\nmaneuvers in some cases.",

          "description": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have significantly advanced image\nsynthesis, however, the synthesis quality drops significantly given a limited\namount of training data. To improve the data efficiency of GAN training, prior\nwork typically employs data augmentation to mitigate the overfitting of the\ndiscriminator yet still learn the discriminator with a bi-classification (i.e.,\nreal vs. fake) task. In this work, we propose a data-efficient Instance\nGeneration (InsGen) method based on instance discrimination. Concretely,\nbesides differentiating the real domain from the fake domain, the discriminator\nis required to distinguish every individual image, no matter it comes from the\ntraining set or from the generator. In this way, the discriminator can benefit\nfrom the infinite synthesized samples for training, alleviating the overfitting\nproblem caused by insufficient training data. A noise perturbation strategy is\nfurther introduced to improve its discriminative power. Meanwhile, the learned\ninstance discrimination capability from the discriminator is in turn exploited\nto encourage the generator for diverse generation. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of datasets and\ntraining settings. Noticeably, on the setting of 2K training images from the\nFFHQ dataset, we outperform the state-of-the-art approach with 23.5% FID\nimprovement.",

To understand and better\nmeasure the generalization capabilities of VQA systems, we look at their\nrobustness to counterfactually augmented data. Our proposed augmentations are\ndesigned to make a focused intervention on a specific property of the question\nsuch that the answer changes. Using these augmentations, we propose a new\nrobustness measure, Robustness to Augmented Data (RAD), which measures the\nconsistency of model predictions between original and augmented examples.\nThrough extensive experimentation, we show that RAD, unlike classical accuracy\nmeasures, can quantify when state-of-the-art systems are not robust to\ncounterfactuals. We find substantial failure cases which reveal that current\nVQA systems are still brittle.

          "description": "The vicinal risk minimization (VRM) principle is an empirical risk\nminimization (ERM) variant that replaces Dirac masses with vicinal functions.\nThere is strong numerical and theoretical evidence showing that VRM outperforms\nERM in terms of generalization if appropriate vicinal functions are chosen.\nMixup Training (MT), a popular choice of vicinal distribution, improves the\ngeneralization performance of models by introducing globally linear behavior in\nbetween training examples. Apart from generalization, recent works have shown\nthat mixup trained models are relatively robust to input\nperturbations/corruptions and at the same time are calibrated better than their\nnon-mixup counterparts. In this work, we investigate the benefits of defining\nthese vicinal distributions like mixup in latent space of generative models\nrather than in input space itself. We propose a new approach - \\textit{VarMixup\n(Variational Mixup)} - to better sample mixup images by using the latent\nmanifold underlying the data. Our empirical studies on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nTiny-ImageNet demonstrate that models trained by performing mixup in the latent\nmanifold learned by VAEs are inherently more robust to various input\ncorruptions/perturbations, are significantly better calibrated, and exhibit\nmore local-linear loss landscapes.",

Since machine learning\nrelies on the statistics of training data as well, the above connection has\ninteresting implications when using perceptual distances (which mimic the\nbehavior of the human visual system) as a loss function. In this paper, we aim\nto unravel the non-trivial relationship between the probability distribution of\nthe data, perceptual distances, and unsupervised machine learning. To this end,\nwe show that perceptual sensitivity is correlated with the probability of an\nimage in its close neighborhood. We also explore the relation between distances\ninduced by autoencoders and the probability distribution of the data used for\ntraining them, as well as how these induced distances are correlated with human\nperception.

Whilst most\npolyps are benign, the number, size and the surface structure of the polyp are\ntightly linked to the risk of colon cancer. There exists a high missed\ndetection rate and incomplete removal of colon polyps due to the variable\nnature, difficulties to delineate the abnormality, high recurrence rates and\nthe anatomical topography of the colon. In the past, several methods have been\nbuilt to automate polyp detection and segmentation. However, the key issue of\nmost methods is that they have not been tested rigorously on a large\nmulti-center purpose-built dataset. Thus, these methods may not generalise to\ndifferent population datasets as they overfit to a specific population and\nendoscopic surveillance. To this extent, we have curated a dataset from 6\ndifferent centers incorporating more than 300 patients. The dataset includes\nboth single frame and sequence data with 3446 annotated polyp labels with\nprecise delineation of polyp boundaries verified by six senior\ngastroenterologists. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive detection\nand pixel-level segmentation dataset curated by a team of computational\nscientists and expert gastroenterologists. This dataset has been originated as\nthe part of the Endocv2021 challenge aimed at addressing generalisability in\npolyp detection and segmentation.

However, they fail to fully consider\nthe feature information at different resolutions and the receptive fields of\nthe networks are relatively limited, thereby compromising the performance. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a light Cascaded Selective Resolution Network\n(CSRNet) to improve the performance of real-time segmentation through multiple\ncontext information embedding and enhanced feature aggregation. The proposed\nnetwork builds a three-stage segmentation system, which integrates feature\ninformation from low resolution to high resolution and achieves feature\nrefinement progressively. CSRNet contains two critical modules: the Shorted\nPyramid Fusion Module (SPFM) and the Selective Resolution Module (SRM). The\nSPFM is a computationally efficient module to incorporate the global context\ninformation and significantly enlarge the receptive field at each stage. The\nSRM is designed to fuse multi-resolution feature maps with various receptive\nfields, which assigns soft channel attentions across the feature maps and helps\nto remedy the problem caused by multi-scale objects.

A deep ViT is composed of\nmultiple blocks, with a consistent architecture comprising of self-attention\nand feed-forward layers, where each block is capable of independently producing\na class token. Formulating an attack using only the last class token\n(conventional approach) does not directly leverage the discriminative\ninformation stored in the earlier tokens, leading to poor adversarial\ntransferability of ViTs. Using the compositional nature of ViT models, we\nenhance the transferability of existing attacks by introducing two novel\nstrategies specific to the architecture of ViT models. (i) Self-Ensemble: We\npropose a method to find multiple discriminative pathways by dissecting a\nsingle ViT model into an ensemble of networks. This allows explicitly utilizing\nclass-specific information at each ViT block. (ii) Token Refinement: We then\npropose to refine the tokens to further enhance the discriminative capacity at\neach block of ViT. Our token refinement systematically combines the class\ntokens with structural information preserved within the patch tokens. An\nadversarial attack, when applied to such refined tokens within the ensemble of\nclassifiers found in a single vision transformer, has significantly higher\ntransferability.",

          "description": "In reality, learning from multi-view multi-label data inevitably confronts\nthree challenges: missing labels, incomplete views, and non-aligned views.\nExisting methods mainly concern the first two and commonly need multiple\nassumptions to attack them, making even state-of-the-arts involve at least two\nexplicit hyper-parameters such that model selection is quite difficult. More\nroughly, they will fail in handling the third challenge, let alone addressing\nthe three jointly. In this paper, we aim at meeting these under the least\nassumption by building a concise yet effective model with just one\nhyper-parameter. To ease insufficiency of available labels, we exploit not only\nthe consensus of multiple views but also the global and local structures hidden\namong multiple labels. Specifically, we introduce an indicator matrix to tackle\nthe first two challenges in a regression form while aligning the same\nindividual labels and all labels of different views in a common label space to\nbattle the third challenge. In aligning, we characterize the global and local\nstructures of multiple labels to be high-rank and low-rank, respectively.\nSubsequently, an efficient algorithm with linear time complexity in the number\nof samples is established. Finally, even without view-alignment, our method\nsubstantially outperforms state-of-the-arts with view-alignment on five real\ndatasets.",

To do so, we propose a network that learns to\nestimate Temporal Similarity Matrices (TSMs) that model a fine-grained\nsimilarity pattern between pairs of videos (trimmed or untrimmed), and uses\nthem to generate Temporal Class Activation Maps (TCAMs) for seen or unseen\nclasses. The TCAMs serve as temporal attention mechanisms to extract\nvideo-level representations of untrimmed videos, and to temporally localize\nactions at test time. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose\na weakly-supervised, one/few-shot action localization network that can be\ntrained in an end-to-end fashion.

          "description": "Medical image segmentation is one of the important tasks of computer-aided\ndiagnosis in medical image analysis. Since most medical images have the\ncharacteristics of blurred boundaries and uneven intensity distribution,\nthrough existing segmentation methods, the discontinuity within the target area\nand the discontinuity of the target boundary are likely to lead to rough or\neven erroneous boundary delineation. In this paper, we propose a new iterative\nrefined interactive segmentation method for medical images based on agent\nreinforcement learning, which focuses on the problem of target segmentation\nboundaries. We model the dynamic process of drawing the target contour in a\ncertain order as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based on a deep reinforcement\nlearning method. In the dynamic process of continuous interaction between the\nagent and the image, the agent tracks the boundary point by point in order\nwithin a limited length range until the contour of the target is completely\ndrawn. In this process, the agent can quickly improve the segmentation\nperformance by exploring an interactive policy in the image. The method we\nproposed is simple and effective. At the same time, we evaluate our method on\nthe cardiac MRI scan data set. Experimental results show that our method has a\nbetter segmentation effect on the left ventricle in a small number of medical\nimage data sets, especially in terms of segmentation boundaries, this method is\nbetter than existing methods.

In this paper, we cast the\nregistration task as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) according to\nthe fact that regions affected by each control point overlap with each other.\nSpecifically, by partitioning the template image into several regions and\nmeasuring the similarity of each region independently, multiple objectives are\nbuilt and deformation estimation can thus be realized by solving the MOP with\noff-the-shelf multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). In addition, a\ncoarse-to-fine strategy is realized by image pyramid combined with control\npoint mesh subdivision. Specifically, the optimized candidate solutions of the\ncurrent image level are inherited by the next level, which increases the\nability to deal with large deformation. Also, a post-processing procedure is\nproposed to generate a single output utilizing the Pareto optimal solutions.\nComparative experiments on both synthetic and real-world images show the\neffectiveness and usefulness of our deformation estimation method.",

Within this paper, we first discuss the project goals\nbefore we present our traffic detection concept using mobile modular\nintelligent transport systems stations (ITS-Ss). We then explain the approaches\nfor data processing of sensor raw data to refined trajectories, data\ncommunication, and data validation.",

Existing models on multiturn conversational fashion image retrieval\nhave limitations, such as employing traditional models, and leading to\nineffective performance. We propose a novel framework that can effectively\nhandle conversational fashion image retrieval with multiturn natural language\nfeedback texts. One characteristic of the framework is that it searches for\ncandidate images based on exploitation of the encoded reference image and\nfeedback text information together with the conversation history. Furthermore,\nthe image fashion attribute information is leveraged via a mutual attention\nstrategy. Since there is no existing fashion dataset suitable for the multiturn\nsetting of our task, we derive a large-scale multiturn fashion dataset via\nadditional manual annotation efforts on an existing single-turn dataset.

Specifically, we first propose a Pyramid\nGroup Transformer (PGT) as the encoder for progressively learning hierarchical\nfeatures, while reducing the computation complexity of the standard visual\ntransformer(ViT). Then, we propose a Feature Pyramid Transformer (FPT) to fuse\nsemantic-level and spatial-level information from multiple levels of the PGT\nencoder for semantic image segmentation.

To this end, we propose\nAffinity Attention Graph Neural Network ($A^2$GNN). Following previous\npractices, we first generate pseudo semantic-aware seeds, which are then formed\ninto semantic graphs based on our newly proposed affinity Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN). Then the built graphs are input to our $A^2$GNN, in which an\naffinity attention layer is designed to acquire the short- and long- distance\ninformation from soft graph edges to accurately propagate semantic labels from\nthe confident seeds to the unlabeled pixels. However, to guarantee the\nprecision of the seeds, we only adopt a limited number of confident pixel seed\nlabels for $A^2$GNN, which may lead to insufficient supervision for training.\nTo alleviate this issue, we further introduce a new loss function and a\nconsistency-checking mechanism to leverage the bounding box constraint, so that\nmore reliable guidance can be included for the model optimization.

          "description": "Graph Neural Network (GNN) has been demonstrated its effectiveness in dealing\nwith non-Euclidean structural data. Both spatial-based and spectral-based GNNs\nare relying on adjacency matrix to guide message passing among neighbors during\nfeature aggregation. Recent works have mainly focused on powerful message\npassing modules, however, in this paper, we show that none of the message\npassing modules is necessary. Instead, we propose a pure\nmultilayer-perceptron-based framework, Graph-MLP with the supervision signal\nleveraging graph structure, which is sufficient for learning discriminative\nnode representation. In model-level, Graph-MLP only includes multi-layer\nperceptrons, activation function, and layer normalization. In the loss level,\nwe design a neighboring contrastive (NContrast) loss to bridge the gap between\nGNNs and MLPs by utilizing the adjacency information implicitly. This design\nallows our model to be lighter and more robust when facing large-scale graph\ndata and corrupted adjacency information. Extensive experiments prove that even\nwithout adjacency information in testing phase, our framework can still reach\ncomparable and even superior performance against the state-of-the-art models in\nthe graph node classification task.",

In particular, the control of drone\nswarms (the direction and formation) has more advantages compared to the\ncontrol of a drone. The visual imagery (VI) paradigm is that subjects visually\nimagine specific objects or scenes. Reduction of the variability among EEG\nsignals of subjects is essential for practical BCI-based systems. In this\nstudy, we proposed the subepoch-wise feature encoder (SEFE) to improve the\nperformances in the subject-independent tasks by using the VI dataset.

Then, we compare the\nusefulness of the features extracted by each architecture. We do so with a\nquick training keeping most of the architecture frozen.

We validate FEAR on Natsbench topology\nsearch space on three different datasets against competing baselines and show\nstrong ranking correlation especially compared to recently proposed zero-cost\nmethods. FEAR particularly excels at ranking high-performance architectures in\nthe search space. When used in the inner loop of discrete search algorithms\nlike random search, FEAR can cut down the search time by approximately 2.4X\nwithout losing accuracy. We additionally empirically study very recently\nproposed zero-cost measures for ranking and find that they breakdown in ranking\nperformance as training proceeds and also that data-agnostic ranking scores\nwhich ignore the dataset do not generalize across dissimilar datasets.",

We then propose a\ntree-structured generative model to learn complex scene representation, whose\nnodes and edges are naturally corresponding to the two types of knowledge\nrespectively.

          "description": "There is a growing interest in the community in making an embodied AI agent\nperform a complicated task while interacting with an environment following\nnatural language directives. Recent studies have tackled the problem using\nALFRED, a well-designed dataset for the task, but achieved only very low\naccuracy. This paper proposes a new method, which outperforms the previous\nmethods by a large margin. It is based on a combination of several new ideas.\nOne is a two-stage interpretation of the provided instructions. The method\nfirst selects and interprets an instruction without using visual information,\nyielding a tentative action sequence prediction. It then integrates the\nprediction with the visual information etc., yielding the final prediction of\nan action and an object. As the object's class to interact is identified in the\nfirst stage, it can accurately select the correct object from the input image.\nMoreover, our method considers multiple egocentric views of the environment and\nextracts essential information by applying hierarchical attention conditioned\non the current instruction. This contributes to the accurate prediction of\nactions for navigation. A preliminary version of the method won the ALFRED\nChallenge 2020. The current version achieves the unseen environment's success\nrate of 4.45% with a single view, which is further improved to 8.37% with\nmultiple views.",

          "description": "Few-shot learning methods offer pre-training techniques optimized for easier\nlater adaptation of the model to new classes (unseen during training) using one\nor a few examples. This adaptivity to unseen classes is especially important\nfor many practical applications where the pre-trained label space cannot remain\nfixed for effective use and the model needs to be \"specialized\" to support new\ncategories on the fly. One particularly interesting scenario, essentially\noverlooked by the few-shot literature, is Coarse-to-Fine Few-Shot (C2FS), where\nthe training classes (e.g. animals) are of much `coarser granularity' than the\ntarget (test) classes (e.g. breeds). A very practical example of C2FS is when\nthe target classes are sub-classes of the training classes. Intuitively, it is\nespecially challenging as (both regular and few-shot) supervised pre-training\ntends to learn to ignore intra-class variability which is essential for\nseparating sub-classes. In this paper, we introduce a novel 'Angular\nnormalization' module that allows to effectively combine supervised and\nself-supervised contrastive pre-training to approach the proposed C2FS task,\ndemonstrating significant gains in a broad study over multiple baselines and\ndatasets. We hope that this work will help to pave the way for future research\non this new, challenging, and very practical topic of C2FS classification.",

          "description": "Machine learning is vulnerable to a wide variety of attacks. It is now well\nunderstood that by changing the underlying data distribution, an adversary can\npoison the model trained with it or introduce backdoors. In this paper we\npresent a novel class of training-time attacks that require no changes to the\nunderlying dataset or model architecture, but instead only change the order in\nwhich data are supplied to the model. In particular, we find that the attacker\ncan either prevent the model from learning, or poison it to learn behaviours\nspecified by the attacker. Furthermore, we find that even a single\nadversarially-ordered epoch can be enough to slow down model learning, or even\nto reset all of the learning progress. Indeed, the attacks presented here are\nnot specific to the model or dataset, but rather target the stochastic nature\nof modern learning procedures. We extensively evaluate our attacks on computer\nvision and natural language benchmarks to find that the adversary can disrupt\nmodel training and even introduce backdoors.",

          "description": "In applied image segmentation tasks, the ability to provide numerous and\nprecise labels for training is paramount to the accuracy of the model at\ninference time. However, this overhead is often neglected, and recently\nproposed segmentation architectures rely heavily on the availability and\nfidelity of ground truth labels to achieve state-of-the-art accuracies. Failure\nto acknowledge the difficulty in creating adequate ground truths can lead to an\nover-reliance on pre-trained models or a lack of adoption in real-world\napplications. We introduce Points2Polygons (P2P), a model which makes use of\ncontextual metric learning techniques that directly addresses this problem.\nPoints2Polygons performs well against existing fully-supervised segmentation\nbaselines with limited training data, despite using lightweight segmentation\nmodels (U-Net with a ResNet18 backbone) and having access to only weak labels\nin the form of object centroids and no pre-training. We demonstrate this on\nseveral different small but non-trivial datasets.

          "description": "Dealing with severe class imbalance poses a major challenge for real-world\napplications, especially when the accurate classification and generalization of\nminority classes is of primary interest. In computer vision, learning from long\ntailed datasets is a recurring theme, especially for natural image datasets.\nWhile existing solutions mostly appeal to sampling or weighting adjustments to\nalleviate the pathological imbalance, or imposing inductive bias to prioritize\nnon-spurious associations, we take novel perspectives to promote sample\nefficiency and model generalization based on the invariance principles of\ncausality. Our proposal posits a meta-distributional scenario, where the data\ngenerating mechanism is invariant across the label-conditional feature\ndistributions. Such causal assumption enables efficient knowledge transfer from\nthe dominant classes to their under-represented counterparts, even if the\nrespective feature distributions show apparent disparities. This allows us to\nleverage a causal data inflation procedure to enlarge the representation of\nminority classes. Our development is orthogonal to the existing extreme\nclassification techniques thus can be seamlessly integrated. The utility of our\nproposal is validated with an extensive set of synthetic and real-world\ncomputer vision tasks against SOTA solutions.",

First, given ${n \\choose 2}$ fundamental matrices computed\nfor $n$ images, we provide a complete algebraic characterization in the form of\nconditions that are both necessary and sufficient to enabling the recovery of\ncamera matrices. These conditions are based on arranging the fundamental\nmatrices as blocks in a single matrix, called the $n$-view fundamental matrix,\nand characterizing this matrix in terms of the signs of its eigenvalues and\nrank structures. Secondly, we propose a concrete algorithm for projective\nstructure-from-motion that utilizes this characterization. Given a complete or\npartial collection of measured fundamental matrices, our method seeks camera\nmatrices that minimize a global algebraic error for the measured fundamental\nmatrices. In contrast to existing methods, our optimization, without any\ninitialization, produces a consistent set of fundamental matrices that\ncorresponds to a unique set of cameras (up to a choice of projective frame).\nOur experiments indicate that our method achieves state of the art performance\nin both accuracy and running time.",

          "description": "Our work focuses on unsupervised and generative methods that address the\nfollowing goals: (a) learning unsupervised generative representations that\ndiscover latent factors controlling image semantic attributes, (b) studying how\nthis ability to control attributes formally relates to the issue of latent\nfactor disentanglement, clarifying related but dissimilar concepts that had\nbeen confounded in the past, and (c) developing anomaly detection methods that\nleverage representations learned in (a). For (a), we propose a network\narchitecture that exploits the combination of multiscale generative models with\nmutual information (MI) maximization. For (b), we derive an analytical result\n(Lemma 1) that brings clarity to two related but distinct concepts: the ability\nof generative networks to control semantic attributes of images they generate,\nresulting from MI maximization, and the ability to disentangle latent space\nrepresentations, obtained via total correlation minimization. More\nspecifically, we demonstrate that maximizing semantic attribute control\nencourages disentanglement of latent factors. Using Lemma 1 and adopting MI in\nour loss function, we then show empirically that, for image generation tasks,\nthe proposed approach exhibits superior performance as measured in the quality\nand disentanglement trade space, when compared to other state of the art\nmethods, with quality assessed via the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and\ndisentanglement via mutual information gap. For (c), we design several systems\nfor anomaly detection exploiting representations learned in (a), and\ndemonstrate their performance benefits when compared to state-of-the-art\ngenerative and discriminative algorithms. The above contributions in\nrepresentation learning have potential applications in addressing other\nimportant problems in computer vision, such as bias and privacy in AI.",

          "description": "Zero-shot learning is a new paradigm to classify objects from classes that\nare not available at training time. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods have\nattracted considerable attention in recent years because of their ability to\nclassify unseen/novel class examples. Most of the existing approaches on ZSL\nworks when all the samples from seen classes are available to train the model,\nwhich does not suit real life. In this paper, we tackle this hindrance by\ndeveloping a generative replay-based continual ZSL (GRCZSL). The proposed\nmethod endows traditional ZSL to learn from streaming data and acquire new\nknowledge without forgetting the previous tasks' gained experience. We handle\ncatastrophic forgetting in GRCZSL by replaying the synthetic samples of seen\nclasses, which have appeared in the earlier tasks. These synthetic samples are\nsynthesized using the trained conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) over\nthe immediate past task. Moreover, we only require the current and immediate\nprevious VAE at any time for training and testing. The proposed GRZSL method is\ndeveloped for a single-head setting of continual learning, simulating a\nreal-world problem setting. In this setting, task identity is given during\ntraining but unavailable during testing. GRCZSL performance is evaluated on\nfive benchmark datasets for the generalized setup of ZSL with fixed and dynamic\n(incremental class) settings of continual learning. The existing class setting\npresented recently in the literature is not suitable for a class-incremental\nsetting. Therefore, this paper proposes a new setting to address this issue.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms\nthe baseline and the state-of-the-art method and makes it more suitable for\nreal-world applications.",

          "description": "Pruning is a model compression method that removes redundant parameters in\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) while maintaining accuracy. Most available filter\npruning methods require complex treatments such as iterative pruning, features\nstatistics/ranking, or additional optimization designs in the training process.\nIn this paper, we propose a simple and effective regularization strategy from a\nnew perspective of evolution of features, which we call feature flow\nregularization (FFR), for improving structured sparsity and filter pruning in\nDNNs. Specifically, FFR imposes controls on the gradient and curvature of\nfeature flow along the neural network, which implicitly increases the sparsity\nof the parameters. The principle behind FFR is that coherent and smooth\nevolution of features will lead to an efficient network that avoids redundant\nparameters. The high structured sparsity obtained from FFR enables us to prune\nfilters effectively. Experiments with VGGNets, ResNets on CIFAR-10/100, and\nTiny ImageNet datasets demonstrate that FFR can significantly improve both\nunstructured and structured sparsity. Our pruning results in terms of reduction\nof parameters and FLOPs are comparable to or even better than those of\nstate-of-the-art pruning methods.",

          "description": "Blind image deblurring is an important yet very challenging problem in\nlow-level vision. Traditional optimization based methods generally formulate\nthis task as a maximum-a-posteriori estimation or variational inference\nproblem, whose performance highly relies on the handcraft priors for both the\nlatent image and the blur kernel. In contrast, recent deep learning methods\ngenerally learn, from a large collection of training images, deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) directly mapping the blurry image to the clean one or to the\nblur kernel, paying less attention to the physical degradation process of the\nblurry image. In this paper, we present a deep variational Bayesian framework\nfor blind image deblurring. Under this framework, the posterior of the latent\nclean image and blur kernel can be jointly estimated in an amortized inference\nfashion with DNNs, and the involved inference DNNs can be trained by fully\nconsidering the physical blur model, together with the supervision of data\ndriven priors for the clean image and blur kernel, which is naturally led to by\nthe evidence lower bound objective. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to\nsubstantiate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that\nit can not only achieve a promising performance with relatively simple\nnetworks, but also enhance the performance of existing DNNs for deblurring.",

Prevailing\ndeep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) usually use high-level features for\nidentifying pedestrian. However, some essential spatial information resided in\nlow-level features such as shape, texture and color will be lost when learning\nthe high-level features, due to extensive padding and pooling operations in the\ntraining stage. In addition, most existing person re-ID methods are mainly\nbased on hand-craft bounding boxes where images are precisely aligned. It is\nunrealistic in practical applications, since the exploited object detection\nalgorithms often produce inaccurate bounding boxes. This will inevitably\ndegrade the performance of existing algorithms. To address these problems, we\nput forward a novel person re-ID model that fuses high- and low-level\nembeddings to reduce the information loss caused in learning high-level\nfeatures. Then we divide the fused embedding into several parts and reconnect\nthem to obtain the global feature and more significant local features, so as to\nalleviate the affect caused by the inaccurate bounding boxes. In addition, we\nalso introduce the spatial and channel attention mechanisms in our model, which\naims to mine more discriminative features related to the target. Finally, we\nreconstruct the feature extractor to ensure that our model can obtain more\nricher and robust features.

          "description": "How to extract effective expression representations that invariant to the\nidentity-specific attributes is a long-lasting problem for facial expression\nrecognition (FER). Most of the previous methods process the RGB images of a\nsequence, while we argue that the off-the-shelf and valuable expression-related\nmuscle movement is already embedded in the compression format. In this paper,\nwe target to explore the inter-subject variations eliminated facial expression\nrepresentation in the compressed video domain. In the up to two orders of\nmagnitude compressed domain, we can explicitly infer the expression from the\nresidual frames and possibly extract identity factors from the I frame with a\npre-trained face recognition network. By enforcing the marginal independence of\nthem, the expression feature is expected to be purer for the expression and be\nrobust to identity shifts. Specifically, we propose a novel collaborative\nmin-min game for mutual information (MI) minimization in latent space. We do\nnot need the identity label or multiple expression samples from the same person\nfor identity elimination. Moreover, when the apex frame is annotated in the\ndataset, the complementary constraint can be further added to regularize the\nfeature-level game. In testing, only the compressed residual frames are\nrequired to achieve expression prediction. Our solution can achieve comparable\nor better performance than the recent decoded image-based methods on the\ntypical FER benchmarks with about 3 times faster inference.",

Conv-MPN is specifically designed for cases where nodes of a\ngraph have explicit spatial embedding. In our problem, nodes correspond to\nbuilding edges in an image. Conv-MPN is different from MPN in that 1) the\nfeature associated with a node is represented as a feature volume instead of a\n1D vector; and 2) convolutions encode messages instead of fully connected\nlayers. Conv-MPN learns to select a true subset of nodes (i.e., building edges)\nto reconstruct a building planar graph.

          "description": "Despite the achievements of large-scale multimodal pre-training approaches,\ncross-modal retrieval, e.g., image-text retrieval, remains a challenging task.\nTo bridge the semantic gap between the two modalities, previous studies mainly\nfocus on word-region alignment at the object level, lacking the matching\nbetween the linguistic relation among the words and the visual relation among\nthe regions. The neglect of such relation consistency impairs the\ncontextualized representation of image-text pairs and hinders the model\nperformance and the interpretability. In this paper, we first propose a novel\nmetric, Intra-modal Self-attention Distance (ISD), to quantify the relation\nconsistency by measuring the semantic distance between linguistic and visual\nrelations. In response, we present Inter-modal Alignment on Intra-modal\nSelf-attentions (IAIS), a regularized training method to optimize the ISD and\ncalibrate intra-modal self-attentions from the two modalities mutually via\ninter-modal alignment. The IAIS regularizer boosts the performance of\nprevailing models on Flickr30k and MS COCO datasets by a considerable margin,\nwhich demonstrates the superiority of our approach.",

We also introduce a\nfamily of multiplication-free operators from the basic 2$\\times$2 Hadamard\ntransform to implement $3\\times 3$ depthwise separable convolution layers.\nUsing these two types of layers, we replace the bottleneck layers in\nMobileNet-V2 to reduce the network's number of parameters with a slight loss in\naccuracy. For example, by replacing the final third bottleneck layers, we\nreduce the number of parameters from 2.270M to 540K. This reduces the accuracy\nfrom 95.21\\% to 92.98\\% on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

We argue that such interaction is not fulfilled since the model can\nbarely construct region-level relationships given partial observations, which\nis contrary to the description logic of natural language/referring expressions.\nIn fact, people usually describe a target object using relations with other\nobjects, which may not be easily understood without seeing the whole video.

In this paper, we propose a fast approach to blind\npansharpening and achieve state-of-the-art image reconstruction quality.\nTypical blind pansharpening algorithms are often computationally intensive\nsince the blur kernel and the target HRMS image are often computed using\niterative solvers and in an alternating fashion. To achieve fast blind\npansharpening, we decouple the solution of the blur kernel and of the HRMS\nimage. First, we estimate the blur kernel by computing the kernel coefficients\nwith minimum total generalized variation that blur a downsampled version of the\nPAN image to approximate a linear combination of the LRMS image channels. Then,\nwe estimate each channel of the HRMS image using local Laplacian prior to\nregularize the relationship between each HRMS channel and the PAN image.\nSolving the HRMS image is accelerated by both parallelizing across the channels\nand by fast numerical algorithms for each channel. Due to the fast scheme and\nthe powerful priors we used on the blur kernel coefficients (total generalized\nvariation) and on the cross-channel relationship (local Laplacian prior),\nnumerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms\nstate-of-the-art model-based counterparts in terms of both computational time\nand reconstruction quality of the HRMS images.",

The full potential and boundaries\nof this attack method are not yet fully understood. In this research, the\nsuccessful and unsuccessful attacks are studied in more detail to illustrate\nthe working mechanisms of a one-pixel attack created using differential\nevolution. The data comes from our earlier studies where we applied the attack\nagainst medical imaging. We used a real breast cancer tissue dataset and a real\nclassifier as the attack target. This research presents ways to analyze\nchromatic and spatial distributions of one-pixel attacks. In addition, we\npresent one-pixel attack confidence maps to illustrate the behavior of the\ntarget classifier. We show that the more effective attacks change the color of\nthe pixel more, and that the successful attacks are situated at the center of\nthe images. This kind of analysis is not only useful for understanding the\nbehavior of the attack but also the qualities of the classifying neural\nnetwork.",

          "description": "Transformers have become one of the dominant architectures in deep learning,\nparticularly as a powerful alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nin computer vision. However, Transformer training and inference in previous\nworks can be prohibitively expensive due to the quadratic complexity of\nself-attention over a long sequence of representations, especially for\nhigh-resolution dense prediction tasks. To this end, we present a novel Less\nattention vIsion Transformer (LIT), building upon the fact that convolutions,\nfully-connected (FC) layers, and self-attentions have almost equivalent\nmathematical expressions for processing image patch sequences. Specifically, we\npropose a hierarchical Transformer where we use pure multi-layer perceptrons\n(MLPs) to encode rich local patterns in the early stages while applying\nself-attention modules to capture longer dependencies in deeper layers.\nMoreover, we further propose a learned deformable token merging module to\nadaptively fuse informative patches in a non-uniform manner. The proposed LIT\nachieves promising performance on image recognition tasks, including image\nclassification, object detection and instance segmentation, serving as a strong\nbackbone for many vision tasks.

It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the\ninterpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the\ntesting resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders.\nThe proposed MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus\ncombining both local attention and global attention to render powerful\nrepresentations. We show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to\nefficient segmentation on Transformers. We scale our approach up to obtain a\nseries of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly\nbetter performance and efficiency than previous counterparts. For example,\nSegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3% mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5x\nsmaller and 2.2% better than the previous best method.

It is often realized through\noptimizing a meta-model with the evaluation loss of a series of task-specific\nsolvers. Most existing algorithms sample non-overlapping $\\mathit{support}$\nsets and $\\mathit{query}$ sets to train and evaluate the solvers respectively\ndue to simplicity ($\\mathcal{S}/\\mathcal{Q}$ protocol). However, another\nevaluation method that assesses the discrepancy between the solver and a target\nmodel is short of research ($\\mathcal{S}/\\mathcal{T}$ protocol).\n$\\mathcal{S}/\\mathcal{T}$ protocol has unique advantages such as offering more\ninformative supervision, but it is computationally expensive. This paper looks\ninto this special evaluation method and takes a step towards putting it into\npractice. We find that with a small ratio of tasks armed with target models,\nclassic meta-learning algorithms can be improved a lot without consuming many\nresources. Furthermore, we empirically verify the effectiveness of\n$\\mathcal{S}/\\mathcal{T}$ protocol in a typical application of meta-learning,\n$\\mathit{i.e.}$, few-shot learning.

          "description": "In this work, we aim to address the 3D scene stylization problem - generating\nstylized images of the scene at arbitrary novel view angles. A straightforward\nsolution is to combine existing novel view synthesis and image/video style\ntransfer approaches, which often leads to blurry results or inconsistent\nappearance. Inspired by the high quality results of the neural radiance fields\n(NeRF) method, we propose a joint framework to directly render novel views with\nthe desired style. Our framework consists of two components: an implicit\nrepresentation of the 3D scene with the neural radiance field model, and a\nhypernetwork to transfer the style information into the scene representation.\nIn particular, our implicit representation model disentangles the scene into\nthe geometry and appearance branches, and the hypernetwork learns to predict\nthe parameters of the appearance branch from the reference style image. To\nalleviate the training difficulties and memory burden, we propose a two-stage\ntraining procedure and a patch sub-sampling approach to optimize the style and\ncontent losses with the neural radiance field model. After optimization, our\nmodel is able to render consistent novel views at arbitrary view angles with\narbitrary style. Both quantitative evaluation and human subject study have\ndemonstrated that the proposed method generates faithful stylization results\nwith consistent appearance across different views.",

Firstly,\nthe SE block is introduced to adaptively extract image features after each\nconvolution in the U-Net encoder, while suppressing irrelevant regions, and\nhighlighting features of specific segmentation task; Secondly, ASPP was\nemployed to replace the transition layer and the output layer, and acquire\nmulti-scale image information via different receptive fields. Thirdly, to\nalleviate the degradation problem, the traditional convolution block was\nreplaced with the residual block and thus prompt the network to gain accuracy\nfrom considerably increased depth.\n\nResults: In the LiTS17 experiment, the mean values of Dice, VOE, RVD, ASD and\nMSD were 95.71, 9.52, -0.84, 1.54 and 29.14, respectively.

While CNNs have been carefully studied with respect to adversarial\nattacks, the same cannot be said of Vision Transformers.

          "description": "Semantic Scene Completion aims at reconstructing a complete 3D scene with\nprecise voxel-wise semantics from a single-view depth or RGBD image. It is a\ncrucial but challenging problem for indoor scene understanding. In this work,\nwe present a novel framework named Scene-Instance-Scene Network\n(\\textit{SISNet}), which takes advantages of both instance and scene level\nsemantic information. Our method is capable of inferring fine-grained shape\ndetails as well as nearby objects whose semantic categories are easily\nmixed-up. The key insight is that we decouple the instances from a coarsely\ncompleted semantic scene instead of a raw input image to guide the\nreconstruction of instances and the overall scene. SISNet conducts iterative\nscene-to-instance (SI) and instance-to-scene (IS) semantic completion.\nSpecifically, the SI is able to encode objects' surrounding context for\neffectively decoupling instances from the scene and each instance could be\nvoxelized into higher resolution to capture finer details. With IS,\nfine-grained instance information can be integrated back into the 3D scene and\nthus leads to more accurate semantic scene completion. Utilizing such an\niterative mechanism, the scene and instance completion benefits each other to\nachieve higher completion accuracy. Extensively experiments show that our\nproposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both real\nNYU, NYUCAD and synthetic SUNCG-RGBD datasets.

In this work, we propose a unified conditional disentanglement\nframework to synthesize any arbitrary modality from an input modality. Our\nframework hinges on a cycle-constrained conditional adversarial training\napproach, where it can extract a modality-invariant anatomical feature with a\nmodality-agnostic encoder and generate a target modality with a conditioned\ndecoder. We validate our framework on four MRI modalities, including\nT1-weighted, T1 contrast enhanced, T2-weighted, and FLAIR MRI, from the\nBraTS'18 database, showing superior performance on synthesis quality over the\ncomparison methods. In addition, we report results from experiments on a tumor\nsegmentation task carried out with synthesized data.",

However, there has been implicit common knowledge that training STR\nmodels on real data is nearly impossible because real data is insufficient. We\nconsider that this common knowledge has obstructed the study of STR with fewer\nlabels. In this work, we would like to reactivate STR with fewer labels by\ndisproving the common knowledge.

          "description": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often of sophisticated design\nwith numerous convolutional layers and learnable parameters for the accuracy\nreason. To alleviate the expensive costs of deploying them on mobile devices,\nrecent works have made huge efforts for excavating redundancy in pre-defined\narchitectures. Nevertheless, the redundancy on the input resolution of modern\nCNNs has not been fully investigated, i.e., the resolution of input image is\nfixed. In this paper, we observe that the smallest resolution for accurately\npredicting the given image is different using the same neural network. To this\nend, we propose a novel dynamic-resolution network (DRNet) in which the\nresolution is determined dynamically based on each input sample. Thus, a\nresolution predictor with negligible computational costs is explored and\noptimized jointly with the desired network. In practice, the predictor learns\nthe smallest resolution that can retain and even exceed the original\nrecognition accuracy for each image. During the inference, each input image\nwill be resized to its predicted resolution for minimizing the overall\ncomputation burden. We then conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark\nnetworks and datasets. The results show that our DRNet can be embedded in any\noff-the-shelf network architecture to obtain a considerable reduction in\ncomputational complexity. For instance, DRNet achieves similar performance with\nan about 34% computation reduction, while gains 1.4% accuracy increase with 10%\ncomputation reduction compared to the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet.",

          "description": "Visual search is a ubiquitous and often challenging daily task, exemplified\nby looking for the car keys at home or a friend in a crowd. An intriguing\nproperty of some classical search tasks is an asymmetry such that finding a\ntarget A among distractors B can be easier than finding B among A. To elucidate\nthe mechanisms responsible for asymmetry in visual search, we propose a\ncomputational model that takes a target and a search image as inputs and\nproduces a sequence of eye movements until the target is found. The model\nintegrates eccentricity-dependent visual recognition with target-dependent\ntop-down cues. We compared the model against human behavior in six paradigmatic\nsearch tasks that show asymmetry in humans. Without prior exposure to the\nstimuli or task-specific training, the model provides a plausible mechanism for\nsearch asymmetry. We hypothesized that the polarity of search asymmetry arises\nfrom experience with the natural environment. We tested this hypothesis by\ntraining the model on an augmented version of ImageNet where the biases of\nnatural images were either removed or reversed. The polarity of search\nasymmetry disappeared or was altered depending on the training protocol. This\nstudy highlights how classical perceptual properties can emerge in neural\nnetwork models, without the need for task-specific training, but rather as a\nconsequence of the statistical properties of the developmental diet fed to the\nmodel.

We first\nidentify the effective patches in the last layer and then use them to guide the\npatch selection process of previous layers. For each layer, the impact of a\npatch on the final output feature is approximated and patches with less impact\nwill be removed. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nthe proposed method can significantly reduce the computational costs of vision\ntransformers without affecting their performances. For example, over 45% FLOPs\nof the ViT-Ti model can be reduced with only 0.2% top-1 accuracy drop on the\nImageNet dataset.",

          "description": "Intelligible speech is produced by creating varying internal local muscle\ngroupings -- i.e., functional units -- that are generated in a systematic and\ncoordinated manner. There are two major challenges in characterizing and\nanalyzing functional units.~First, due to the complex and convoluted nature of\ntongue structure and function, it is of great importance to develop a method\nthat can accurately decode complex muscle coordination patterns during speech.\nSecond, it is challenging to keep identified functional units across subjects\ncomparable due to their substantial variability. In this work, to address these\nchallenges, we develop a new deep learning framework to identify common and\nsubject-specific functional units of tongue motion during speech.~Our framework\nhinges on joint deep graph-regularized sparse non-negative matrix factorization\n(NMF) using motion quantities derived from displacements by tagged Magnetic\nResonance Imaging. More specifically, we transform NMF with sparse and graph\nregularizations into modular architectures akin to deep neural networks by\nmeans of unfolding the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm to learn\ninterpretable building blocks and associated weighting map. We then apply\nspectral clustering to common and subject-specific weighting maps from which we\njointly determine the common and subject-specific functional units. Experiments\ncarried out with simulated datasets show that the proposed method achieved on\npar or better clustering performance over the comparison methods. Experiments\ncarried out with in vivo tongue motion data show that the proposed method can\ndetermine the common and subject-specific functional units with increased\ninterpretability and decreased size variability.",

Especially, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing system,\nequipped with a visual tracking approach, has been widely used in aviation,\nnavigation, agriculture,transportation, and public security, etc. As is\nmentioned above, the UAV-based aerial tracking platform has been gradually\ndeveloped from research to practical application stage, reaching one of the\nmain aerial remote sensing technologies in the future. However, due to the\nreal-world onerous situations, e.g., harsh external challenges, the vibration\nof the UAV mechanical structure (especially under strong wind conditions), the\nmaneuvering flight in complex environment, and the limited computation\nresources onboard, accuracy, robustness, and high efficiency are all crucial\nfor the onboard tracking methods. Recently, the discriminative correlation\nfilter (DCF)-based trackers have stood out for their high computational\nefficiency and appealing robustness on a single CPU, and have flourished in the\nUAV visual tracking community. In this work, the basic framework of the\nDCF-based trackers is firstly generalized, based on which, 23 state-of-the-art\nDCF-based trackers are orderly summarized according to their innovations for\nsolving various issues. Besides, exhaustive and quantitative experiments have\nbeen extended on various prevailing UAV tracking benchmarks, i.e., UAV123,\nUAV123@10fps, UAV20L, UAVDT, DTB70, and VisDrone2019-SOT, which contain 371,903\nframes in total.

In this work, we explore the idea of instance\ncontrastive learning in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and propose a\nnovel Category Contrast technique (CaCo) that introduces semantic priors on top\nof instance discrimination for visual UDA tasks. By considering instance\ncontrastive learning as a dictionary look-up operation, we construct a\nsemantics-aware dictionary with samples from both source and target domains\nwhere each target sample is assigned a (pseudo) category label based on the\ncategory priors of source samples. This allows category contrastive learning\n(between target queries and the category-level dictionary) for\ncategory-discriminative yet domain-invariant feature representations: samples\nof the same category (from either source or target domain) are pulled closer\nwhile those of different categories are pushed apart simultaneously. Extensive\nUDA experiments in multiple visual tasks ($e.g.$, segmentation, classification\nand detection) show that the simple implementation of CaCo achieves superior\nperformance as compared with the highly-optimized state-of-the-art methods.\nAnalytically and empirically, the experiments also demonstrate that CaCo is\ncomplementary to existing UDA methods and generalizable to other learning\nsetups such as semi-supervised learning, unsupervised model adaptation, etc.",

In recent years, a new class of CNNs, recurrent\nconvolution neural network (RCNN), inspired by abundant recurrent connections\nin the visual systems of animals, was proposed. The critical element of RCNN is\nthe recurrent convolutional layer (RCL), which incorporates recurrent\nconnections between neurons in the standard convolutional layer. With\nincreasing number of recurrent computations, the receptive fields (RFs) of\nneurons in RCL expand unboundedly, which is inconsistent with biological facts.\nWe propose to modulate the RFs of neurons by introducing gates to the recurrent\nconnections. The gates control the amount of context information inputting to\nthe neurons and the neurons' RFs therefore become adaptive. The resulting layer\nis called gated recurrent convolution layer (GRCL). Multiple GRCLs constitute a\ndeep model called gated RCNN (GRCNN). The GRCNN was evaluated on several\ncomputer vision tasks including object recognition, scene text recognition and\nobject detection, and obtained much better results than the RCNN. In addition,\nwhen combined with other adaptive RF techniques, the GRCNN demonstrated\ncompetitive performance to the state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets\nfor these tasks.

          "description": "The recent breakthrough achieved by contrastive learning accelerates the pace\nfor deploying unsupervised training on real-world data applications. However,\nunlabeled data in reality is commonly imbalanced and shows a long-tail\ndistribution, and it is unclear how robustly the latest contrastive learning\nmethods could perform in the practical scenario. This paper proposes to\nexplicitly tackle this challenge, via a principled framework called\nSelf-Damaging Contrastive Learning (SDCLR), to automatically balance the\nrepresentation learning without knowing the classes. Our main inspiration is\ndrawn from the recent finding that deep models have difficult-to-memorize\nsamples, and those may be exposed through network pruning. It is further\nnatural to hypothesize that long-tail samples are also tougher for the model to\nlearn well due to insufficient examples. Hence, the key innovation in SDCLR is\nto create a dynamic self-competitor model to contrast with the target model,\nwhich is a pruned version of the latter. During training, contrasting the two\nmodels will lead to adaptive online mining of the most easily forgotten samples\nfor the current target model, and implicitly emphasize them more in the\ncontrastive loss. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and imbalance\nsettings show that SDCLR significantly improves not only overall accuracies but\nalso balancedness, in terms of linear evaluation on the full-shot and few-shot\nsettings.

          "description": "Recent advances in brain clearing and imaging have made it possible to image\nentire mammalian brains at sub-micron resolution. These images offer the\npotential to assemble brain-wide atlases of projection neuron morphology, but\nmanual neuron reconstruction remains a bottleneck. Here we present a method\ninspired by hidden Markov modeling and appearance modeling of fluorescent\nneuron images that can automatically trace neuronal processes. Our method\nleverages dynamic programming to scale to terabyte sized image data and can be\napplied to images with one or more neurons. We applied our algorithm to the\noutput of image segmentation models where false negatives severed neuronal\nprocesses, and showed that it can follow axons in the presence of noise or\nnearby neurons. Our method has the potential to be integrated into a semi or\nfully automated reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, it creates a framework\nthrough which users can intervene with hard constraints to, for example, rule\nout certain reconstructions, or assign axons to particular cell bodies.",

          "description": "Lobar cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and localized non-hemorrhage iron deposits\nin the basal ganglia have been associated with brain aging, vascular disease\nand neurodegenerative disorders. Particularly, CMBs are small lesions and\nrequire multiple neuroimaging modalities for accurate detection. Quantitative\nsusceptibility mapping (QSM) derived from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) is necessary to differentiate between iron content and mineralization. We\nset out to develop a deep learning-based segmentation method suitable for\nsegmenting both CMBs and iron deposits. We included a convenience sample of 24\nparticipants from the MESA cohort and used T2-weighted images, susceptibility\nweighted imaging (SWI), and QSM to segment the two types of lesions. We\ndeveloped a protocol for simultaneous manual annotation of CMBs and\nnon-hemorrhage iron deposits in the basal ganglia. This manual annotation was\nthen used to train a deep convolution neural network (CNN). Specifically, we\nadapted the U-Net model with a higher number of resolution layers to be able to\ndetect small lesions such as CMBs from standard resolution MRI. We tested\ndifferent combinations of the three modalities to determine the most\ninformative data sources for the detection tasks. In the detection of CMBs\nusing single class and multiclass models, we achieved an average sensitivity\nand precision of between 0.84-0.88 and 0.40-0.59, respectively. The same\nframework detected non-hemorrhage iron deposits with an average sensitivity and\nprecision of about 0.75-0.81 and 0.62-0.75, respectively. Our results showed\nthat deep learning could automate the detection of small vessel disease lesions\nand including multimodal MR data (particularly QSM) can improve the detection\nof CMB and non-hemorrhage iron deposits with sensitivity and precision that is\ncompatible with use in large-scale research studies.",

This work extends the earlier ER\ninvestigations, which focused on either group-level ER on single images or\nwithin a video, by fully investigating group-level expression recognition on\ncrowd videos. In this paper, we propose an effective deep feature level fusion\nmechanism to model the spatial-temporal information in the crowd videos. In our\napproach, the fusing process is performed on the deep feature domain by a\ngenerative probabilistic model, Non-Volume Preserving Fusion (NVPF), that\nmodels spatial information relationships. Furthermore, we extend our proposed\nspatial NVPF approach to the spatial-temporal NVPF approach to learn the\ntemporal information between frames. To demonstrate the robustness and\neffectiveness of each component in the proposed approach, three experiments\nwere conducted: (i) evaluation on AffectNet database to benchmark the proposed\nEmoNet for recognizing facial expression; (ii) evaluation on EmotiW2018 to\nbenchmark the proposed deep feature level fusion mechanism NVPF; and, (iii)\nexamine the proposed TNVPF on an innovative Group-level Emotion on Crowd Videos\n(GECV) dataset composed of 627 videos collected from publicly available\nsources.

          "description": "The inductive bias of a neural network is largely determined by the\narchitecture and the training algorithm. To achieve good generalization, how to\neffectively train a neural network is of great importance. We propose a novel\northogonal over-parameterized training (OPT) framework that can provably\nminimize the hyperspherical energy which characterizes the diversity of neurons\non a hypersphere. By maintaining the minimum hyperspherical energy during\ntraining, OPT can greatly improve the empirical generalization. Specifically,\nOPT fixes the randomly initialized weights of the neurons and learns an\northogonal transformation that applies to these neurons. We consider multiple\nways to learn such an orthogonal transformation, including unrolling\northogonalization algorithms, applying orthogonal parameterization, and\ndesigning orthogonality-preserving gradient descent. For better scalability, we\npropose the stochastic OPT which performs orthogonal transformation\nstochastically for partial dimensions of neurons. Interestingly, OPT reveals\nthat learning a proper coordinate system for neurons is crucial to\ngeneralization. We provide some insights on why OPT yields better\ngeneralization. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of OPT over the\nstandard training.",

After demonstrating the manipulation of\naction classification of single videos, we generalize the procedure to make\nuniversal adversarial perturbation, achieving high fooling ratio. In addition,\nwe generalize the universal perturbation and produce a temporal-invariant\nperturbation, which can be applied to the video without synchronizing the\nperturbation to the input.

          "description": "Most modern multiple object tracking (MOT) systems follow the\ntracking-by-detection paradigm, consisting of a detector followed by a method\nfor associating detections into tracks. There is a long history in tracking of\ncombining motion and appearance features to provide robustness to occlusions\nand other challenges, but typically this comes with the trade-off of a more\ncomplex and slower implementation. Recent successes on popular 2D tracking\nbenchmarks indicate that top-scores can be achieved using a state-of-the-art\ndetector and relatively simple associations relying on single-frame spatial\noffsets -- notably outperforming contemporary methods that leverage learned\nappearance features to help re-identify lost tracks. In this paper, we propose\nan efficient joint detection and tracking model named DEFT, or \"Detection\nEmbeddings for Tracking.\" Our approach relies on an appearance-based object\nmatching network jointly-learned with an underlying object detection network.\nAn LSTM is also added to capture motion constraints. DEFT has comparable\naccuracy and speed to the top methods on 2D online tracking leaderboards while\nhaving significant advantages in robustness when applied to more challenging\ntracking data.

          "description": "Most existing lightweight RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) models are\nbased on two-stream structure or single-stream structure. The former one first\nuses two sub-networks to extract unimodal features from RGB and depth images,\nrespectively, and then fuses them for SOD. While, the latter one directly\nextracts multi-modal features from the input RGB-D images and then focuses on\nexploiting cross-level complementary information. However, two-stream structure\nbased models inevitably require more parameters and single-stream structure\nbased ones cannot well exploit the cross-modal complementary information since\nthey ignore the modality difference. To address these issues, we propose to\nemploy the middle-level fusion structure for designing lightweight RGB-D SOD\nmodel in this paper, which first employs two sub-networks to extract low- and\nmiddle-level unimodal features, respectively, and then fuses those extracted\nmiddle-level unimodal features for extracting corresponding high-level\nmulti-modal features in the subsequent sub-network. Different from existing\nmodels, this structure can effectively exploit the cross-modal complementary\ninformation and significantly reduce the network's parameters, simultaneously.\nTherefore, a novel lightweight SOD model is designed, which contains a\ninformation-aware multi-modal feature fusion (IMFF) module for effectively\ncapturing the cross-modal complementary information and a lightweight\nfeature-level and decision-level feature fusion (LFDF) module for aggregating\nthe feature-level and the decision-level saliency information in different\nstages with less parameters.

Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a new\narchitecture that adopts the pyramid structure and employ a novel\nregional-to-local attention rather than global self-attention in vision\ntransformers. More specifically, our model first generates regional tokens and\nlocal tokens from an image with different patch sizes, where each regional\ntoken is associated with a set of local tokens based on the spatial location.\nThe regional-to-local attention includes two steps: first, the regional\nself-attention extract global information among all regional tokens and then\nthe local self-attention exchanges the information among one regional token and\nthe associated local tokens via self-attention. Therefore, even though local\nself-attention confines the scope in a local region but it can still receive\nglobal information.

          "description": "Skin lesion segmentation is an important step for automatic melanoma\ndiagnosis. Due to the non-negligible diversity of lesions from different\npatients, extracting powerful context for fine-grained semantic segmentation is\nstill challenging today. Although the deep convolutional neural network (CNNs)\nhave made significant improvements on skin lesion segmentation, they often fail\nto reserve the spatial details and long-range dependencies context due to\nconsecutive convolution striding and pooling operations inside CNNs. In this\npaper, we formulate a cascaded context enhancement neural network for automatic\nskin lesion segmentation. A new cascaded context aggregation (CCA) module with\na gate-based information integration approach is proposed to sequentially and\nselectively aggregate original image and multi-level features from the encoder\nsub-network. The generated context is further utilized to guide discriminative\nfeatures extraction by the designed context-guided local affinity (CGL) module.\nFurthermore, an auxiliary loss is added to the CCA module for refining the\nprediction. In our work, we evaluate our approach on four public skin\ndermoscopy image datasets. The proposed method achieves the Jaccard Index (JA)\nof 87.1%, 80.3%, 83.4%, and 86.6% on ISIC-2016, ISIC-2017, ISIC-2018, and PH2\ndatasets, which are higher than other state-of-the-art models respectively.",

It is known that the network typically\nbegins to rapidly memorize false-labeled samples after a certain point of\ntraining. Thus, to counter the label noise challenge, we propose a novel\nself-transitional learning method called MORPH, which automatically switches\nits learning phase at the transition point from seeding to evolution. In the\nseeding phase, the network is updated using all the samples to collect a seed\nof clean samples. Then, in the evolution phase, the network is updated using\nonly the set of arguably clean samples, which precisely keeps expanding by the\nupdated network. Thus, MORPH effectively avoids the overfitting to\nfalse-labeled samples throughout the entire training period.

          "description": "Estimating 3D mesh of the human body from a single 2D image is an important\ntask with many applications such as augmented reality and Human-Robot\ninteraction. However, prior works reconstructed 3D mesh from global image\nfeature extracted by using convolutional neural network (CNN), where the dense\ncorrespondences between the mesh surface and the image pixels are missing,\nleading to suboptimal solution. This paper proposes a model-free 3D human mesh\nestimation framework, named DecoMR, which explicitly establishes the dense\ncorrespondence between the mesh and the local image features in the UV space\n(i.e. a 2D space used for texture mapping of 3D mesh). DecoMR first predicts\npixel-to-surface dense correspondence map (i.e., IUV image), with which we\ntransfer local features from the image space to the UV space. Then the\ntransferred local image features are processed in the UV space to regress a\nlocation map, which is well aligned with transferred features. Finally we\nreconstruct 3D human mesh from the regressed location map with a predefined\nmapping function. We also observe that the existing discontinuous UV map are\nunfriendly to the learning of network. Therefore, we propose a novel UV map\nthat maintains most of the neighboring relations on the original mesh surface.\nExperiments demonstrate that our proposed local feature alignment and\ncontinuous UV map outperforms existing 3D mesh based methods on multiple public\nbenchmarks.

          "description": "An effective understanding of the contextual environment and accurate motion\nforecasting of surrounding agents is crucial for the development of autonomous\nvehicles and social mobile robots. This task is challenging since the behavior\nof an autonomous agent is not only affected by its own intention, but also by\nthe static environment and surrounding dynamically interacting agents. Previous\nworks focused on utilizing the spatial and temporal information in time domain\nwhile not sufficiently taking advantage of the cues in frequency domain. To\nthis end, we propose a Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (SpecTGNN), which\ncan capture inter-agent correlations and temporal dependency simultaneously in\nfrequency domain in addition to time domain. SpecTGNN operates on both an agent\ngraph with dynamic state information and an environment graph with the features\nextracted from context images in two streams. The model integrates graph\nFourier transform, spectral graph convolution and temporal gated convolution to\nencode history information and forecast future trajectories. Moreover, we\nincorporate a multi-head spatio-temporal attention mechanism to mitigate the\neffect of error propagation in a long time horizon. We demonstrate the\nperformance of SpecTGNN on two public trajectory prediction benchmark datasets,\nwhich achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of prediction accuracy.",

          "description": "In this paper, we focus on category-level 6D pose and size estimation from\nmonocular RGB-D image. Previous methods suffer from inefficient category-level\npose feature extraction which leads to low accuracy and inference speed. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a fast shape-based network (FS-Net) with\nefficient category-level feature extraction for 6D pose estimation. First, we\ndesign an orientation aware autoencoder with 3D graph convolution for latent\nfeature extraction. The learned latent feature is insensitive to point shift\nand object size thanks to the shift and scale-invariance properties of the 3D\ngraph convolution. Then, to efficiently decode category-level rotation\ninformation from the latent feature, we propose a novel decoupled rotation\nmechanism that employs two decoders to complementarily access the rotation\ninformation. Meanwhile, we estimate translation and size by two residuals,\nwhich are the difference between the mean of object points and ground truth\ntranslation, and the difference between the mean size of the category and\nground truth size, respectively. Finally, to increase the generalization\nability of FS-Net, we propose an online box-cage based 3D deformation mechanism\nto augment the training data. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets\nshow that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both\ncategory- and instance-level 6D object pose estimation. Especially in\ncategory-level pose estimation, without extra synthetic data, our method\noutperforms existing methods by 6.3% on the NOCS-REAL dataset.",

          "description": "Researchers working on computational analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in\nhistopathology have primarily resorted to patch-based modelling due to large\nresolution of each WSI. The large resolution makes WSIs infeasible to be fed\ndirectly into the machine learning models due to computational constraints.\nHowever, due to patch-based analysis, most of the current methods fail to\nexploit the underlying spatial relationship among the patches. In our work, we\nhave tried to integrate this relationship along with feature-based correlation\namong the extracted patches from the particular tumorous region. For the given\ntask of classification, we have used BiLSTMs to model both forward and backward\ncontextual relationship. RNN based models eliminate the limitation of sequence\nsize by allowing the modelling of variable size images within a deep learning\nmodel. We have also incorporated the effect of spatial continuity by exploring\ndifferent scanning techniques used to sample patches. To establish the\nefficiency of our approach, we trained and tested our model on two datasets,\nmicroscopy images and WSI tumour regions. After comparing with contemporary\nliterature we achieved the better performance with accuracy of 90% for\nmicroscopy image dataset. For WSI tumour region dataset, we compared the\nclassification results with deep learning networks such as ResNet, DenseNet,\nand InceptionV3 using maximum voting technique. We achieved the highest\nperformance accuracy of 84%. We found out that BiLSTMs with CNN features have\nperformed much better in modelling patches into an end-to-end Image\nclassification network. Additionally, the variable dimensions of WSI tumour\nregions were used for classification without the need for resizing. This\nsuggests that our method is independent of tumour image size and can process\nlarge dimensional images without losing the resolution details.",

          "description": "The measurement of bias in machine learning often focuses on model\nperformance across identity subgroups (such as man and woman) with respect to\ngroundtruth labels. However, these methods do not directly measure the\nassociations that a model may have learned, for example between labels and\nidentity subgroups. Further, measuring a model's bias requires a fully\nannotated evaluation dataset which may not be easily available in practice. We\npresent an elegant mathematical solution that tackles both issues\nsimultaneously, using image classification as a working example. By treating a\nclassification model's predictions for a given image as a set of labels\nanalogous to a bag of words, we rank the biases that a model has learned with\nrespect to different identity labels. We use (man, woman) as a concrete example\nof an identity label set (although this set need not be binary), and present\nrankings for the labels that are most biased towards one identity or the other.\nWe demonstrate how the statistical properties of different association metrics\ncan lead to different rankings of the most \"gender biased\" labels, and conclude\nthat normalized pointwise mutual information (nPMI) is most useful in practice.\nFinally, we announce an open-sourced nPMI visualization tool using TensorBoard.",

          "description": "Less than 35% of recyclable waste is being actually recycled in the US, which\nleads to increased soil and sea pollution and is one of the major concerns of\nenvironmental researchers as well as the common public. At the heart of the\nproblem is the inefficiencies of the waste sorting process (separating paper,\nplastic, metal, glass, etc.) due to the extremely complex and cluttered nature\nof the waste stream. Automated waste detection strategies have a great\npotential to enable more efficient, reliable and safer waste sorting practices,\nbut the literature lacks comprehensive datasets and methodology for the\nindustrial waste sorting solutions. In this paper, we take a step towards\ncomputer-aided waste detection and present the first in-the-wild\nindustrial-grade waste detection and segmentation dataset, ZeroWaste. This\ndataset contains over1800fully segmented video frames collected from a real\nwaste sorting plant along with waste material labels for training and\nevaluation of the segmentation methods, as well as over6000unlabeled frames\nthat can be further used for semi-supervised and self-supervised learning\ntechniques. ZeroWaste also provides frames of the conveyor belt before and\nafter the sorting process, comprising a novel setup that can be used for\nweakly-supervised segmentation. We present baselines for fully-, semi- and\nweakly-supervised segmentation methods. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat state-of-the-art segmentation methods struggle to correctly detect and\nclassify target objects which suggests the challenging nature of our proposed\nin-the-wild dataset. We believe that ZeroWastewill catalyze research in object\ndetection and semantic segmentation in extreme clutter as well as applications\nin the recycling domain.

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves a supervised loss in a labeled\nsource domain and an unsupervised loss in an unlabeled target domain, which\noften faces more severe overfitting (than classical supervised learning) as the\nsupervised source loss has clear domain gap and the unsupervised target loss is\noften noisy due to the lack of annotations. This paper presents RDA, a robust\ndomain adaptation technique that introduces adversarial attacking to mitigate\noverfitting in UDA. We achieve robust domain adaptation by a novel Fourier\nadversarial attacking (FAA) method that allows large magnitude of perturbation\nnoises but has minimal modification of image semantics, the former is critical\nto the effectiveness of its generated adversarial samples due to the existence\nof 'domain gaps'. Specifically, FAA decomposes images into multiple frequency\ncomponents (FCs) and generates adversarial samples by just perturbating certain\nFCs that capture little semantic information. With FAA-generated samples, the\ntraining can continue the 'random walk' and drift into an area with a flat loss\nlandscape, leading to more robust domain adaptation. Extensive experiments over\nmultiple domain adaptation tasks show that RDA can work with different computer\nvision tasks with superior performance.",

          "description": "While radar and video data can be readily fused at the detection level,\nfusing them at the pixel level is potentially more beneficial. This is also\nmore challenging in part due to the sparsity of radar, but also because\nautomotive radar beams are much wider than a typical pixel combined with a\nlarge baseline between camera and radar, which results in poor association\nbetween radar pixels and color pixel. A consequence is that depth completion\nmethods designed for LiDAR and video fare poorly for radar and video. Here we\npropose a radar-to-pixel association stage which learns a mapping from radar\nreturns to pixels. This mapping also serves to densify radar returns. Using\nthis as a first stage, followed by a more traditional depth completion method,\nwe are able to achieve image-guided depth completion with radar and video. We\ndemonstrate performance superior to camera and radar alone on the nuScenes\ndataset. Our source code is available at https://github.com/longyunf/rc-pda.",

However, annotating a few target samples is usually very\nmanageable and worthwhile especially if it improves the adaptation performance\nsubstantially. This paper presents SSDAS, a Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptive\nimage Segmentation network that employs a few labeled target samples as anchors\nfor adaptive and progressive feature alignment between labeled source samples\nand unlabeled target samples. We position the few labeled target samples as\nreferences that gauge the similarity between source and target features and\nguide adaptive inter-domain alignment for learning more similar source\nfeatures. In addition, we replace the dissimilar source features by\nhigh-confidence target features continuously during the iterative training\nprocess, which achieves progressive intra-domain alignment between confident\nand unconfident target features. Extensive experiments show the proposed SSDAS\ngreatly outperforms a number of baselines, i.e., UDA-based semantic\nsegmentation and SSDA-based image classification.

We achieve this by building a differentiable decision\nforest on top of CNNs, which enjoys two characteristics: 1) During training,\nthe tree hierarchies of the forest are learned in a top-down manner under the\nguidance from the category semantics embedded in the pre-trained CNN weights;\n2) During inference, a single decision tree is dynamically selected from the\nforest for each input sample, enabling the transferred model to make sequential\ndecisions corresponding to the attributes shared by semantically-similar\ncategories, rather than directly performing flat classification. We name the\ntransferred model deep Dynamic Sequential Decision Forest (dDSDF).

          "description": "Computer-aided design (CAD) is the most widely used modeling approach for\ntechnical design. The typical starting point in these designs is 2D sketches\nwhich can later be extruded and combined to obtain complex three-dimensional\nassemblies. Such sketches are typically composed of parametric primitives, such\nas points, lines, and circular arcs, augmented with geometric constraints\nlinking the primitives, such as coincidence, parallelism, or orthogonality.\nSketches can be represented as graphs, with the primitives as nodes and the\nconstraints as edges. Training a model to automatically generate CAD sketches\ncan enable several novel workflows, but is challenging due to the complexity of\nthe graphs and the heterogeneity of the primitives and constraints. In\nparticular, each type of primitive and constraint may require a record of\ndifferent size and parameter types. We propose SketchGen as a generative model\nbased on a transformer architecture to address the heterogeneity problem by\ncarefully designing a sequential language for the primitives and constraints\nthat allows distinguishing between different primitive or constraint types and\ntheir parameters, while encouraging our model to re-use information across\nrelated parameters, encoding shared structure. A particular highlight of our\nwork is the ability to produce primitives linked via constraints that enables\nthe final output to be further regularized via a constraint solver. We evaluate\nour model by demonstrating constraint prediction for given sets of primitives\nand full sketch generation from scratch, showing that our approach\nsignificantly out performs the state-of-the-art in CAD sketch generation.",

          "description": "Self-supervised learning methods for computer vision have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of pre-training feature representations, resulting in\nwell-generalizing Deep Neural Networks, even if the annotated data are limited.\nHowever, representation learning techniques require a significant amount of\ntime for model training, with most of it time spent on precise hyper-parameter\noptimization and selection of augmentation techniques. We hypothesized that if\nthe annotated dataset has enough morphological diversity to capture the general\npopulation's as is common in medical imaging, for example, due to conserved\nsimilarities of tissue mythologies, the variance error of the trained model is\nthe prevalent component of the Bias-Variance Trade-off. We propose the Variance\nAware Training (VAT) method that exploits this property by introducing the\nvariance error into the model loss function, i.e., enabling minimizing the\nvariance explicitly. Additionally, we provide the theoretical formulation and\nproof of the proposed method to aid in interpreting the approach. Our method\nrequires selecting only one hyper-parameter and was able to match or improve\nthe state-of-the-art performance of self-supervised methods while achieving an\norder of magnitude reduction in the GPU training time. We validated VAT on\nthree medical imaging datasets from diverse domains and various learning\nobjectives. These included a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) dataset for the\nheart semantic segmentation (MICCAI 2017 ACDC challenge), fundus photography\ndataset for ordinary regression of diabetic retinopathy progression (Kaggle\n2019 APTOS Blindness Detection challenge), and classification of\nhistopathologic scans of lymph node sections (PatchCamelyon dataset).",

          "description": "The design of machines and algorithms capable of learning in a dynamically\nchanging environment has become an increasingly topical problem with the\nincrease of the size and heterogeneity of data available to learning systems.\nAs a consequence, the key issue of Continual Learning has become that of\naddressing the stability-plasticity dilemma of connectionist systems, as they\nneed to adapt their model without forgetting previously acquired knowledge.\nWithin this context, rehearsal-based methods i.e., solutions in where the\nlearner exploits memory to revisit past data, has proven to be very effective,\nleading to performance at the state-of-the-art. In our study, we propose an\nanalysis of the memory quantity/quality trade-off adopting various data\nreduction approaches to increase the number of instances storable in memory. In\nparticular, we investigate complex instance compression techniques such as deep\nencoders, but also trivial approaches such as image resizing and linear\ndimensionality reduction. Our findings suggest that the optimal trade-off is\nseverely skewed toward instance quantity, where rehearsal approaches with\nseveral heavily compressed instances easily outperform state-of-the-art\napproaches with the same amount of memory at their disposal. Further, in high\nmemory configurations, deep approaches extracting spatial structure combined\nwith extreme resizing (of the order of $8\\times8$ images) yield the best\nresults, while in memory-constrained configurations where deep approaches\ncannot be used due to their memory requirement in training, Extreme Learning\nMachines (ELM) offer a clear advantage.",

          "description": "Recently, most siamese network based trackers locate targets via object\nclassification and bounding-box regression. Generally, they select the\nbounding-box with maximum classification confidence as the final prediction.\nThis strategy may miss the right result due to the accuracy misalignment\nbetween classification and regression. In this paper, we propose a novel\nsiamese tracking algorithm called SiamRCR, addressing this problem with a\nsimple, light and effective solution. It builds reciprocal links between\nclassification and regression branches, which can dynamically re-weight their\nlosses for each positive sample. In addition, we add a localization branch to\npredict the localization accuracy, so that it can work as the replacement of\nthe regression assistance link during inference. This branch makes the training\nand inference more consistent. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of SiamRCR and its superiority over the state-of-the-art\ncompetitors on GOT-10k, LaSOT, TrackingNet, OTB-2015, VOT-2018 and VOT-2019.\nMoreover, our SiamRCR runs at 65 FPS, far above the real-time requirement.",

          "description": "In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks have become ubiquitous in\nboth research and public perception, but how GANs convert an unstructured\nlatent code to a high quality output is still an open question. In this work,\nwe investigate regression into the latent space as a probe to understand the\ncompositional properties of GANs. We find that combining the regressor and a\npretrained generator provides a strong image prior, allowing us to create\ncomposite images from a collage of random image parts at inference time while\nmaintaining global consistency. To compare compositional properties across\ndifferent generators, we measure the trade-offs between reconstruction of the\nunrealistic input and image quality of the regenerated samples. We find that\nthe regression approach enables more localized editing of individual image\nparts compared to direct editing in the latent space, and we conduct\nexperiments to quantify this independence effect. Our method is agnostic to the\nsemantics of edits, and does not require labels or predefined concepts during\ntraining. Beyond image composition, our method extends to a number of related\napplications, such as image inpainting or example-based image editing, which we\ndemonstrate on several GANs and datasets, and because it uses only a single\nforward pass, it can operate in real-time.

          "description": "Deep neural networks have increasingly been used as an auxiliary tool in\nhealthcare applications, due to their ability to improve performance of several\ndiagnosis tasks. However, these methods are not widely adopted in clinical\nsettings due to the practical limitations in the reliability, generalizability,\nand interpretability of deep learning based systems. As a result, methods have\nbeen developed that impose additional constraints during network training to\ngain more control as well as improve interpretabilty, facilitating their\nacceptance in healthcare community. In this work, we investigate the benefit of\nusing Orthogonal Spheres (OS) constraint for classification of COVID-19 cases\nfrom chest X-ray images. The OS constraint can be written as a simple\northonormality term which is used in conjunction with the standard\ncross-entropy loss during classification network training. Previous studies\nhave demonstrated significant benefits in applying such constraints to deep\nlearning models. Our findings corroborate these observations, indicating that\nthe orthonormality loss function effectively produces improved semantic\nlocalization via GradCAM visualizations, enhanced classification performance,\nand reduced model calibration error. Our approach achieves an improvement in\naccuracy of 1.6% and 4.8% for two- and three-class classification,\nrespectively; similar results are found for models with data augmentation\napplied. In addition to these findings, our work also presents a new\napplication of the OS regularizer in healthcare, increasing the post-hoc\ninterpretability and performance of deep learning models for COVID-19\nclassification to facilitate adoption of these methods in clinical settings. We\nalso identify the limitations of our strategy that can be explored for further\nresearch in future.",

          "description": "Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a challenging problem when\ngiven image category labels but requires to learn object localization models.\nOptimizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification tends to\nactivate local discriminative regions while ignoring complete object extent,\ncausing the partial activation issue. In this paper, we argue that partial\nactivation is caused by the intrinsic characteristics of CNN, where the\nconvolution operations produce local receptive fields and experience difficulty\nto capture long-range feature dependency among pixels. We introduce the token\nsemantic coupled attention map (TS-CAM) to take full advantage of the\nself-attention mechanism in visual transformer for long-range dependency\nextraction. TS-CAM first splits an image into a sequence of patch tokens for\nspatial embedding, which produce attention maps of long-range visual dependency\nto avoid partial activation. TS-CAM then re-allocates category-related\nsemantics for patch tokens, enabling each of them to be aware of object\ncategories. TS-CAM finally couples the patch tokens with the semantic-agnostic\nattention map to achieve semantic-aware localization. Experiments on the\nILSVRC/CUB-200-2011 datasets show that TS-CAM outperforms its CNN-CAM\ncounterparts by 7.1%/27.1% for WSOL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

          "description": "A neural radiance field (NeRF) is a scene model supporting high-quality view\nsynthesis, optimized per scene. In this paper, we explore enabling user editing\nof a category-level NeRF - also known as a conditional radiance field - trained\non a shape category. Specifically, we introduce a method for propagating coarse\n2D user scribbles to the 3D space, to modify the color or shape of a local\nregion. First, we propose a conditional radiance field that incorporates new\nmodular network components, including a shape branch that is shared across\nobject instances. Observing multiple instances of the same category, our model\nlearns underlying part semantics without any supervision, thereby allowing the\npropagation of coarse 2D user scribbles to the entire 3D region (e.g., chair\nseat). Next, we propose a hybrid network update strategy that targets specific\nnetwork components, which balances efficiency and accuracy. During user\ninteraction, we formulate an optimization problem that both satisfies the\nuser's constraints and preserves the original object structure. We demonstrate\nour approach on various editing tasks over three shape datasets and show that\nit outperforms prior neural editing approaches. Finally, we edit the appearance\nand shape of a real photograph and show that the edit propagates to\nextrapolated novel views.",

          "description": "Data augmentation is widely known as a simple yet surprisingly effective\ntechnique for regularizing deep networks. Conventional data augmentation\nschemes, e.g., flipping, translation or rotation, are low-level,\ndata-independent and class-agnostic operations, leading to limited diversity\nfor augmented samples. To this end, we propose a novel semantic data\naugmentation algorithm to complement traditional approaches. The proposed\nmethod is inspired by the intriguing property that deep networks are effective\nin learning linearized features, i.e., certain directions in the deep feature\nspace correspond to meaningful semantic transformations, e.g., changing the\nbackground or view angle of an object. Based on this observation, translating\ntraining samples along many such directions in the feature space can\neffectively augment the dataset for more diversity. To implement this idea, we\nfirst introduce a sampling based method to obtain semantically meaningful\ndirections efficiently. Then, an upper bound of the expected cross-entropy (CE)\nloss on the augmented training set is derived by assuming the number of\naugmented samples goes to infinity, yielding a highly efficient algorithm. In\nfact, we show that the proposed implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA)\nalgorithm amounts to minimizing a novel robust CE loss, which adds minimal\nextra computational cost to a normal training procedure. In addition to\nsupervised learning, ISDA can be applied to semi-supervised learning tasks\nunder the consistency regularization framework, where ISDA amounts to\nminimizing the upper bound of the expected KL-divergence between the augmented\nfeatures and the original features. Although being simple, ISDA consistently\nimproves the generalization performance of popular deep models (e.g., ResNets\nand DenseNets) on a variety of datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN,\nImageNet, and Cityscapes.",

In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank\ntensor decomposition (LRTD) based multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) framework that\nachieves accurate and robust pathological liver segmentation of CT images.\nFirstly, we propose a multi-slice LRTD scheme to recover the underlying\nlow-rank structure embedded in 3D medical images. It performs the LRTD on small\nimage segments consisting of multiple consecutive image slices. Then, we\npresent an LRTD-based atlas construction method to generate tumor-free liver\natlases that mitigates the performance degradation of liver segmentation due to\nthe presence of tumors. Finally, we introduce an LRTD-based MAS algorithm to\nderive patient-specific liver atlases for each test image, and to achieve\naccurate pairwise image registration and label propagation. Extensive\nexperiments on three public databases of pathological liver cases validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.

The main strategy to prolong this\ntrend relies on further upscaling networks in size. However, costs increase\nrapidly while performance improvements may be marginal. We hypothesise that\nadding heterogeneous sources of information may be more cost-effective to a CNN\nthan building a bigger network.

Pre-training based meta-learning methods\neffectively tackle the problem by pre-training a feature extractor and then\nfine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based meta-learning. However,\nresults show that the fine-tuning step makes very marginal improvements. In\nthis paper, 1) we figure out the key reason, i.e., in the pre-trained feature\nspace, the base classes already form compact clusters while novel classes\nspread as groups with large variances, which implies that fine-tuning the\nfeature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning the feature\nextractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes during\nmeta-learning. Consequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based\nmeta-learning framework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge\n(i.e., class-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative\nattribute features as priors. Then, we design a prototype completion network to\nlearn to complete prototypes with these priors. To avoid the prototype\ncompletion error caused by primitive knowledge noises or class differences, we\nfurther develop a Gaussian based prototype fusion strategy that combines the\nmean-based and completed prototypes by exploiting the unlabeled samples.\nExtensive experiments show that our method: (i) can obtain more accurate\nprototypes; (ii) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 2% - 9% in terms of\nclassification accuracy.

To alleviate this issue, we introduce two novel training\ntechniques called frequency dropping (F-Drop) and frequency matching (F-Match).\nThe key idea of F-Drop is to filter out unnecessary high-frequency components\nfrom the input images of the discriminators. This simple modification prevents\nthe discriminators from being confused by perturbations of the high-frequency\ncomponents. In addition, F-Drop makes the GANs focus on fitting in the\nlow-frequency domain, in which there are the dominant components of natural\nimages. F-Match minimizes the difference between real and fake images in the\nfrequency domain for generating more realistic images. F-Match is implemented\nas a regularization term in the objective functions of the generators; it\npenalizes the batch mean error in the frequency domain. F-Match helps the\ngenerators to fit in the high-frequency domain filtered out by F-Drop to the\nreal image. We experimentally demonstrate that the combination of F-Drop and\nF-Match improves the generative performance of GANs in both the frequency and\nspatial domain on multiple image benchmarks (CIFAR, TinyImageNet, STL-10,\nCelebA, and ImageNet).",

In specific, we use the modified\nVGG-M as the generality adapter to extract the modality-shared target\nrepresentations.To extract the modality-specific features while reducing the\ncomputational complexity, we design a modality adapter, which adds a small\nblock to the generality adapter in each layer and each modality in a parallel\nmanner. Such a design could learn multilevel modality-specific representations\nwith a modest number of parameters as the vast majority of parameters are\nshared with the generality adapter. We also design instance adapter to capture\nthe appearance properties and temporal variations of a certain target.\nMoreover, to enhance the shared and specific features, we employ the loss of\nmultiple kernel maximum mean discrepancy to measure the distribution divergence\nof different modal features and integrate it into each layer for more robust\nrepresentation learning. Extensive experiments on two RGBT tracking benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed tracker\nagainst the state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work, we propose a novel neural scene\nrepresentation, Light Field Networks or LFNs, which represent both geometry and\nappearance of the underlying 3D scene in a 360-degree, four-dimensional light\nfield parameterized via a neural implicit representation. Rendering a ray from\nan LFN requires only a *single* network evaluation, as opposed to hundreds of\nevaluations per ray for ray-marching or volumetric based renderers in\n3D-structured neural scene representations. In the setting of simple scenes, we\nleverage meta-learning to learn a prior over LFNs that enables multi-view\nconsistent light field reconstruction from as little as a single image\nobservation. This results in dramatic reductions in time and memory complexity,\nand enables real-time rendering. The cost of storing a 360-degree light field\nvia an LFN is two orders of magnitude lower than conventional methods such as\nthe Lumigraph.

Existingmethods achieve varying degrees of\nsuccess by using different surface representations.

To this end, we propose to\nlearn and use the topology-preserved, skeletal shape representationto assist\nthe downstream task of object surface reconstruction from RGB images.\nTechnically, we propose the novelSkeletonNetdesign that learns a volumetric\nrepresentation of a skeleton via a bridged learning of a skeletal point set,\nwhere we use paralleldecoders each responsible for the learning of points on 1D\nskeletal curves and 2D skeletal sheets, as well as an efficient module\nofglobally guided subvolume synthesis for a refined, high-resolution skeletal\nvolume; we present a differentiablePoint2Voxellayer tomake SkeletonNet\nend-to-end and trainable.

Despite that\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved good performance for this\ntask, they rely on a large set of labeled images for training, which is\nexpensive and time-consuming to acquire. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework with Uncertainty Rectified Pyramid Consistency (URPC) regularization\nfor semi-supervised NPC GTV segmentation. Concretely, we extend a backbone\nsegmentation network to produce pyramid predictions at different scales. The\npyramid predictions network (PPNet) is supervised by the ground truth of\nlabeled images and a multi-scale consistency loss for unlabeled images,\nmotivated by the fact that prediction at different scales for the same input\nshould be similar and consistent. However, due to the different resolution of\nthese predictions, encouraging them to be consistent at each pixel directly has\nlow robustness and may lose some fine details. To address this problem, we\nfurther design a novel uncertainty rectifying module to enable the framework to\ngradually learn from meaningful and reliable consensual regions at different\nscales. Experimental results on a dataset with 258 NPC MR images showed that\nwith only 10% or 20% images labeled, our method largely improved the\nsegmentation performance by leveraging the unlabeled images, and it also\noutperformed five state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods.\nMoreover, when only 50% images labeled, URPC achieved an average Dice score of\n82.74% that was close to fully supervised learning.",

Though many DA theories and algorithms\nhave been proposed, most of them are tailored into classification settings and\nmay fail in regression tasks, especially in the practical keypoint detection\ntask. To tackle this difficult but significant task, we present a method of\nregressive domain adaptation (RegDA) for unsupervised keypoint detection.\nInspired by the latest theoretical work, we first utilize an adversarial\nregressor to maximize the disparity on the target domain and train a feature\ngenerator to minimize this disparity. However, due to the high dimension of the\noutput space, this regressor fails to detect samples that deviate from the\nsupport of the source. To overcome this problem, we propose two important\nideas. First, based on our observation that the probability density of the\noutput space is sparse, we introduce a spatial probability distribution to\ndescribe this sparsity and then use it to guide the learning of the adversarial\nregressor. Second, to alleviate the optimization difficulty in the\nhigh-dimensional space, we innovatively convert the minimax game in the\nadversarial training to the minimization of two opposite goals.

Classical methods\nconsider analytic shape priors; however, their performance degraded when the\nscanned points deviate from the ideal conditions of cleanness and completeness.\nImportant progress has been recently made by data-driven approaches, which\nlearn global and/or local models of implicit surface representations from\nauxiliary sets of training shapes. Motivated from a universal phenomenon that\nself-similar shape patterns of local surface patches repeat across the entire\nsurface of an object, we aim to push forward the data-driven strategies and\npropose to learn a local implicit surface network for a shared, adaptive\nmodeling of the entire surface for a direct surface reconstruction from raw\npoint cloud; we also enhance the leveraging of surface self-similarities by\nimproving correlations among the optimized latent codes of individual surface\npatches. Given that orientations of raw points could be unavailable or noisy,\nwe extend sign agnostic learning into our local implicit model, which enables\nour recovery of signed implicit fields of local surfaces from the unsigned\ninputs. We term our framework as Sign-Agnostic Implicit Learning of Surface\nSelf-Similarities (SAIL-S3). With a global post-optimization of local sign\nflipping, SAIL-S3 is able to directly model raw, un-oriented point clouds and\nreconstruct high-quality object surfaces.

          "description": "This paper tackles the problem of training a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork of both low-bitwidth weights and activations. Optimizing a\nlow-precision network is very challenging due to the non-differentiability of\nthe quantizer, which may result in substantial accuracy loss. To address this,\nwe propose three practical approaches, including (i) progressive quantization;\n(ii) stochastic precision; and (iii) joint knowledge distillation to improve\nthe network training. First, for progressive quantization, we propose two\nschemes to progressively find good local minima. Specifically, we propose to\nfirst optimize a net with quantized weights and subsequently quantize\nactivations. This is in contrast to the traditional methods which optimize them\nsimultaneously. Furthermore, we propose a second progressive quantization\nscheme which gradually decreases the bit-width from high-precision to\nlow-precision during training. Second, to alleviate the excessive training\nburden due to the multi-round training stages, we further propose a one-stage\nstochastic precision strategy to randomly sample and quantize sub-networks\nwhile keeping other parts in full-precision. Finally, we adopt a novel learning\nscheme to jointly train a full-precision model alongside the low-precision one.\nBy doing so, the full-precision model provides hints to guide the low-precision\nmodel training and significantly improves the performance of the low-precision\nnetwork.

Our method learns past\nand future trajectory embeddings using recurrent neural networks and exploits\nan associative external memory to store and retrieve such embeddings.\nTrajectory prediction is then performed by decoding in-memory future encodings\nconditioned with the observed past.

An essential building block of\nsingle image depth estimation is an encoder-decoder task network that takes RGB\nimages as input and produces depth maps as output. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel training strategy to force the task network to learn domain invariant\nrepresentations in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, we extend\nself-supervised learning from traditional representation learning, which works\non images from a single domain, to domain invariant representation learning,\nwhich works on images from two different domains by utilizing an image-to-image\ntranslation network. Firstly, we use our bidirectional image-to-image\ntranslation network to transfer domain-specific styles between synthetic and\nreal domains. This style transfer operation allows us to obtain similar images\nfrom the different domains. Secondly, we jointly train our task network and\nSiamese network with the same images from the different domains to obtain\ndomain invariance for the task network. Finally, we fine-tune the task network\nusing labeled synthetic and unlabeled real-world data. Our training strategy\nyields improved generalization capability in the real-world domain. We carry\nout an extensive evaluation on two popular datasets for depth estimation, KITTI\nand Make3D.

          "description": "The prevalence of employing attention mechanisms has brought along concerns\non the interpretability of attention distributions. Although it provides\ninsights about how a model is operating, utilizing attention as the explanation\nof model predictions is still highly dubious. The community is still seeking\nmore interpretable strategies for better identifying local active regions that\ncontribute the most to the final decision. To improve the interpretability of\nexisting attention models, we propose a novel Bilinear Representative\nNon-Parametric Attention (BR-NPA) strategy that captures the task-relevant\nhuman-interpretable information. The target model is first distilled to have\nhigher-resolution intermediate feature maps. From which, representative\nfeatures are then grouped based on local pairwise feature similarity, to\nproduce finer-grained, more precise attention maps highlighting task-relevant\nparts of the input. The obtained attention maps are ranked according to the\n`active level' of the compound feature, which provides information regarding\nthe important level of the highlighted regions. The proposed model can be\neasily adapted in a wide variety of modern deep models, where classification is\ninvolved. It is also more accurate, faster, and with a smaller memory footprint\nthan usual neural attention modules. Extensive experiments showcase more\ncomprehensive visual explanations compared to the state-of-the-art\nvisualization model across multiple tasks including few-shot classification,\nperson re-identification, fine-grained image classification.

We reduced the\ndimensionality of thermomics by spanning them onto Hilbert space using RBF\nkernel and select the three most efficient features using the block Hilbert\nSchmidt Independence Criterion Lasso (block HSIC Lasso).

          "description": "Road infrastructure maintenance inspection is typically a labour-intensive\nand critical task to ensure the safety of all the road users. In this work, we\npropose a detailed methodology to use state-of-the-art techniques in artificial\nintelligence and computer vision to automate a sizeable portion of the\nmaintenance inspection subtasks and reduce the labour costs. The proposed\nmethodology uses state-of-the-art computer vision techniques such as object\ndetection and semantic segmentation to automate inspections on primary road\nstructures such as the road surface, markings, barriers (guardrails) and\ntraffic signs. The models are mostly trained on commercially viable datasets\nand augmented with proprietary data. We demonstrate that our AI models can not\nonly automate and scale maintenance inspections on primary road structures but\nalso result in higher recall compared to traditional manual inspections.",

          "description": "In this article, an approach for probabilistic trajectory forecasting of\nvulnerable road users (VRUs) is presented, which considers past movements and\nthe surrounding scene. Past movements are represented by 3D poses reflecting\nthe posture and movements of individual body parts. The surrounding scene is\nmodeled in the form of semantic maps showing, e.g., the course of streets,\nsidewalks, and the occurrence of obstacles. The forecasts are generated in\ngrids discretizing the space and in the form of arbitrary discrete probability\ndistributions. The distributions are evaluated in terms of their reliability,\nsharpness, and positional accuracy. We compare our method with an approach that\nprovides forecasts in the form of Gaussian distributions and discuss the\nrespective advantages and disadvantages. Thereby, we investigate the impact of\nusing poses and semantic maps. With a technique called spatial label smoothing,\nour approach achieves reliable forecasts. Overall, the poses have a positive\nimpact on the forecasts. The semantic maps offer the opportunity to adapt the\nprobability distributions to the individual situation, although at the\nconsidered forecasted time horizon of 2.52 s they play a minor role compared to\nthe past movements of the VRU. Our method is evaluated on a dataset recorded in\ninner-city traffic using a research vehicle. The dataset is made publicly\navailable.",

          "description": "There is a growing demand for high-resolution (HR) medical images in both the\nclinical and research applications. Image quality is inevitably traded off with\nthe acquisition time for better patient comfort, lower examination costs, dose,\nand fewer motion-induced artifacts. For many image-based tasks, increasing the\napparent resolution in the perpendicular plane to produce multi-planar\nreformats or 3D images is commonly used. Single image super-resolution (SR) is\na promising technique to provide HR images based on unsupervised learning to\nincrease resolution of a 2D image, but there are few reports on 3D SR. Further,\nperceptual loss is proposed in the literature to better capture the textual\ndetails and edges than using pixel-wise loss functions, by comparing the\nsemantic distances in the high-dimensional feature space of a pre-trained 2D\nnetwork (e.g., VGG). However, it is not clear how one should generalize it to\n3D medical images, and the attendant implications are still unclear. In this\npaper, we propose a framework called SOUP-GAN: Super-resolution Optimized Using\nPerceptual-tuned Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), in order to produce\nthinner slice (e.g., high resolution in the 'Z' plane) medical images with\nanti-aliasing and deblurring. The proposed method outperforms other\nconventional resolution-enhancement methods and previous SR work on medical\nimages upon both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Specifically, we\nexamine the model in terms of its generalization for various SR ratios and\nimaging modalities. By addressing those limitations, our model shows promise as\na novel 3D SR interpolation technique, providing potential applications in both\nclinical and research settings.",

          "description": "Prior correlation filter (CF)-based tracking methods for unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs) have virtually focused on tracking in the daytime. However,\nwhen the night falls, the trackers will encounter more harsh scenes, which can\neasily lead to tracking failure. In this regard, this work proposes a novel\ntracker with anti-dark function (ADTrack). The proposed method integrates an\nefficient and effective low-light image enhancer into a CF-based tracker.\nBesides, a target-aware mask is simultaneously generated by virtue of image\nillumination variation. The target-aware mask can be applied to jointly train a\ntarget-focused filter that assists the context filter for robust tracking.\nSpecifically, ADTrack adopts dual regression, where the context filter and the\ntarget-focused filter restrict each other for dual filter learning. Exhaustive\nexperiments are conducted on typical dark sceneries benchmark, consisting of 37\ntypical night sequences from authoritative benchmarks, i.e., UAVDark, and our\nnewly constructed benchmark UAVDark70. The results have shown that ADTrack\nfavorably outperforms other state-of-the-art trackers and achieves a real-time\nspeed of 34 frames/s on a single CPU, greatly extending robust UAV tracking to\nnight scenes.",

Such generality for\ntransfer learning, however, sacrifices specificity if we are interested in a\ncertain downstream task.

In this paper, we follow\nthis principle with a pretraining method specifically designed for the task of\nobject detection. We attain alignment in the following three aspects: 1)\nobject-level representations are introduced via selective search bounding boxes\nas object proposals; 2) the pretraining network architecture incorporates the\nsame dedicated modules used in the detection pipeline (e.g. FPN); 3) the\npretraining is equipped with object detection properties such as object-level\ntranslation invariance and scale invariance.

          "description": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of death for men\nworldwide. Multi-parametric magnetic resonance (mpMR) imaging has emerged as a\nnon-invasive diagnostic tool for detecting and localising prostate tumours by\nspecialised radiologists. These radiological examinations, for example, for\ndifferentiating malignant lesions from benign prostatic hyperplasia in\ntransition zones and for defining the boundaries of clinically significant\ncancer, remain challenging and highly skill-and-experience-dependent. We first\ninvestigate experimental results in developing object detection neural networks\nthat are trained to predict the radiological assessment, using these\nhigh-variance labels. We further argue that such a computer-assisted diagnosis\n(CAD) system needs to have the ability to control the false-positive rate (FPR)\nor false-negative rate (FNR), in order to be usefully deployed in a clinical\nworkflow, informing clinical decisions without further human intervention. This\nwork proposes a novel PCa detection network that incorporates a lesion-level\ncost-sensitive loss and an additional slice-level loss based on a\nlesion-to-slice mapping function, to manage the lesion- and slice-level costs,\nrespectively. Our experiments based on 290 clinical patients concludes that 1)\nThe lesion-level FNR was effectively reduced from 0.19 to 0.10 and the\nlesion-level FPR was reduced from 1.03 to 0.66 by changing the lesion-level\ncost; 2) The slice-level FNR was reduced from 0.19 to 0.00 by taking into\naccount the slice-level cost; (3) Both lesion-level and slice-level FNRs were\nreduced with lower FP/FPR by changing the lesion-level or slice-level costs,\ncompared with post-training threshold adjustment using networks without the\nproposed cost-aware training.",

          "description": "Reference-based image super-resolution (RefSR) has shown promising success in\nrecovering high-frequency details by utilizing an external reference image\n(Ref). In this task, texture details are transferred from the Ref image to the\nlow-resolution (LR) image according to their point- or patch-wise\ncorrespondence. Therefore, high-quality correspondence matching is critical. It\nis also desired to be computationally efficient. Besides, existing RefSR\nmethods tend to ignore the potential large disparity in distributions between\nthe LR and Ref images, which hurts the effectiveness of the information\nutilization. In this paper, we propose the MASA network for RefSR, where two\nnovel modules are designed to address these problems. The proposed Match &\nExtraction Module significantly reduces the computational cost by a\ncoarse-to-fine correspondence matching scheme. The Spatial Adaptation Module\nlearns the difference of distribution between the LR and Ref images, and remaps\nthe distribution of Ref features to that of LR features in a spatially adaptive\nway. This scheme makes the network robust to handle different reference images.\nExtensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness\nof our proposed model.",

It is known that MCC is\n$\\mathsf{NP}$-hard [Culberson & Reckhow: Covering polygons is hard, FOCS\n1988/Journal of Algorithms 1994] and in $\\exists\\mathbb{R}$ [O'Rourke: The\ncomplexity of computing minimum convex covers for polygons, Allerton 1982].

In other words, the problem is equivalent to\ndeciding whether a system of polynomial equations and inequalities with integer\ncoefficients has a real solution.\n\nIf a cover for our constructed polygon exists, then so does a cover\nconsisting entirely of triangles. As a byproduct, we therefore also establish\nthat it is $\\exists\\mathbb{R}$-complete to decide whether $k$ triangles cover a\ngiven polygon.\n\nThe issue that it was not known if finding a minimum cover is in\n$\\mathsf{NP}$ has repeatedly been raised in the literature, and it was\nmentioned as a \"long-standing open question\" already in 2001 [Eidenbenz &\nWidmayer: An approximation algorithm for minimum convex cover with logarithmic\nperformance guarantee, ESA 2001/SIAM Journal on Computing 2003].

          "description": "Accurate localization is of crucial importance for autonomous driving tasks.\nNowadays, we have seen a lot of sensor-rich vehicles (e.g. Robo-taxi) driving\non the street autonomously, which rely on high-accurate sensors (e.g. Lidar and\nRTK GPS) and high-resolution map. However, low-cost production cars cannot\nafford such high expenses on sensors and maps. How to reduce costs? How do\nsensor-rich vehicles benefit low-cost cars? In this paper, we proposed a\nlight-weight localization solution, which relies on low-cost cameras and\ncompact visual semantic maps. The map is easily produced and updated by\nsensor-rich vehicles in a crowd-sourced way. Specifically, the map consists of\nseveral semantic elements, such as lane line, crosswalk, ground sign, and stop\nline on the road surface. We introduce the whole framework of on-vehicle\nmapping, on-cloud maintenance, and user-end localization. The map data is\ncollected and preprocessed on vehicles. Then, the crowd-sourced data is\nuploaded to a cloud server. The mass data from multiple vehicles are merged on\nthe cloud so that the semantic map is updated in time. Finally, the semantic\nmap is compressed and distributed to production cars, which use this map for\nlocalization. We validate the performance of the proposed map in real-world\nexperiments and compare it against other algorithms. The average size of the\nsemantic map is $36$ kb/km. We highlight that this framework is a reliable and\npractical localization solution for autonomous driving.",

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made great breakthroughs in 2D\ncomputer vision. However, the irregular structure of meshes makes it hard to\nexploit the power of CNNs directly. A subdivision surface provides a\nhierarchical multi-resolution structure, and each face in a closed 2-manifold\ntriangle mesh is exactly adjacent to three faces. Motivated by these two\nproperties, this paper introduces a novel and flexible CNN framework, named\nSubdivNet, for 3D triangle meshes with Loop subdivision sequence connectivity.\nMaking an analogy between mesh faces and pixels in a 2D image allows us to\npresent a mesh convolution operator to aggregate local features from adjacent\nfaces. By exploiting face neighborhoods, this convolution can support standard\n2D convolutional network concepts, e.g. variable kernel size, stride, and\ndilation. Based on the multi-resolution hierarchy, we propose a spatial uniform\npooling layer which merges four faces into one and an upsampling method which\nsplits one face into four. As a result, many popular 2D CNN architectures can\nbe readily adapted to processing 3D meshes. Meshes with arbitrary connectivity\ncan be remeshed to hold Loop subdivision sequence connectivity via\nself-parameterization, making SubdivNet a general approach. Experiments on mesh\nclassification, segmentation, correspondence, and retrieval from the real-world\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SubdivNet.",

Two scenarios are investigated: Totally Black Box\n(TBB) where only the soft-predictions are available and Partially Black Box\n(PBB) where gradient-propagation to perform input pre-processing is allowed.\nEmpirically, we show that DOCTOR outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on\nvarious well-known images and sentiment analysis datasets. In particular, we\nobserve a reduction of up to $4\\%$ of the false rejection rate (FRR) in the PBB\nscenario. DOCTOR can be applied to any pre-trained model, it does not require\nprior information about the underlying dataset and is as simple as the simplest\navailable methods in the literature.",

          "description": "This paper investigates how to realize better and more efficient embedding\nlearning to tackle the semi-supervised video object segmentation under\nchallenging multi-object scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods learn to\ndecode features with a single positive object and thus have to match and\nsegment each target separately under multi-object scenarios, consuming multiple\ntimes computing resources. To solve the problem, we propose an Associating\nObjects with Transformers (AOT) approach to match and decode multiple objects\nuniformly. In detail, AOT employs an identification mechanism to associate\nmultiple targets into the same high-dimensional embedding space. Thus, we can\nsimultaneously process the matching and segmentation decoding of multiple\nobjects as efficiently as processing a single object. For sufficiently modeling\nmulti-object association, a Long Short-Term Transformer is designed for\nconstructing hierarchical matching and propagation. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on both multi-object and single-object benchmarks to examine AOT\nvariant networks with different complexities. Particularly, our AOT-L\noutperforms all the state-of-the-art competitors on three popular benchmarks,\ni.e., YouTube-VOS (83.7% J&F), DAVIS 2017 (83.0%), and DAVIS 2016 (91.0%),\nwhile keeping better multi-object efficiency. Meanwhile, our AOT-T can maintain\nreal-time multi-object speed on above benchmarks. We ranked 1st in the 3rd\nLarge-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

          "description": "Few-shot segmentation aims to train a segmentation model that can fast adapt\nto novel classes with few exemplars. The conventional training paradigm is to\nlearn to make predictions on query images conditioned on the features from\nsupport images. Previous methods only utilized the semantic-level prototypes of\nsupport images as the conditional information. These methods cannot utilize all\npixel-wise support information for the query predictions, which is however\ncritical for the segmentation task. In this paper, we focus on utilizing\npixel-wise relationships between support and target images to facilitate the\nfew-shot semantic segmentation task. We design a novel Cycle-Consistent\nTransformer (CyCTR) module to aggregate pixel-wise support features into query\nones. CyCTR performs cross-attention between features from different images,\ni.e. support and query images. We observe that there may exist unexpected\nirrelevant pixel-level support features. Directly performing cross-attention\nmay aggregate these features from support to query and bias the query features.\nThus, we propose using a novel cycle-consistent attention mechanism to filter\nout possible harmful support features and encourage query features to attend to\nthe most informative pixels from support images. Experiments on all few-shot\nsegmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed CyCTR leads to remarkable\nimprovement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, on\nPascal-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ datasets, we achieve 66.6% and 45.6% mIoU for\n5-shot segmentation, outperforming previous state-of-the-art by 4.6% and 7.1%\nrespectively.",

          "description": "Recently, there emerges a series of vision Transformers, which show superior\nperformance with a more compact model size than conventional convolutional\nneural networks, thanks to the strong ability of Transformers to model\nlong-range dependencies. However, the advantages of vision Transformers also\ncome with a price: Self-attention, the core part of Transformer, has a\nquadratic complexity to the input sequence length. This leads to a dramatic\nincrease of computation and memory cost with the increase of sequence length,\nthus introducing difficulties when applying Transformers to the vision tasks\nthat require dense predictions based on high-resolution feature maps. In this\npaper, we propose a new vision Transformer, named Glance-and-Gaze Transformer\n(GG-Transformer), to address the aforementioned issues. It is motivated by the\nGlance and Gaze behavior of human beings when recognizing objects in natural\nscenes, with the ability to efficiently model both long-range dependencies and\nlocal context. In GG-Transformer, the Glance and Gaze behavior is realized by\ntwo parallel branches: The Glance branch is achieved by performing\nself-attention on the adaptively-dilated partitions of the input, which leads\nto a linear complexity while still enjoying a global receptive field; The Gaze\nbranch is implemented by a simple depth-wise convolutional layer, which\ncompensates local image context to the features obtained by the Glance\nmechanism. We empirically demonstrate our method achieves consistently superior\nperformance over previous state-of-the-art Transformers on various vision tasks\nand benchmarks.

          "description": "Current works formulate facial action unit (AU) recognition as a supervised\nlearning problem, requiring fully AU-labeled facial images during training. It\nis challenging if not impossible to provide AU annotations for large numbers of\nfacial images. Fortunately, AUs appear on all facial images, whether manually\nlabeled or not, satisfy the underlying anatomic mechanisms and human behavioral\nhabits. In this paper, we propose a deep semi-supervised framework for facial\naction unit recognition from partially AU-labeled facial images. Specifically,\nthe proposed deep semi-supervised AU recognition approach consists of a deep\nrecognition network and a discriminator D. The deep recognition network R\nlearns facial representations from large-scale facial images and AU classifiers\nfrom limited ground truth AU labels. The discriminator D is introduced to\nenforce statistical similarity between the AU distribution inherent in ground\ntruth AU labels and the distribution of the predicted AU labels from labeled\nand unlabeled facial images. The deep recognition network aims to minimize\nrecognition loss from the labeled facial images, to faithfully represent\ninherent AU distribution for both labeled and unlabeled facial images, and to\nconfuse the discriminator. During training, the deep recognition network R and\nthe discriminator D are optimized alternately. Thus, the inherent AU\ndistributions caused by underlying anatomic mechanisms are leveraged to\nconstruct better feature representations and AU classifiers from partially\nAU-labeled data during training. Experiments on two benchmark databases\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach successfully captures AU distributions\nthrough adversarial learning and outperforms state-of-the-art AU recognition\nwork.",

          "description": "Cervical cancer is a malignant tumor that seriously threatens women's health,\nand is one of the most common that affects women worldwide. For its early\ndetection, colposcopic images of the cervix are used for searching for possible\ninjuries or abnormalities. An inherent characteristic of these images is the\npresence of specular reflections (brightness) that make it difficult to observe\nsome regions, which might imply a misdiagnosis. In this paper, a new strategy\nbased on neural networks is introduced for eliminating specular reflections and\nestimating the unobserved anatomical cervix portion under the bright zones. We\npresent a supervised learning method, despite not knowing the ground truth from\nthe beginning, based on training a neural network to learn how to restore any\nhidden region of colposcopic images. Once the specular reflections are\nidentified, they are removed from the image and the previously trained network\nis used to fulfill these deleted areas. The quality of the processed images was\nevaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. In 21 of the 22 evaluated images,\nthe detected specular reflections were totally eliminated, whereas, in the\nremaining one, these reflections were almost completely eliminated. The\ndistribution of the colors and the content of the restored images are similar\nto those of the originals. The evaluation carried out by a specialist in Cervix\nPathology concluded that, after eliminating the specular reflections, the\nanatomical and physiological elements of the cervix are observable in the\nrestored images, which facilitates the medical diagnosis of cervical\npathologies. Our method has the potential to improve the early detection of\ncervical cancer.",

Emergent communication research has\nsought to explore how agents can learn to communicate in order to\ncollaboratively solve tasks. Existing research has focused on language, with a\nlearned communication channel transmitting sequences of discrete tokens between\nthe agents. In this work, we explore a visual communication channel between\nagents that are allowed to draw with simple strokes. Our agents are\nparameterised by deep neural networks, and the drawing procedure is\ndifferentiable, allowing for end-to-end training. In the framework of a\nreferential communication game, we demonstrate that agents can not only\nsuccessfully learn to communicate by drawing, but with appropriate inductive\nbiases, can do so in a fashion that humans can interpret.

This study proposes a new dynamic radiomics feature extraction\nworkflow that uses time-dependent tomographic images of the same patient,\nfocuses on the changes in image features over time, and then quantifies them as\nnew dynamic features for diagnostic or prognostic evaluation. We first define\nthe mathematical paradigm of dynamic radiomics and introduce three specific\nmethods that can describe the transformation process of features over time.\nThree different clinical problems are used to validate the performance of the\nproposed dynamic feature with conventional 2D and 3D static features.",

The inherent complexity of the\nunderlying optimization requires current gradient-based attacks to be carefully\ntuned, initialized, and possibly executed for many computationally-demanding\niterations, even if specialized to a given perturbation model. In this work, we\novercome these limitations by proposing a fast minimum-norm (FMN) attack that\nworks with different $\\ell_p$-norm perturbation models ($p=0, 1, 2, \\infty$),\nis robust to hyperparameter choices, does not require adversarial starting\npoints, and converges within few lightweight steps. It works by iteratively\nfinding the sample misclassified with maximum confidence within an\n$\\ell_p$-norm constraint of size $\\epsilon$, while adapting $\\epsilon$ to\nminimize the distance of the current sample to the decision boundary.

However, the behaviour of such\noptimisation has not been studied in the light of a fundamentally different\nclass of attacks called backdoors. In this paper, we demonstrate that\nadversarially robust models are susceptible to backdoor attacks. Subsequently,\nwe observe that backdoors are reflected in the feature representation of such\nmodels. Then, this observation is leveraged to detect backdoor-infected models\nvia a detection technique called AEGIS. Specifically, AEGIS uses feature\nclustering to effectively detect backdoor-infected robust Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs). In our evaluation of several visible and hidden backdoor triggers on\nmajor classification tasks using CIFAR-10, MNIST and FMNIST datasets, AEGIS\neffectively detects robust DNNs infected with backdoors. AEGIS detects a\nbackdoor-infected model with 91.6% accuracy, without any false positives.\nFurthermore, AEGIS detects the targeted class in the backdoor-infected model\nwith a reasonably low (11.1%) false positive rate. Our investigation reveals\nthat salient features of adversarially robust DNNs break the stealthy nature of\nbackdoor attacks.",

          "description": "Semi-Supervised classification and segmentation methods have been widely\ninvestigated in medical image analysis. Both approaches can improve the\nperformance of fully-supervised methods with additional unlabeled data.\nHowever, as a fundamental task, semi-supervised object detection has not gained\nenough attention in the field of medical image analysis. In this paper, we\npropose a novel Semi-Supervised Medical image Detector (SSMD). The motivation\nbehind SSMD is to provide free yet effective supervision for unlabeled data, by\nregularizing the predictions at each position to be consistent. To achieve the\nabove idea, we develop a novel adaptive consistency cost function to regularize\ndifferent components in the predictions. Moreover, we introduce heterogeneous\nperturbation strategies that work in both feature space and image space, so\nthat the proposed detector is promising to produce powerful image\nrepresentations and robust predictions. Extensive experimental results show\nthat the proposed SSMD achieves the state-of-the-art performance at a wide\nrange of settings. We also demonstrate the strength of each proposed module\nwith comprehensive ablation studies.",

          "description": "State-of-the-art deep neural networks are sensitive to small input\nperturbations. Since the discovery of this intriguing vulnerability, many\ndefence methods have been proposed that attempt to improve robustness to\nadversarial noise. Fast and accurate attacks are required to compare various\ndefence methods. However, evaluating adversarial robustness has proven to be\nextremely challenging. Existing norm minimisation adversarial attacks require\nthousands of iterations (e.g. Carlini & Wagner attack), are limited to the\nspecific norms (e.g. Fast Adaptive Boundary), or produce sub-optimal results\n(e.g. Brendel & Bethge attack). On the other hand, PGD attack, which is fast,\ngeneral and accurate, ignores the norm minimisation penalty and solves a\nsimpler perturbation-constrained problem. In this work, we introduce a fast,\ngeneral and accurate adversarial attack that optimises the original non-convex\nconstrained minimisation problem. We interpret optimising the Lagrangian of the\nadversarial attack optimisation problem as a two-player game: the first player\nminimises the Lagrangian wrt the adversarial noise; the second player maximises\nthe Lagrangian wrt the regularisation penalty. Our attack algorithm\nsimultaneously optimises primal and dual variables to find the minimal\nadversarial perturbation. In addition, for non-smooth $l_p$-norm minimisation,\nsuch as $l_{\\infty}$-, $l_1$-, and $l_0$-norms, we introduce primal-dual\nproximal gradient descent attack. We show in the experiments that our attack\noutperforms current state-of-the-art $l_{\\infty}$-, $l_2$-, $l_1$-, and\n$l_0$-attacks on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Restricted ImageNet datasets against\nunregularised and adversarially trained models.",

          "description": "We tackle the task of video moment retrieval (VMR), which aims to localize a\nspecific moment in a video according to a textual query. Existing methods\nprimarily model the matching relationship between query and moment by complex\ncross-modal interactions. Despite their effectiveness, current models mostly\nexploit dataset biases while ignoring the video content, thus leading to poor\ngeneralizability. We argue that the issue is caused by the hidden confounder in\nVMR, {i.e., temporal location of moments}, that spuriously correlates the model\ninput and prediction. How to design robust matching models against the temporal\nlocation biases is crucial but, as far as we know, has not been studied yet for\nVMR.\n\nTo fill the research gap, we propose a causality-inspired VMR framework that\nbuilds structural causal model to capture the true effect of query and video\ncontent on the prediction. Specifically, we develop a Deconfounded Cross-modal\nMatching (DCM) method to remove the confounding effects of moment location. It\nfirst disentangles moment representation to infer the core feature of visual\ncontent, and then applies causal intervention on the disentangled multimodal\ninput based on backdoor adjustment, which forces the model to fairly\nincorporate each possible location of the target into consideration. Extensive\nexperiments clearly show that our approach can achieve significant improvement\nover the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and generalization\n(Codes:\n\\color{blue}{\\url{https://github.com/Xun-Yang/Causal_Video_Moment_Retrieval}}",

          "description": "Seamlessly blending features from multiple images is extremely challenging\nbecause of complex relationships in lighting, geometry, and partial occlusion\nwhich cause coupling between different parts of the image. Even though recent\nwork on GANs enables synthesis of realistic hair or faces, it remains difficult\nto combine them into a single, coherent, and plausible image rather than a\ndisjointed set of image patches. We present a novel solution to image blending,\nparticularly for the problem of hairstyle transfer, based on GAN-inversion. We\npropose a novel latent space for image blending which is better at preserving\ndetail and encoding spatial information, and propose a new GAN-embedding\nalgorithm which is able to slightly modify images to conform to a common\nsegmentation mask. Our novel representation enables the transfer of the visual\nproperties from multiple reference images including specific details such as\nmoles and wrinkles, and because we do image blending in a latent-space we are\nable to synthesize images that are coherent. Our approach avoids blending\nartifacts present in other approaches and finds a globally consistent image.\nOur results demonstrate a significant improvement over the current state of the\nart in a user study, with users preferring our blending solution over 95\npercent of the time.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks(DNNs) is vulnerable to be attacked by adversarial\nexamples. Black-box attack is the most threatening attack. At present,\nblack-box attack methods mainly adopt gradient-based iterative attack methods,\nwhich usually limit the relationship between the iteration step size, the\nnumber of iterations, and the maximum perturbation. In this paper, we propose a\nnew gradient iteration framework, which redefines the relationship between the\nabove three. Under this framework, we easily improve the attack success rate of\nDI-TI-MIM. In addition, we propose a gradient iterative attack method based on\ninput dropout, which can be well combined with our framework. We further\npropose a multi dropout rate version of this method. Experimental results show\nthat our best method can achieve attack success rate of 96.2\\% for defense\nmodel on average, which is higher than the state-of-the-art gradient-based\nattacks.",

          "description": "Fooling people with highly realistic fake images generated with Deepfake or\nGANs brings a great social disturbance to our society. Many methods have been\nproposed to detect fake images, but they are vulnerable to adversarial\nperturbations -- intentionally designed noises that can lead to the wrong\nprediction. Existing methods of attacking fake image detectors usually generate\nadversarial perturbations to perturb almost the entire image. This is redundant\nand increases the perceptibility of perturbations. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method to disrupt the fake image detection by determining key pixels to a\nfake image detector and attacking only the key pixels, which results in the\n$L_0$ and the $L_2$ norms of adversarial perturbations much less than those of\nexisting works. Experiments on two public datasets with three fake image\ndetectors indicate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both white-box and black-box attacks.",

          "description": "Mutual knowledge distillation (MKD) improves a model by distilling knowledge\nfrom another model. However, not all knowledge is certain and correct,\nespecially under adverse conditions. For example, label noise usually leads to\nless reliable models due to the undesired memorisation [1, 2]. Wrong knowledge\nmisleads the learning rather than helps. This problem can be handled by two\naspects: (i) improving the reliability of a model where the knowledge is from\n(i.e., knowledge source's reliability); (ii) selecting reliable knowledge for\ndistillation. In the literature, making a model more reliable is widely studied\nwhile selective MKD receives little attention. Therefore, we focus on studying\nselective MKD and highlight its importance in this work.\n\nConcretely, a generic MKD framework, Confident knowledge selection followed\nby Mutual Distillation (CMD), is designed. The key component of CMD is a\ngeneric knowledge selection formulation, making the selection threshold either\nstatic (CMD-S) or progressive (CMD-P). Additionally, CMD covers two special\ncases: zero knowledge and all knowledge, leading to a unified MKD framework. We\nempirically find CMD-P performs better than CMD-S. The main reason is that a\nmodel's knowledge upgrades and becomes confident as the training progresses.\n\nExtensive experiments are present to demonstrate the effectiveness of CMD and\nthoroughly justify the design of CMD. For example, CMD-P obtains new\nstate-of-the-art results in robustness against label noise.",

Recently, Transformers --\noriginally introduced in natural language processing -- have been increasingly\nadopted in computer vision.

          "description": "3D convolution is powerful for video classification but often computationally\nexpensive, recent studies mainly focus on decomposing it on spatial-temporal\nand/or channel dimensions. Unfortunately, most approaches fail to achieve a\npreferable balance between convolutional efficiency and feature-interaction\nsufficiency. For this reason, we propose a concise and novel Channel\nTensorization Network (CT-Net), by treating the channel dimension of input\nfeature as a multiplication of K sub-dimensions. On one hand, it naturally\nfactorizes convolution in a multiple dimension way, leading to a light\ncomputation burden. On the other hand, it can effectively enhance feature\ninteraction from different channels, and progressively enlarge the 3D receptive\nfield of such interaction to boost classification accuracy. Furthermore, we\nequip our CT-Module with a Tensor Excitation (TE) mechanism. It can learn to\nexploit spatial, temporal and channel attention in a high-dimensional manner,\nto improve the cooperative power of all the feature dimensions in our\nCT-Module. Finally, we flexibly adapt ResNet as our CT-Net. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on several challenging video benchmarks, e.g.,\nKinetics-400, Something-Something V1 and V2. Our CT-Net outperforms a number of\nrecent SOTA approaches, in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. The codes and\nmodels will be available on https://github.com/Andy1621/CT-Net.",

In modern settings, the\ncompression of high-dimensional neural representations to low-dimensional\nbinary codes is a challenging task and often require large bit-codes to be\naccurate. In this work, we propose a novel method for Learning Low-dimensional\nbinary Codes (LLC) for instances as well as classes. Our method does not\nrequire any side-information, like annotated attributes or label meta-data, and\nlearns extremely low-dimensional binary codes (~20 bits for ImageNet-1K). The\nlearnt codes are super-efficient while still ensuring nearly optimal\nclassification accuracy for ResNet50 on ImageNet-1K. We demonstrate that the\nlearnt codes capture intrinsically important features in the data, by\ndiscovering an intuitive taxonomy over classes. We further quantitatively\nmeasure the quality of our codes by applying it to the efficient image\nretrieval as well as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problems. For\nImageNet-100 retrieval problem, our learnt binary codes outperform 16 bit\nHashNet using only 10 bits and also are as accurate as 10 dimensional real\nrepresentations.

          "description": "This paper addresses the problem of 3D hand pose estimation from a monocular\nRGB image. While previous methods have shown great success, the structure of\nhands has not been fully exploited, which is critical in pose estimation. To\nthis end, we propose a regularized graph representation learning under a\nconditional adversarial learning framework for 3D hand pose estimation, aiming\nto capture structural inter-dependencies of hand joints. In particular, we\nestimate an initial hand pose from a parametric hand model as a prior of hand\nstructure, which regularizes the inference of the structural deformation in the\nprior pose for accurate graph representation learning via residual graph\nconvolution. To optimize the hand structure further, we propose two\nbone-constrained loss functions, which characterize the morphable structure of\nhand poses explicitly. Also, we introduce an adversarial learning framework\nconditioned on the input image with a multi-source discriminator, which imposes\nthe structural constraints onto the distribution of generated 3D hand poses for\nanthropomorphically valid hand poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour model sets the new state-of-the-art in 3D hand pose estimation from a\nmonocular image on five standard benchmarks.",

          "description": "Reference-based Super-Resolution (Ref-SR) has recently emerged as a promising\nparadigm to enhance a low-resolution (LR) input image by introducing an\nadditional high-resolution (HR) reference image. Existing Ref-SR methods mostly\nrely on implicit correspondence matching to borrow HR textures from reference\nimages to compensate for the information loss in input images. However,\nperforming local transfer is difficult because of two gaps between input and\nreference images: the transformation gap (e.g. scale and rotation) and the\nresolution gap (e.g. HR and LR). To tackle these challenges, we propose\nC2-Matching in this work, which produces explicit robust matching crossing\ntransformation and resolution. 1) For the transformation gap, we propose a\ncontrastive correspondence network, which learns transformation-robust\ncorrespondences using augmented views of the input image. 2) For the resolution\ngap, we adopt a teacher-student correlation distillation, which distills\nknowledge from the easier HR-HR matching to guide the more ambiguous LR-HR\nmatching. 3) Finally, we design a dynamic aggregation module to address the\npotential misalignment issue. In addition, to faithfully evaluate the\nperformance of Ref-SR under a realistic setting, we contribute the\nWebly-Referenced SR (WR-SR) dataset, mimicking the practical usage scenario.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed C2-Matching significantly\noutperforms state of the arts by over 1dB on the standard CUFED5 benchmark.\nNotably, it also shows great generalizability on WR-SR dataset as well as\nrobustness across large scale and rotation transformations.",

          "description": "Existing rotated object detectors are mostly inherited from the horizontal\ndetection paradigm, as the latter has evolved into a well-developed area.\nHowever, these detectors are difficult to perform prominently in high-precision\ndetection due to the limitation of current regression loss design, especially\nfor objects with large aspect ratios. Taking the perspective that horizontal\ndetection is a special case for rotated object detection, in this paper, we are\nmotivated to change the design of rotation regression loss from induction\nparadigm to deduction methodology, in terms of the relation between rotation\nand horizontal detection. We show that one essential challenge is how to\nmodulate the coupled parameters in the rotation regression loss, as such the\nestimated parameters can influence to each other during the dynamic joint\noptimization, in an adaptive and synergetic way. Specifically, we first convert\nthe rotated bounding box into a 2-D Gaussian distribution, and then calculate\nthe Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the Gaussian distributions as the\nregression loss. By analyzing the gradient of each parameter, we show that KLD\n(and its derivatives) can dynamically adjust the parameter gradients according\nto the characteristics of the object. It will adjust the importance (gradient\nweight) of the angle parameter according to the aspect ratio. This mechanism\ncan be vital for high-precision detection as a slight angle error would cause a\nserious accuracy drop for large aspect ratios objects. More importantly, we\nhave proved that KLD is scale invariant. We further show that the KLD loss can\nbe degenerated into the popular $l_{n}$-norm loss for horizontal detection.\nExperimental results on seven datasets using different detectors show its\nconsistent superiority, and codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/yangxue0827/RotationDetection.",

Research has shown\nthat the use of multi-parametric magnetic resonance images to conduct biopsies\ncan drastically help to mitigate the overdiagnosis, thus reducing the side\neffects on healthy patients. This study aims to investigate the use of deep\nlearning techniques to explore computer-aid diagnosis based on MRI as input.\nSeveral diagnosis problems ranging from classification of lesions as being\nclinically significant or not to the detection and segmentation of lesions are\naddressed with deep learning based approaches.\n\nThis thesis tackled two main problems regarding the diagnosis of prostate\ncancer. Firstly, XmasNet was used to conduct two large experiments on the\nclassification of lesions. Secondly, detection and segmentation experiments\nwere conducted, first on the prostate and afterward on the prostate cancer\nlesions. The former experiments explored the lesions through a two-dimensional\nspace, while the latter explored models to work with three-dimensional inputs.\nFor this task, the 3D models explored were the 3D U-Net and a pretrained 3D\nResNet-18. A rigorous analysis of all these problems was conducted with a total\nof two networks, two cropping techniques, two resampling techniques, two crop\nsizes, five input sizes and data augmentations experimented for lesion\nclassification. While for segmentation two models, two input sizes and data\naugmentations were experimented. However, while the binary classification of\nthe clinical significance of lesions and the detection and segmentation of the\nprostate already achieve the desired results (0.870 AUC and 0.915 dice score\nrespectively), the classification of the PIRADS score and the segmentation of\nlesions still have a large margin to improve (0.664 accuracy and 0.690 dice\nscore respectively).",

          "description": "Attention is sparse in vision transformers. We observe the final prediction\nin vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens,\nwhich is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation,\nwe propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens\nprogressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a\nlightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token\ngiven the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune\nredundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an\nend-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably\nprune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from\nthe nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware\nfriendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By\nhierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces\n31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of\naccuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers.

          "description": "In this paper, we propose a novel method for separately estimating spectral\ndistributions from images captured by a typical RGB camera. The proposed method\nallows us to separately estimate a spectral distribution of illumination,\nreflectance, or camera sensitivity, while recent hyperspectral cameras are\nlimited to capturing a joint spectral distribution from a scene. In addition,\nthe use of Bayesian inference makes it possible to take into account prior\ninformation of both spectral distributions and image noise as probability\ndistributions. As a result, the proposed method can estimate spectral\ndistributions in a unified way, and it can enhance the robustness of the\nestimation against noise, which conventional spectral-distribution estimation\nmethods cannot. The use of Bayesian inference also enables us to obtain the\nconfidence of estimation results. In an experiment, the proposed method is\nshown not only to outperform conventional estimation methods in terms of RMSE\nbut also to be robust against noise.",

          "description": "The goal of this paper is guided image filtering, which emphasizes the\nimportance of structure transfer during filtering by means of an additional\nguidance image. Where classical guided filters transfer structures using\nhand-designed functions, recent guided filters have been considerably advanced\nthrough parametric learning of deep networks. The state-of-the-art leverages\ndeep networks to estimate the two core coefficients of the guided filter. In\nthis work, we posit that simultaneously estimating both coefficients is\nsuboptimal, resulting in halo artifacts and structure inconsistencies. Inspired\nby unsharp masking, a classical technique for edge enhancement that requires\nonly a single coefficient, we propose a new and simplified formulation of the\nguided filter. Our formulation enjoys a filtering prior from a low-pass filter\nand enables explicit structure transfer by estimating a single coefficient.\nBased on our proposed formulation, we introduce a successive guided filtering\nnetwork, which provides multiple filtering results from a single network,\nallowing for a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Extensive ablations,\ncomparisons and analysis show the effectiveness and efficiency of our\nformulation and network, resulting in state-of-the-art results across filtering\ntasks like upsampling, denoising, and cross-modality filtering.

          "description": "We address the problem of recovering the shape and spatially-varying\nreflectance of an object from posed multi-view images of the object illuminated\nby one unknown lighting condition. This enables the rendering of novel views of\nthe object under arbitrary environment lighting and editing of the object's\nmaterial properties. The key to our approach, which we call Neural Radiance\nFactorization (NeRFactor), is to distill the volumetric geometry of a Neural\nRadiance Field (NeRF) [Mildenhall et al. 2020] representation of the object\ninto a surface representation and then jointly refine the geometry while\nsolving for the spatially-varying reflectance and the environment lighting.\nSpecifically, NeRFactor recovers 3D neural fields of surface normals, light\nvisibility, albedo, and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions\n(BRDFs) without any supervision, using only a re-rendering loss, simple\nsmoothness priors, and a data-driven BRDF prior learned from real-world BRDF\nmeasurements. By explicitly modeling light visibility, NeRFactor is able to\nseparate shadows from albedo and synthesize realistic soft or hard shadows\nunder arbitrary lighting conditions. NeRFactor is able to recover convincing 3D\nmodels for free-viewpoint relighting in this challenging and underconstrained\ncapture setup for both synthetic and real scenes. Qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments show that NeRFactor outperforms classic and deep learning-based\nstate of the art across various tasks.

          "description": "Controllable person image generation aims to produce realistic human images\nwith desirable attributes (e.g., the given pose, cloth textures or hair style).\nHowever, the large spatial misalignment between the source and target images\nmakes the standard architectures for image-to-image translation not suitable\nfor this task. Most of the state-of-the-art architectures avoid the alignment\nstep during the generation, which causes many artifacts, especially for person\nimages with complex textures. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel\nSpatially-Adaptive Warped Normalization (SAWN), which integrates a learned\nflow-field to warp modulation parameters. This allows us to align person\nspatial-adaptive styles with pose features efficiently. Moreover, we propose a\nnovel self-training part replacement strategy to refine the pretrained model\nfor the texture-transfer task, significantly improving the quality of the\ngenerated cloth and the preservation ability of irrelevant regions. Our\nexperimental results on the widely used DeepFashion dataset demonstrate a\nsignificant improvement of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art\nmethods on both pose-transfer and texture-transfer tasks.

We used lateral view knee radiographs from MOST public use\ndatasets (n = 5507 knees). Patellar region-of-interest (ROI) was automatically\ndetected using landmark detection tool (BoneFinder). Hand-crafted features,\nbased on LocalBinary Patterns (LBP), were then extracted to describe the\npatellar texture. First, a machine learning model (Gradient Boosting Machine)\nwas trained to detect radiographic PFOA from the LBP features. Furthermore, we\nused end-to-end trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) directly on\nthe texture patches for detecting the PFOA. The proposed classification models\nwere eventually compared with more conventional reference models that use\nclinical assessments and participant characteristics such as age, sex, body\nmass index(BMI), the total WOMAC score, and tibiofemoral Kellgren-Lawrence (KL)\ngrade. Atlas-guided visual assessment of PFOA status by expert readers provided\nin the MOST public use datasets was used as a classification outcome for the\nmodels. Performance of prediction models was assessed using the area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC), the area under the\nprecision-recall (PR) curve-average precision (AP)-, and Brier score in the\nstratified 5-fold cross validation setting.Of the 5507 knees, 953 (17.3%) had\nPFOA. AUC and AP for the strongest reference model including age, sex, BMI,\nWOMAC score, and tibiofemoral KL grade to predict PFOA were 0.817 and 0.487,\nrespectively. Textural ROI classification using CNN significantly improved the\nprediction performance (ROC AUC= 0.889, AP= 0.714).

          "description": "Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is an effective non-destructive evaluation\n(NDE) device for inspecting and surveying subsurface objects (i.e., rebars,\nutility pipes) in complex environments. However, the current practice for GPR\ndata collection requires a human inspector to move a GPR cart along pre-marked\ngrid lines and record the GPR data in both X and Y directions for\npost-processing by 3D GPR imaging software. It is time-consuming and tedious\nwork to survey a large area. Furthermore, identifying the subsurface targets\ndepends on the knowledge of an experienced engineer, who has to make manual and\nsubjective interpretation that limits the GPR applications, especially in\nlarge-scale scenarios. In addition, the current GPR imaging technology is not\nintuitive, and not for normal users to understand, and not friendly to\nvisualize. To address the above challenges, this paper presents a novel robotic\nsystem to collect GPR data, interpret GPR data, localize the underground\nutilities, reconstruct and visualize the underground objects' dense point cloud\nmodel in a user-friendly manner. This system is composed of three modules: 1) a\nvision-aided Omni-directional robotic data collection platform, which enables\nthe GPR antenna to scan the target area freely with an arbitrary trajectory\nwhile using a visual-inertial-based positioning module tags the GPR\nmeasurements with positioning information; 2) a deep neural network (DNN)\nmigration module to interpret the raw GPR B-scan image into a cross-section of\nobject model; 3) a DNN-based 3D reconstruction method, i.e., GPRNet, to\ngenerate underground utility model represented as fine 3D point cloud.\nComparative studies on synthetic and field GPR raw data with various\nincompleteness and noise are performed.",

          "description": "Contrastive learning has shown superior performance in embedding global and\nspatial invariant features in computer vision (e.g., image classification).\nHowever, its overall success of embedding local and spatial variant features is\nstill limited, especially for semantic segmentation. In a per-pixel prediction\ntask, more than one label can exist in a single image for segmentation (e.g.,\nan image contains both cat, dog, and grass), thereby it is difficult to define\n'positive' or 'negative' pairs in a canonical contrastive learning setting. In\nthis paper, we propose an attention-guided supervised contrastive learning\napproach to highlight a single semantic object every time as the target. With\nour design, the same image can be embedded to different semantic clusters with\nsemantic attention (i.e., coerce semantic masks) as an additional input\nchannel. To achieve such attention, a novel two-stage training strategy is\npresented. We evaluate the proposed method on multi-organ medical image\nsegmentation task, as our major task, with both in-house data and BTCV 2015\ndatasets. Comparing with the supervised and semi-supervised training\nstate-of-the-art in the backbone of ResNet-50, our proposed pipeline yields\nsubstantial improvement of 5.53% and 6.09% in Dice score for both medical image\nsegmentation cohorts respectively. The performance of the proposed method on\nnatural images is assessed via PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and achieves 2.75%\nsubstantial improvement.",

          "description": "Large-scale crop yield estimation is, in part, made possible due to the\navailability of remote sensing data allowing for the continuous monitoring of\ncrops throughout their growth cycle. Having this information allows\nstakeholders the ability to make real-time decisions to maximize yield\npotential. Although various models exist that predict yield from remote sensing\ndata, there currently does not exist an approach that can estimate yield for\nmultiple crops simultaneously, and thus leads to more accurate predictions. A\nmodel that predicts the yield of multiple crops and concurrently considers the\ninteraction between multiple crop yields. We propose a new convolutional neural\nnetwork model called YieldNet which utilizes a novel deep learning framework\nthat uses transfer learning between corn and soybean yield predictions by\nsharing the weights of the backbone feature extractor. Additionally, to\nconsider the multi-target response variable, we propose a new loss function. We\nconduct our experiment using data from 1,132 counties for corn and 1,076\ncounties for soybean across the United States. Numerical results demonstrate\nthat our proposed method accurately predicts corn and soybean yield from one to\nfour months before the harvest with a MAE being 8.74% and 8.70% of the average\nyield, respectively, and is competitive to other state-of-the-art approaches.",

          "description": "Neuromorphic sensing and computing hold a promise for highly energy-efficient\nand high-bandwidth-sensor processing. A major challenge for neuromorphic\ncomputing is that learning algorithms for traditional artificial neural\nnetworks (ANNs) do not transfer directly to spiking neural networks (SNNs) due\nto the discrete spikes and more complex neuronal dynamics. As a consequence,\nSNNs have not yet been successfully applied to complex, large-scale tasks. In\nthis article, we focus on the self-supervised learning problem of optical flow\nestimation from event-based camera inputs, and investigate the changes that are\nnecessary to the state-of-the-art ANN training pipeline in order to\nsuccessfully tackle it with SNNs. More specifically, we first modify the input\nevent representation to encode a much smaller time slice with minimal explicit\ntemporal information. Consequently, we make the network's neuronal dynamics and\nrecurrent connections responsible for integrating information over time.\nMoreover, we reformulate the self-supervised loss function for event-based\noptical flow to improve its convexity. We perform experiments with various\ntypes of recurrent ANNs and SNNs using the proposed pipeline. Concerning SNNs,\nwe investigate the effects of elements such as parameter initialization and\noptimization, surrogate gradient shape, and adaptive neuronal mechanisms. We\nfind that initialization and surrogate gradient width play a crucial part in\nenabling learning with sparse inputs, while the inclusion of adaptivity and\nlearnable neuronal parameters can improve performance. We show that the\nperformance of the proposed ANNs and SNNs are on par with that of the current\nstate-of-the-art ANNs trained in a self-supervised manner.",

We show that\nour architecture outperforms a baseline based on Transformer, both in terms of\naccuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we develop a user\ninterface to integrate our neural model in Unity, a real-time 3D development\nplatform. Furthermore, we introduce two new datasets representing the static\nhuman pose modeling problem, based on high-quality human motion capture data,\nwhich will be released publicly along with model code.",

          "description": "Exploiting multi-scale features has shown great potential in tackling\nsemantic segmentation problems. The aggregation is commonly done with sum or\nconcatenation (concat) followed by convolutional (conv) layers. However, it\nfully passes down the high-level context to the following hierarchy without\nconsidering their interrelation. In this work, we aim to enable the low-level\nfeature to aggregate the complementary context from adjacent high-level feature\nmaps by a cross-scale pixel-to-region relation operation. We leverage\ncross-scale context propagation to make the long-range dependency capturable\neven by the high-resolution low-level features. To this end, we employ an\nefficient feature pyramid network to obtain multi-scale features. We propose a\nRelational Semantics Extractor (RSE) and Relational Semantics Propagator (RSP)\nfor context extraction and propagation respectively. Then we stack several RSP\ninto an RSP head to achieve the progressive top-down distribution of the\ncontext. Experiment results on two challenging datasets Cityscapes and COCO\ndemonstrate that the RSP head performs competitively on both semantic\nsegmentation and panoptic segmentation with high efficiency. It outperforms\nDeeplabV3 [1] by 0.7% with 75% fewer FLOPs (multiply-adds) in the semantic\nsegmentation task.",

DR broadly is classified into two stages - non-proliferative (NPDR),\nwhere there are almost no symptoms, except a few microaneurysms, and\nproliferative (PDR) involving a huge number of microaneurysms and hemorrhages,\nsoft and hard exudates, neo-vascularization, macular ischemia or a combination\nof these, making it easier to detect. More specifically, DR is usually\nclassified into five levels, labeled 0-4, from 0 indicating no DR to 4 which is\nmost severe.

However, a standalone datum is\nnot perceiving the context of the holistic cluster, and may undergo sub-optimal\nassignment. In this paper, we extend the mainstream contrastive learning\nparadigm to a cluster-level scheme, where all the data subjected to the same\ncluster contribute to a unified representation that encodes the context of each\ndata group. Contrastive learning with this representation then rewards the\nassignment of each datum. To implement this vision, we propose twin-contrast\nclustering (TCC). We define a set of categorical variables as clustering\nassignment confidence, which links the instance-level learning track with the\ncluster-level one. On one hand, with the corresponding assignment variables\nbeing the weight, a weighted aggregation along the data points implements the\nset representation of a cluster. We further propose heuristic cluster\naugmentation equivalents to enable cluster-level contrastive learning. On the\nother hand, we derive the evidence lower-bound of the instance-level\ncontrastive objective with the assignments. By reparametrizing the assignment\nvariables, TCC is trained end-to-end, requiring no alternating steps.

Existing works focus on\nstudying the adversarial domain augmentation (ADA) to improve the model's\ngeneralization capability. The impact on domain generalization of the\nstatistics of normalization layers is still underinvestigated. In this paper,\nwe propose a generic normalization approach, adaptive standardization and\nrescaling normalization (ASR-Norm), to complement the missing part in previous\nworks. ASR-Norm learns both the standardization and rescaling statistics via\nneural networks. This new form of normalization can be viewed as a generic form\nof the traditional normalizations. When trained with ADA, the statistics in\nASR-Norm are learned to be adaptive to the data coming from different domains,\nand hence improves the model generalization performance across domains,\nespecially on the target domain with large discrepancy from the source domain.\nThe experimental results show that ASR-Norm can bring consistent improvement to\nthe state-of-the-art ADA approaches by 1.6%, 2.7%, and 6.3% averagely on the\nDigits, CIFAR-10-C, and PACS benchmarks, respectively.

          "description": "Neuromorphic neural network processors, in the form of compute-in-memory\ncrossbar arrays of memristors, or in the form of subthreshold analog and\nmixed-signal ASICs, promise enormous advantages in compute density and energy\nefficiency for NN-based ML tasks. However, these technologies are prone to\ncomputational non-idealities, due to process variation and intrinsic device\nphysics. This degrades the task performance of networks deployed to the\nprocessor, by introducing parameter noise into the deployed model. While it is\npossible to calibrate each device, or train networks individually for each\nprocessor, these approaches are expensive and impractical for commercial\ndeployment. Alternative methods are therefore needed to train networks that are\ninherently robust against parameter variation, as a consequence of network\narchitecture and parameters. We present a new adversarial network optimisation\nalgorithm that attacks network parameters during training, and promotes robust\nperformance during inference in the face of parameter variation. Our approach\nintroduces a regularization term penalising the susceptibility of a network to\nweight perturbation. We compare against previous approaches for producing\nparameter insensitivity such as dropout, weight smoothing and introducing\nparameter noise during training. We show that our approach produces models that\nare more robust to targeted parameter variation, and equally robust to random\nparameter variation. Our approach finds minima in flatter locations in the\nweight-loss landscape compared with other approaches, highlighting that the\nnetworks found by our technique are less sensitive to parameter perturbation.\nOur work provides an approach to deploy neural network architectures to\ninference devices that suffer from computational non-idealities, with minimal\nloss of performance. ...",

          "description": "Kernel mean embedding is a useful tool to compare probability measures.\nDespite its usefulness, kernel mean embedding considers infinite-dimensional\nfeatures, which are challenging to handle in the context of differentially\nprivate data generation. A recent work proposes to approximate the kernel mean\nembedding of data distribution using finite-dimensional random features, where\nthe sensitivity of the features becomes analytically tractable. More\nimportantly, this approach significantly reduces the privacy cost, compared to\nother known privatization methods (e.g., DP-SGD), as the approximate kernel\nmean embedding of the data distribution is privatized only once and can then be\nrepeatedly used during training of a generator without incurring any further\nprivacy cost. However, the required number of random features is excessively\nhigh, often ten thousand to a hundred thousand, which worsens the sensitivity\nof the approximate kernel mean embedding. To improve the sensitivity, we\npropose to replace random features with Hermite polynomial features. Unlike the\nrandom features, the Hermite polynomial features are ordered, where the\nfeatures at the low orders contain more information on the distribution than\nthose at the high orders. Hence, a relatively low order of Hermite polynomial\nfeatures can more accurately approximate the mean embedding of the data\ndistribution compared to a significantly higher number of random features. As a\nresult, using the Hermite polynomial features, we significantly improve the\nprivacy-accuracy trade-off, reflected in the high quality and diversity of the\ngenerated data, when tested on several heterogeneous tabular datasets, as well\nas several image benchmark datasets.",

SAD optimizes the online inference efficiency for GEC\nby two innovations: 1) it aggressively decodes as many tokens as possible in\nparallel instead of always decoding only one token in each step to improve\ncomputational parallelism; 2) it uses a shallow decoder instead of the\nconventional Transformer architecture with balanced encoder-decoder depth to\nreduce the computational cost during inference. Experiments in both English and\nChinese GEC benchmarks show that aggressive decoding could yield the same\npredictions as greedy decoding but with a significant speedup for online\ninference. Its combination with the shallow decoder could offer an even higher\nonline inference speedup over the powerful Transformer baseline without quality\nloss.

This setup captures settings where different\ngroups of users have their own objectives (learning tasks) but by aggregating\ntheir data with others in the same cluster (same learning task), they can\nleverage the strength in numbers in order to perform more efficient federated\nlearning. For this new framework of clustered federated learning, we propose\nthe Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), which alternately\nestimates the cluster identities of the users and optimizes model parameters\nfor the user clusters via gradient descent. We analyze the convergence rate of\nthis algorithm first in a linear model with squared loss and then for generic\nstrongly convex and smooth loss functions. We show that in both settings, with\ngood initialization, IFCA is guaranteed to converge, and discuss the optimality\nof the statistical error rate. In particular, for the linear model with two\nclusters, we can guarantee that our algorithm converges as long as the\ninitialization is slightly better than random. When the clustering structure is\nambiguous, we propose to train the models by combining IFCA with the weight\nsharing technique in multi-task learning. In the experiments, we show that our\nalgorithm can succeed even if we relax the requirements on initialization with\nrandom initialization and multiple restarts.

While recent\nwork has illustrated that the dataset and the training algorithm must be taken\ninto account in order to obtain meaningful generalization bounds, it is still\ntheoretically not clear which properties of the data and the algorithm\ndetermine the generalization performance. In this study, we approach this\nproblem from a dynamical systems theory perspective and represent stochastic\noptimization algorithms as random iterated function systems (IFS). Well studied\nin the dynamical systems literature, under mild assumptions, such IFSs can be\nshown to be ergodic with an invariant measure that is often supported on sets\nwith a fractal structure. As our main contribution, we prove that the\ngeneralization error of a stochastic optimization algorithm can be bounded\nbased on the `complexity' of the fractal structure that underlies its invariant\nmeasure. Leveraging results from dynamical systems theory, we show that the\ngeneralization error can be explicitly linked to the choice of the algorithm\n(e.g., stochastic gradient descent -- SGD), algorithm hyperparameters (e.g.,\nstep-size, batch-size), and the geometry of the problem (e.g., Hessian of the\nloss). We further specialize our results to specific problems (e.g.,\nlinear/logistic regression, one hidden-layered neural networks) and algorithms\n(e.g., SGD and preconditioned variants), and obtain analytical estimates for\nour bound.For modern neural networks, we develop an efficient algorithm to\ncompute the developed bound and support our theory with various experiments on\nneural networks.",

          "description": "Combinatorial Optimization (CO) has been a long-standing challenging research\ntopic featured by its NP-hard nature. Traditionally such problems are\napproximately solved with heuristic algorithms which are usually fast but may\nsacrifice the solution quality. Currently, machine learning for combinatorial\noptimization (MLCO) has become a trending research topic, but most existing\nMLCO methods treat CO as a single-level optimization by directly learning the\nend-to-end solutions, which are hard to scale up and mostly limited by the\ncapacity of ML models given the high complexity of CO. In this paper, we\npropose a hybrid approach to combine the best of the two worlds, in which a\nbi-level framework is developed with an upper-level learning method to optimize\nthe graph (e.g. add, delete or modify edges in a graph), fused with a\nlower-level heuristic algorithm solving on the optimized graph. Such a bi-level\napproach simplifies the learning on the original hard CO and can effectively\nmitigate the demand for model capacity. The experiments and results on several\npopular CO problems like Directed Acyclic Graph scheduling, Graph Edit Distance\nand Hamiltonian Cycle Problem show its effectiveness over manually designed\nheuristics and single-level learning methods.",

          "description": "Neural Transfer Learning (TL) is becoming ubiquitous in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), thanks to its high performance on many tasks, especially in\nlow-resourced scenarios. Notably, TL is widely used for neural domain\nadaptation to transfer valuable knowledge from high-resource to low-resource\ndomains. In the standard fine-tuning scheme of TL, a model is initially\npre-trained on a source domain and subsequently fine-tuned on a target domain\nand, therefore, source and target domains are trained using the same\narchitecture. In this paper, we show through interpretation methods that such\nscheme, despite its efficiency, is suffering from a main limitation. Indeed,\nalthough capable of adapting to new domains, pre-trained neurons struggle with\nlearning certain patterns that are specific to the target domain. Moreover, we\nshed light on the hidden negative transfer occurring despite the high\nrelatedness between source and target domains, which may mitigate the final\ngain brought by transfer learning. To address these problems, we propose to\naugment the pre-trained model with normalised, weighted and randomly\ninitialised units that foster a better adaptation while maintaining the\nvaluable source knowledge. We show that our approach exhibits significant\nimprovements to the standard fine-tuning scheme for neural domain adaptation\nfrom the news domain to the social media domain on four NLP tasks:\npart-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition and morphosyntactic\ntagging.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs), while accurate, are expensive to train. Many\npractitioners, therefore, outsource the training process to third parties or\nuse pre-trained DNNs. This practice makes DNNs vulnerable to $backdoor$\n$attacks$: the third party who trains the model may act maliciously to inject\nhidden behaviors into the otherwise accurate model. Until now, the mechanism to\ninject backdoors has been limited to $poisoning$.\n\nWe argue that such a supply-chain attacker has more attack techniques\navailable. To study this hypothesis, we introduce a handcrafted attack that\ndirectly manipulates the parameters of a pre-trained model to inject backdoors.\nOur handcrafted attacker has more degrees of freedom in manipulating model\nparameters than poisoning. This makes it difficult for a defender to identify\nor remove the manipulations with straightforward methods, such as statistical\nanalysis, adding random noises to model parameters, or clipping their values\nwithin a certain range. Further, our attacker can combine the handcrafting\nprocess with additional techniques, $e.g.$, jointly optimizing a trigger\npattern, to inject backdoors into complex networks effectively$-$the\nmeet-in-the-middle attack.\n\nIn evaluations, our handcrafted backdoors remain effective across four\ndatasets and four network architectures with a success rate above 96%. Our\nbackdoored models are resilient to both parameter-level backdoor removal\ntechniques and can evade existing defenses by slightly changing the backdoor\nattack configurations. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of suppressing\nunwanted behaviors otherwise caused by poisoning. Our results suggest that\nfurther research is needed for understanding the complete space of supply-chain\nbackdoor attacks.",

          "description": "Bayesian model averaging, obtained as the expectation of a likelihood\nfunction by a posterior distribution, has been widely used for prediction,\nevaluation of uncertainty, and model selection. Various approaches have been\ndeveloped to efficiently capture the information in the posterior distribution;\none such approach is the optimization of a set of models simultaneously with\ninteraction to ensure the diversity of the individual models in the same way as\nensemble learning. A representative approach is particle variational inference\n(PVI), which uses an ensemble of models as an empirical approximation for the\nposterior distribution. PVI iteratively updates each model with a repulsion\nforce to ensure the diversity of the optimized models. However, despite its\npromising performance, a theoretical understanding of this repulsion and its\nassociation with the generalization ability remains unclear. In this paper, we\ntackle this problem in light of PAC-Bayesian analysis. First, we provide a new\nsecond-order Jensen inequality, which has the repulsion term based on the loss\nfunction. Thanks to the repulsion term, it is tighter than the standard Jensen\ninequality. Then, we derive a novel generalization error bound and show that it\ncan be reduced by enhancing the diversity of models. Finally, we derive a new\nPVI that optimizes the generalization error bound directly. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that the performance of the proposed PVI compares\nfavorably with existing methods in the experiment.",

          "description": "As a generic modeling tool, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been\nwidely employed in image generation and translation tasks. However, when fed\nwith a flat input, current CNN models may fail to generate vivid results due to\nthe spatially shared convolution kernels. We call it the flatness degradation\nof CNNs. Unfortunately, such degradation is the greatest obstacles to generate\na spatially-variant output from a flat input, which has been barely discussed\nin the previous literature. To tackle this problem, we propose a model agnostic\nsolution, i.e. Noise Incentive Block (NIB), which serves as a generic plug-in\nfor any CNN generation model. The key idea is to break the flat input condition\nwhile keeping the intactness of the original information. Specifically, the NIB\nperturbs the input data symmetrically with a noise map and reassembles them in\nthe feature domain as driven by the objective function. Extensive experiments\nshow that existing CNN models equipped with NIB survive from the flatness\ndegradation and are able to generate visually better results with richer\ndetails in some specific image generation tasks given flat inputs, e.g.\nsemantic image synthesis, data-hidden image generation, and deep neural\ndithering.",

          "description": "Neural radiance fields (NeRF) methods have demonstrated impressive novel view\nsynthesis performance. The core approach is to render individual rays by\nquerying a neural network at points sampled along the ray to obtain the density\nand colour of the sampled points, and integrating this information using the\nrendering equation. Since dense sampling is computationally prohibitive, a\ncommon solution is to perform coarse-to-fine sampling.\n\nIn this work we address a clear limitation of the vanilla coarse-to-fine\napproach -- that it is based on a heuristic and not trained end-to-end for the\ntask at hand. We introduce a differentiable module that learns to propose\nsamples and their importance for the fine network, and consider and compare\nmultiple alternatives for its neural architecture. Training the proposal module\nfrom scratch can be unstable due to lack of supervision, so an effective\npre-training strategy is also put forward. The approach, named `NeRF in detail'\n(NeRF-ID), achieves superior view synthesis quality over NeRF and the\nstate-of-the-art on the synthetic Blender benchmark and on par or better\nperformance on the real LLFF-NeRF scenes. Furthermore, by leveraging the\npredicted sample importance, a 25% saving in computation can be achieved\nwithout significantly sacrificing the rendering quality.",

          "description": "Prior studies have shown that, training machine learning models via empirical\nloss minimization to maximize a utility metric (e.g., accuracy), might yield\nmodels that make discriminatory predictions. To alleviate this issue, we\ndevelop a new training algorithm, named BiFair, which jointly minimizes for a\nutility, and a fairness loss of interest. Crucially, we do so without directly\nmodifying the training objective, e.g., by adding regularization terms. Rather,\nwe learn a set of weights on the training dataset, such that, training on the\nweighted dataset ensures both good utility, and fairness. The dataset weights\nare learned in concurrence to the model training, which is done by solving a\nbilevel optimization problem using a held-out validation dataset. Overall, this\napproach yields models with better fairness-utility trade-offs. Particularly,\nwe compare our algorithm with three other state-of-the-art fair training\nalgorithms over three real-world datasets, and demonstrate that, BiFair\nconsistently performs better, i.e., we reach to better values of a given\nfairness metric under same, or higher accuracy.

From the classical perspective, however, much fewer parameters are\nsufficient for optimal estimation and prediction, whereas overparametrization\ncan be harmful even in the presence of explicit regularization. To reconcile\nthis conflict, we present a generalization theory for overparametrized ReLU\nnetworks by incorporating an explicit regularizer based on the scaled variation\nnorm. Interestingly, this regularizer is equivalent to the ridge from the angle\nof gradient-based optimization, but is similar to the group lasso in terms of\ncontrolling model complexity. By exploiting this ridge-lasso duality, we show\nthat overparametrization is generally harmless to two-layer ReLU networks. In\nparticular, the overparametrized estimators are minimax optimal up to a\nlogarithmic factor. By contrast, we show that overparametrized random feature\nmodels suffer from the curse of dimensionality and thus are suboptimal.",

          "description": "We consider speeding up stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by parallelizing it\nacross multiple workers. We assume the same data set is shared among $N$\nworkers, who can take SGD steps and coordinate with a central server. While it\nis possible to obtain a linear reduction in the variance by averaging all the\nstochastic gradients at every step, this requires a lot of communication\nbetween the workers and the server, which can dramatically reduce the gains\nfrom parallelism. The Local SGD method, proposed and analyzed in the earlier\nliterature, suggests machines should make many local steps between such\ncommunications. While the initial analysis of Local SGD showed it needs $\\Omega\n( \\sqrt{T} )$ communications for $T$ local gradient steps in order for the\nerror to scale proportionately to $1/(NT)$, this has been successively improved\nin a string of papers, with the state-of-the-art requiring $\\Omega \\left( N\n\\left( \\mbox{ polynomial in log } (T) \\right) \\right)$ communications. In this\npaper, we suggest a Local SGD scheme that communicates less overall by\ncommunicating less frequently as the number of iterations grows. Our analysis\nshows that this can achieve an error that scales as $1/(NT)$ with a number of\ncommunications that is completely independent of $T$. In particular, we show\nthat $\\Omega(N)$ communications are sufficient. Empirical evidence suggests\nthis bound is close to tight as we further show that $\\sqrt{N}$ or $N^{3/4}$\ncommunications fail to achieve linear speed-up in simulations. Moreover, we\nshow that under mild assumptions, the main of which is twice differentiability\non any neighborhood of the optimal solution, one-shot averaging which only uses\na single round of communication can also achieve the optimal convergence rate\nasymptotically.",

          "description": "Hierarchy and compositionality are common latent properties in many natural\nand scientific datasets. Determining when a deep network's hidden activations\nrepresent hierarchy and compositionality is important both for understanding\ndeep representation learning and for applying deep networks in domains where\ninterpretability is crucial. However, current benchmark machine learning\ndatasets either have little hierarchical or compositional structure, or the\nstructure is not known. This gap impedes precise analysis of a network's\nrepresentations and thus hinders development of new methods that can learn such\nproperties. To address this gap, we developed a new benchmark dataset with\nknown hierarchical and compositional structure. The Hangul Fonts Dataset (HFD)\nis comprised of 35 fonts from the Korean writing system (Hangul), each with\n11,172 blocks (syllables) composed from the product of initial consonant,\nmedial vowel, and final consonant glyphs. All blocks can be grouped into a few\ngeometric types which induces a hierarchy across blocks. In addition, each\nblock is composed of individual glyphs with rotations, translations, scalings,\nand naturalistic style variation across fonts. We find that both shallow and\ndeep unsupervised methods only show modest evidence of hierarchy and\ncompositionality in their representations of the HFD compared to supervised\ndeep networks. Supervised deep network representations contain structure\nrelated to the geometrical hierarchy of the characters, but the compositional\nstructure of the data is not evident. Thus, HFD enables the identification of\nshortcomings in existing methods, a critical first step toward developing new\nmachine learning algorithms to extract hierarchical and compositional structure\nin the context of naturalistic variability.",

In this paper, we\npropose a novel attacking algorithm which has an RL-based \"director\" searching\nfor the optimal policy perturbation, and an \"actor\" crafting state\nperturbations following the directions from the director (i.e. the actor\nexecutes targeted attacks). Our proposed algorithm, PA-AD, is theoretically\noptimal against an RL agent and significantly improves the efficiency compared\nwith prior RL-based works in environments with large or pixel state spaces.\nEmpirical results show that our proposed PA-AD universally outperforms\nstate-of-the-art attacking methods in a wide range of environments. Our method\ncan be easily applied to any RL algorithms to evaluate and improve their\nrobustness.",

In this paper, we conduct theoretical analysis of a\ngeneral representation model of path integration by grid cells, where the 2D\nself-position is encoded as a higher dimensional vector, and the 2D self-motion\nis represented by a general transformation of the vector. We identify two\nconditions on the transformation. One is a group representation condition that\nis necessary for path integration. The other is an isotropic scaling condition\nthat ensures locally conformal embedding, so that the error in the vector\nrepresentation translates proportionally to the error in the 2D self-position.\nThen we investigate the simplest transformation, i.e., the linear\ntransformation, uncover its explicit algebraic and geometric structure as\nmatrix Lie group of rotation, and establish the connection between the\nisotropic scaling condition and hexagon grid patterns of grid cells under the\nlinear transformation. Finally, with our optimization-based approach, we manage\nto learn hexagon grid patterns that share similar properties of the grid cells\nin the rodent brain.

          "description": "It is well known that adversarial attacks can fool deep neural networks with\nimperceptible perturbations. Although adversarial training significantly\nimproves model robustness, failure cases of defense still broadly exist. In\nthis work, we find that the adversarial attacks can also be vulnerable to small\nperturbations. Namely, on adversarially-trained models, perturbing adversarial\nexamples with a small random noise may invalidate their misled predictions.\nAfter carefully examining state-of-the-art attacks of various kinds, we find\nthat all these attacks have this deficiency to different extents. Enlightened\nby this finding, we propose to counter attacks by crafting more effective\ndefensive perturbations. Our defensive perturbations leverage the advantage\nthat adversarial training endows the ground-truth class with smaller local\nLipschitzness. By simultaneously attacking all the classes, the misled\npredictions with larger Lipschitzness can be flipped into correct ones. We\nverify our defensive perturbation with both empirical experiments and\ntheoretical analyses on a linear model. On CIFAR10, it boosts the\nstate-of-the-art model from 66.16% to 72.66% against the four attacks of\nAutoAttack, including 71.76% to 83.30% against the Square attack.

Keywords are terms that describe the most relevant\ninformation in a document. The main problem that researchers are facing is how\nto efficiently and accurately extract the core keywords from a document.\nHowever, previous keyword extraction approaches have utilized the text and\ngraph features, there is the lack of models that can properly learn and combine\nthese features in a best way.\n\nMethods: In this paper, we develop a multimodal Key-phrase extraction\napproach, namely Phraseformer, using transformer and graph embedding\ntechniques. In Phraseformer, each keyword candidate is presented by a vector\nwhich is the concatenation of the text and structure learning representations.\nPhraseformer takes the advantages of recent researches such as BERT and ExEm to\npreserve both representations. Also, the Phraseformer treats the key-phrase\nextraction task as a sequence labeling problem solved using classification\ntask.\n\nResults: We analyze the performance of Phraseformer on three datasets\nincluding Inspec, SemEval2010 and SemEval 2017 by F1-score. Also, we\ninvestigate the performance of different classifiers on Phraseformer method\nover Inspec dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nPhraseformer method over the three datasets used. Additionally, the Random\nForest classifier gain the highest F1-score among all classifiers.\n\nConclusions: Due to the fact that the combination of BERT and ExEm is more\nmeaningful and can better represent the semantic of words. Hence, Phraseformer\nsignificantly outperforms single-modality methods.",

          "description": "Measuring and promoting policy diversity is critical for solving games with\nstrong non-transitive dynamics where strategic cycles exist, and there is no\nconsistent winner (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors). With that in mind, maintaining a\npool of diverse policies via open-ended learning is an attractive solution,\nwhich can generate auto-curricula to avoid being exploited. However, in\nconventional open-ended learning algorithms, there are no widely accepted\ndefinitions for diversity, making it hard to construct and evaluate the diverse\npolicies. In this work, we summarize previous concepts of diversity and work\ntowards offering a unified measure of diversity in multi-agent open-ended\nlearning to include all elements in Markov games, based on both Behavioral\nDiversity (BD) and Response Diversity (RD). At the trajectory distribution\nlevel, we re-define BD in the state-action space as the discrepancies of\noccupancy measures. For the reward dynamics, we propose RD to characterize\ndiversity through the responses of policies when encountering different\nopponents. We also show that many current diversity measures fall in one of the\ncategories of BD or RD but not both. With this unified diversity measure, we\ndesign the corresponding diversity-promoting objective and population\neffectivity when seeking the best responses in open-ended learning. We validate\nour methods in both relatively simple games like matrix game, non-transitive\nmixture model, and the complex \\textit{Google Research Football} environment.\nThe population found by our methods reveals the lowest exploitability, highest\npopulation effectivity in matrix game and non-transitive mixture model, as well\nas the largest goal difference when interacting with opponents of various\nlevels in \\textit{Google Research Football}.",

This paper extends the setting to a multivariate Gaussian\nprocess where the basis functions are weighted with Gaussian graphical vectors.\nWe motivate a model where the basis functions represent different levels of\nresolution and the graphical vectors for each level are assumed to be\nindependent. Using an orthogonal basis grants linear complexity and memory\nusage in the number of spatial locations, the number of basis functions, and\nthe number of realizations. An additional fusion penalty encourages a\nparsimonious conditional independence structure in the multilevel graphical\nmodel.

In this problem, there is a user\nthat wishes to obtain $L$ independent linear combinations of a $D$-subset of\nmessages belonging to a dataset of $K$ messages stored on a single server. The\ngoal is to minimize the download cost while keeping the identity of each\nmessage required for the computation individually private. The individual\nprivacy requirement ensures that the identity of each individual message\nrequired for the computation is kept private. This is in contrast to the\nstricter notion of joint privacy that protects the entire set of identities of\nall messages used for the computation, including the correlations between these\nidentities. The notion of individual privacy captures a broad set of practical\napplications. For example, such notion is relevant when the dataset contains\ninformation about individuals, each of them requires privacy guarantees for\ntheir data access patterns. We focus on the setting in which the required\nlinear transformation is associated with a maximum distance separable (MDS)\nmatrix. In particular, we require that the matrix of coefficients pertaining to\nthe required linear combinations is the generator matrix of an MDS code. We\nestablish lower and upper bounds on the capacity of PLT with individual\nprivacy, where the capacity is defined as the supremum of all achievable\ndownload rates.

Unfortunately, this means that the model's\napproximation quality can rapidly degenerate outside some compact subset of\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$, as any such measure is largely concentrated on some bounded\nsubset of $\\mathbb{R}^d$. This paper proposes a generic solution to this\napproximation theoretic problem by introducing a canonical transformation which\n\"upgrades $\\mathscr{F}$'s approximation property\" in the following sense. The\ntransformed model class, denoted by $\\mathscr{F}\\text{-tope}$, is shown to be\ndense in $L^p_{\\mu,\\text{strict}}(\\mathbb{R}^d,\\mathbb{R}^D)$ which is a\ntopological space whose elements are locally $p$-integrable functions and whose\ntopology is much finer than usual norm topology on\n$L^p_{\\mu}(\\mathbb{R}^d,\\mathbb{R}^D)$; here $\\mu$ is any suitable\n$\\sigma$-finite Borel measure $\\mu$ on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Next, we show that if\n$\\mathscr{F}$ is any family of analytic functions then there is always a strict\n\"gap\" between $\\mathscr{F}\\text{-tope}$'s expressibility and that of\n$\\mathscr{F}$, since we find that $\\mathscr{F}$ can never dense in\n$L^p_{\\mu,\\text{strict}}(\\mathbb{R}^d,\\mathbb{R}^D)$. In the general case,\nwhere $\\mathscr{F}$ may contain non-analytic functions, we provide an abstract\nform of these results guaranteeing that there always exists some function space\nin which $\\mathscr{F}\\text{-tope}$ is dense but $\\mathscr{F}$ is not, while,\nthe converse is never possible.

A critical problem\nbehind these limitations is that the representations of unseen intents cannot\nbe learned in the training stage. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nframework that utilizes unseen class labels to learn Class-Transductive Intent\nRepresentations (CTIR).

On this basis, we introduce a multi-task learning objective, which\nencourages the model to learn the distinctions among intents, and a similarity\nscorer, which estimates the connections among intents more accurately. CTIR is\neasy to implement and can be integrated with existing methods. Experiments on\ntwo real-world datasets show that CTIR brings considerable improvement to the\nbaseline systems.",

This diagnosis process can be automatized to help\nmedical staff through Decision Support Systems (DSSs), and Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) are good candidates, because they are effective when applied to\nspatial data. This paper proposes a 3D CNN ordinal model for assessing the\nlevel or neurological damage in PD patients. Given that CNNs need large\ndatasets to achieve acceptable performance, a data augmentation method is\nadapted to work with spatial data. We consider the Ordinal Graph-based\nOversampling via Shortest Paths (OGO-SP) method, which applies a gamma\nprobability distribution for inter-class data generation. A modification of\nOGO-SP is proposed, the OGO-SP-$\\beta$ algorithm, which applies the beta\ndistribution for generating synthetic samples in the inter-class region, a\nbetter suited distribution when compared to gamma. The evaluation of the\ndifferent methods is based on a novel 3D image dataset provided by the Hospital\nUniversitario 'Reina Sof\\'ia' (C\\'ordoba, Spain). We show how the ordinal\nmethodology improves the performance with respect to the nominal one, and how\nOGO-SP-$\\beta$ yields better performance than OGO-SP.",

Most such models use deterministic attention while\nstochastic attention is less explored due to the optimization difficulties or\ncomplicated model design. This paper introduces Bayesian attention belief\nnetworks, which construct a decoder network by modeling unnormalized attention\nweights with a hierarchy of gamma distributions, and an encoder network by\nstacking Weibull distributions with a deterministic-upward-stochastic-downward\nstructure to approximate the posterior. The resulting auto-encoding networks\ncan be optimized in a differentiable way with a variational lower bound. It is\nsimple to convert any models with deterministic attention, including pretrained\nones, to the proposed Bayesian attention belief networks. On a variety of\nlanguage understanding tasks, we show that our method outperforms deterministic\nattention and state-of-the-art stochastic attention in accuracy, uncertainty\nestimation, generalization across domains, and robustness to adversarial\nattacks. We further demonstrate the general applicability of our method on\nneural machine translation and visual question answering, showing great\npotential of incorporating our method into various attention-related tasks.",

          "description": "Complex systems manifest a small number of instabilities and bifurcations\nthat are canonical in nature, resulting in universal pattern forming\ncharacteristics as a function of some parametric dependence. Such parametric\ninstabilities are mathematically characterized by their universal un-foldings,\nor normal form dynamics, whereby a parsimonious model can be used to represent\nthe dynamics. Although center manifold theory guarantees the existence of such\nlow-dimensional normal forms, finding them has remained a long standing\nchallenge. In this work, we introduce deep learning autoencoders to discover\ncoordinate transformations that capture the underlying parametric dependence of\na dynamical system in terms of its canonical normal form, allowing for a simple\nrepresentation of the parametric dependence and bifurcation structure. The\nautoencoder constrains the latent variable to adhere to a given normal form,\nthus allowing it to learn the appropriate coordinate transformation. We\ndemonstrate the method on a number of example problems, showing that it can\ncapture a diverse set of normal forms associated with Hopf, pitchfork,\ntranscritical and/or saddle node bifurcations. This method shows how normal\nforms can be leveraged as canonical and universal building blocks in deep\nlearning approaches for model discovery and reduced-order modeling.",

          "description": "Using logical clauses to represent patterns, Tsetlin Machines (TMs) have\nrecently obtained competitive performance in terms of accuracy, memory\nfootprint, energy, and learning speed on several benchmarks. Each TM clause\nvotes for or against a particular class, with classification resolved using a\nmajority vote. While the evaluation of clauses is fast, being based on binary\noperators, the voting makes it necessary to synchronize the clause evaluation,\nimpeding parallelization. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for\ndesynchronizing the evaluation of clauses, eliminating the voting bottleneck.\nIn brief, every clause runs in its own thread for massive native parallelism.\nFor each training example, we keep track of the class votes obtained from the\nclauses in local voting tallies. The local voting tallies allow us to detach\nthe processing of each clause from the rest of the clauses, supporting\ndecentralized learning. This means that the TM most of the time will operate on\noutdated voting tallies. We evaluated the proposed parallelization across\ndiverse learning tasks and it turns out that our decentralized TM learning\nalgorithm copes well with working on outdated data, resulting in no significant\nloss in learning accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach\nprovides up to 50 times faster learning. Finally, learning time is almost\nconstant for reasonable clause amounts (employing from 20 to 7,000 clauses on a\nTesla V100 GPU). For sufficiently large clause numbers, computation time\nincreases approximately proportionally. Our parallel and asynchronous\narchitecture thus allows processing of massive datasets and operating with more\nclauses for higher accuracy.",

Since the log loss is very sensitive to invalid references, we leverage\ncross entropy initialization and loss truncation to ensure the model focuses on\na good part of the search space. Extensive experiments on major WMT benchmarks\nshow that OaXE substantially improves translation performance, setting new\nstate of the art for fully NAT models. Further analyses show that OaXE\nalleviates the multimodality problem by reducing token repetitions and\nincreasing prediction confidence.

          "description": "Error feedback (EF), also known as error compensation, is an immensely\npopular convergence stabilization mechanism in the context of distributed\ntraining of supervised machine learning models enhanced by the use of\ncontractive communication compression mechanisms, such as Top-$k$. First\nproposed by Seide et al (2014) as a heuristic, EF resisted any theoretical\nunderstanding until recently [Stich et al., 2018, Alistarh et al., 2018].\nHowever, all existing analyses either i) apply to the single node setting only,\nii) rely on very strong and often unreasonable assumptions, such global\nboundedness of the gradients, or iterate-dependent assumptions that cannot be\nchecked a-priori and may not hold in practice, or iii) circumvent these issues\nvia the introduction of additional unbiased compressors, which increase the\ncommunication cost. In this work we fix all these deficiencies by proposing and\nanalyzing a new EF mechanism, which we call EF21, which consistently and\nsubstantially outperforms EF in practice. Our theoretical analysis relies on\nstandard assumptions only, works in the distributed heterogeneous data setting,\nand leads to better and more meaningful rates. In particular, we prove that\nEF21 enjoys a fast $O(1/T)$ convergence rate for smooth nonconvex problems,\nbeating the previous bound of $O(1/T^{2/3})$, which was shown a bounded\ngradients assumption. We further improve this to a fast linear rate for PL\nfunctions, which is the first linear convergence result for an EF-type method\nnot relying on unbiased compressors. Since EF has a large number of\napplications where it reigns supreme, we believe that our 2021 variant, EF21,\ncan a large impact on the practice of communication efficient distributed\nlearning.",

This\nencompasses not only RL but also imitation learning and exploration, among\nothers. Yet, this more general paradigm invalidates the classical Bellman\nequations, and calls for new algorithms.

They consider the limit case of a\ncontinuous distribution of identical agents, anonymous with symmetric\ninterests, and reduce the problem to the study of a single representative agent\nin interaction with the full population. Our core contribution consists in\nshowing that CURL is a subclass of MFGs. We think this important to bridge\ntogether both communities. It also allows to shed light on aspects of both\nfields: we show the equivalence between concavity in CURL and monotonicity in\nthe associated MFG, between optimality conditions in CURL and Nash equilibrium\nin MFG, or that Fictitious Play (FP) for this class of MFGs is simply\nFrank-Wolfe, bringing the first convergence rate for discrete-time FP for MFGs.\nWe also experimentally demonstrate that, using algorithms recently introduced\nfor solving MFGs, we can address the CURL problem more efficiently.",

Although the local and\nglobal structures often depend on each other and their simultaneous modeling is\nimportant, many convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches interchange\nrepresentations in different resolutions only a few times. In this paper, we\nclaim the importance of a dense simultaneous modeling of multiresolution\nrepresentation and propose a novel CNN architecture called densely connected\nmultidilated DenseNet (D3Net). D3Net involves a novel multidilated convolution\nthat has different dilation factors in a single layer to model different\nresolutions simultaneously.

          "description": "Recently numerous machine learning based methods for combinatorial\noptimization problems have been proposed that learn to construct solutions in a\nsequential decision process via reinforcement learning. While these methods can\nbe easily combined with search strategies like sampling and beam search, it is\nnot straightforward to integrate them into a high-level search procedure\noffering strong search guidance. Bello et al. (2016) propose active search,\nwhich adjusts the weights of a (trained) model with respect to a single\ninstance at test time using reinforcement learning. While active search is\nsimple to implement, it is not competitive with state-of-the-art methods\nbecause adjusting all model weights for each test instance is very time and\nmemory intensive. Instead of updating all model weights, we propose and\nevaluate three efficient active search strategies that only update a subset of\nparameters during the search. The proposed methods offer a simple way to\nsignificantly improve the search performance of a given model and outperform\nstate-of-the-art machine learning based methods on combinatorial problems, even\nsurpassing the well-known heuristic solver LKH3 on the capacitated vehicle\nrouting problem.

          "description": "This paper presents a new approach for assembling graph neural networks based\non framelet transforms. The latter provides a multi-scale representation for\ngraph-structured data. We decompose an input graph into low-pass and high-pass\nfrequencies coefficients for network training, which then defines a\nframelet-based graph convolution. The framelet decomposition naturally induces\na graph pooling strategy by aggregating the graph feature into low-pass and\nhigh-pass spectra, which considers both the feature values and geometry of the\ngraph data and conserves the total information. The graph neural networks with\nthe proposed framelet convolution and pooling achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance in many node and graph prediction tasks. Moreover, we propose\nshrinkage as a new activation for the framelet convolution, which thresholds\nhigh-frequency information at different scales. Compared to ReLU, shrinkage\nactivation improves model performance on denoising and signal compression:\nnoises in both node and structure can be significantly reduced by accurately\ncutting off the high-pass coefficients from framelet decomposition, and the\nsignal can be compressed to less than half its original size with\nwell-preserved prediction performance.",

Yet, it has not\nachieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level\nprediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery\nhow Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this\npaper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the\nstandard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a\nbroad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent\nOGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the\ngraph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a\ngraph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective\nstructural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured\ndata. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of\nGraphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural\ninformation of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the\nspecial cases of Graphormer.",

Traditional algorithms, without a specific design for algorithmic\nfairness, could implicitly encode and propagate statistical bias in data and\nraise societal concerns. To correct such unfairness and deliver a fair set of\npotential outlier candidates, we propose Deep Clustering based Fair Outlier\nDetection (DCFOD) that learns a good representation for utility maximization\nwhile enforcing the learnable representation to be subgroup-invariant on the\nsensitive attribute. Considering the coupled and reciprocal nature between\nclustering and outlier detection, we leverage deep clustering to discover the\nintrinsic cluster structure and out-of-structure instances. Meanwhile, an\nadversarial training erases the sensitive pattern for instances for fairness\nadaptation. Technically, we propose an instance-level weighted representation\nlearning strategy to enhance the joint deep clustering and outlier detection,\nwhere the dynamic weight module re-emphasizes contributions of likely-inliers\nwhile mitigating the negative impact from outliers.

          "description": "Adversarial learning has emerged as one of the successful techniques to\ncircumvent the susceptibility of existing methods against adversarial\nperturbations. However, the majority of existing defense methods are tailored\nto defend against a single category of adversarial perturbation (e.g.\n$\\ell_\\infty$-attack). In safety-critical applications, this makes these\nmethods extraneous as the attacker can adopt diverse adversaries to deceive the\nsystem. Moreover, training on multiple perturbations simultaneously\nsignificantly increases the computational overhead during training. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that explicitly\nlearns to generate noise to improve the model's robustness against multiple\ntypes of attacks. Its key component is Meta Noise Generator (MNG) that outputs\noptimal noise to stochastically perturb a given sample, such that it helps\nlower the error on diverse adversarial perturbations. By utilizing samples\ngenerated by MNG, we train a model by enforcing the label consistency across\nmultiple perturbations. We validate the robustness of models trained by our\nscheme on various datasets and against a wide variety of perturbations,\ndemonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines across multiple\nperturbations with a marginal computational cost.",

          "description": "While task-specific finetuning of pretrained networks has led to significant\nempirical advances in NLP, the large size of networks makes finetuning\ndifficult to deploy in multi-task, memory-constrained settings. We propose diff\npruning as a simple approach to enable parameter-efficient transfer learning\nwithin the pretrain-finetune framework. This approach views finetuning as\nlearning a task-specific diff vector that is applied on top of the pretrained\nparameter vector, which remains fixed and is shared across different tasks. The\ndiff vector is adaptively pruned during training with a differentiable\napproximation to the L0-norm penalty to encourage sparsity. Diff pruning\nbecomes parameter-efficient as the number of tasks increases, as it requires\nstoring only the nonzero positions and weights of the diff vector for each\ntask, while the cost of storing the shared pretrained model remains constant.\nIt further does not require access to all tasks during training, which makes it\nattractive in settings where tasks arrive in stream or the set of tasks is\nunknown. We find that models finetuned with diff pruning can match the\nperformance of fully finetuned baselines on the GLUE benchmark while only\nmodifying 0.5% of the pretrained model's parameters per task.",

          "description": "Language is an outcome of our complex and dynamic human-interactions and the\ntechnique of natural language processing (NLP) is hence built on human\nlinguistic activities. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n(BERT) has recently gained its popularity by establishing the state-of-the-art\nscores in several NLP benchmarks. A Lite BERT (ALBERT) is literally\ncharacterized as a lightweight version of BERT, in which the number of BERT\nparameters is reduced by repeatedly applying the same neural network called\nTransformer's encoder layer. By pre-training the parameters with a massive\namount of natural language data, ALBERT can convert input sentences into\nversatile high-dimensional vectors potentially capable of solving multiple NLP\ntasks. In that sense, ALBERT can be regarded as a well-designed\nhigh-dimensional dynamical system whose operator is the Transformer's encoder,\nand essential structures of human language are thus expected to be encapsulated\nin its dynamics. In this study, we investigated the embedded properties of\nALBERT to reveal how NLP tasks are effectively solved by exploiting its\ndynamics. We thereby aimed to explore the nature of human language from the\ndynamical expressions of the NLP model. Our short-term analysis clarified that\nthe pre-trained model stably yields trajectories with higher dimensionality,\nwhich would enhance the expressive capacity required for NLP tasks. Also, our\nlong-term analysis revealed that ALBERT intrinsically shows transient chaos, a\ntypical nonlinear phenomenon showing chaotic dynamics only in its transient,\nand the pre-trained ALBERT model tends to produce the chaotic trajectory for a\nsignificantly longer time period compared to a randomly-initialized one. Our\nresults imply that local chaoticity would contribute to improving NLP\nperformance, uncovering a novel aspect in the role of chaotic dynamics in human\nlanguage behaviors.",

          "description": "Vast amount of data generated from networks of sensors, wearables, and the\nInternet of Things (IoT) devices underscores the need for advanced modeling\ntechniques that leverage the spatio-temporal structure of decentralized data\ndue to the need for edge computation and licensing (data access) issues. While\nfederated learning (FL) has emerged as a framework for model training without\nrequiring direct data sharing and exchange, effectively modeling the complex\nspatio-temporal dependencies to improve forecasting capabilities still remains\nan open problem. On the other hand, state-of-the-art spatio-temporal\nforecasting models assume unfettered access to the data, neglecting constraints\non data sharing. To bridge this gap, we propose a federated spatio-temporal\nmodel -- Cross-Node Federated Graph Neural Network (CNFGNN) -- which explicitly\nencodes the underlying graph structure using graph neural network (GNN)-based\narchitecture under the constraint of cross-node federated learning, which\nrequires that data in a network of nodes is generated locally on each node and\nremains decentralized. CNFGNN operates by disentangling the temporal dynamics\nmodeling on devices and spatial dynamics on the server, utilizing alternating\noptimization to reduce the communication cost, facilitating computations on the\nedge devices.

In this paper, we provide tight bounds on the smallest\neigenvalue of NTK matrices for deep ReLU nets, both in the limiting case of\ninfinite widths and for finite widths.

          "description": "In the past few years, significant advancements were made in reconstruction\nof observed natural images from fMRI brain recordings using deep-learning\ntools. Here, for the first time, we show that dense 3D depth maps of observed\n2D natural images can also be recovered directly from fMRI brain recordings. We\nuse an off-the-shelf method to estimate the unknown depth maps of natural\nimages. This is applied to both: (i) the small number of images presented to\nsubjects in an fMRI scanner (images for which we have fMRI recordings -\nreferred to as \"paired\" data), and (ii) a very large number of natural images\nwith no fMRI recordings (\"unpaired data\"). The estimated depth maps are then\nused as an auxiliary reconstruction criterion to train for depth reconstruction\ndirectly from fMRI. We propose two main approaches: Depth-only recovery and\njoint image-depth RGBD recovery. Because the number of available \"paired\"\ntraining data (images with fMRI) is small, we enrich the training data via\nself-supervised cycle-consistent training on many \"unpaired\" data (natural\nimages & depth maps without fMRI). This is achieved using our newly defined and\ntrained Depth-based Perceptual Similarity metric as a reconstruction criterion.\nWe show that predicting the depth map directly from fMRI outperforms its\nindirect sequential recovery from the reconstructed images. We further show\nthat activations from early cortical visual areas dominate our depth\nreconstruction results, and propose means to characterize fMRI voxels by their\ndegree of depth-information tuning. This work adds an important layer of\ndecoded information, extending the current envelope of visual brain decoding\ncapabilities.",

          "description": "An exciting recent development is the uptake of deep learning in many\nscientific fields, where the objective is seeking novel scientific insights and\ndiscoveries. To interpret a learning outcome, researchers perform hypothesis\ntesting for explainable features to advance scientific domain knowledge. In\nsuch a situation, testing for a blackbox learner poses a severe challenge\nbecause of intractable models, unknown limiting distributions of parameter\nestimates, and high computational constraints. In this article, we derive two\nconsistent tests for the feature relevance of a blackbox learner. The first one\nevaluates a loss difference with perturbation on an inference sample, which is\nindependent of an estimation sample used for parameter estimation in model\nfitting. The second further splits the inference sample into two but does not\nrequire data perturbation. Also, we develop their combined versions by\naggregating the order statistics of the $p$-values based on repeated sample\nsplitting. To estimate the splitting ratio and the perturbation size, we\ndevelop adaptive splitting schemes for suitably controlling the Type \\rom{1}\nerror subject to computational constraints. By deflating the\n\\textit{bias-sd-ratio}, we establish asymptotic null distributions of the test\nstatistics and their consistency in terms of statistical power. Our theoretical\npower analysis and simulations indicate that the one-split test is more\npowerful than the two-split test, though the latter is easier to apply for\nlarge datasets. Moreover, the combined tests are more stable while compensating\nfor a power loss by repeated sample splitting. Numerically, we demonstrate the\nutility of the proposed tests on two benchmark examples. Accompanying this\npaper is our Python library {\\tt dnn-inference}\nhttps://dnn-inference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ that implements the proposed\ntests.",

While most of the bits have been corrupted, many\nbits, at random locations, have not.

          "description": "Electronic Health Records (EHR) have been heavily used in modern healthcare\nsystems for recording patients' admission information to hospitals. Many\ndata-driven approaches employ temporal features in EHR for predicting specific\ndiseases, readmission times, or diagnoses of patients. However, most existing\npredictive models cannot fully utilize EHR data, due to an inherent lack of\nlabels in supervised training for some temporal events. Moreover, it is hard\nfor existing works to simultaneously provide generic and personalized\ninterpretability. To address these challenges, we first propose a hyperbolic\nembedding method with information flow to pre-train medical code\nrepresentations in a hierarchical structure. We incorporate these pre-trained\nrepresentations into a graph neural network to detect disease complications,\nand design a multi-level attention method to compute the contributions of\nparticular diseases and admissions, thus enhancing personalized\ninterpretability. We present a new hierarchy-enhanced historical prediction\nproxy task in our self-supervised learning framework to fully utilize EHR data\nand exploit medical domain knowledge. We conduct a comprehensive set of\nexperiments and case studies on widely used publicly available EHR datasets to\nverify the effectiveness of our model.

          "description": "After their successful debut in natural language processing, Transformer\narchitectures are now becoming the de-facto standard in many domains. An\nobstacle for their deployment over new modalities is the architectural\nconfiguration: the optimal depth-to-width ratio has been shown to dramatically\nvary across data types (e.g., $10$x larger over images than over language). We\ntheoretically predict the existence of an embedding rank bottleneck that limits\nthe contribution of self-attention width to the Transformer expressivity. We\nthus directly tie the input vocabulary size and rank to the optimal\ndepth-to-width ratio, since a small vocabulary size or rank dictates an added\nadvantage of depth over width. We empirically demonstrate the existence of this\nbottleneck and its implications on the depth-to-width interplay of Transformer\narchitectures, linking the architecture variability across domains to the often\nglossed-over usage of different vocabulary sizes or embedding ranks in\ndifferent domains. As an additional benefit, our rank bottlenecking framework\nallows us to identify size redundancies of $25\\%-50\\%$ in leading NLP models\nsuch as ALBERT and T5.",

          "description": "Due to spurious correlations, machine learning systems often fail to\ngeneralize to environments whose distributions differ from the ones used at\ntraining time. Prior work addressing this, either explicitly or implicitly,\nattempted to find a data representation that has an invariant relationship with\nthe target. This is done by leveraging a diverse set of training environments\nto reduce the effect of spurious features and build an invariant predictor.\nHowever, these methods have generalization guarantees only when both data\nrepresentation and classifiers come from a linear model class. We propose\ninvariant Causal Representation Learning (iCaRL), an approach that enables\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in the nonlinear setting (i.e.,\nnonlinear representations and nonlinear classifiers). It builds upon a\npractical and general assumption: the prior over the data representation (i.e.,\na set of latent variables encoding the data) given the target and the\nenvironment belongs to general exponential family distributions. Based on this,\nwe show that it is possible to identify the data representation up to simple\ntransformations. We also prove that all direct causes of the target can be\nfully discovered, which further enables us to obtain generalization guarantees\nin the nonlinear setting. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets show that our approach outperforms a variety of baseline\nmethods. Finally, in the discussion, we further explore the aforementioned\nassumption and propose a more general hypothesis, called the Agnostic\nHypothesis: there exist a set of hidden causal factors affecting both inputs\nand outcomes. The Agnostic Hypothesis can provide a unifying view of machine\nlearning. More importantly, it can inspire a new direction to explore a general\ntheory for identifying hidden causal factors, which is key to enabling the OOD\ngeneralization guarantees.",

          "description": "Recently, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has garnered tremendous\nattention. However, stochastic optimization of MAML is still immature. Existing\nalgorithms for MAML are based on the ``episode\" idea by sampling a number of\ntasks and a number of data points for each sampled task at each iteration for\nupdating the meta-model. However, they either do not necessarily guarantee\nconvergence with a constant mini-batch size or require processing a larger\nnumber of tasks at every iteration, which is not viable for continual learning\nor cross-device federated learning where only a small number of tasks are\navailable per-iteration or per-round. This paper addresses these issues by (i)\nproposing efficient memory-based stochastic algorithms for MAML with a\ndiminishing convergence error, which only requires sampling a constant number\nof tasks and a constant number of examples per-task per-iteration; (ii)\nproposing communication-efficient distributed memory-based MAML algorithms for\npersonalized federated learning in both the cross-device (w/ client sampling)\nand the cross-silo (w/o client sampling) settings. The key novelty of the\nproposed algorithms is to maintain an individual personalized model (aka\nmemory) for each task besides the meta-model and only update them for the\nsampled tasks by a momentum method that incorporates historical updates at each\niteration. The theoretical results significantly improve the optimization\ntheory for MAML and the empirical results also corroborate the theory.",

Recent line of work posits strong\nbenefits for model generalization and transfer when model size, data size, and\ncompute budget are increased for the pre-training. It remains however still\nlargely unclear whether the observed transfer improvement due to increase in\nscale also holds when source and target data distributions are far apart from\neach other. In this work we conduct large-scale pre-training on large source\ndatasets of either natural (ImageNet-21k/1k) or medical chest X-Ray images and\ncompare full and few-shot transfer using different target datasets from both\nnatural and medical imaging domains. Our observations provide evidence that\nwhile pre-training and transfer on closely related datasets do show clear\nbenefit of increasing model and data size during pre-training, such benefits\nare not clearly visible when source and target datasets are further apart.\nThese observations hold across both full and few-shot transfer and indicate\nthat scaling laws pointing to improvement of generalization and transfer with\nincreasing model and data size are incomplete and should be revised by taking\ninto account the type and proximity of the source and target data, to correctly\npredict the effect of model and data scale during pre-training on transfer.\nRemarkably, in full shot transfer to a large X-Ray chest imaging target\n(PadChest), the largest model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k slightly outperforms\nbest models pre-trained on large X-Ray chest imaging data.

          "description": "We present a novel methodology for automated feature subset selection from a\npool of physiological signals using Quantum Annealing (QA). As a case study, we\nwill investigate the effectiveness of QA-based feature selection techniques in\nselecting the optimal feature subset for stress detection. Features are\nextracted from four signal sources: foot EDA, hand EDA, ECG, and respiration.\nThe proposed method embeds the feature variables extracted from the\nphysiological signals in a binary quadratic model. The bias of the feature\nvariable is calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient between the\nfeature variable and the target variable. The weight of the edge connecting the\ntwo feature variables is calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient\nbetween two feature variables in the binary quadratic model. Subsequently,\nD-Wave's clique sampler is used to sample cliques from the binary quadratic\nmodel. The underlying solution is then re-sampled to obtain multiple good\nsolutions and the clique with the lowest energy is returned as the optimal\nsolution. The proposed method is compared with commonly used feature selection\ntechniques for stress detection. Results indicate that QA-based feature subset\nselection performed equally as that of classical techniques. However, under\ndata uncertainty conditions such as limited training data, the performance of\nquantum annealing for selecting optimum features remained unaffected, whereas a\nsignificant decrease in performance is observed with classical feature\nselection techniques. Preliminary results show the promise of quantum annealing\nin optimizing the training phase of a machine learning classifier, especially\nunder data uncertainty conditions.",

We\nempirically compare four different existing metrics for quantifying\ncatastrophic forgetting and (2) show that the degree to which the learning\nsystems experience catastrophic forgetting is sufficiently sensitive to the\nmetric used that a change from one principled metric to another is enough to\nchange the conclusions of a study dramatically. Our results suggest that a much\nmore rigorous experimental methodology is required when looking at catastrophic\nforgetting. Based on our results, we recommend inter-task forgetting in\nsupervised learning must be measured with both retention and relearning metrics\nconcurrently, and intra-task forgetting in reinforcement learning must-at the\nvery least-be measured with pairwise interference.",

          "description": "Approximate Bayesian inference methods that scale to very large datasets are\ncrucial in leveraging probabilistic models for real-world time series. Sparse\nMarkovian Gaussian processes combine the use of inducing variables with\nefficient Kalman filter-like recursions, resulting in algorithms whose\ncomputational and memory requirements scale linearly in the number of inducing\npoints, whilst also enabling parallel parameter updates and stochastic\noptimisation. Under this paradigm, we derive a general site-based approach to\napproximate inference, whereby we approximate the non-Gaussian likelihood with\nlocal Gaussian terms, called sites. Our approach results in a suite of novel\nsparse extensions to algorithms from both the machine learning and signal\nprocessing literature, including variational inference, expectation\npropagation, and the classical nonlinear Kalman smoothers.

Although the classic Hawkes\nprocesses cover a wide range of applications, their expressive ability is\nlimited due to three key hypotheses: parametric, linear and homogeneous.

This work aims to\novercome all three assumptions simultaneously by proposing the flexible\nstate-switching Hawkes processes: a flexible, nonlinear and nonhomogeneous\nvariant where a state process is incorporated to interact with the point\nprocesses. The proposed model empowers Hawkes processes to be applied to\ntime-varying systems. For inference, we utilize the latent variable\naugmentation technique to design two efficient Bayesian inference algorithms:\nGibbs sampler and mean-field variational inference, with analytical iterative\nupdates to estimate the posterior.

In this paper, we extend and discuss the results of\nthis same HT for general convex loss functions.

          "description": "Recent theoretical work studies sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL)\nextensively in two settings: learning interactively in the environment (online\nRL), or learning from an offline dataset (offline RL). However, existing\nalgorithms and theories for learning near-optimal policies in these two\nsettings are rather different and disconnected. Towards bridging this gap, this\npaper initiates the theoretical study of policy finetuning, that is, online RL\nwhere the learner has additional access to a \"reference policy\" $\\mu$ close to\nthe optimal policy $\\pi_\\star$ in a certain sense. We consider the policy\nfinetuning problem in episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$\nstates, $A$ actions, and horizon length $H$. We first design a sharp offline\nreduction algorithm -- which simply executes $\\mu$ and runs offline policy\noptimization on the collected dataset -- that finds an $\\varepsilon$\nnear-optimal policy within $\\widetilde{O}(H^3SC^\\star/\\varepsilon^2)$ episodes,\nwhere $C^\\star$ is the single-policy concentrability coefficient between $\\mu$\nand $\\pi_\\star$. This offline result is the first that matches the sample\ncomplexity lower bound in this setting, and resolves a recent open question in\noffline RL. We then establish an $\\Omega(H^3S\\min\\{C^\\star, A\\}/\\varepsilon^2)$\nsample complexity lower bound for any policy finetuning algorithm, including\nthose that can adaptively explore the environment. This implies that -- perhaps\nsurprisingly -- the optimal policy finetuning algorithm is either offline\nreduction or a purely online RL algorithm that does not use $\\mu$. Finally, we\ndesign a new hybrid offline/online algorithm for policy finetuning that\nachieves better sample complexity than both vanilla offline reduction and\npurely online RL algorithms, in a relaxed setting where $\\mu$ only satisfies\nconcentrability partially up to a certain time step.",

However, relatively little work\nhas been conducted on quantifying the robustness of interpretations. In this\nwork, we assess the robustness of interpretations of neural text classifiers,\nspecifically, those based on pretrained Transformer encoders, using two\nrandomization tests. The first compares the interpretations of two models that\nare identical except for their initializations. The second measures whether the\ninterpretations differ between a model with trained parameters and a model with\nrandom parameters. Both tests show surprising deviations from expected\nbehavior, raising questions about the extent of insights that practitioners may\ndraw from interpretations.",

          "description": "In ordinary distillation, student networks are trained with soft labels (SLs)\ngiven by pretrained teacher networks, and students are expected to improve upon\nteachers since SLs are stronger supervision than the original hard labels.\nHowever, when considering adversarial robustness, teachers may become\nunreliable and adversarial distillation may not work: teachers are pretrained\non their own adversarial data, and it is too demanding to require that teachers\nare also good at every adversarial data queried by students. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose reliable introspective adversarial distillation (IAD) where\nstudents partially instead of fully trust their teachers. Specifically, IAD\ndistinguishes between three cases given a query of a natural data (ND) and the\ncorresponding adversarial data (AD): (a) if a teacher is good at AD, its SL is\nfully trusted; (b) if a teacher is good at ND but not AD, its SL is partially\ntrusted and the student also takes its own SL into account; (c) otherwise, the\nstudent only relies on its own SL. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nIAD for improving upon teachers in terms of adversarial robustness.",

          "description": "Retrosynthetic planning is a fundamental problem in chemistry for finding a\npathway of reactions to synthesize a target molecule. Recently, search\nalgorithms have shown promising results for solving this problem by using deep\nneural networks (DNNs) to expand their candidate solutions, i.e., adding new\nreactions to reaction pathways. However, the existing works on this line are\nsuboptimal; the retrosynthetic planning problem requires the reaction pathways\nto be (a) represented by real-world reactions and (b) executable using\n\"building block\" molecules, yet the DNNs expand reaction pathways without fully\nincorporating such requirements. Motivated by this, we propose an end-to-end\nframework for directly training the DNNs towards generating reaction pathways\nwith the desirable properties. Our main idea is based on a self-improving\nprocedure that trains the model to imitate successful trajectories found by\nitself. We also propose a novel reaction augmentation scheme based on a forward\nreaction model. Our experiments demonstrate that our scheme significantly\nimproves the success rate of solving the retrosynthetic problem from 86.84% to\n96.32% while maintaining the performance of DNN for predicting valid reactions.",

Recent\nmodern machine learning approaches have demonstrated their ability to\naccelerate spatio-temporal predictions, although, with only moderate accuracy\nin comparison. Here we introduce MultiScaleGNN, a novel multi-scale graph\nneural network model for learning to infer unsteady continuum mechanics.\nMultiScaleGNN represents the physical domain as an unstructured set of nodes,\nand it constructs one or more graphs, each of them encoding different scales of\nspatial resolution. Successive learnt message passing between these graphs\nimproves the ability of GNNs to capture and forecast the system state in\nproblems encompassing a range of length scales. Using graph representations,\nMultiScaleGNN can impose periodic boundary conditions as an inductive bias on\nthe edges in the graphs, and achieve independence to the nodes' positions. We\ndemonstrate this method on advection problems and incompressible fluid\ndynamics. Our results show that the proposed model can generalise from uniform\nadvection fields to high-gradient fields on complex domains at test time and\ninfer long-term Navier-Stokes solutions within a range of Reynolds numbers.\nSimulations obtained with MultiScaleGNN are between two and four orders of\nmagnitude faster than the ones on which it was trained.",

Analogous to a probabilistic program, an expectation program is\ncomprised of a mix of probabilistic constructs and deterministic calculations\nthat define a conditional distribution over its variables. However, the focus\nof the inference engine in an EPF is to directly estimate the resulting\nexpectation of the program return values, rather than approximate the\nconditional distribution itself. This distinction allows us to achieve\nsubstantial performance improvements over the standard probabilistic\nprogramming pipeline by tailoring the inference to the precise expectation we\ncare about. We realize a particular instantiation of our EPF concept by\nextending the probabilistic programming language Turing to allow so-called\ntarget-aware inference to be run automatically, and show that this leads to\nsignificant empirical gains compared to conventional posterior-based inference.",

We begin by introducing a simple but general notion of margin between\nclusters that captures, as special cases, the margins used in previous work,\nthe classic SVM margin, and standard notions of stability for center-based\nclusterings. Then, under our margin assumptions we design algorithms that, in a\nvariety of settings, recover all clusters exactly using only $O(\\log n)$\nqueries. For the Euclidean case, $\\mathbb{R}^m$, we give an algorithm that\nrecovers arbitrary convex clusters, in polynomial time, and with a number of\nqueries that is lower than the best existing algorithm by $\\Theta(m^m)$\nfactors. For general pseudometric spaces, where clusters might not be convex or\nmight not have any notion of shape, we give an algorithm that achieves the\n$O(\\log n)$ query bound, and is provably near-optimal as a function of the\npacking number of the space. Finally, for clusterings realized by binary\nconcept classes, we give a combinatorial characterization of recoverability\nwith $O(\\log n)$ queries, and we show that, for many concept classes in\nEuclidean spaces, this characterization is equivalent to our margin condition.\nOur results show a deep connection between cluster margins and active cluster\nrecoverability.",

          "description": "We propose a machine learning approach for quickly solving Mixed Integer\nPrograms (MIP) by learning to prioritize a set of decision variables, which we\ncall pseudo-backdoors, for branching that results in faster solution times.\nLearning-based approaches have seen success in the area of solving\ncombinatorial optimization problems by being able to flexibly leverage common\nstructures in a given distribution of problems. Our approach takes inspiration\nfrom the concept of strong backdoors, which corresponds to a small set of\nvariables such that only branching on these variables yields an optimal\nintegral solution and a proof of optimality. Our notion of pseudo-backdoors\ncorresponds to a small set of variables such that only branching on them leads\nto faster solve time (which can be solver dependent). A key advantage of\npseudo-backdoors over strong backdoors is that they are much amenable to\ndata-driven identification or prediction. Our proposed method learns to\nestimate the solver performance of a proposed pseudo-backdoor, using a labeled\ndataset collected on a set of training MIP instances. This model can then be\nused to identify high-quality pseudo-backdoors on new MIP instances from the\nsame distribution. We evaluate our method on the generalized independent set\nproblems and find that our approach can efficiently identify high-quality\npseudo-backdoors. In addition, we compare our learned approach against Gurobi,\na state-of-the-art MIP solver, demonstrating that our method can be used to\nimprove solver performance.",

          "description": "The recent advanced deep learning techniques have shown the promising results\nin various domains such as computer vision and natural language processing. The\nsuccess of deep neural networks in supervised learning heavily relies on a\nlarge amount of labeled data. However, obtaining labeled data with target\nlabels is often challenging due to various reasons such as cost of labeling and\nprivacy issues, which challenges existing deep models. In spite of that, it is\nrelatively easy to obtain data with \\textit{inexact supervision}, i.e., having\nlabels/tags related to the target task. For example, social media platforms are\noverwhelmed with billions of posts and images with self-customized tags, which\nare not the exact labels for target classification tasks but are usually\nrelated to the target labels. It is promising to leverage these tags (inexact\nsupervision) and their relations with target classes to generate labeled data\nto facilitate the downstream classification tasks. However, the work on this is\nrather limited. Therefore, we study a novel problem of labeled data generation\nwith inexact supervision. We propose a novel generative framework named as\nADDES which can synthesize high-quality labeled data for target classification\ntasks by learning from data with inexact supervision and the relations between\ninexact supervision and target classes. Experimental results on image and text\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADDES for generating\nrealistic labeled data from inexact supervision to facilitate the target\nclassification task.",

It was shown in the paper that the sensitivity of compressed models to\ndifferent distortion types is nuanced, and some of the corruptions are heavily\nimpacted by the compression methods (i.e., additive noise), while others (blur\neffect) are only slightly affected. A common way to improve the robustness of\nmodels is to use data augmentation, which was confirmed to positively affect\nmodels' robustness, also for highly compressed models. It was further shown\nthat while data imbalance methods brought only a slight increase in accuracy\nfor the baseline model (without compression), the impact was more striking at\nhigher compression rates for the structured pruning.

          "description": "Tracking-by-detection is a very popular framework for single object tracking\nwhich attempts to search the target object within a local search window for\neach frame. Although such local search mechanism works well on simple videos,\nhowever, it makes the trackers sensitive to extremely challenging scenarios,\nsuch as heavy occlusion and fast motion. In this paper, we propose a novel and\ngeneral target-aware attention mechanism (termed TANet) and integrate it with\ntracking-by-detection framework to conduct joint local and global search for\nrobust tracking. Specifically, we extract the features of target object patch\nand continuous video frames, then we concatenate and feed them into a decoder\nnetwork to generate target-aware global attention maps. More importantly, we\nresort to adversarial training for better attention prediction. The appearance\nand motion discriminator networks are designed to ensure its consistency in\nspatial and temporal views. In the tracking procedure, we integrate the\ntarget-aware attention with multiple trackers by exploring candidate search\nregions for robust tracking.

To avoid these problems, researchers have begun to\nconsider the use of energy systems based on energy-harvesting units for such\ndevices. However, the power harvested from an ambient source is fundamentally\nsmall and unstable, resulting in frequent power failures during the operation\nof IoT applications involving, for example, intermittent speech signals and the\nstreaming of videos. This paper presents a deep-learning-based speech recovery\nsystem that reconstructs intermittent speech signals from self-powered IoT\ndevices. Our intermittent speech recovery system (ISR) consists of three\nstages: interpolation, recovery, and combination. The experimental results show\nthat our recovery system increases speech quality by up to 707.1%, while\nincreasing speech intelligibility by up to 92.1%. Most importantly, our ISR\nsystem also enhances the WER scores by up to 65.6%. To the best of our\nknowledge, this study is one of the first to reconstruct intermittent speech\nsignals from self-powered-sensing IoT devices. These promising results suggest\nthat even though self powered microphone devices function with weak energy\nsources, our ISR system can still maintain the performance of most\nspeech-signal-based applications.",

We show here how identifiability can be\nobtained in the absence of this side-information, rendering possible\nfully-unsupervised identifiable non-linear ICA. While previous theoretical\nresults have established the impossibility of identifiable non-linear ICA in\nthe presence of infinitely-flexible universal function approximators, here we\nrely on the intrinsically-finite modelling capacity of any particular chosen\nparameterisation of a deep generative model.

          "description": "Modern machine learning methods are often overparametrized, allowing\nadaptation to the data at a fine level. This can seem puzzling; in the worst\ncase, such models do not need to generalize. This puzzle inspired a great\namount of work, arguing when overparametrization reduces test error, in a\nphenomenon called \"double descent\". Recent work aimed to understand in greater\ndepth why overparametrization is helpful for generalization. This leads to\ndiscovering the unimodality of variance as a function of the level of\nparametrization, and to decomposing the variance into that arising from label\nnoise, initialization, and randomness in the training data to understand the\nsources of the error.\n\nIn this work we develop a deeper understanding of this area. Specifically, we\npropose using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to decompose the variance in the\ntest error in a symmetric way, for studying the generalization performance of\ncertain two-layer linear and non-linear networks. The advantage of the analysis\nof variance is that it reveals the effects of initialization, label noise, and\ntraining data more clearly than prior approaches. Moreover, we also study the\nmonotonicity and unimodality of the variance components. While prior work\nstudied the unimodality of the overall variance, we study the properties of\neach term in variance decomposition.\n\nOne key insight is that in typical settings, the interaction between training\nsamples and initialization can dominate the variance; surprisingly being larger\nthan their marginal effect. Also, we characterize \"phase transitions\" where the\nvariance changes from unimodal to monotone. On a technical level, we leverage\nadvanced deterministic equivalent techniques for Haar random matrices, that --\nto our knowledge -- have not yet been used in the area. We also verify our\nresults in numerical simulations and on empirical data examples.",

          "description": "Recommendation models can effectively estimate underlying user interests and\npredict one's future behaviors by factorizing an observed user-item rating\nmatrix into products of two sets of latent factors. However, the user-specific\nembedding factors can only be learned in a transductive way, making it\ndifficult to handle new users on-the-fly. In this paper, we propose an\ninductive collaborative filtering framework that contains two representation\nmodels. The first model follows conventional matrix factorization which\nfactorizes a group of key users' rating matrix to obtain meta latents. The\nsecond model resorts to attention-based structure learning that estimates\nhidden relations from query to key users and learns to leverage meta latents to\ninductively compute embeddings for query users via neural message passing. Our\nmodel enables inductive representation learning for users and meanwhile\nguarantees equivalent representation capacity as matrix factorization.\nExperiments demonstrate that our model achieves promising results for\nrecommendation on few-shot users with limited training ratings and new unseen\nusers which are commonly encountered in open-world recommender systems.",

          "description": "We present a theoretical framework of probabilistic learning derived by\nMaximum Probability (MP) Theorem shown in the current paper. In this\nprobabilistic framework, a model is defined as an event in the probability\nspace, and a model or the associated event - either the true underlying model\nor the parameterized model - have a quantified probability measure. This\nquantification of a model's probability measure is derived by the MP Theorem,\nin which we have shown that an event's probability measure has an upper-bound\ngiven its conditional distribution on an arbitrary random variable. Through\nthis alternative framework, the notion of model parameters is encompassed in\nthe definition of the model or the associated event. Therefore, this framework\ndeviates from the conventional approach of assuming a prior on the model\nparameters. Instead, the regularizing effects of assuming prior over parameters\nis seen through maximizing probabilities of models or according to information\ntheory, minimizing the information content of a model. The probability of a\nmodel in our framework is invariant to reparameterization and is solely\ndependent on the model's likelihood function. Also, rather than maximizing the\nposterior in a conventional Bayesian setting, the objective function in our\nalternative framework is defined as the probability of set operations (e.g.\nintersection) on the event of the true underlying model and the event of the\nmodel at hand. Our theoretical framework, as a derivation of MP theorem, adds\nclarity to probabilistic learning through solidifying the definition of\nprobabilistic models, quantifying their probabilities, and providing a visual\nunderstanding of objective functions.",

          "description": "Graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) have been the model of choice for\ngraph representation learning, which is mainly due to the effective design of\ngraph convolution that computes the representation of a node by aggregating\nthose of its neighbors. However, existing GCN variants commonly use 1-D graph\nconvolution that solely operates on the object link graph without exploring\ninformative relational information among object attributes. This significantly\nlimits their modeling capability and may lead to inferior performance on noisy\nand sparse real-world networks. In this paper, we explore 2-D graph convolution\nto jointly model object links and attribute relations for graph representation\nlearning. Specifically, we propose a computationally efficient dimensionwise\nseparable 2-D graph convolution (DSGC) for filtering node features.\nTheoretically, we show that DSGC can reduce intra-class variance of node\nfeatures on both the object dimension and the attribute dimension to learn more\neffective representations.

          "description": "Probability density models based on deep networks have achieved remarkable\nsuccess in modeling complex high-dimensional datasets. However, unlike kernel\ndensity estimators, modern neural models do not yield marginals or conditionals\nin closed form, as these quantities require the evaluation of seldom tractable\nintegrals. In this work, we present the Marginalizable Density Model\nApproximator (MDMA), a novel deep network architecture which provides closed\nform expressions for the probabilities, marginals and conditionals of any\nsubset of the variables. The MDMA learns deep scalar representations for each\nindividual variable and combines them via learned hierarchical tensor\ndecompositions into a tractable yet expressive CDF, from which marginals and\nconditional densities are easily obtained. We illustrate the advantage of exact\nmarginalizability in several tasks that are out of reach of previous deep\nnetwork-based density estimation models, such as estimating mutual information\nbetween arbitrary subsets of variables, inferring causality by testing for\nconditional independence, and inference with missing data without the need for\ndata imputation, outperforming state-of-the-art models on these tasks. The\nmodel also allows for parallelized sampling with only a logarithmic dependence\nof the time complexity on the number of variables.",

          "description": "We present a novel control-theoretic understanding of online optimization and\nlearning in games, via the notion of passivity. Passivity is a fundamental\nconcept in control theory, which abstracts energy conservation and dissipation\nin physical systems. It has become a standard tool in analysis of general\nfeedback systems, to which game dynamics belong. Our starting point is to show\nthat all continuous-time Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) dynamics, which\nincludes the well-known Replicator Dynamic, are lossless, i.e. it is passive\nwith no energy dissipation. Interestingly, we prove that passivity implies\nbounded regret, connecting two fundamental primitives of control theory and\nonline optimization.\n\nThe observation of energy conservation in FTRL inspires us to present a\nfamily of lossless learning dynamics, each of which has an underlying energy\nfunction with a simple gradient structure. This family is closed under convex\ncombination; as an immediate corollary, any convex combination of FTRL dynamics\nis lossless and thus has bounded regret. This allows us to extend the framework\nof Fox and Shamma (Games, 2013) to prove not just global asymptotic stability\nresults for game dynamics, but Poincar\\'e recurrence results as well.\nIntuitively, when a lossless game (e.g. graphical constant-sum game) is coupled\nwith lossless learning dynamic, their interconnection is also lossless, which\nresults in a pendulum-like energy-preserving recurrent behavior, generalizing\nthe results of Piliouras and Shamma (SODA, 2014) and Mertikopoulos,\nPapadimitriou and Piliouras (SODA, 2018).",

In addition to characterizing theoretical\nlimits of NN compression, this formulation shows that \\emph{pruning},\nimplicitly or explicitly, must be a part of a good compression algorithm. This\nobservation bridges a gap between parts of the literature pertaining to NN and\ndata compression, respectively, providing insight into the empirical success of\npruning for NN compression.

          "description": "Recent studies suggest that ``memorization'' is one important factor for\noverparameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) to achieve optimal performance.\nSpecifically, the perfectly fitted DNNs can memorize the labels of many\natypical samples, generalize their memorization to correctly classify test\natypical samples and enjoy better test performance. While, DNNs which are\noptimized via adversarial training algorithms can also achieve perfect training\nperformance by memorizing the labels of atypical samples, as well as the\nadversarially perturbed atypical samples. However, adversarially trained models\nalways suffer from poor generalization, with both relatively low clean accuracy\nand robustness on the test set. In this work, we study the effect of\nmemorization in adversarial trained DNNs and disclose two important findings:\n(a) Memorizing atypical samples is only effective to improve DNN's accuracy on\nclean atypical samples, but hardly improve their adversarial robustness and (b)\nMemorizing certain atypical samples will even hurt the DNN's performance on\ntypical samples. Based on these two findings, we propose Benign Adversarial\nTraining (BAT) which can facilitate adversarial training to avoid fitting\n``harmful'' atypical samples and fit as more ``benign'' atypical samples as\npossible. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of BAT, and show it\ncan achieve better clean accuracy vs. robustness trade-off than baseline\nmethods, in benchmark datasets such as CIFAR100 and Tiny~ImageNet.",

          "description": "Deep learning techniques are increasingly being adopted for classification\ntasks over the past decade, yet explaining how deep learning architectures can\nachieve state-of-the-art performance is still an elusive goal. While all the\ntraining information is embedded deeply in a trained model, we still do not\nunderstand much about its performance by only analyzing the model. This paper\nexamines the neuron activation patterns of deep learning-based classification\nmodels and explores whether the models' performances can be explained through\nneurons' activation behavior. We propose two approaches: one that models\nneurons' activation behavior as a graph and examines whether the neurons form\nmeaningful communities, and the other examines the predictability of neurons'\nbehavior using entropy. Our comprehensive experimental study reveals that both\nthe community quality (modularity) and entropy are closely related to the deep\nlearning models' performances, thus paves a novel way of explaining deep\nlearning models directly from the neurons' activation pattern.",

          "description": "In multi-server queueing systems where there is no central queue holding all\nincoming jobs, job dispatching policies are used to assign incoming jobs to the\nqueue at one of the servers. Classic job dispatching policies such as\njoin-the-shortest-queue and shortest expected delay assume that the service\nrates and queue lengths of the servers are known to the dispatcher. In this\nwork, we tackle the problem of job dispatching without the knowledge of service\nrates and queue lengths, where the dispatcher can only obtain noisy estimates\nof the service rates by observing job departures. This problem presents a novel\nexploration-exploitation trade-off between sending jobs to all the servers to\nestimate their service rates, and exploiting the currently known fastest\nservers to minimize the expected queueing delay. We propose a bandit-based\nexploration policy that learns the service rates from observed job departures.\nUnlike the standard multi-armed bandit problem where only one out of a finite\nset of actions is optimal, here the optimal policy requires identifying the\noptimal fraction of incoming jobs to be sent to each server. We present a\nregret analysis and simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed bandit-based exploration policy.",

However, using a different subset of features that is most\ninformative for each test instance individually may not only improve prediction\naccuracy, but also the overall interpretability of the model. At the same time,\nfeature selection methods for classification have been known to be the most\neffective when many features are irrelevant and/or uncorrelated. In fact,\nfeature selection ignoring correlations between features can lead to poor\nclassification performance. In this work, a Bayesian network is utilized to\nmodel feature dependencies. Using the dependency network, a new method is\nproposed that sequentially selects the best feature to evaluate for each test\ninstance individually, and stops the selection process to make a prediction\nonce it determines that no further improvement can be achieved with respect to\nclassification accuracy. The optimum number of features to acquire and the\noptimum classification strategy are derived for each test instance. The\ntheoretical properties of the optimum solution are analyzed, and a new\nalgorithm is proposed that takes advantage of these properties to implement a\nrobust and scalable solution for high dimensional settings.

In this paper, we propose a method to\nlearn the weights of subtree patterns in the framework of WWL kernels, the\nstate of the art method for graph classification task [14]. To overcome the\ncomputational issue on large scale data sets, we present an efficient learning\nalgorithm and also derive a generalization gap bound to show its convergence.\nFinally, through experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for learning the weights\nof subtree patterns.",

          "description": "The field of Deep Learning is rich with empirical evidence of human-like\nperformance on a variety of prediction tasks. However, despite these successes,\nthe recent Predicting Generalization in Deep Learning (PGDL) NeurIPS 2020\ncompetition suggests that there is a need for more robust and efficient\nmeasures of network generalization. In this work, we propose a new framework\nfor evaluating the generalization capabilities of trained networks. We use\nperturbation response (PR) curves that capture the accuracy change of a given\nnetwork as a function of varying levels of training sample perturbation. From\nthese PR curves, we derive novel statistics that capture generalization\ncapability. Specifically, we introduce two new measures for accurately\npredicting generalization gaps: the Gi-score and Pal-score, that are inspired\nby the Gini coefficient and Palma ratio (measures of income inequality), that\naccurately predict generalization gaps. Using our framework applied to intra\nand inter class sample mixup, we attain better predictive scores than the\ncurrent state-of-the-art measures on a majority of tasks in the PGDL\ncompetition. In addition, we show that our framework and the proposed\nstatistics can be used to capture to what extent a trained network is invariant\nto a given parametric input transformation, such as rotation or translation.\nTherefore, these generalization gap prediction statistics also provide a useful\nmeans for selecting the optimal network architectures and hyperparameters that\nare invariant to a certain perturbation.",

Compared to most previous parallel HAC algorithms, which\nrequire quadratic memory, our new algorithms require only linear memory, and\nare scalable to large data sets. ParChain is based on our parallelization of\nthe nearest-neighbor chain algorithm, and enables multiple clusters to be\nmerged on every round. We introduce two key optimizations that are critical for\nefficiency: a range query optimization that reduces the number of distance\ncomputations required when finding nearest neighbors of clusters, and a caching\noptimization that stores a subset of previously computed distances, which are\nlikely to be reused.\n\nExperimentally, we show that our highly-optimized implementations using 48\ncores with two-way hyper-threading achieve 5.8--110.1x speedup over\nstate-of-the-art parallel HAC algorithms and achieve 13.75--54.23x\nself-relative speedup.

          "description": "Understanding product attributes plays an important role in improving online\nshopping experience for customers and serves as an integral part for\nconstructing a product knowledge graph. Most existing methods focus on\nattribute extraction from text description or utilize visual information from\nproduct images such as shape and color. Compared to the inputs considered in\nprior works, a product image in fact contains more information, represented by\na rich mixture of words and visual clues with a layout carefully designed to\nimpress customers. This work proposes a more inclusive framework that fully\nutilizes these different modalities for attribute extraction. Inspired by\nrecent works in visual question answering, we use a transformer based sequence\nto sequence model to fuse representations of product text, Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) tokens and visual objects detected in the product image. The\nframework is further extended with the capability to extract attribute value\nacross multiple product categories with a single model, by training the decoder\nto predict both product category and attribute value and conditioning its\noutput on product category. The model provides a unified attribute extraction\nsolution desirable at an e-commerce platform that offers numerous product\ncategories with a diverse body of product attributes. We evaluated the model on\ntwo product attributes, one with many possible values and one with a small set\nof possible values, over 14 product categories and found the model could\nachieve 15% gain on the Recall and 10% gain on the F1 score compared to\nexisting methods using text-only features.",

Hence, we\npropose to reduce the cost of NAS using proxy data, i.e., a representative\nsubset of the target data, without sacrificing search performance. Even though\ndata selection has been used across various fields, our evaluation of existing\nselection methods for NAS algorithms offered by NAS-Bench-1shot1 reveals that\nthey are not always appropriate for NAS and a new selection method is\nnecessary. By analyzing proxy data constructed using various selection methods\nthrough data entropy, we propose a novel proxy data selection method tailored\nfor NAS. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness, we conduct thorough\nexperiments across diverse datasets, search spaces, and NAS algorithms.\nConsequently, NAS algorithms with the proposed selection discover architectures\nthat are competitive with those obtained using the entire dataset. It\nsignificantly reduces the search cost: executing DARTS with the proposed\nselection requires only 40 minutes on CIFAR-10 and 7.5 hours on ImageNet with a\nsingle GPU. Additionally, when the architecture searched on ImageNet using the\nproposed selection is inversely transferred to CIFAR-10, a state-of-the-art\ntest error of 2.4\\% is yielded.

Despite\nthe great success of GNNs, many real-world graphs are often sparsely and\nnoisily labeled, which could significantly degrade the performance of GNNs, as\nthe noisy information could propagate to unlabeled nodes via graph structure.\nThus, it is important to develop a label noise-resistant GNN for\nsemi-supervised node classification. Though extensive studies have been\nconducted to learn neural networks with noisy labels, they mostly focus on\nindependent and identically distributed data and assume a large number of noisy\nlabels are available, which are not directly applicable for GNNs. Thus, we\ninvestigate a novel problem of learning a robust GNN with noisy and limited\nlabels. To alleviate the negative effects of label noise, we propose to link\nthe unlabeled nodes with labeled nodes of high feature similarity to bring more\nclean label information. Furthermore, accurate pseudo labels could be obtained\nby this strategy to provide more supervision and further reduce the effects of\nlabel noise. Our theoretical and empirical analysis verify the effectiveness of\nthese two strategies under mild conditions.

          "description": "Radical progress in the field of deep learning (DL) has led to unprecedented\naccuracy in diverse inference tasks. As such, deploying DL models across mobile\nplatforms is vital to enable the development and broad availability of the\nnext-generation intelligent apps. Nevertheless, the wide and optimised\ndeployment of DL models is currently hindered by the vast system heterogeneity\nof mobile devices, the varying computational cost of different DL models and\nthe variability of performance needs across DL applications. This paper\nproposes OODIn, a framework for the optimised deployment of DL apps across\nheterogeneous mobile devices. OODIn comprises a novel DL-specific software\narchitecture together with an analytical framework for modelling DL\napplications that: (1) counteract the variability in device resources and DL\nmodels by means of a highly parametrised multi-layer design; and (2) perform a\nprincipled optimisation of both model- and system-level parameters through a\nmulti-objective formulation, designed for DL inference apps, in order to adapt\nthe deployment to the user-specified performance requirements and device\ncapabilities. Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed framework\nconsistently outperforms status-quo designs across heterogeneous devices and\ndelivers up to 4.3x and 3.5x performance gain over highly optimised platform-\nand model-aware designs respectively, while effectively adapting execution to\ndynamic changes in resource availability.",

          "description": "Surrogate algorithms such as Bayesian optimisation are especially designed\nfor black-box optimisation problems with expensive objectives, such as\nhyperparameter tuning or simulation-based optimisation. In the literature,\nthese algorithms are usually evaluated with synthetic benchmarks which are well\nestablished but have no expensive objective, and only on one or two real-life\napplications which vary wildly between papers. There is a clear lack of\nstandardisation when it comes to benchmarking surrogate algorithms on\nreal-life, expensive, black-box objective functions. This makes it very\ndifficult to draw conclusions on the effect of algorithmic contributions. A new\nbenchmark library, EXPObench, provides first steps towards such a\nstandardisation. The library is used to provide an extensive comparison of six\ndifferent surrogate algorithms on four expensive optimisation problems from\ndifferent real-life applications. This has led to new insights regarding the\nrelative importance of exploration, the evaluation time of the objective, and\nthe used model. A further contribution is that we make the algorithms and\nbenchmark problem instances publicly available, contributing to more uniform\nanalysis of surrogate algorithms. Most importantly, we include the performance\nof the six algorithms on all evaluated problem instances. This results in a\nunique new dataset that lowers the bar for researching new methods as the\nnumber of expensive evaluations required for comparison is significantly\nreduced.",

          "description": "Machine learning algorithms are increasingly used for consequential decision\nmaking regarding individuals based on their relevant features. Features that\nare relevant for accurate decisions may however lead to either explicit or\nimplicit forms of discrimination against unprivileged groups, such as those of\ncertain race or gender. This happens due to existing biases in the training\ndata, which are often replicated or even exacerbated by the learning algorithm.\nIdentifying and measuring these biases at the data level is a challenging\nproblem due to the interdependence among the features, and the decision\noutcome. In this work, we develop a framework for fairness-aware feature\nselection which takes into account the correlation among the features and the\ndecision outcome, and is based on information theoretic measures for the\naccuracy and discriminatory impacts of features. In particular, we first\npropose information theoretic measures which quantify the impact of different\nsubsets of features on the accuracy and discrimination of the decision\noutcomes. We then deduce the marginal impact of each feature using Shapley\nvalue function; a solution concept in cooperative game theory used to estimate\nmarginal contributions of players in a coalitional game. Finally, we design a\nfairness utility score for each feature (for feature selection) which\nquantifies how this feature influences accurate as well as nondiscriminatory\ndecisions. Our framework depends on the joint statistics of the data rather\nthan a particular classifier design. We examine our proposed framework on real\nand synthetic data to evaluate its performance.",

In this work, the decision-maker is\ngiven a deadline of $T$ rounds, where, on each round, it can adaptively choose\nwhich arms to pull and how many times to pull them; this distinguishes the\nnumber of decisions made (i.e., time or number of rounds) from the number of\nsamples acquired (cost). Such situations occur in clinical trials, where one\nmay need to identify a promising treatment under a deadline while minimizing\nthe number of test subjects, or in simulation-based studies run on the cloud,\nwhere we can elastically scale up or down the number of virtual machines to\nconduct as many experiments as we wish, but need to pay for the resource-time\nused. As the decision-maker can only make $T$ decisions, she may need to pull\nsome arms excessively relative to a sequential algorithm in order to perform\nwell on all possible problems. We formalize this added difficulty with two\nhardness results that indicate that unlike sequential settings, the ability to\nadapt to the problem difficulty is constrained by the finite deadline. We\npropose Elastic Batch Racing (EBR), a novel algorithm for this setting and\nbound its sample complexity, showing that EBR is optimal with respect to both\nhardness results. We present simulations evaluating EBR in this setting, where\nit outperforms baselines by several orders of magnitude.",

          "description": "Batch Normalization (BN) is a popular technique for training Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs). BN uses scaling and shifting to normalize activations of\nmini-batches to accelerate convergence and improve generalization. The recently\nproposed Iterative Normalization (IterNorm) method improves these properties by\nwhitening the activations iteratively using Newton's method. However, since\nNewton's method initializes the whitening matrix independently at each training\nstep, no information is shared between consecutive steps. In this work, instead\nof exact computation of whitening matrix at each time step, we estimate it\ngradually during training in an online fashion, using our proposed Stochastic\nWhitening Batch Normalization (SWBN) algorithm. We show that while SWBN\nimproves the convergence rate and generalization of DNNs, its computational\noverhead is less than that of IterNorm. Due to the high efficiency of the\nproposed method, it can be easily employed in most DNN architectures with a\nlarge number of layers. We provide comprehensive experiments and comparisons\nbetween BN, IterNorm, and SWBN layers to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed technique in conventional (many-shot) image classification and\nfew-shot classification tasks.",

          "description": "With the popularity of Machine Learning (ML) solutions, algorithms and data\nhave been released faster than the capacity of processing them. In this\ncontext, the problem of Algorithm Recommendation (AR) is receiving a\nsignificant deal of attention recently. This problem has been addressed in the\nliterature as a learning task, often as a Meta-Learning problem where the aim\nis to recommend the best alternative for a specific dataset. For such, datasets\nencoded by meta-features are explored by ML algorithms that try to learn the\nmapping between meta-representations and the best technique to be used. One of\nthe challenges for the successful use of ML is to define which features are the\nmost valuable for a specific dataset since several meta-features can be used,\nwhich increases the meta-feature dimension. This paper presents an empirical\nanalysis of Feature Selection and Feature Extraction in the meta-level for the\nAR problem. The present study was focused on three criteria: predictive\nperformance, dimensionality reduction, and pipeline runtime. As we verified,\napplying Dimensionality Reduction (DR) methods did not improve predictive\nperformances in general. However, DR solutions reduced about 80% of the\nmeta-features, obtaining pretty much the same performance as the original setup\nbut with lower runtimes. The only exception was PCA, which presented about the\nsame runtime as the original meta-features. Experimental results also showed\nthat various datasets have many non-informative meta-features and that it is\npossible to obtain high predictive performance using around 20% of the original\nmeta-features. Therefore, due to their natural trend for high dimensionality,\nDR methods should be used for Meta-Feature Selection and Meta-Feature\nExtraction.",

          "description": "Polyps in the colon are widely known as cancer precursors identified by\ncolonoscopy either related to diagnostic work-up for symptoms, colorectal\ncancer screening or systematic surveillance of certain diseases. Whilst most\npolyps are benign, the number, size and the surface structure of the polyp are\ntightly linked to the risk of colon cancer. There exists a high missed\ndetection rate and incomplete removal of colon polyps due to the variable\nnature, difficulties to delineate the abnormality, high recurrence rates and\nthe anatomical topography of the colon. In the past, several methods have been\nbuilt to automate polyp detection and segmentation. However, the key issue of\nmost methods is that they have not been tested rigorously on a large\nmulti-center purpose-built dataset. Thus, these methods may not generalise to\ndifferent population datasets as they overfit to a specific population and\nendoscopic surveillance. To this extent, we have curated a dataset from 6\ndifferent centers incorporating more than 300 patients. The dataset includes\nboth single frame and sequence data with 3446 annotated polyp labels with\nprecise delineation of polyp boundaries verified by six senior\ngastroenterologists. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive detection\nand pixel-level segmentation dataset curated by a team of computational\nscientists and expert gastroenterologists. This dataset has been originated as\nthe part of the Endocv2021 challenge aimed at addressing generalisability in\npolyp detection and segmentation.

          "description": "The optimal way for a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to explore is\nto learn a set of skills that achieves a uniform distribution of states.\nFollowing this,we introduce DisTop, a new model that simultaneously learns\ndiverse skills and focuses on improving rewarding skills. DisTop progressively\nbuilds a discrete topology of the environment using an unsupervised contrastive\nloss, a growing network and a goal-conditioned policy. Using this topology, a\nstate-independent hierarchical policy can select where the agent has to keep\ndiscovering skills in the state space. In turn, the newly visited states allows\nan improved learnt representation and the learning loop continues. Our\nexperiments emphasize that DisTop is agnostic to the ground state\nrepresentation and that the agent can discover the topology of its environment\nwhether the states are high-dimensional binary data, images, or proprioceptive\ninputs. We demonstrate that this paradigm is competitiveon MuJoCo benchmarks\nwith state-of-the-art algorithms on both single-task dense rewards and diverse\nskill discovery. By combining these two aspects, we showthat DisTop achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in comparison with hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning (HRL) when rewards are sparse. We believe DisTop opens new\nperspectives by showing that bottom-up skill discovery combined with\nrepresentation learning can unlock the exploration challenge in DRL.",

          "description": "Credit assignment is a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning, the\nproblem of measuring an action's influence on future rewards. Improvements in\ncredit assignment methods have the potential to boost the performance of RL\nalgorithms on many tasks, but thus far have not seen widespread adoption.\nRecently, a family of methods called Hindsight Credit Assignment (HCA) was\nproposed, which explicitly assign credit to actions in hindsight based on the\nprobability of the action having led to an observed outcome. This approach is\nappealing as a means to more efficient data usage, but remains a largely\ntheoretical idea applicable to a limited set of tabular RL tasks, and it is\nunclear how to extend HCA to Deep RL environments. In this work, we explore the\nuse of HCA-style credit in a deep RL context. We first describe the limitations\nof existing HCA algorithms in deep RL, then propose several\ntheoretically-justified modifications to overcome them. Based on this\nexploration, we present a new algorithm, Credit-Constrained Advantage\nActor-Critic (C2A2C), which ignores policy updates for actions which don't\naffect future outcomes based on credit in hindsight, while updating the policy\nas normal for those that do. We find that C2A2C outperforms Advantage\nActor-Critic (A2C) on the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) benchmark, showing\nbroad improvements over A2C and motivating further work on credit-constrained\nupdate rules for deep RL methods.",

The ELN is in structure similar to a\nradial basis function (RBF) neural network, but its input is an error sample\nand output is a loss corresponding to that error sample. That means the\nnonlinear input-output mapper of ELN creates an error loss function. The\nproposed ELN provides a unified model for a large class of error loss\nfunctions, which includes some information theoretic learning (ITL) loss\nfunctions as special cases. The activation function, weight parameters and\nnetwork size of the ELN can be predetermined or learned from the error samples.\nOn this basis, we propose a new machine learning paradigm where the learning\nprocess is divided into two stages: first, learning a loss function using an\nELN; second, using the learned loss function to continue to perform the\nlearning.

This\napproach allows for formal subdifferentiation: for instance, replacing\nderivatives by Clarke Jacobians in the usual differentiation formulas is fully\njustified for a wide class of nonsmooth problems. Moreover this calculus is\nentirely compatible with algorithmic differentiation (e.g., backpropagation).\nWe provide several applications such as training deep equilibrium networks,\ntraining neural nets with conic optimization layers, or hyperparameter-tuning\nfor nonsmooth Lasso-type models. To show the sharpness of our assumptions, we\npresent numerical experiments showcasing the extremely pathological gradient\ndynamics one can encounter when applying implicit algorithmic differentiation\nwithout any hypothesis.",

          "description": "To tackle the susceptibility of deep neural networks to adversarial examples,\nthe adversarial training has been proposed which provides a notion of security\nthrough an inner maximization problem presenting the first-order adversaries\nembedded within the outer minimization of the training loss. To generalize the\nadversarial robustness over different perturbation types, the adversarial\ntraining method has been augmented with the improved inner maximization\npresenting a union of multiple perturbations e.g., various $\\ell_p$\nnorm-bounded perturbations. However, the improved inner maximization only\nenjoys limited flexibility in terms of the allowable perturbation types. In\nthis work, through a gating mechanism, we assemble a set of expert networks,\neach one either adversarially trained to deal with a particular perturbation\ntype or normally trained for boosting accuracy on clean data. The gating module\nassigns weights dynamically to each expert to achieve superior accuracy under\nvarious data types e.g., adversarial examples, adverse weather perturbations,\nand clean input. In order to deal with the obfuscated gradients issue, the\ntraining of the gating module is conducted together with fine-tuning of the\nlast fully connected layers of expert networks through adversarial training\napproach.

          "description": "Transformer networks are able to capture patterns in data coming from many\ndomains (text, images, videos, proteins, etc.) with little or no change to\narchitecture components. We perform a theoretical analysis of the core\ncomponent responsible for signal propagation between elements, i.e. the\nself-attention matrix. In practice, this matrix typically exhibits two\nproperties: (1) it is sparse, meaning that each token only attends to a small\nsubset of other tokens; and (2) it changes dynamically depending on the input\nto the module. With these considerations in mind, we ask the following\nquestion: Can a fixed self-attention module approximate arbitrary sparse\npatterns depending on the input? How small is the hidden size $d$ required for\nsuch approximation? We make progress in answering this question and show that\nthe self-attention matrix can provably approximate sparse matrices, where\nsparsity is in terms of a bounded number of nonzero elements in each row and\ncolumn. While the parameters of self-attention are fixed, various sparse\nmatrices can be approximated by only modifying the inputs. Our proof is based\non the random projection technique and uses the seminal Johnson-Lindenstrauss\nlemma. Our proof is constructive, enabling us to propose an algorithm for\nfinding adaptive inputs and fixed self-attention parameters in order to\napproximate a given matrix. In particular, we show that, in order to\napproximate any sparse matrix up to a given precision defined in terms of\npreserving matrix element ratios, $d$ grows only logarithmically with the\nsequence length $L$ (i.e. $d = O(\\log L)$).",

In that respect, a\nPSR is indistinguishable from the corresponding POMDP. However, PSRs\nnotoriously ignore the notion of rewards, which undermines the general utility\nof PSR models for control, planning, or reinforcement learning. Therefore, we\ndescribe a sufficient and necessary accuracy condition which determines whether\na PSR is able to accurately model POMDP rewards, we show that rewards can be\napproximated even when the accuracy condition is not satisfied, and we find\nthat a non-trivial number of POMDPs taken from a well-known third-party\nrepository do not satisfy the accuracy condition. We propose reward-predictive\nstate representations (R-PSRs), a generalization of PSRs which accurately\nmodels both observations and rewards, and develop value iteration for R-PSRs.\nWe show that there is a mismatch between optimal POMDP policies and the optimal\nPSR policies derived from approximate rewards. On the other hand, optimal R-PSR\npolicies perfectly match optimal POMDP policies, reconfirming R-PSRs as\naccurate state-less generative models of observations and rewards.",

Here, we train two deep\nnets from scratch to perform realistic referent identification through\nunsupervised emergent communication. We show that the largely interpretable\nemergent protocol allows the nets to successfully communicate even about object\ntypes they did not see at training time. The visual representations induced as\na by-product of our training regime, moreover, show comparable quality, when\nre-used as generic visual features, to a recent self-supervised learning model.\nOur results provide concrete evidence of the viability of (interpretable)\nemergent deep net communication in a more realistic scenario than previously\nconsidered, as well as establishing an intriguing link between this field and\nself-supervised visual learning.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of learning a tree-structured Ising model from data,\nsuch that subsequent predictions computed using the model are accurate.\nConcretely, we aim to learn a model such that posteriors $P(X_i|X_S)$ for small\nsets of variables $S$ are accurate. Since its introduction more than 50 years\nago, the Chow-Liu algorithm, which efficiently computes the maximum likelihood\ntree, has been the benchmark algorithm for learning tree-structured graphical\nmodels. A bound on the sample complexity of the Chow-Liu algorithm with respect\nto the prediction-centric local total variation loss was shown in [BK19]. While\nthose results demonstrated that it is possible to learn a useful model even\nwhen recovering the true underlying graph is impossible, their bound depends on\nthe maximum strength of interactions and thus does not achieve the\ninformation-theoretic optimum. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm that\ncarefully combines elements of the Chow-Liu algorithm with tree metric\nreconstruction methods to efficiently and optimally learn tree Ising models\nunder a prediction-centric loss. Our algorithm is robust to model\nmisspecification and adversarial corruptions. In contrast, we show that the\ncelebrated Chow-Liu algorithm can be arbitrarily suboptimal.",

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm for machine learning, in\nwhich data owners can collaboratively train a model by sharing gradients\ninstead of their raw data. Two fundamental research problems in FL are\nincentive mechanism and privacy protection. The former focuses on how to\nincentivize data owners to participate in FL. The latter studies how to protect\ndata owners' privacy while maintaining high utility of trained models. However,\nincentive mechanism and privacy protection in FL have been studied separately\nand no work solves both problems at the same time. In this work, we address the\ntwo problems simultaneously by an FL-Market that incentivizes data owners'\nparticipation by providing appropriate payments and privacy protection.\nFL-Market enables data owners to obtain compensation according to their privacy\nloss quantified by local differential privacy (LDP). Our insight is that, by\nmeeting data owners' personalized privacy preferences and providing appropriate\npayments, we can (1) incentivize privacy risk-tolerant data owners to set\nlarger privacy parameters (i.e., gradients with less noise) and (2) provide\npreferred privacy protection for privacy risk-averse data owners. To achieve\nthis, we design a personalized LDP-based FL framework with a deep\nlearning-empowered auction mechanism for incentivizing trading gradients with\nless noise and optimal aggregation mechanisms for model updates.

We propose two different\nstrategies that incorporate reversibility in RL agents, one strategy for\nexploration (RAE) and one strategy for control (RAC). We demonstrate the\npotential of reversibility-aware agents in several environments, including the\nchallenging Sokoban game. In synthetic tasks, we show that we can learn control\npolicies that never fail and reduce to zero the side-effects of interactions,\neven without access to the reward function.",

          "description": "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) raises keen attention to identifying sparse\ntrainable subnetworks, or winning tickets, of training, which can be trained in\nisolation to achieve similar or even better performance compared to the full\nmodels. Despite many efforts being made, the most effective method to identify\nsuch winning tickets is still Iterative Magnitude-based Pruning (IMP), which is\ncomputationally expensive and has to be run thoroughly for every different\nnetwork. A natural question that comes in is: can we \"transform\" the winning\nticket found in one network to another with a different architecture, yielding\na winning ticket for the latter at the beginning, without re-doing the\nexpensive IMP? Answering this question is not only practically relevant for\nefficient \"once-for-all\" winning ticket finding, but also theoretically\nappealing for uncovering inherently scalable sparse patterns in networks. We\nconduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and propose a variety\nof strategies to tweak the winning tickets found from different networks of the\nsame model family (e.g., ResNets). Based on these results, we articulate the\nElastic Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (E-LTH): by mindfully replicating (or\ndropping) and re-ordering layers for one network, its corresponding winning\nticket could be stretched (or squeezed) into a subnetwork for another deeper\n(or shallower) network from the same family, whose performance is nearly the\nsame competitive as the latter's winning ticket directly found by IMP. We have\nalso thoroughly compared E-LTH with pruning-at-initialization and dynamic\nsparse training methods, and discuss the generalizability of E-LTH to different\nmodel families, layer types, or across datasets.

In this work, we expand the capabilities\nof widely popular single-attack $\\ell_\\infty$ AT frameworks to provide\nrobustness to the union of ($\\ell_\\infty, \\ell_2, \\ell_1$) perturbations while\npreserving their training efficiency. Our technique, referred to as Shaped\nNoise Augmented Processing (SNAP), exploits a well-established byproduct of\nsingle-attack AT frameworks -- the reduction in the curvature of the decision\nboundary of networks. SNAP prepends a given deep net with a shaped noise\naugmentation layer whose distribution is learned along with network parameters\nusing any standard single-attack AT. As a result, SNAP enhances adversarial\naccuracy of ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 against the union of ($\\ell_\\infty, \\ell_2,\n\\ell_1$) perturbations by 14%-to-20% for four state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nsingle-attack $\\ell_\\infty$ AT frameworks, and, for the first time, establishes\na benchmark for ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 on ImageNet.",

          "description": "Robotic tasks such as manipulation with visual inputs require image features\nthat capture the physical properties of the scene, e.g., the position and\nconfiguration of objects. Recently, it has been suggested to learn such\nfeatures in an unsupervised manner from simulated, self-supervised, robot\ninteraction; the idea being that high-level physical properties are well\ncaptured by modern physical simulators, and their representation from visual\ninputs may transfer well to the real world. In particular, learning methods\nbased on noise contrastive estimation have shown promising results. To\nrobustify the simulation-to-real transfer, domain randomization (DR) was\nsuggested for learning features that are invariant to irrelevant visual\nproperties such as textures or lighting. In this work, however, we show that a\nnaive application of DR to unsupervised learning based on contrastive\nestimation does not promote invariance, as the loss function maximizes mutual\ninformation between the features and both the relevant and irrelevant visual\nproperties. We propose a simple modification of the contrastive loss to fix\nthis, exploiting the fact that we can control the simulated randomization of\nvisual properties. Our approach learns physical features that are significantly\nmore robust to visual domain variation, as we demonstrate using both rigid and\nnon-rigid objects.",

Repeatedly, they send\npackets to servers, each of them treating only at most one packet at a time. In\nthe centralized case, the number of accumulated packets remains bounded (i.e.,\nthe system is \\textit{stable}) as long as the ratio between service rates and\narrival rates is larger than $1$. In the decentralized case, individual\nno-regret strategies ensures stability when this ratio is larger than $2$. Yet,\nmyopically minimizing regret disregards the long term effects due to the\ncarryover of packets to further rounds. On the other hand, minimizing long term\ncosts leads to stable Nash equilibria as soon as the ratio exceeds\n$\\frac{e}{e-1}$. Stability with decentralized learning strategies with a ratio\nbelow $2$ was a major remaining question. We first argue that for ratios up to\n$2$, cooperation is required for stability of learning strategies, as selfish\nminimization of policy regret, a \\textit{patient} notion of regret, might\nindeed still be unstable in this case.

          "description": "Dynamical systems consisting of a set of autonomous agents face the challenge\nof having to accomplish a global task, relying only on local information. While\ncentralized controllers are readily available, they face limitations in terms\nof scalability and implementation, as they do not respect the distributed\ninformation structure imposed by the network system of agents. Given the\ndifficulties in finding optimal decentralized controllers, we propose a novel\nframework using graph neural networks (GNNs) to \\emph{learn} these controllers.\nGNNs are well-suited for the task since they are naturally distributed\narchitectures and exhibit good scalability and transferability properties. The\nproblems of flocking and multi-agent path planning are explored to illustrate\nthe potential of GNNs in learning decentralized controllers.",

          "description": "We present a novel offline-online method to mitigate the computational burden\nof the characterization of conditional beliefs in statistical learning. In the\noffline phase, the proposed method learns the joint law of the belief random\nvariables and the observational random variables in the tensor-train (TT)\nformat. In the online phase, it utilizes the resulting order-preserving\nconditional transport map to issue real-time characterization of the\nconditional beliefs given new observed information. Compared with the\nstate-of-the-art normalizing flows techniques, the proposed method relies on\nfunction approximation and is equipped with thorough performance analysis. This\nalso allows us to further extend the capability of transport maps in\nchallenging problems with high-dimensional observations and high-dimensional\nbelief variables. On the one hand, we present novel heuristics to reorder\nand/or reparametrize the variables to enhance the approximation power of TT. On\nthe other, we integrate the TT-based transport maps and the parameter\nreordering/reparametrization into layered compositions to further improve the\nperformance of the resulting transport maps. We demonstrate the efficiency of\nthe proposed method on various statistical learning tasks in ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs).",

One strand of\nwork considers the complexity, in the sense of local optima, of high\ndimensional random functions with the aim of informing how local optimisation\nmethods may perform in such complicated settings. Prior work of Choromanska et\nal (2015) established a direct link between the training loss surfaces of deep\nmulti-layer perceptron networks and spherical multi-spin glass models under\nsome very strong assumptions on the network and its data. In this work, we test\nthe validity of this approach by removing the undesirable restriction to ReLU\nactivation functions.

Apart from generalization, recent works have shown\nthat mixup trained models are relatively robust to input\nperturbations/corruptions and at the same time are calibrated better than their\nnon-mixup counterparts. In this work, we investigate the benefits of defining\nthese vicinal distributions like mixup in latent space of generative models\nrather than in input space itself.

Our empirical studies on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nTiny-ImageNet demonstrate that models trained by performing mixup in the latent\nmanifold learned by VAEs are inherently more robust to various input\ncorruptions/perturbations, are significantly better calibrated, and exhibit\nmore local-linear loss landscapes.",

We observe that at certain compression ratios, the generalization\nperformance of the winning tickets can not only match but also exceed that of\nthe full model. In particular, we observe a phase transition phenomenon: As the\ncompression ratio increases, generalization performance of the winning tickets\nfirst improves then deteriorates after a certain threshold.

We further show that the phase\ntransition is task and model dependent -- as the model size becomes larger and\nthe training data set becomes smaller, the transition becomes more pronounced.\nOur experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that the super tickets improve\nsingle task fine-tuning by $0.9$ points on BERT-base and $1.0$ points on\nBERT-large, in terms of task-average score.

          "description": "There has been a growing interest in model-agnostic methods that can make\ndeep learning models more transparent and explainable to a user. Some\nresearchers recently argued that for a machine to achieve a certain degree of\nhuman-level explainability, this machine needs to provide human causally\nunderstandable explanations, also known as causability. A specific class of\nalgorithms that have the potential to provide causability are counterfactuals.\nThis paper presents an in-depth systematic review of the diverse existing body\nof literature on counterfactuals and causability for explainable artificial\nintelligence. We performed an LDA topic modelling analysis under a PRISMA\nframework to find the most relevant literature articles. This analysis resulted\nin a novel taxonomy that considers the grounding theories of the surveyed\nalgorithms, together with their underlying properties and applications in\nreal-world data. This research suggests that current model-agnostic\ncounterfactual algorithms for explainable AI are not grounded on a causal\ntheoretical formalism and, consequently, cannot promote causability to a human\ndecision-maker. Our findings suggest that the explanations derived from major\nalgorithms in the literature provide spurious correlations rather than\ncause/effects relationships, leading to sub-optimal, erroneous or even biased\nexplanations. This paper also advances the literature with new directions and\nchallenges on promoting causability in model-agnostic approaches for\nexplainable artificial intelligence.",

          "description": "Efficiently propagating credit to responsible actions is a central and\nchallenging task in reinforcement learning. To accelerate information\npropagation, this paper presents a new method that bridges a highway that\nallows unimpeded information to flow across long horizons. The key to our\nmethod is a newly proposed Bellman equation, called Greedy-Step Bellman\nOptimality Equation, through which the high-credit information can fast\npropagate across a long horizon. We theoretically show that the solution of the\nnew equation is exactly the optimal value function and the corresponding\noperator converges faster than the classical operator. Besides, it leads to a\nnew multi-step off-policy algorithm, which is capable of safely utilizing any\noff-policy data collected by the arbitrary policy. Experiments reveal that the\nproposed method is reliable, easy to implement. Moreover, without employing\nadditional components of Rainbow except Double DQN, our method achieves\ncompetitive performance with Rainbow on the benchmark tasks.",

Our attack model assumes an\n\\textit{adaptive} adversary who can arbitrarily corrupt the reward and\ntransition at every step within an episode, for at most $\\epsilon$-fraction of\nthe learning episodes. Our attack model is strictly stronger than those\nconsidered in prior works. Our first result shows that no algorithm can find a\nbetter than $O(\\epsilon)$-optimal policy under our attack model. Next, we show\nthat surprisingly the natural policy gradient (NPG) method retains a natural\nrobustness property if the reward corruption is bounded, and can find an\n$O(\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$-optimal policy. Consequently, we develop a Filtered Policy\nGradient (FPG) algorithm that can tolerate even unbounded reward corruption and\ncan find an $O(\\epsilon^{1/4})$-optimal policy. We emphasize that FPG is the\nfirst that can achieve a meaningful learning guarantee when a constant fraction\nof episodes are corrupted.

          "description": "Noise and low quality of ECG signals acquired from Holter or wearable devices\ndeteriorate the accuracy and robustness of R-peak detection algorithms. This\npaper presents a generic and robust system for R-peak detection in Holter ECG\nsignals. While many proposed algorithms have successfully addressed the problem\nof ECG R-peak detection, there is still a notable gap in the performance of\nthese detectors on such low-quality ECG records. Therefore, in this study, a\nnovel implementation of the 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used\nintegrated with a verification model to reduce the number of false alarms. This\nCNN architecture consists of an encoder block and a corresponding decoder block\nfollowed by a sample-wise classification layer to construct the 1D segmentation\nmap of R- peaks from the input ECG signal. Once the proposed model has been\ntrained, it can solely be used to detect R-peaks possibly in a single channel\nECG data stream quickly and accurately, or alternatively, such a solution can\nbe conveniently employed for real-time monitoring on a lightweight portable\ndevice. The model is tested on two open-access ECG databases: The China\nPhysiological Signal Challenge (2020) database (CPSC-DB) with more than one\nmillion beats, and the commonly used MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MIT-DB).\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed systematic approach achieves\n99.30% F1-score, 99.69% recall, and 98.91% precision in CPSC-DB, which is the\nbest R-peak detection performance ever achieved. Compared to all competing\nmethods, the proposed approach can reduce the false-positives and\nfalse-negatives in Holter ECG signals by more than 54% and 82%, respectively.\nResults also demonstrate similar or better performance than most competing\nalgorithms on MIT-DB with 99.83% F1-score, 99.85% recall, and 99.82% precision.",

We address these\nproblems by proving a new group-theoretic result in the context of equivariant\nneural networks that shows that a network is equivariant to a large group if\nand only if it is equivariant to smaller groups from which it is constructed.\nUsing this result, we design a novel fast group equivariant construction\nalgorithm, and a deep Q-learning-based search algorithm in a reduced search\nspace, yielding what we call autoequivariant networks (AENs). AENs find the\nright balance between equivariance and network size when tested on new\nbenchmark datasets, G-MNIST and G-Fashion-MNIST, obtained via group\ntransformations on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST respectively that we release.\nExtending these results to group convolutional neural networks, where we\noptimize between equivariances, augmentations, and network sizes, we find group\nequivariance to be the most dominating factor in all high-performing GCNNs on\nseveral datasets like CIFAR10, SVHN, RotMNIST, ASL, EMNIST, and KMNIST.",

          "description": "Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across\nvarious machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head\nself-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image\npatches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such\nflexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can\nfacilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain\nshifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We\nsystematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments\nencompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following\nintriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe\nocclusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.\n(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local\ntextures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to\nCNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate\nshape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,\npreviously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape\nrepresentation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic\nsegmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a\nsingle ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high\naccuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional\nand few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to\nflexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention\nmechanism.",

          "description": "Combining multiple machine learning models into an ensemble is known to\nprovide superior performance levels compared to the individual components\nforming the ensemble. This is because models can complement each other in\ntaking better decisions. Instead of just combining the models, we propose a\nself-paced ensemble learning scheme in which models learn from each other over\nseveral iterations. During the self-paced learning process based on\npseudo-labeling, in addition to improving the individual models, our ensemble\nalso gains knowledge about the target domain. To demonstrate the generality of\nour self-paced ensemble learning (SPEL) scheme, we conduct experiments on three\naudio tasks. Our empirical results indicate that SPEL significantly outperforms\nthe baseline ensemble models. We also show that applying self-paced learning on\nindividual models is less effective, illustrating the idea that models in the\nensemble actually learn from each other.",

          "description": "Despite their impressive performance in object recognition and other tasks\nunder standard testing conditions, deep networks often fail to generalize to\nout-of-distribution (o.o.d.) samples. One cause for this shortcoming is that\nmodern architectures tend to rely on \"shortcuts\" - superficial features that\ncorrelate with categories without capturing deeper invariants that hold across\ncontexts. Real-world concepts often possess a complex structure that can vary\nsuperficially across contexts, which can make the most intuitive and promising\nsolutions in one context not generalize to others. One potential way to improve\no.o.d. generalization is to assume simple solutions are unlikely to be valid\nacross contexts and avoid them, which we refer to as the too-good-to-be-true\nprior. A low-capacity network (LCN) with a shallow architecture should only be\nable to learn surface relationships, including shortcuts. We find that LCNs can\nserve as shortcut detectors. Furthermore, an LCN's predictions can be used in a\ntwo-stage approach to encourage a high-capacity network (HCN) to rely on deeper\ninvariant features that should generalize broadly. In particular, items that\nthe LCN can master are downweighted when training the HCN. Using a modified\nversion of the CIFAR-10 dataset in which we introduced shortcuts, we found that\nthe two-stage LCN-HCN approach reduced reliance on shortcuts and facilitated\no.o.d. generalization.",

The present study attempted to explore the\nfull functionality of open Sentinel satellite data and ML models for detecting\nand classifying floating plastic debris in Mytilene (Greece), Limassol\n(Cyprus), Calabria (Italy), and Beirut (Lebanon). Two ML models, i.e. Support\nVector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) were utilized to carry out the\nclassification analysis. In-situ plastic location data was collected from the\ncontrol experiment conducted in Mytilene, Greece and Limassol, Cyprus, and the\nsame was considered for training the models. Both remote sensing bands and\nspectral indices were used for developing the ML models. A spectral signature\nprofile for plastic was created for discriminating the floating plastic from\nother marine debris. A newly developed index, kernel Normalized Difference\nVegetation Index (kNDVI), was incorporated into the modelling to examine its\ncontribution to model performances. Both SVM and RF were performed well in five\nmodels and test case combinations. Among the two ML models, the highest\nperformance was measured for the RF. The inclusion of kNDVI was found effective\nand increased the model performances, reflected by high balanced accuracy\nmeasured for model 2 (~80% to ~98 % for SVM and ~87% to ~97 % for RF). Using\nthe best-performed model, an automated floating plastic detection system was\ndeveloped and tested in Calabria and Beirut. For both sites, the trained model\nhad detected the floating plastic with ~99% accuracy. Among the six predictors,\nthe FDI was found the most important variable for detecting marine floating\nplastic. These findings collectively suggest that high-resolution remote\nsensing imagery and the automated ML models can be an effective alternative for\nthe cost-effective detection of marine floating plastic.",

          "description": "Real world applications such as economics and policy making often involve\nsolving multi-agent games with two unique features: (1) The agents are\ninherently asymmetric and partitioned into leaders and followers; (2) The\nagents have different reward functions, thus the game is general-sum. The\nmajority of existing results in this field focuses on either symmetric solution\nconcepts (e.g. Nash equilibrium) or zero-sum games. It remains vastly open how\nto learn the Stackelberg equilibrium -- an asymmetric analog of the Nash\nequilibrium -- in general-sum games efficiently from samples.\n\nThis paper initiates the theoretical study of sample-efficient learning of\nthe Stackelberg equilibrium, in the bandit feedback setting where we only\nobserve noisy samples of the reward. We consider three representative\ntwo-player general-sum games: bandit games, bandit-reinforcement learning\n(bandit-RL) games, and linear bandit games. In all these games, we identify a\nfundamental gap between the exact value of the Stackelberg equilibrium and its\nestimated version using finitely many noisy samples, which can not be closed\ninformation-theoretically regardless of the algorithm. We then establish sharp\npositive results on sample-efficient learning of Stackelberg equilibrium with\nvalue optimal up to the gap identified above, with matching lower bounds in the\ndependency on the gap, error tolerance, and the size of the action spaces.\nOverall, our results unveil unique challenges in learning Stackelberg\nequilibria under noisy bandit feedback, which we hope could shed light on\nfuture research on this topic.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are notorious for making more mistakes for the\nclasses that have substantially fewer samples than the others during training.\nSuch class imbalance is ubiquitous in clinical applications and very crucial to\nhandle because the classes with fewer samples most often correspond to critical\ncases (e.g., cancer) where misclassifications can have severe consequences. Not\nto miss such cases, binary classifiers need to be operated at high True\nPositive Rates (TPR) by setting a higher threshold but this comes at the cost\nof very high False Positive Rates (FPR) for problems with class imbalance.\nExisting methods for learning under class imbalance most often do not take this\ninto account. We argue that prediction accuracy should be improved by\nemphasizing reducing FPRs at high TPRs for problems where misclassification of\nthe positive, i.e., critical, class samples are associated with higher cost. To\nthis end, we pose the training of a DNN for binary classification as a\nconstrained optimization problem and introduce a novel constraint that can be\nused with existing loss functions to enforce maximal area under the ROC curve\n(AUC) through prioritizing FPR reduction at high TPR. We solve the resulting\nconstrained optimization problem using an Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM).\nGoing beyond binary, we also propose two possible extensions of the proposed\nconstraint for multi-class classification problems. We present experimental\nresults for image-based binary and multi-class classification applications\nusing an in-house medical imaging dataset, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Our results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method improves the baselines in majority of the\ncases by attaining higher accuracy on critical classes while reducing the\nmisclassification rate for the non-critical class samples.",

Although information-theoretic\nmethods have been studied in CBO literature, they have not revealed any\nrelation between their acquisition functions and the original mutual\ninformation. In contrast, our acquisition function is an unbiased consistent\nestimator of a lower bound of mutual information. We show that our CMES-IBO has\nseveral advantageous properties such as non-negativity, estimation error bounds\nof the acquisition function, and well-definedness of the criterion, none of\nwhich have been shown for the existing information-theoretic CBO.

Very effective representations are obtained when\npowerful externally trained feature extractors (e.g. ResNets pre-trained on\nImageNet) are fine-tuned on the training data which consists of normal samples\nand no anomalies. However, this is a difficult task that can suffer from\ncatastrophic collapse, i.e. it is prone to learning trivial and non-specific\nfeatures. In this paper, we propose a new loss function which can overcome\nfailure modes of both center-loss and contrastive-loss methods.

          "description": "The ever-growing computational demands of increasingly complex machine\nlearning models frequently necessitate the use of powerful cloud-based\ninfrastructure for their training. Binary neural networks are known to be\npromising candidates for on-device inference due to their extreme compute and\nmemory savings over higher-precision alternatives. However, their existing\ntraining methods require the concurrent storage of high-precision activations\nfor all layers, generally making learning on memory-constrained devices\ninfeasible. In this paper, we demonstrate that the backward propagation\noperations needed for binary neural network training are strongly robust to\nquantization, thereby making on-the-edge learning with modern models a\npractical proposition. We introduce a low-cost binary neural network training\nstrategy exhibiting sizable memory footprint and energy reductions while\ninducing little to no accuracy loss vs Courbariaux & Bengio's standard\napproach. These resource decreases are primarily enabled through the retention\nof activations exclusively in binary format. Against the latter algorithm, our\ndrop-in replacement sees coincident memory requirement and energy consumption\ndrops of 2--6$\\times$, while reaching similar test accuracy in comparable time,\nacross a range of small-scale models trained to classify popular datasets. We\nalso demonstrate from-scratch ImageNet training of binarized ResNet-18,\nachieving a 3.12$\\times$ memory reduction.

          "description": "Recent years have seen a rapid growth of utilizing graph neural networks\n(GNNs) in the biomedical domain for tackling drug-related problems. However,\nlike any other deep architectures, GNNs are data hungry. While requiring labels\nin real world is often expensive, pretraining GNNs in an unsupervised manner\nhas been actively explored. Among them, graph contrastive learning, by\nmaximizing the mutual information between paired graph augmentations, has been\nshown to be effective on various downstream tasks. However, the current graph\ncontrastive learning framework has two limitations. First, the augmentations\nare designed for general graphs and thus may not be suitable or powerful enough\nfor certain domains. Second, the contrastive scheme only learns representations\nthat are invariant to local perturbations and thus does not consider the global\nstructure of the dataset, which may also be useful for downstream tasks.\nTherefore, in this paper, we study graph contrastive learning in the context of\nbiomedical domain, where molecular graphs are present. We propose a novel\nframework called MoCL, which utilizes domain knowledge at both local- and\nglobal-level to assist representation learning. The local-level domain\nknowledge guides the augmentation process such that variation is introduced\nwithout changing graph semantics. The global-level knowledge encodes the\nsimilarity information between graphs in the entire dataset and helps to learn\nrepresentations with richer semantics. The entire model is learned through a\ndouble contrast objective. We evaluate MoCL on various molecular datasets under\nboth linear and semi-supervised settings and results show that MoCL achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

However, neural models perform poorly in\nsettings requiring compositional generalization beyond the training data --\nparticularly to rare or unseen subsequences. Past work has found symbolic\nscaffolding (e.g. grammars or automata) essential in these settings. We\ndescribe R&R, a learned data augmentation scheme that enables a large category\nof compositional generalizations without appeal to latent symbolic structure.\nR&R has two components: recombination of original training examples via a\nprototype-based generative model and resampling of generated examples to\nencourage extrapolation. Training an ordinary neural sequence model on a\ndataset augmented with recombined and resampled examples significantly improves\ngeneralization in two language processing problems -- instruction following\n(SCAN) and morphological analysis (SIGMORPHON 2018) -- where R&R enables\nlearning of new constructions and tenses from as few as eight initial examples.",

          "description": "Domain generalization (DG) methods aim to achieve generalizability to an\nunseen target domain by using only training data from the source domains.\nAlthough a variety of DG methods have been proposed, a recent study shows that\nunder a fair evaluation protocol, called DomainBed, the simple empirical risk\nminimization (ERM) approach works comparable to or even outperforms previous\nmethods. Unfortunately, simply solving ERM on a complex, non-convex loss\nfunction can easily lead to sub-optimal generalizability by seeking sharp\nminima. In this paper, we theoretically show that finding flat minima results\nin a smaller domain generalization gap. We also propose a simple yet effective\nmethod, named Stochastic Weight Averaging Densely (SWAD), to find flat minima.\nSWAD finds flatter minima and suffers less from overfitting than does the\nvanilla SWA by a dense and overfit-aware stochastic weight sampling strategy.\nSWAD shows state-of-the-art performances on five DG benchmarks, namely PACS,\nVLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet, with consistent and large\nmargins of +1.6% averagely on out-of-domain accuracy. We also compare SWAD with\nconventional generalization methods, such as data augmentation and consistency\nregularization methods, to verify that the remarkable performance improvements\nare originated from by seeking flat minima, not from better in-domain\ngeneralizability. Last but not least, SWAD is readily adaptable to existing DG\nmethods without modification; the combination of SWAD and an existing DG method\nfurther improves DG performances.",

This study addresses the algorithm selection challenge\nfor data clustering, a fundamental task in data mining that is aimed at\ngrouping similar objects. We present MARCO-GE, a novel meta-learning approach\nfor the automated recommendation of clustering algorithms. MARCO-GE first\ntransforms datasets into graphs and then utilizes a graph convolutional neural\nnetwork technique to extract their latent representation. Using the embedding\nrepresentations obtained, MARCO-GE trains a ranking meta-model capable of\naccurately recommending top-performing algorithms for a new dataset and\nclustering evaluation measure.

          "description": "Modeling the dynamics of real-world physical systems is critical for\nspatiotemporal prediction tasks, but challenging when data is limited. The\nscarcity of real-world data and the difficulty in reproducing the data\ndistribution hinder directly applying meta-learning techniques. Although the\nknowledge of governing partial differential equations (PDE) of data can be\nhelpful for the fast adaptation to few observations, it is mostly infeasible to\nexactly find the equation for observations in real-world physical systems. In\nthis work, we propose a framework, physics-aware meta-learning with auxiliary\ntasks, whose spatial modules incorporate PDE-independent knowledge and temporal\nmodules utilize the generalized features from the spatial modules to be adapted\nto the limited data, respectively. The framework is inspired by a local\nconservation law expressed mathematically as a continuity equation and does not\nrequire the exact form of governing equation to model the spatiotemporal\nobservations. The proposed method mitigates the need for a large number of\nreal-world tasks for meta-learning by leveraging spatial information in\nsimulated data to meta-initialize the spatial modules. We apply the proposed\nframework to both synthetic and real-world spatiotemporal prediction tasks and\ndemonstrate its superior performance with limited observations.",

Traditionally, these tasks are implemented\nusing separate deep learning models for separate tasks, which is not efficient\nbecause it involves unnecessary training repetitions, demands greater\ncomputational resources, and requires a relatively large amount of labeled\ndata.

          "description": "This paper investigates the motion planning of autonomous dynamical systems\nmodeled by Markov decision processes (MDP) with unknown transition\nprobabilities over continuous state and action spaces. Linear temporal logic\n(LTL) is used to specify high-level tasks over infinite horizon, which can be\nconverted into a limit deterministic generalized B\\\"uchi automaton (LDGBA) with\nseveral accepting sets. The novelty is to design an embedded product MDP\n(EP-MDP) between the LDGBA and the MDP by incorporating a synchronous\ntracking-frontier function to record unvisited accepting sets of the automaton,\nand to facilitate the satisfaction of the accepting conditions. The proposed\nLDGBA-based reward shaping and discounting schemes for the model-free\nreinforcement learning (RL) only depend on the EP-MDP states and can overcome\nthe issues of sparse rewards. Rigorous analysis shows that any RL method that\noptimizes the expected discounted return is guaranteed to find an optimal\npolicy whose traces maximize the satisfaction probability. A modular deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is then developed to generate such\npolicies over continuous state and action spaces. The performance of our\nframework is evaluated via an array of OpenAI gym environments.",

          "description": "In reality, learning from multi-view multi-label data inevitably confronts\nthree challenges: missing labels, incomplete views, and non-aligned views.\nExisting methods mainly concern the first two and commonly need multiple\nassumptions to attack them, making even state-of-the-arts involve at least two\nexplicit hyper-parameters such that model selection is quite difficult. More\nroughly, they will fail in handling the third challenge, let alone addressing\nthe three jointly. In this paper, we aim at meeting these under the least\nassumption by building a concise yet effective model with just one\nhyper-parameter. To ease insufficiency of available labels, we exploit not only\nthe consensus of multiple views but also the global and local structures hidden\namong multiple labels. Specifically, we introduce an indicator matrix to tackle\nthe first two challenges in a regression form while aligning the same\nindividual labels and all labels of different views in a common label space to\nbattle the third challenge. In aligning, we characterize the global and local\nstructures of multiple labels to be high-rank and low-rank, respectively.\nSubsequently, an efficient algorithm with linear time complexity in the number\nof samples is established. Finally, even without view-alignment, our method\nsubstantially outperforms state-of-the-arts with view-alignment on five real\ndatasets.",

          "description": "Machine learning has started to be deployed in fields such as healthcare and\nfinance, which propelled the need for and growth of privacy-preserving machine\nlearning (PPML). We propose an actively secure four-party protocol (4PC), and a\nframework for PPML, showcasing its applications on four of the most\nwidely-known machine learning algorithms -- Linear Regression, Logistic\nRegression, Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks. Our 4PC\nprotocol tolerating at most one malicious corruption is practically efficient\nas compared to the existing works. We use the protocol to build an efficient\nmixed-world framework (Trident) to switch between the Arithmetic, Boolean, and\nGarbled worlds. Our framework operates in the offline-online paradigm over\nrings and is instantiated in an outsourced setting for machine learning. Also,\nwe propose conversions especially relevant to privacy-preserving machine\nlearning. The highlights of our framework include using a minimal number of\nexpensive circuits overall as compared to ABY3. This can be seen in our\ntechnique for truncation, which does not affect the online cost of\nmultiplication and removes the need for any circuits in the offline phase. Our\nB2A conversion has an improvement of $\\mathbf{7} \\times$ in rounds and\n$\\mathbf{18} \\times$ in the communication complexity. The practicality of our\nframework is argued through improvements in the benchmarking of the\naforementioned algorithms when compared with ABY3. All the protocols are\nimplemented over a 64-bit ring in both LAN and WAN settings. Our improvements\ngo up to $\\mathbf{187} \\times$ for the training phase and $\\mathbf{158} \\times$\nfor the prediction phase when observed over LAN and WAN.",

          "description": "Accurate and trustworthy epidemic forecasting is an important problem that\nhas impact on public health planning and disease mitigation. Most existing\nepidemic forecasting models disregard uncertainty quantification, resulting in\nmis-calibrated predictions. Recent works in deep neural models for\nuncertainty-aware time-series forecasting also have several limitations; e.g.\nit is difficult to specify meaningful priors in Bayesian NNs, while methods\nlike deep ensembling are computationally expensive in practice. In this paper,\nwe fill this important gap. We model the forecasting task as a probabilistic\ngenerative process and propose a functional neural process model called EPIFNP,\nwhich directly models the probability density of the forecast value. EPIFNP\nleverages a dynamic stochastic correlation graph to model the correlations\nbetween sequences in a non-parametric way, and designs different stochastic\nlatent variables to capture functional uncertainty from different perspectives.\nOur extensive experiments in a real-time flu forecasting setting show that\nEPIFNP significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in both\naccuracy and calibration metrics, up to 2.5x in accuracy and 2.4x in\ncalibration. Additionally, due to properties of its generative process,EPIFNP\nlearns the relations between the current season and similar patterns of\nhistorical seasons,enabling interpretable forecasts. Beyond epidemic\nforecasting, the EPIFNP can be of independent interest for advancing principled\nuncertainty quantification in deep sequential models for predictive analytics",

We\nconduct the structural analysis of optimal policy and study the impact of model\nrisk on the policy selection.

However, existing systems\nusually depend on a pool of hand-made questions, limiting how fine-grained and\nopen-ended they can be in adapting to individual students. We explore targeted\nquestion generation as a controllable sequence generation task. We first show\nhow to fine-tune pre-trained language models for deep knowledge tracing\n(LM-KT). This model accurately predicts the probability of a student answering\na question correctly, and generalizes to questions not seen in training. We\nthen use LM-KT to specify the objective and data for training a model to\ngenerate questions conditioned on the student and target difficulty. Our\nresults show we succeed at generating novel, well-calibrated language\ntranslation questions for second language learners from a real online education\nplatform.",

          "description": "Query auto-completion (QAC) is a fundamental feature in search engines where\nthe task is to suggest plausible completions of a prefix typed in the search\nbar. Previous queries in the user session can provide useful context for the\nuser's intent and can be leveraged to suggest auto-completions that are more\nrelevant while adhering to the user's prefix. Such session-aware QACs can be\ngenerated by recent sequence-to-sequence deep learning models; however, these\ngenerative approaches often do not meet the stringent latency requirements of\nresponding to each user keystroke. Moreover, these generative approaches pose\nthe risk of showing nonsensical queries.\n\nIn this paper, we provide a solution to this problem: we take the novel\napproach of modeling session-aware QAC as an eXtreme Multi-Label Ranking (XMR)\nproblem where the input is the previous query in the session and the user's\ncurrent prefix, while the output space is the set of tens of millions of\nqueries entered by users in the recent past. We adapt a popular XMR algorithm\nfor this purpose by proposing several modifications to the key steps in the\nalgorithm. The proposed modifications yield a 10x improvement in terms of Mean\nReciprocal Rank (MRR) over the baseline XMR approach on a public search logs\ndataset. We are able to maintain an inference latency of less than 10 ms while\nstill using session context. When compared against baseline models of\nacceptable latency, we observed a 33% improvement in MRR for short prefixes of\nup to 3 characters. Moreover, our model yielded a statistically significant\nimprovement of 2.81% over a production QAC system in terms of suggestion\nacceptance rate, when deployed on the search bar of an online shopping store as\npart of an A/B test.",

          "description": "Agents that learn to select optimal actions represent a prominent focus of\nthe sequential decision-making literature. In the face of a complex environment\nor constraints on time and resources, however, aiming to synthesize such an\noptimal policy can become infeasible. These scenarios give rise to an important\ntrade-off between the information an agent must acquire to learn and the\nsub-optimality of the resulting policy. While an agent designer has a\npreference for how this trade-off is resolved, existing approaches further\nrequire that the designer translate these preferences into a fixed learning\ntarget for the agent. In this work, leveraging rate-distortion theory, we\nautomate this process such that the designer need only express their\npreferences via a single hyperparameter and the agent is endowed with the\nability to compute its own learning targets that best achieve the desired\ntrade-off. We establish a general bound on expected discounted regret for an\nagent that decides what to learn in this manner along with computational\nexperiments that illustrate the expressiveness of designer preferences and even\nshow improvements over Thompson sampling in identifying an optimal policy.",

Memcodes are straightforward\nto implement, require no additional loss terms, are stable to train compared\nwith other approaches, and show evidence of interpretability. To predict on the\nMemcode space, we use an autoregressive encoder-decoder model conditioned on\naudio. Additionally, our model can control latent attributes in the generated\nvideo that are not annotated in the data. We train NWT on clips from HBO's Last\nWeek Tonight with John Oliver.

One approach to designing fair algorithms is to use\nrelaxations of fairness notions as regularization terms or in a constrained\noptimization problem. We observe that the hyperbolic tangent function can\napproximate the indicator function. We leverage this property to define a\ndifferentiable relaxation that approximates fairness notions provably better\nthan existing relaxations. In addition, we propose a model-agnostic\nmulti-objective architecture that can simultaneously optimize for multiple\nfairness notions and multiple sensitive attributes and supports all statistical\nparity-based notions of fairness. We use our relaxation with the\nmulti-objective architecture to learn fair classifiers.

In\nthis case, the convergence of popular FL algorithms such as FedAvg is severely\ninfluenced by the straggling devices. To tackle this challenge, we study\nfederated learning algorithms under arbitrary device unavailability and propose\nan algorithm named Memory-augmented Impatient Federated Averaging (MIFA).

          "description": "This paper underlines a subtle property of batch-normalization (BN):\nSuccessive batch normalizations with random linear transformations make hidden\nrepresentations increasingly orthogonal across layers of a deep neural network.\nWe establish a non-asymptotic characterization of the interplay between depth,\nwidth, and the orthogonality of deep representations. More precisely, under a\nmild assumption, we prove that the deviation of the representations from\northogonality rapidly decays with depth up to a term inversely proportional to\nthe network width. This result has two main implications: 1) Theoretically, as\nthe depth grows, the distribution of the representation -- after the linear\nlayers -- contracts to a Wasserstein-2 ball around an isotropic Gaussian\ndistribution. Furthermore, the radius of this Wasserstein ball shrinks with the\nwidth of the network. 2) In practice, the orthogonality of the representations\ndirectly influences the performance of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). When\nrepresentations are initially aligned, we observe SGD wastes many iterations to\northogonalize representations before the classification. Nevertheless, we\nexperimentally show that starting optimization from orthogonal representations\nis sufficient to accelerate SGD, with no need for BN.",

          "description": "Most machine learning models are validated and tested on fixed datasets. This\ncan give an incomplete picture of the capabilities and weaknesses of the model.\nSuch weaknesses can be revealed at test time in the real world. The risks\ninvolved in such failures can be loss of profits, loss of time or even loss of\nlife in certain critical applications. In order to alleviate this issue,\nsimulators can be controlled in a fine-grained manner using interpretable\nparameters to explore the semantic image manifold. In this work, we propose a\nframework for learning how to test machine learning algorithms using simulators\nin an adversarial manner in order to find weaknesses in the model before\ndeploying it in critical scenarios. We apply this model in a face recognition\nscenario. We are the first to show that weaknesses of models trained on real\ndata can be discovered using simulated samples. Using our proposed method, we\ncan find adversarial synthetic faces that fool contemporary face recognition\nmodels. This demonstrates the fact that these models have weaknesses that are\nnot measured by commonly used validation datasets. We hypothesize that this\ntype of adversarial examples are not isolated, but usually lie in connected\ncomponents in the latent space of the simulator.

Our backpropagation algorithm\n\"spins\" the reels to seek \"winning\" combinations, i.e., selections of random\nweight values that minimize the given loss. Quite surprisingly, we find that\nallocating just a few random values to each connection (e.g., 8 values per\nconnection) yields highly competitive combinations despite being dramatically\nmore constrained compared to traditionally learned weights. Moreover,\nfinetuning these combinations often improves performance over the trained\nbaselines.

          "description": "High-quality estimates of uncertainty and robustness are crucial for numerous\nreal-world applications, especially for deep learning which underlies many\ndeployed ML systems. The ability to compare techniques for improving these\nestimates is therefore very important for research and practice alike. Yet,\ncompetitive comparisons of methods are often lacking due to a range of reasons,\nincluding: compute availability for extensive tuning, incorporation of\nsufficiently many baselines, and concrete documentation for reproducibility. In\nthis paper we introduce Uncertainty Baselines: high-quality implementations of\nstandard and state-of-the-art deep learning methods on a variety of tasks. As\nof this writing, the collection spans 19 methods across 9 tasks, each with at\nleast 5 metrics. Each baseline is a self-contained experiment pipeline with\neasily reusable and extendable components. Our goal is to provide immediate\nstarting points for experimentation with new methods or applications.\nAdditionally we provide model checkpoints, experiment outputs as Python\nnotebooks, and leaderboards for comparing results.

          "description": "Recently, there has been considerable research interest in graph clustering\naimed at data partition using the graph information. However, one limitation of\nthe most of graph-based methods is that they assume the graph structure to\noperate is fixed and reliable. And there are inevitably some edges in the graph\nthat are not conducive to graph clustering, which we call spurious edges. This\npaper is the first attempt to employ graph pooling technique for node\nclustering and we propose a novel dual graph embedding network (DGEN), which is\ndesigned as a two-step graph encoder connected by a graph pooling layer to\nlearn the graph embedding. In our model, it is assumed that if a node and its\nnearest neighboring node are close to the same clustering center, this node is\nan informative node and this edge can be considered as a cluster-friendly edge.\nBased on this assumption, the neighbor cluster pooling (NCPool) is devised to\nselect the most informative subset of nodes and the corresponding edges based\non the distance of nodes and their nearest neighbors to the cluster centers.\nThis can effectively alleviate the impact of the spurious edges on the\nclustering. Finally, to obtain the clustering assignment of all nodes, a\nclassifier is trained using the clustering results of the selected nodes.\nExperiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed method over state-of-the-art algorithms.",

          "description": "Building invariance to non-meaningful transformations is essential to\nbuilding efficient and generalizable machine learning models. In practice, the\nmost common way to learn invariance is through data augmentation. There has\nbeen recent interest in the development of methods that learn distributions on\naugmentation transformations from the training data itself. While such\napproaches are beneficial since they are responsive to the data, they ignore\nthe fact that in many situations the range of transformations to which a model\nneeds to be invariant changes depending on the particular class input belongs\nto. For example, if a model needs to be able to predict whether an image\ncontains a starfish or a dog, we may want to apply random rotations to starfish\nimages during training (since these do not have a preferred orientation), but\nwe would not want to do this to images of dogs. In this work we introduce a\nmethod by which we can learn class conditional distributions on augmentation\ntransformations. We give a number of examples where our methods learn different\nnon-meaningful transformations depending on class and further show how our\nmethod can be used as a tool to probe the symmetries intrinsic to a potentially\ncomplex dataset.",

          "description": "When modeling dynamical systems from real-world data samples, the\ndistribution of data often changes according to the environment in which they\nare captured, and the dynamics of the system itself vary from one environment\nto another. Generalizing across environments thus challenges the conventional\nframeworks. The classical settings suggest either considering data as i.i.d.\nand learning a single model to cover all situations or learning\nenvironment-specific models. Both are sub-optimal: the former disregards the\ndiscrepancies between environments leading to biased solutions, while the\nlatter does not exploit their potential commonalities and is prone to scarcity\nproblems. We propose LEADS, a novel framework that leverages the commonalities\nand discrepancies among known environments to improve model generalization.\nThis is achieved with a tailored training formulation aiming at capturing\ncommon dynamics within a shared model while additional terms capture\nenvironment-specific dynamics. We ground our approach in theory, exhibiting a\ndecrease in sample complexity with our approach and corroborate these results\nempirically, instantiating it for linear dynamics. Moreover, we concretize this\nframework for neural networks and evaluate it experimentally on representative\nfamilies of nonlinear dynamics. We show that this new setting can exploit\nknowledge extracted from environment-dependent data and improves generalization\nfor both known and novel environments.",

          "description": "Mitigating bias in machine learning systems requires refining our\nunderstanding of bias propagation pathways: from societal structures to\nlarge-scale data to trained models to impact on society. In this work, we focus\non one aspect of the problem, namely bias amplification: the tendency of models\nto amplify the biases present in the data they are trained on. A metric for\nmeasuring bias amplification was introduced in the seminal work by Zhao et al.\n(2017); however, as we demonstrate, this metric suffers from a number of\nshortcomings including conflating different types of bias amplification and\nfailing to account for varying base rates of protected attributes. We introduce\nand analyze a new, decoupled metric for measuring bias amplification,\n$\\text{BiasAmp}_{\\rightarrow}$ (Directional Bias Amplification). We thoroughly\nanalyze and discuss both the technical assumptions and normative implications\nof this metric. We provide suggestions about its measurement by cautioning\nagainst predicting sensitive attributes, encouraging the use of confidence\nintervals due to fluctuations in the fairness of models across runs, and\ndiscussing the limitations of what this metric captures.

          "description": "Deep reinforcement learning has achieved significant success in many\ndecision-making tasks in various fields. However, it requires a large training\ntime of dense neural networks to obtain a good performance. This hinders its\napplicability on low-resource devices where memory and computation are strictly\nconstrained. In a step towards enabling deep reinforcement learning agents to\nbe applied to low-resource devices, in this work, we propose for the first time\nto dynamically train deep reinforcement learning agents with sparse neural\nnetworks from scratch. We adopt the evolution principles of dynamic sparse\ntraining in the reinforcement learning paradigm and introduce a training\nalgorithm that optimizes the sparse topology and the weight values jointly to\ndynamically fit the incoming data. Our approach is easy to be integrated into\nexisting deep reinforcement learning algorithms and has many favorable\nadvantages. First, it allows for significant compression of the network size\nwhich reduces the memory and computation costs substantially. This would\naccelerate not only the agent inference but also its training process. Second,\nit speeds up the agent learning process and allows for reducing the number of\nrequired training steps. Third, it can achieve higher performance than training\nthe dense counterpart network. We evaluate our approach on OpenAI gym\ncontinuous control tasks. The experimental results show the effectiveness of\nour approach in achieving higher performance than one of the state-of-art\nbaselines with a 50\\% reduction in the network size and floating-point\noperations (FLOPs). Moreover, our proposed approach can reach the same\nperformance achieved by the dense network with a 40-50\\% reduction in the\nnumber of training steps.",

          "description": "In multiagent environments, several decision-making individuals interact\nwhile adhering to the dynamics constraints imposed by the environment. These\ninteractions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents'\ndecision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to study\nfrom a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted on\nlearning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, for\nexample, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-driving\ncars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may be\navailable in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets of\nplayers may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, while\nunobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study the\nproblem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and future\nobservations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations for\nother agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- and\nbackward-information in combination with graph networks and variational\nautoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. We\nevaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projective\ncamera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player state\nestimation setting.

Prior to our work,\nproducing rewards from self-supervised embeddings has typically required\nalignment with a reference trajectory, which may be difficult to acquire. We\nshow empirically that if the embeddings are aware of task-progress, simply\ntaking the negative distance between the current state and goal state in the\nlearned embedding space is useful as a reward for training policies with\nreinforcement learning. We find our learned reward function not only works for\nembodiments seen during training, but also generalizes to entirely new\nembodiments.

          "description": "Machine-learning force fields (MLFF) should be accurate, computationally and\ndata efficient, and applicable to molecules, materials, and interfaces thereof.\nCurrently, MLFFs often introduce tradeoffs that restrict their practical\napplicability to small subsets of chemical space or require exhaustive datasets\nfor training. Here, we introduce the Bravais-Inspired Gradient-Domain Machine\nLearning (BIGDML) approach and demonstrate its ability to construct reliable\nforce fields using a training set with just 10-200 geometries for materials\nincluding pristine and defect-containing 2D and 3D semiconductors and metals,\nas well as chemisorbed and physisorbed atomic and molecular adsorbates on\nsurfaces. The BIGDML model employs the full relevant symmetry group for a given\nmaterial, does not assume artificial atom types or localization of atomic\ninteractions and exhibits high data efficiency and state-of-the-art energy\naccuracies (errors substantially below 1 meV per atom) for an extended set of\nmaterials. Extensive path-integral molecular dynamics carried out with BIGDML\nmodels demonstrate the counterintuitive localization of benzene--graphene\ndynamics induced by nuclear quantum effects and allow to rationalize the\nArrhenius behavior of hydrogen diffusion coefficient in a Pd crystal for a wide\nrange of temperatures.",

          "description": "When applying machine learning in safety-critical systems, a reliable\nassessment of the uncertainy of a classifier is required. However, deep neural\nnetworks are known to produce highly overconfident predictions on\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data and even if trained to be non-confident on OOD\ndata one can still adversarially manipulate OOD data so that the classifer\nagain assigns high confidence to the manipulated samples. In this paper we\npropose a novel method where from first principles we combine a certifiable OOD\ndetector with a standard classifier into an OOD aware classifier. In this way\nwe achieve the best of two worlds: certifiably adversarially robust OOD\ndetection, even for OOD samples close to the in-distribution, without loss in\nprediction accuracy and close to state-of-the-art OOD detection performance for\nnon-manipulated OOD data. Moreover, due to the particular construction our\nclassifier provably avoids the asymptotic overconfidence problem of standard\nneural networks.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have been shown as a class of useful tools for\naddressing signal recognition issues in recent years, especially for\nidentifying the nonlinear feature structures of signals. However, this power of\nmost deep learning techniques heavily relies on an abundant amount of training\ndata, so the performance of classic neural nets decreases sharply when the\nnumber of training data samples is small or unseen data are presented in the\ntesting phase. This calls for an advanced strategy, i.e., model-agnostic\nmeta-learning (MAML), which is able to capture the invariant representation of\nthe data samples or signals. In this paper, inspired by the special structure\nof the signal, i.e., real and imaginary parts consisted in practical\ntime-series signals, we propose a Complex-valued Attentional MEta Learner\n(CAMEL) for the problem of few-shot signal recognition by leveraging attention\nand meta-learning in the complex domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nalso the first complex-valued MAML that can find the first-order stationary\npoints of general nonconvex problems with theoretical convergence guarantees.\nExtensive experiments results showcase the superiority of the proposed CAMEL\ncompared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been integrated in several models of\nrecommendation to augment the informational value of an item by means of its\nrelated entities in the graph. Yet, existing datasets only provide explicit\nratings on items and no information is provided about user opinions of other\n(non-recommendable) entities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new\ndataset, called the MindReader, providing explicit user ratings both for items\nand for KG entities. In this first version, the MindReader dataset provides\nmore than 102 thousands explicit ratings collected from 1,174 real users on\nboth items and entities from a KG in the movie domain. This dataset has been\ncollected through an online interview application that we also release open\nsource. As a demonstration of the importance of this new dataset, we present a\ncomparative study of the effect of the inclusion of ratings on non-item KG\nentities in a variety of state-of-the-art recommendation models. In particular,\nwe show that most models, whether designed specifically for graph data or not,\nsee improvements in recommendation quality when trained on explicit non-item\nratings. Moreover, for some models, we show that non-item ratings can\neffectively replace item ratings without loss of recommendation quality. This\nfinding, thanks also to an observed greater familiarity of users towards common\nKG entities than towards long-tail items, motivates the use of KG entities for\nboth warm and cold-start recommendations.",

In fact, obtaining an algorithm for FL which is\nuniformly better than simple centralized training has been a major open problem\nthus far. In this work, we propose a general algorithmic framework, Mime, which\ni) mitigates client drift and ii) adapts arbitrary centralized optimization\nalgorithms such as momentum and Adam to the cross-device federated learning\nsetting. Mime uses a combination of control-variates and server-level\nstatistics (e.g. momentum) at every client-update step to ensure that each\nlocal update mimics that of the centralized method run on iid data. We prove a\nreduction result showing that Mime can translate the convergence of a generic\nalgorithm in the centralized setting into convergence in the federated setting.\nFurther, we show that when combined with momentum based variance reduction,\nMime is provably faster than any centralized method--the first such result. We\nalso perform a thorough experimental exploration of Mime's performance on real\nworld datasets.",

          "description": "Generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, or domain generalization,\nis one of the central problems in modern machine learning. Recently, there is a\nsurge of attempts to propose algorithms for OOD that mainly build upon the idea\nof extracting invariant features. Although intuitively reasonable, theoretical\nunderstanding of what kind of invariance can guarantee OOD generalization is\nstill limited, and generalization to arbitrary out-of-distribution is clearly\nimpossible. In this work, we take the first step towards rigorous and\nquantitative definitions of 1) what is OOD; and 2) what does it mean by saying\nan OOD problem is learnable. We also introduce a new concept of expansion\nfunction, which characterizes to what extent the variance is amplified in the\ntest domains over the training domains, and therefore give a quantitative\nmeaning of invariant features. Based on these, we prove OOD generalization\nerror bounds. It turns out that OOD generalization largely depends on the\nexpansion function. As recently pointed out by Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz (2020),\nany OOD learning algorithm without a model selection module is incomplete. Our\ntheory naturally induces a model selection criterion. Extensive experiments on\nbenchmark OOD datasets demonstrate that our model selection criterion has a\nsignificant advantage over baselines.",

          "description": "Vision transformers (ViTs) process input images as sequences of patches via\nself-attention; a radically different architecture than convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs). This makes it interesting to study the adversarial feature\nspace of ViT models and their transferability. In particular, we observe that\nadversarial patterns found via conventional adversarial attacks show very low\nblack-box transferability even for large ViT models. However, we show that this\nphenomenon is only due to the sub-optimal attack procedures that do not\nleverage the true representation potential of ViTs. A deep ViT is composed of\nmultiple blocks, with a consistent architecture comprising of self-attention\nand feed-forward layers, where each block is capable of independently producing\na class token. Formulating an attack using only the last class token\n(conventional approach) does not directly leverage the discriminative\ninformation stored in the earlier tokens, leading to poor adversarial\ntransferability of ViTs. Using the compositional nature of ViT models, we\nenhance the transferability of existing attacks by introducing two novel\nstrategies specific to the architecture of ViT models. (i) Self-Ensemble: We\npropose a method to find multiple discriminative pathways by dissecting a\nsingle ViT model into an ensemble of networks. This allows explicitly utilizing\nclass-specific information at each ViT block. (ii) Token Refinement: We then\npropose to refine the tokens to further enhance the discriminative capacity at\neach block of ViT. Our token refinement systematically combines the class\ntokens with structural information preserved within the patch tokens. An\nadversarial attack, when applied to such refined tokens within the ensemble of\nclassifiers found in a single vision transformer, has significantly higher\ntransferability.",

However,\nsometimes it is only possible to measure qualitative changes of a system in\nresponse to a controlled condition. In dynamical systems theory, such change\npoints are known as \\textit{bifurcations} and lie on a function of the\ncontrolled condition called the \\textit{bifurcation diagram}. In this work, we\npropose a gradient-based semi-supervised approach for inferring the parameters\nof differential equations that produce a user-specified bifurcation diagram.\nThe cost function contains a supervised error term that is minimal when the\nmodel bifurcations match the specified targets and an unsupervised bifurcation\nmeasure which has gradients that push optimisers towards bifurcating parameter\nregimes. The gradients can be computed without the need to differentiate\nthrough the operations of the solver that was used to compute the diagram.

Our technique\nexploits the observation that, because DNN training consists of repetitive\ncompute steps, predicting the execution time of a single iteration is usually\nenough to characterize the performance of an entire training process. We make\npredictions by scaling the execution time of each operation in a training\niteration from one GPU to another using either (i) wave scaling, a technique\nbased on a GPU's execution model, or (ii) pre-trained multilayer perceptrons.\nWe implement our technique into a Python library called Habitat and find that\nit makes accurate iteration execution time predictions (with an average error\nof 11.8%) on ResNet-50, Inception v3, the Transformer, GNMT, and DCGAN across\nsix different GPU architectures.

The highlight is that the\nannotations from different domains can be efficiently reused and consistently\nboost performance for each specific domain. This is achieved by first\npretraining the network via the proposed pixel-to-prototype contrastive loss\nover multiple datasets regardless of their taxonomy labels, and followed by\nfine-tuning the pretrained model over specific dataset as usual. In order to\nbetter model the relationship among images and classes from different datasets,\nwe extend the pixel level embeddings via cross dataset mixing and propose a\npixel-to-class sparse coding strategy that explicitly models the pixel-class\nsimilarity over the manifold embedding space. In this way, we are able to\nincrease intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, as well as\nconsidering inter-class similarity across different datasets for better\ntransferability.

          "description": "Recent works in self-supervised learning have advanced the state-of-the-art\nby relying on the contrastive learning paradigm, which learns representations\nby pushing positive pairs, or similar examples from the same class, closer\ntogether while keeping negative pairs far apart. Despite the empirical\nsuccesses, theoretical foundations are limited -- prior analyses assume\nconditional independence of the positive pairs given the same class label, but\nrecent empirical applications use heavily correlated positive pairs (i.e., data\naugmentations of the same image). Our work analyzes contrastive learning\nwithout assuming conditional independence of positive pairs using a novel\nconcept of the augmentation graph on data. Edges in this graph connect\naugmentations of the same data, and ground-truth classes naturally form\nconnected sub-graphs. We propose a loss that performs spectral decomposition on\nthe population augmentation graph and can be succinctly written as a\ncontrastive learning objective on neural net representations. Minimizing this\nobjective leads to features with provable accuracy guarantees under linear\nprobe evaluation. By standard generalization bounds, these accuracy guarantees\nalso hold when minimizing the training contrastive loss. Empirically, the\nfeatures learned by our objective can match or outperform several strong\nbaselines on benchmark vision datasets. In all, this work provides the first\nprovable analysis for contrastive learning where guarantees for linear probe\nevaluation can apply to realistic empirical settings.",

          "description": "Machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL) techniques have been\nincreasingly used in anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS).\nHowever, ML/DL has shown to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks,\nespecially in such security-sensitive systems. Many adversarial attacks have\nbeen proposed to evaluate the robustness of ML-based NIDSs. Unfortunately,\nexisting attacks mostly focused on feature-space and/or white-box attacks,\nwhich make impractical assumptions in real-world scenarios, leaving the study\non practical gray/black-box attacks largely unexplored.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of the\ngray/black-box traffic-space adversarial attacks to evaluate the robustness of\nML-based NIDSs. Our work outperforms previous ones in the following aspects:\n(i) practical-the proposed attack can automatically mutate original traffic\nwith extremely limited knowledge and affordable overhead while preserving its\nfunctionality; (ii) generic-the proposed attack is effective for evaluating the\nrobustness of various NIDSs using diverse ML/DL models and non-payload-based\nfeatures; (iii) explainable-we propose an explanation method for the fragile\nrobustness of ML-based NIDSs. Based on this, we also propose a defense scheme\nagainst adversarial attacks to improve system robustness. We extensively\nevaluate the robustness of various NIDSs using diverse feature sets and ML/DL\nmodels. Experimental results show our attack is effective (e.g., >97% evasion\nrate in half cases for Kitsune, a state-of-the-art NIDS) with affordable\nexecution cost and the proposed defense method can effectively mitigate such\nattacks (evasion rate is reduced by >50% in most cases).",

          "description": "In recent years, various notions of capacity and complexity have been\nproposed for characterizing the generalization properties of stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) in deep learning. Some of the popular notions that\ncorrelate well with the performance on unseen data are (i) the `flatness' of\nthe local minimum found by SGD, which is related to the eigenvalues of the\nHessian, (ii) the ratio of the stepsize $\\eta$ to the batch-size $b$, which\nessentially controls the magnitude of the stochastic gradient noise, and (iii)\nthe `tail-index', which measures the heaviness of the tails of the network\nweights at convergence. In this paper, we argue that these three seemingly\nunrelated perspectives for generalization are deeply linked to each other. We\nclaim that depending on the structure of the Hessian of the loss at the\nminimum, and the choices of the algorithm parameters $\\eta$ and $b$, the SGD\niterates will converge to a \\emph{heavy-tailed} stationary distribution. We\nrigorously prove this claim in the setting of quadratic optimization: we show\nthat even in a simple linear regression problem with independent and\nidentically distributed data whose distribution has finite moments of all\norder, the iterates can be heavy-tailed with infinite variance. We further\ncharacterize the behavior of the tails with respect to algorithm parameters,\nthe dimension, and the curvature. We then translate our results into insights\nabout the behavior of SGD in deep learning. We support our theory with\nexperiments conducted on synthetic data, fully connected, and convolutional\nneural networks.",

          "description": "Label smoothing (LS) is an arising learning paradigm that uses the positively\nweighted average of both the hard training labels and uniformly distributed\nsoft labels. It was shown that LS serves as a regularizer for training data\nwith hard labels and therefore improves the generalization of the model. Later\nit was reported LS even helps with improving robustness when learning with\nnoisy labels. However, we observe that the advantage of LS vanishes when we\noperate in a high label noise regime. Puzzled by the observation, we proceeded\nto discover that several proposed learning-with-noisy-labels solutions in the\nliterature instead relate more closely to negative label smoothing (NLS), which\ndefines as using a negative weight to combine the hard and soft labels! We show\nthat NLS functions substantially differently from LS in their achieved model\nconfidence. To differentiate the two cases, we will call LS the positive label\nsmoothing (PLS), and this paper unifies PLS and NLS into generalized label\nsmoothing (GLS). We provide understandings for the properties of GLS when\nlearning with noisy labels. Among other established properties, we\ntheoretically show NLS is considered more beneficial when the label noise rates\nare high. We provide experimental results to support our findings too.",

For\nexample, a person who has learned to solve small mazes can easily extend the\nvery same search techniques to solve much larger mazes by spending more time.\nIn computers, this behavior is often achieved through the use of algorithms,\nwhich scale to arbitrarily hard problem instances at the cost of more\ncomputation. In contrast, the sequential computing budget of feed-forward\nneural networks is limited by their depth, and networks trained on simple\nproblems have no way of extending their reasoning to accommodate harder\nproblems. In this work, we show that recurrent networks trained to solve simple\nproblems with few recurrent steps can indeed solve much more complex problems\nsimply by performing additional recurrences during inference. We demonstrate\nthis algorithmic behavior of recurrent networks on prefix sum computation,\nmazes, and chess. In all three domains, networks trained on simple problem\ninstances are able to extend their reasoning abilities at test time simply by\n\"thinking for longer.\"",

          "description": "Current technology for autonomous cars primarily focuses on getting the\npassenger from point A to B. Nevertheless, it has been shown that passengers\nare afraid of taking a ride in self-driving cars. One way to alleviate this\nproblem is by allowing the passenger to give natural language commands to the\ncar. However, the car can misunderstand the issued command or the visual\nsurroundings which could lead to uncertain situations. It is desirable that the\nself-driving car detects these situations and interacts with the passenger to\nsolve them. This paper proposes a model that detects uncertain situations when\na command is given and finds the visual objects causing it. Optionally, a\nquestion generated by the system describing the uncertain objects is included.\nWe argue that if the car could explain the objects in a human-like way,\npassengers could gain more confidence in the car's abilities. Thus, we\ninvestigate how to (1) detect uncertain situations and their underlying causes,\nand (2) how to generate clarifying questions for the passenger. When evaluating\non the Talk2Car dataset, we show that the proposed model, \\acrfull{pipeline},\nimproves \\gls{m:ambiguous-absolute-increase} in terms of $IoU_{.5}$ compared to\nnot using \\gls{pipeline}. Furthermore, we designed a referring expression\ngenerator (REG) \\acrfull{reg_model} tailored to a self-driving car setting\nwhich yields a relative improvement of \\gls{m:meteor-relative} METEOR and\n\\gls{m:rouge-relative} ROUGE-l compared with state-of-the-art REG models, and\nis three times faster.",

Our analysis provides evidence for this supposition by\nrelating the network's distribution of Lipschitz constants (i.e., the norm of\nthe gradient at different regions of the input space) during different training\nintervals with the behavior of the stochastic training procedure. We first\nobserve that the average Lipschitz constant close to the training data affects\nvarious aspects of the parameter trajectory, with more complex networks having\na longer trajectory, bigger variance, and often veering further from their\ninitialization. We then show that NNs whose biases are trained more steadily\nhave bounded complexity even in regions of the input space that are far from\nany training point. Finally, we find that steady training with Dropout implies\na training- and data-dependent generalization bound that grows\npoly-logarithmically with the number of parameters.

In this context, one of the main challenges would be to accurately\nclassify numerous scanned documents uploaded every day by customers as usual\nbusiness processes. For example, processes in banking (e.g., applying for\nloans) or the Government Registry of BDM (Births, Deaths, and Marriages)\napplications may involve uploading several documents such as a driver's license\nand passport. There are not many studies available to address the challenge as\nan application of image classification. Although some studies are available\nwhich used various methods, a more accurate model is still required. The\ncurrent study has proposed a robust fusion model to define the type of identity\ndocuments accurately. The proposed approach is based on two different methods\nin which images are classified based on their visual features and text\nfeatures. A novel model based on statistics and regression has been proposed to\ncalculate the confidence level for the feature-based classifier. A fuzzy-mean\nfusion model has been proposed to combine the classifier results based on their\nconfidence score. The proposed approach has been implemented using Python and\nexperimentally validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

          "description": "Time series forecasting is a relevant task that is performed in several\nreal-world scenarios such as product sales analysis and prediction of energy\ndemand. Given their accuracy performance, currently, Recurrent Neural Networks\n(RNNs) are the models of choice for this task. Despite their success in time\nseries forecasting, less attention has been paid to make the RNNs trustworthy.\nFor example, RNNs can not naturally provide an uncertainty measure to their\npredictions. This could be extremely useful in practice in several cases e.g.\nto detect when a prediction might be completely wrong due to an unusual pattern\nin the time series. Whittle Sum-Product Networks (WSPNs), prominent deep\ntractable probabilistic circuits (PCs) for time series, can assist an RNN with\nproviding meaningful probabilities as uncertainty measure. With this aim, we\npropose RECOWN, a novel architecture that employs RNNs and a discriminant\nvariant of WSPNs called Conditional WSPNs (CWSPNs). We also formulate a\nLog-Likelihood Ratio Score as better estimation of uncertainty that is tailored\nto time series and Whittle likelihoods. In our experiments, we show that\nRECOWNs are accurate and trustworthy time series predictors, able to \"know when\nthey do not know\".",

          "description": "Static recommendation methods like collaborative filtering suffer from the\ninherent limitation of performing real-time personalization for cold-start\nusers. Online recommendation, e.g., multi-armed bandit approach, addresses this\nlimitation by interactively exploring user preference online and pursuing the\nexploration-exploitation (EE) trade-off. However, existing bandit-based methods\nmodel recommendation actions homogeneously. Specifically, they only consider\nthe items as the arms, being incapable of handling the item attributes, which\nnaturally provide interpretable information of user's current demands and can\neffectively filter out undesired items. In this work, we consider the\nconversational recommendation for cold-start users, where a system can both ask\nthe attributes from and recommend items to a user interactively. This important\nscenario was studied in a recent work. However, it employs a hand-crafted\nfunction to decide when to ask attributes or make recommendations. Such\nseparate modeling of attributes and items makes the effectiveness of the system\nhighly rely on the choice of the hand-crafted function, thus introducing\nfragility to the system. To address this limitation, we seamlessly unify\nattributes and items in the same arm space and achieve their EE trade-offs\nautomatically using the framework of Thompson Sampling. Our Conversational\nThompson Sampling (ConTS) model holistically solves all questions in\nconversational recommendation by choosing the arm with the maximal reward to\nplay. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that ConTS\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods Conversational UCB (ConUCB) and\nEstimation-Action-Reflection model in both metrics of success rate and average\nnumber of conversation turns.",

          "description": "In this paper we present LiM (\"Less is More\"), a malware classification\nframework that leverages Federated Learning to detect and classify malicious\napps in a privacy-respecting manner. Information about newly installed apps is\nkept locally on users' devices, so that the provider cannot infer which apps\nwere installed by users. At the same time, input from all users is taken into\naccount in the federated learning process and they all benefit from better\nclassification performance. A key challenge of this setting is that users do\nnot have access to the ground truth (i.e. they cannot correctly identify\nwhether an app is malicious). To tackle this, LiM uses a safe semi-supervised\nensemble that maximizes classification accuracy with respect to a baseline\nclassifier trained by the service provider (i.e. the cloud). We implement LiM\nand show that the cloud server has F1 score of 95%, while clients have perfect\nrecall with only 1 false positive in >100 apps, using a dataset of 25K clean\napps and 25K malicious apps, 200 users and 50 rounds of federation.\nFurthermore, we conduct a security analysis and demonstrate that LiM is robust\nagainst both poisoning attacks by adversaries who control half of the clients,\nand inference attacks performed by an honest-but-curious cloud server.

Neurons tuned to features of attended objects\ntend to be more active than those associated with non-attended objects. There\nis a rich set of models of this phenomenon in computational neuroscience.\nHowever, there is currently a divide between models that successfully match\nphysiological data but can only deal with extremely simple problems and models\nof attention used in computer vision. For example, attention in the brain is\nknown to depend on top-down processing, whereas self-attention in deep learning\ndoes not. Here, we propose an artificial neural network model of object-based\nattention that captures the way in which attention is both top-down and\nrecurrent. Our attention model works well both on simple test stimuli, such as\nthose using images of handwritten digits, and on more complex stimuli, such as\nnatural images drawn from the COCO dataset. We find that our model replicates a\nrange of findings from neuroscience, including attention-invariant tuning,\ninhibition of return, and attention-mediated scaling of activity. Understanding\nobject based attention is both computationally interesting and a key problem\nfor computational neuroscience.",

          "description": "Recent works on ride-sharing order dispatching have highlighted the\nimportance of taking into account both the spatial and temporal dynamics in the\ndispatching process for improving the transportation system efficiency. At the\nsame time, deep reinforcement learning has advanced to the point where it\nachieves superhuman performance in a number of fields. In this work, we propose\na deep reinforcement learning based solution for order dispatching and we\nconduct large scale online A/B tests on DiDi's ride-dispatching platform to\nshow that the proposed method achieves significant improvement on both total\ndriver income and user experience related metrics. In particular, we model the\nride dispatching problem as a Semi Markov Decision Process to account for the\ntemporal aspect of the dispatching actions. To improve the stability of the\nvalue iteration with nonlinear function approximators like neural networks, we\npropose Cerebellar Value Networks (CVNet) with a novel distributed state\nrepresentation layer. We further derive a regularized policy evaluation scheme\nfor CVNet that penalizes large Lipschitz constant of the value network for\nadditional robustness against adversarial perturbation and noises. Finally, we\nadapt various transfer learning methods to CVNet for increased learning\nadaptability and efficiency across multiple cities. We conduct extensive\noffline simulations based on real dispatching data as well as online AB tests\nthrough the DiDi's platform. Results show that CVNet consistently outperforms\nother recently proposed dispatching methods. We finally show that the\nperformance can be further improved through the efficient use of transfer\nlearning.",

We introduce a novel set of conditions and prove\nthat they are sufficient for learning a Markov abstract state representation.\nWe then describe a practical training procedure that combines inverse model\nestimation and temporal contrastive learning to learn an abstraction that\napproximately satisfies these conditions. Our novel training objective is\ncompatible with both online and offline training: it does not require a reward\nsignal, but agents can capitalize on reward information when available. We\nempirically evaluate our approach on a visual gridworld domain and a set of\ncontinuous control benchmarks.

          "description": "The randomized or cross-validated split of training and testing sets has been\nadopted as the gold standard of machine learning for decades. The establishment\nof these split protocols are based on two assumptions: (i)-fixing the dataset\nto be eternally static so we could evaluate different machine learning\nalgorithms or models; (ii)-there is a complete set of annotated data available\nto researchers or industrial practitioners. However, in this article, we intend\nto take a closer and critical look at the split protocol itself and point out\nits weakness and limitation, especially for industrial applications. In many\nreal-world problems, we must acknowledge that there are numerous situations\nwhere assumption (ii) does not hold. For instance, for interdisciplinary\napplications like drug discovery, it often requires real lab experiments to\nannotate data which poses huge costs in both time and financial considerations.\nIn other words, it can be very difficult or even impossible to satisfy\nassumption (ii).

We further\npropose a new adaptive active learning architecture (AAL) which involves an\nadaptation policy, in comparison with the traditional active learning that only\nunidirectionally adds data points to the training pool.

Recently,\nadversarial domain adaptation with two distinct classifiers (bi-classifier) has\nbeen introduced into UDA which is effective to align distributions between\ndifferent domains. Previous bi-classifier adversarial learning methods only\nfocus on the similarity between the outputs of two distinct classifiers.\nHowever, the similarity of the outputs cannot guarantee the accuracy of target\nsamples, i.e., target samples may match to wrong categories even if the\ndiscrepancy between two classifiers is small. To challenge this issue, in this\npaper, we propose a cross-domain gradient discrepancy minimization (CGDM)\nmethod which explicitly minimizes the discrepancy of gradients generated by\nsource samples and target samples. Specifically, the gradient gives a cue for\nthe semantic information of target samples so it can be used as a good\nsupervision to improve the accuracy of target samples. In order to compute the\ngradient signal of target samples, we further obtain target pseudo labels\nthrough a clustering-based self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on\nthree widely used UDA datasets show that our method surpasses many previous\nstate-of-the-arts. Codes are available at https://github.com/lijin118/CGDM.",

          "description": "This paper is about the problem of learning a stochastic policy for\ngenerating an object (like a molecular graph) from a sequence of actions, such\nthat the probability of generating an object is proportional to a given\npositive reward for that object. Whereas standard return maximization tends to\nconverge to a single return-maximizing sequence, there are cases where we would\nlike to sample a diverse set of high-return solutions. These arise, for\nexample, in black-box function optimization when few rounds are possible, each\nwith large batches of queries, where the batches should be diverse, e.g., in\nthe design of new molecules. One can also see this as a problem of\napproximately converting an energy function to a generative distribution. While\nMCMC methods can achieve that, they are expensive and generally only perform\nlocal exploration. Instead, training a generative policy amortizes the cost of\nsearch during training and yields to fast generation. Using insights from\nTemporal Difference learning, we propose GFlowNet, based on a view of the\ngenerative process as a flow network, making it possible to handle the tricky\ncase where different trajectories can yield the same final state, e.g., there\nare many ways to sequentially add atoms to generate some molecular graph. We\ncast the set of trajectories as a flow and convert the flow consistency\nequations into a learning objective, akin to the casting of the Bellman\nequations into Temporal Difference methods. We prove that any global minimum of\nthe proposed objectives yields a policy which samples from the desired\ndistribution, and demonstrate the improved performance and diversity of\nGFlowNet on a simple domain where there are many modes to the reward function,\nand on a molecule synthesis task.",

In\nreference to biomedical image analysis, the advances in image acquisition\nmodalities and high-throughput imaging experiments are creating new challenges.\nThis huge information ensemble could overwhelm the analytic capabilities needed\nby physicians in their daily decision-making tasks as well as by biologists\ninvestigating complex biochemical systems. In particular, quantitative imaging\nmethods convey scientifically and clinically relevant information in\nprediction, prognosis or treatment response assessment, by also considering\nradiomics approaches.

In\nthis regard, frameworks based on advanced Machine Learning and Computational\nIntelligence can significantly improve traditional Image Processing and Pattern\nRecognition approaches. However, conventional Artificial Intelligence\ntechniques must be tailored to address the unique challenges concerning\nbiomedical imaging data. This thesis aims at proposing novel and advanced\ncomputer-assisted methods for biomedical image analysis, also as an instrument\nin the development of Clinical Decision Support Systems, by always keeping in\nmind the clinical feasibility of the developed solutions. In conclusion, the\nultimate goal of these research studies is to gain clinically and biologically\nuseful insights that can guide differential diagnosis and therapies, leading\ntowards biomedical data integration for personalized medicine.

          "description": "Learning dynamics governed by differential equations is crucial for\npredicting and controlling the systems in science and engineering. Neural\nOrdinary Differential Equation (NODE), a deep learning model integrated with\ndifferential equations, learns the dynamics directly from the samples on the\ntrajectory and shows great promise in the scientific field. However, the\ntraining of NODE highly depends on the numerical solver, which can amplify\nnumerical noise and be unstable, especially for ill-conditioned dynamical\nsystems. In this paper, to reduce the reliance on the numerical solver, we\npropose to enhance the supervised signal in learning dynamics. Specifically,\nbeyond learning directly from the trajectory samples, we pre-train a neural\ndifferential operator (NDO) to output an estimation of the derivatives to serve\nas an additional supervised signal. The NDO is pre-trained on a class of\nsymbolic functions, and it learns the mapping between the trajectory samples of\nthese functions to their derivatives. We provide theoretical guarantee on that\nthe output of NDO can well approximate the ground truth derivatives by proper\ntuning the complexity of the library. To leverage both the trajectory signal\nand the estimated derivatives from NDO, we propose an algorithm called\nNDO-NODE, in which the loss function contains two terms: the fitness on the\ntrue trajectory samples and the fitness on the estimated derivatives that are\noutput by the pre-trained NDO. Experiments on various of dynamics show that our\nproposed NDO-NODE can consistently improve the forecasting accuracy.",

          "description": "Bayesian optimization (BO) conventionally relies on handcrafted acquisition\nfunctions (AFs) to sequentially determine the sample points. However, it has\nbeen widely observed in practice that the best-performing AF in terms of regret\ncan vary significantly under different types of black-box functions. It has\nremained a challenge to design one AF that can attain the best performance over\na wide variety of black-box functions. This paper aims to attack this challenge\nthrough the perspective of reinforced few-shot AF learning (FSAF).\nSpecifically, we first connect the notion of AFs with Q-functions and view a\ndeep Q-network (DQN) as a surrogate differentiable AF. While it serves as a\nnatural idea to combine DQN and an existing few-shot learning method, we\nidentify that such a direct combination does not perform well due to severe\noverfitting, which is particularly critical in BO due to the need of a\nversatile sampling policy. To address this, we present a Bayesian variant of\nDQN with the following three features: (i) It learns a distribution of\nQ-networks as AFs based on the Kullback-Leibler regularization framework. This\ninherently provides the uncertainty required in sampling for BO and mitigates\noverfitting. (ii) For the prior of the Bayesian DQN, we propose to use a demo\npolicy induced by an off-the-shelf AF for better training stability. (iii) On\nthe meta-level, we leverage the meta-loss of Bayesian model-agnostic\nmeta-learning, which serves as a natural companion to the proposed FSAF.\nMoreover, with the proper design of the Q-networks, FSAF is general-purpose in\nthat it is agnostic to the dimension and the cardinality of the input domain.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the FSAF achieves comparable\nor better regrets than the state-of-the-art benchmarks on a wide variety of\nsynthetic and real-world test functions.",

A fundamental limitation of virtually all such\nmethods are computations involving the kernel matrix that naively scale\nquadratically (e.g., constructing the kernel matrix and matrix-vector\nmultiplication) or cubically (solving linear systems) with the size of the data\nset $N.$ We propose the Fast Kernel Transform (FKT), a general algorithm to\ncompute matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) for datasets in moderate\ndimensions with quasilinear complexity. Typically, analytically grounded fast\nmultiplication methods require specialized development for specific kernels. In\ncontrast, our scheme is based on auto-differentiation and automated symbolic\ncomputations that leverage the analytical structure of the underlying kernel.\nThis allows the FKT to be easily applied to a broad class of kernels, including\nGaussian, Matern, and Rational Quadratic covariance functions and physically\nmotivated Green's functions, including those of the Laplace and Helmholtz\nequations. Furthermore, the FKT maintains a high, quantifiable, and\ncontrollable level of accuracy -- properties that many acceleration methods\nlack. We illustrate the efficacy and versatility of the FKT by providing timing\nand accuracy benchmarks and by applying it to scale the stochastic neighborhood\nembedding (t-SNE) and Gaussian processes to large real-world data sets.",

          "description": "This paper addresses the problem of Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) in\nwhich the marginal conditions are relaxed (using weighted penalties in lieu of\nequality) and no additional regularization is enforced on the OT plan. In this\ncontext, we show that the corresponding optimization problem can be\nreformulated as a non-negative penalized linear regression problem. This\nreformulation allows us to propose novel algorithms inspired from inverse\nproblems and nonnegative matrix factorization. In particular, we consider\nmajorization-minimization which leads in our setting to efficient\nmultiplicative updates for a variety of penalties. Furthermore, we derive for\nthe first time an efficient algorithm to compute the regularization path of UOT\nwith quadratic penalties. The proposed algorithm provides a continuity of\npiece-wise linear OT plans converging to the solution of balanced OT\n(corresponding to infinite penalty weights). We perform several numerical\nexperiments on simulated and real data illustrating the new algorithms, and\nprovide a detailed discussion about more sophisticated optimization tools that\ncan further be used to solve OT problems thanks to our reformulation.",

          "description": "Learning good feature representations is important for deep reinforcement\nlearning (RL). However, with limited experience, RL often suffers from data\ninefficiency for training. For un-experienced or less-experienced trajectories\n(i.e., state-action sequences), the lack of data limits the use of them for\nbetter feature learning. In this work, we propose a novel method, dubbed\nPlayVirtual, which augments cycle-consistent virtual trajectories to enhance\nthe data efficiency for RL feature representation learning. Specifically,\nPlayVirtual predicts future states based on the current state and action by a\ndynamics model and then predicts the previous states by a backward dynamics\nmodel, which forms a trajectory cycle. Based on this, we augment the actions to\ngenerate a large amount of virtual state-action trajectories. Being free of\ngroudtruth state supervision, we enforce a trajectory to meet the cycle\nconsistency constraint, which can significantly enhance the data efficiency. We\nvalidate the effectiveness of our designs on the Atari and DeepMind Control\nSuite benchmarks. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods\nby a large margin on both benchmarks.",

          "description": "Data deletion algorithms aim to remove the influence of deleted data points\nfrom trained models at a cheaper computational cost than fully retraining those\nmodels. However, for sequences of deletions, most prior work in the non-convex\nsetting gives valid guarantees only for sequences that are chosen independently\nof the models that are published. If people choose to delete their data as a\nfunction of the published models (because they don't like what the models\nreveal about them, for example), then the update sequence is adaptive. In this\npaper, we give a general reduction from deletion guarantees against adaptive\nsequences to deletion guarantees against non-adaptive sequences, using\ndifferential privacy and its connection to max information. Combined with ideas\nfrom prior work which give guarantees for non-adaptive deletion sequences, this\nleads to extremely flexible algorithms able to handle arbitrary model classes\nand training methodologies, giving strong provable deletion guarantees for\nadaptive deletion sequences. We show in theory how prior work for non-convex\nmodels fails against adaptive deletion sequences, and use this intuition to\ndesign a practical attack against the SISA algorithm of Bourtoule et al.

We propose a novel method for PCL, the deep feature proxy variable\nmethod (DFPV), to address the case where the proxies, treatments, and outcomes\nare high-dimensional and have nonlinear complex relationships, as represented\nby deep neural network features. We show that DFPV outperforms recent\nstate-of-the-art PCL methods on challenging synthetic benchmarks, including\nsettings involving high dimensional image data.

Thus the KL divergence between two Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)\nsharing the same Gaussian components is equivalent to a Bregman divergence.\nThis KL-BD equivalence on a mixture family manifold implies that we can perform\noptimal KL-averaging aggregation of $w$-mixtures without information loss.

          "description": "Machine learning approaches achieve high accuracy for text recognition and\nare therefore increasingly used for the transcription of handwritten historical\nsources. However, using machine learning in production requires a streamlined\nend-to-end machine learning pipeline that scales to the dataset size, and a\nmodel that achieves high accuracy with few manual transcriptions. In addition,\nthe correctness of the model results must be verified. This paper describes our\nlessons learned developing, tuning, and using the Occode end-to-end machine\nlearning pipeline for transcribing 7,3 million rows with handwritten occupation\ncodes in the Norwegian 1950 population census. We achieve an accuracy of 97%\nfor the automatically transcribed codes, and we send 3% of the codes for manual\nverification. We verify that the occupation code distribution found in our\nresult matches the distribution found in our training data which should be\nrepresentative for the census as a whole.

Our\nestimator is theoretically motivated by the connection between generalisation\nand training speed, and is also inspired by the reformulation of a PAC-Bayes\nbound under the Bayesian setting. Our model-free estimator is simple,\nefficient, and cheap to implement, and does not require hyperparameter-tuning\nor surrogate training before deployment. We demonstrate on various NAS search\nspaces that our estimator consistently outperforms other alternatives in\nachieving better correlation with the true test performance rankings.

While matrix factorization approaches fail\nto model nonlinear relations, neural networks can potentially capture such\ncomplex relations with unprecedented predictive power and are highly scalable.\nHowever, neither of them is able to model predictive uncertainties. In\ncontrast, Gaussian Process based models can generate a predictive distribution,\nbut cannot scale to large amounts of data.

We introduce an efficient strategy for model\ntraining and inference, resulting in a model that scales to very large and\nsparse datasets and achieves competitive performance in terms of classical\nmetrics quantifying the reconstruction error.

          "description": "Broadening access to both computational and educational resources is critical\nto diffusing machine-learning (ML) innovation. However, today, most ML\nresources and experts are siloed in a few countries and organizations. In this\npaper, we describe our pedagogical approach to increasing access to applied ML\nthrough a massive open online course (MOOC) on Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML).\nWe suggest that TinyML, ML on resource-constrained embedded devices, is an\nattractive means to widen access because TinyML both leverages low-cost and\nglobally accessible hardware, and encourages the development of complete,\nself-contained applications, from data collection to deployment. To this end, a\ncollaboration between academia (Harvard University) and industry (Google)\nproduced a four-part MOOC that provides application-oriented instruction on how\nto develop solutions using TinyML. The series is openly available on the edX\nMOOC platform, has no prerequisites beyond basic programming, and is designed\nfor learners from a global variety of backgrounds. It introduces pupils to\nreal-world applications, ML algorithms, data-set engineering, and the ethical\nconsiderations of these technologies via hands-on programming and deployment of\nTinyML applications in both the cloud and their own microcontrollers. To\nfacilitate continued learning, community building, and collaboration beyond the\ncourses, we launched a standalone website, a forum, a chat, and an optional\ncourse-project competition.

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) in the infinite width/channel limit have received\nmuch attention recently, as they provide a clear analytical window to deep\nlearning via mappings to Gaussian Processes (GPs). Despite its theoretical\nappeal, this viewpoint lacks a crucial ingredient of deep learning in finite\nDNNs, laying at the heart of their success -- feature learning. Here we\nconsider DNNs trained with noisy gradient descent on a large training set and\nderive a self consistent Gaussian Process theory accounting for strong\nfinite-DNN and feature learning effects. Applying this to a toy model of a\ntwo-layer linear convolutional neural network (CNN) shows good agreement with\nexperiments. We further identify, both analytical and numerically, a sharp\ntransition between a feature learning regime and a lazy learning regime in this\nmodel. Strong finite-DNN effects are also derived for a non-linear two-layer\nfully connected network. Our self consistent theory provides a rich and\nversatile analytical framework for studying feature learning and other non-lazy\neffects in finite DNNs.",

          "description": "We tackle sequential learning under label noise in applications where a human\nsupervisor can be queried to relabel suspicious examples. Existing approaches\nare flawed, in that they only relabel incoming examples that look\n``suspicious'' to the model. As a consequence, those mislabeled examples that\nelude (or don't undergo) this cleaning step end up tainting the training data\nand the model with no further chance of being cleaned. We propose Cincer, a\nnovel approach that cleans both new and past data by identifying pairs of\nmutually incompatible examples. Whenever it detects a suspicious example,\nCincer identifies a counter-example in the training set that -- according to\nthe model -- is maximally incompatible with the suspicious example, and asks\nthe annotator to relabel either or both examples, resolving this possible\ninconsistency. The counter-examples are chosen to be maximally incompatible, so\nto serve as explanations of the model' suspicion, and highly influential, so to\nconvey as much information as possible if relabeled. Cincer achieves this by\nleveraging an efficient and robust approximation of influence functions based\non the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Our extensive empirical evaluation\nshows that clarifying the reasons behind the model's suspicions by cleaning the\ncounter-examples helps acquiring substantially better data and models,\nespecially when paired with our FIM approximation.",

          "description": "When faced with learning challenging new tasks, humans often follow sequences\nof steps that allow them to incrementally build up the necessary skills for\nperforming these new tasks. However, in machine learning, models are most often\ntrained to solve the target tasks directly.Inspired by human learning, we\npropose a novel curriculum learning approach which decomposes challenging tasks\ninto sequences of easier intermediate goals that are used to pre-train a model\nbefore tackling the target task. We focus on classification tasks, and design\nthe intermediate tasks using an automatically constructed label hierarchy. We\ntrain the model at each level of the hierarchy, from coarse labels to fine\nlabels, transferring acquired knowledge across these levels. For instance, the\nmodel will first learn to distinguish animals from objects, and then use this\nacquired knowledge when learning to classify among more fine-grained classes\nsuch as cat, dog, car, and truck. Most existing curriculum learning algorithms\nfor supervised learning consist of scheduling the order in which the training\nexamples are presented to the model. In contrast, our approach focuses on the\noutput space of the model. We evaluate our method on several established\ndatasets and show significant performance gains especially on classification\nproblems with many labels. We also evaluate on a new synthetic dataset which\nallows us to study multiple aspects of our method.",

          "description": "Explainable machine learning (ML) has gained traction in recent years due to\nthe increasing adoption of ML-based systems in many sectors. Counterfactual\nexplanations (CFEs) provide ``what if'' feedback of the form ``if an input\ndatapoint were $x'$ instead of $x$, then an ML-based system's output would be\n$y'$ instead of $y$.'' CFEs are attractive due to their actionable feedback,\namenability to existing legal frameworks, and fidelity to the underlying ML\nmodel. Yet, current CFE approaches are single shot -- that is, they assume $x$\ncan change to $x'$ in a single time period. We propose a novel\nstochastic-control-based approach that generates sequential CFEs, that is, CFEs\nthat allow $x$ to move stochastically and sequentially across intermediate\nstates to a final state $x'$. Our approach is model agnostic and black box.\nFurthermore, calculation of CFEs is amortized such that once trained, it\napplies to multiple datapoints without the need for re-optimization. In\naddition to these primary characteristics, our approach admits optional\ndesiderata such as adherence to the data manifold, respect for causal\nrelations, and sparsity -- identified by past research as desirable properties\nof CFEs.

However, for fully connected networks,\nit has been previously shown that for any fixed network width, $n$, the\nGaussian approximation gets worse as the network depth, $d$, increases. Given\nthat modern networks are deep, this raises the question of how well modern\narchitectures, like ResNets, are captured by the infinite-width limit. To\nprovide a better approximation, we study ReLU ResNets in the\ninfinite-depth-and-width limit, where both depth and width tend to infinity as\ntheir ratio, $d/n$, remains constant. In contrast to the Gaussian\ninfinite-width limit, we show theoretically that the network exhibits\nlog-Gaussian behaviour at initialization in the infinite-depth-and-width limit,\nwith parameters depending on the ratio $d/n$. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we\ndemonstrate that even basic properties of standard ResNet architectures are\npoorly captured by the Gaussian limit, but remarkably well captured by our\nlog-Gaussian limit. Moreover, our analysis reveals that ReLU ResNets at\ninitialization are hypoactivated: fewer than half of the ReLUs are activated.\nAdditionally, we calculate the interlayer correlations, which have the effect\nof exponentially increasing the variance of the network output.

          "description": "Machine learning algorithms often make decisions on behalf of agents with\nvaried and sometimes conflicting interests. In domains where agents can choose\nto take their own action or delegate their action to a central mediator, an\nopen question is how mediators should take actions on behalf of delegating\nagents. The main existing approach uses delegating agents to punish\nnon-delegating agents in an attempt to get all agents to delegate, which tends\nto be costly for all. We introduce a Pareto Mediator which aims to improve\noutcomes for delegating agents without making any of them worse off. Our\nexperiments in random normal form games, a restaurant recommendation game, and\na reinforcement learning sequential social dilemma show that the Pareto\nMediator greatly increases social welfare. Also, even when the Pareto Mediator\nis based on an incorrect model of agent utility, performance gracefully\ndegrades to the pre-intervention level, due to the individual autonomy\npreserved by the voluntary mediator.",

          "description": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with stochastic momentum is popular in\nnonconvex stochastic optimization and particularly for the training of deep\nneural networks. In standard SGD, parameters are updated by improving along the\npath of the gradient at the current iterate on a batch of examples, where the\naddition of a ``momentum'' term biases the update in the direction of the\nprevious change in parameters. In non-stochastic convex optimization one can\nshow that a momentum adjustment provably reduces convergence time in many\nsettings, yet such results have been elusive in the stochastic and non-convex\nsettings. At the same time, a widely-observed empirical phenomenon is that in\ntraining deep networks stochastic momentum appears to significantly improve\nconvergence time, variants of it have flourished in the development of other\npopular update methods, e.g. ADAM [KB15], AMSGrad [RKK18], etc. Yet theoretical\njustification for the use of stochastic momentum has remained a significant\nopen question. In this paper we propose an answer: stochastic momentum improves\ndeep network training because it modifies SGD to escape saddle points faster\nand, consequently, to more quickly find a second order stationary point. Our\ntheoretical results also shed light on the related question of how to choose\nthe ideal momentum parameter--our analysis suggests that $\\beta \\in [0,1)$\nshould be large (close to 1), which comports with empirical findings. We also\nprovide experimental findings that further validate these conclusions.",

          "description": "Computer-aided design (CAD) is the most widely used modeling approach for\ntechnical design. The typical starting point in these designs is 2D sketches\nwhich can later be extruded and combined to obtain complex three-dimensional\nassemblies. Such sketches are typically composed of parametric primitives, such\nas points, lines, and circular arcs, augmented with geometric constraints\nlinking the primitives, such as coincidence, parallelism, or orthogonality.\nSketches can be represented as graphs, with the primitives as nodes and the\nconstraints as edges. Training a model to automatically generate CAD sketches\ncan enable several novel workflows, but is challenging due to the complexity of\nthe graphs and the heterogeneity of the primitives and constraints. In\nparticular, each type of primitive and constraint may require a record of\ndifferent size and parameter types. We propose SketchGen as a generative model\nbased on a transformer architecture to address the heterogeneity problem by\ncarefully designing a sequential language for the primitives and constraints\nthat allows distinguishing between different primitive or constraint types and\ntheir parameters, while encouraging our model to re-use information across\nrelated parameters, encoding shared structure. A particular highlight of our\nwork is the ability to produce primitives linked via constraints that enables\nthe final output to be further regularized via a constraint solver. We evaluate\nour model by demonstrating constraint prediction for given sets of primitives\nand full sketch generation from scratch, showing that our approach\nsignificantly out performs the state-of-the-art in CAD sketch generation.",

          "description": "Existing work on automated hate speech classification assumes that the\ndataset is fixed and the classes are pre-defined. However, the amount of data\nin social media increases every day, and the hot topics changes rapidly,\nrequiring the classifiers to be able to continuously adapt to new data without\nforgetting the previously learned knowledge. This ability, referred to as\nlifelong learning, is crucial for the real-word application of hate speech\nclassifiers in social media. In this work, we propose lifelong learning of hate\nspeech classification on social media. To alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we\npropose to use Variational Representation Learning (VRL) along with a memory\nmodule based on LB-SOINN (Load-Balancing Self-Organizing Incremental Neural\nNetwork). Experimentally, we show that combining variational representation\nlearning and the LB-SOINN memory module achieves better performance than the\ncommonly-used lifelong learning techniques.",

          "description": "Imbalanced classification on graphs is ubiquitous yet challenging in many\nreal-world applications, such as fraudulent node detection. Recently, graph\nneural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance on many network\nanalysis tasks. However, most existing GNNs have almost exclusively focused on\nthe balanced networks, and would get unappealing performance on the imbalanced\nnetworks. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we present a generative\nadversarial graph network model, called ImGAGN to address the imbalanced\nclassification problem on graphs. It introduces a novel generator for graph\nstructure data, named GraphGenerator, which can simulate both the minority\nclass nodes' attribute distribution and network topological structure\ndistribution by generating a set of synthetic minority nodes such that the\nnumber of nodes in different classes can be balanced. Then a graph\nconvolutional network (GCN) discriminator is trained to discriminate between\nreal nodes and fake (i.e., generated) nodes, and also between minority nodes\nand majority nodes on the synthetic balanced network. To validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on\nfour real-world imbalanced network datasets. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed method ImGAGN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for\nsemi-supervised imbalanced node classification task.",

In this study, we\npropose CGA2M+, which is based on the Generalized Additive 2 Model (GA2M) and\ndiffers from it in two major ways. The first is the introduction of\nmonotonicity. Imposing monotonicity on some functions based on an analyst's\nknowledge is expected to improve not only interpretability but also\ngeneralization performance. The second is the introduction of a higher-order\nterm: given that GA2M considers only second-order interactions, we aim to\nbalance interpretability and prediction accuracy by introducing a higher-order\nterm that can capture higher-order interactions. In this way, we can improve\nprediction performance without compromising interpretability by applying\nlearning innovation.

          "description": "Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is an emerging technique for information\nretrieval (IR) applications. While GCN assumes the homophily property of a\ngraph, real-world graphs are never perfect: the local structure of a node may\ncontain discrepancy, e.g., the labels of a node's neighbors could vary. This\npushes us to consider the discrepancy of local structure in GCN modeling.\nExisting work approaches this issue by introducing an additional module such as\ngraph attention, which is expected to learn the contribution of each neighbor.\nHowever, such module may not work reliably as expected, especially when there\nlacks supervision signal, e.g., when the labeled data is small. Moreover,\nexisting methods focus on modeling the nodes in the training data, and never\nconsider the local structure discrepancy of testing nodes.\n\nThis work focuses on the local structure discrepancy issue for testing nodes,\nwhich has received little scrutiny. From a novel perspective of causality, we\ninvestigate whether a GCN should trust the local structure of a testing node\nwhen predicting its label. To this end, we analyze the working mechanism of GCN\nwith causal graph, estimating the causal effect of a node's local structure for\nthe prediction. The idea is simple yet effective: given a trained GCN model, we\nfirst intervene the prediction by blocking the graph structure; we then compare\nthe original prediction with the intervened prediction to assess the causal\neffect of the local structure on the prediction. Through this way, we can\neliminate the impact of local structure discrepancy and make more accurate\nprediction. Extensive experiments on seven node classification datasets show\nthat our method effectively enhances the inference stage of GCN.",

          "description": "Kickstarting deep reinforcement learning algorithms facilitate a\nteacher-student relationship among the agents and allow for a well-performing\nteacher to share demonstrations with a student to expedite the student's\ntraining. However, despite the known benefits, the demonstrations may contain\nsensitive information about the teacher's training data and existing\nkickstarting methods do not take any measures to protect it. Therefore, we use\nthe framework of differential privacy to develop a mechanism that securely\nshares the teacher's demonstrations with the student. The mechanism allows for\nthe teacher to decide upon the accuracy of its demonstrations with respect to\nthe privacy budget that it consumes, thereby granting the teacher full control\nover its data privacy. We then develop a kickstarted deep reinforcement\nlearning algorithm for the student that is privacy-aware because we calibrate\nits objective with the parameters of the teacher's privacy mechanism. The\nprivacy-aware design of the algorithm makes it possible to kickstart the\nstudent's learning despite the perturbations induced by the privacy mechanism.\nFrom numerical experiments, we highlight three empirical results: (i) the\nalgorithm succeeds in expediting the student's learning, (ii) the student\nconverges to a performance level that was not possible without the\ndemonstrations, and (iii) the student maintains its enhanced performance even\nafter the teacher stops sharing useful demonstrations due to its privacy budget\nconstraints.",

          "description": "Meta-learning can extract an inductive bias from previous learning experience\nand assist the training processes of new tasks. It is often realized through\noptimizing a meta-model with the evaluation loss of a series of task-specific\nsolvers. Most existing algorithms sample non-overlapping $\\mathit{support}$\nsets and $\\mathit{query}$ sets to train and evaluate the solvers respectively\ndue to simplicity ($\\mathcal{S}/\\mathcal{Q}$ protocol). However, another\nevaluation method that assesses the discrepancy between the solver and a target\nmodel is short of research ($\\mathcal{S}/\\mathcal{T}$ protocol).\n$\\mathcal{S}/\\mathcal{T}$ protocol has unique advantages such as offering more\ninformative supervision, but it is computationally expensive. This paper looks\ninto this special evaluation method and takes a step towards putting it into\npractice. We find that with a small ratio of tasks armed with target models,\nclassic meta-learning algorithms can be improved a lot without consuming many\nresources. Furthermore, we empirically verify the effectiveness of\n$\\mathcal{S}/\\mathcal{T}$ protocol in a typical application of meta-learning,\n$\\mathit{i.e.}$, few-shot learning. In detail, after constructing target models\nby fine-tuning the pre-trained network on those hard tasks, we match the\ntask-specific solvers to target models via knowledge distillation.

          "description": "In reinforcement learning, experience replay stores past samples for further\nreuse. Prioritized sampling is a promising technique to better utilize these\nsamples. Previous criteria of prioritization include TD error, recentness and\ncorrective feedback, which are mostly heuristically designed. In this work, we\nstart from the regret minimization objective, and obtain an optimal\nprioritization strategy for Bellman update that can directly maximize the\nreturn of the policy. The theory suggests that data with higher hindsight TD\nerror, better on-policiness and more accurate Q value should be assigned with\nhigher weights during sampling. Thus most previous criteria only consider this\nstrategy partially. We not only provide theoretical justifications for previous\ncriteria, but also propose two new methods to compute the prioritization\nweight, namely ReMERN and ReMERT. ReMERN learns an error network, while ReMERT\nexploits the temporal ordering of states.

          "description": "We study the effects of information discrepancy across sub-populations on\ntheir ability to simultaneously improve their features in strategic learning\nsettings. Specifically, we consider a game where a principal deploys a decision\nrule in an attempt to optimize the whole population's welfare, and agents\nstrategically adapt to it to receive better scores. Inspired by real-life\nsettings, such as loan approvals and college admissions, we remove the typical\nassumption made in the strategic learning literature that the decision rule is\nfully known to the agents, and focus on settings where it is inaccessible. In\ntheir lack of knowledge, individuals try to infer this rule by learning from\ntheir peers (e.g., friends and acquaintances who previously applied for a\nloan), naturally forming groups in the population, each with possibly different\ntype and level of information about the decision rule. In our equilibrium\nanalysis, we show that the principal's decision rule optimizing the welfare\nacross subgroups may cause a surprising negative externality; the true quality\nof some of the subgroups can actually deteriorate. On the positive side, we\nshow that in many natural cases, optimal improvement is guaranteed\nsimultaneously for all subgroups in equilibrium.

In studying maps on the chain complex of a simplicial\ncomplex, we define three desirable properties of a simplicial neural network\narchitecture: namely, permutation equivariance, orientation equivariance, and\nsimplicial awareness. The first two properties respectively account for the\nfact that the node indexing and the simplex orientations in a simplicial\ncomplex are arbitrary. The last property encodes the desirable feature that the\noutput of the neural network depends on the entire simplicial complex and not\non a subset of its dimensions. Based on these properties, we propose a simple\nconvolutional architecture, rooted in tools from algebraic topology, for the\nproblem of trajectory prediction, and show that it obeys all three of these\nproperties when an odd, nonlinear activation function is used.

Recently, there\nhave been rising concerns on whether the learned scoring function can cause\nsystematic disparity across different protected groups defined by sensitive\nattributes. While there could be trade-off between fairness and performance, in\nthis paper we propose a model agnostic post-processing framework for balancing\nthem in the bipartite ranking scenario. Specifically, we maximize a weighted\nsum of the utility and fairness by directly adjusting the relative ordering of\nsamples across groups. By formulating this problem as the identification of an\noptimal warping path across different protected groups, we propose a\nnon-parametric method to search for such an optimal path through a dynamic\nprogramming process. Our method is compatible with various classification\nmodels and applicable to a variety of ranking fairness metrics. Comprehensive\nexperiments on a suite of benchmark data sets and two real-world patient\nelectronic health record repositories show that our method can achieve a great\nbalance between the algorithm utility and ranking fairness.

The objective is to predict and\noptimally store the files on the caches to maximize the total number of cache\nhits. We propose $\\texttt{LeadCache}$ - an online caching policy based on the\nFollow-the-Perturbed-Leader paradigm. We show that the policy is regret-optimal\nup to a factor of $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/8}),$ where $n$ is the number of users. We\nimplement the policy by designing a new linear-time Pipage rounding algorithm.\nWith an additional Strong-Law-type assumption, we show that the total number of\nfile fetches under $\\texttt{LeadCache}$ remains almost surely finite.\nAdditionally, we derive a tight regret lower bound using results from graph\ncoloring. Our conclusion is that the proposed learning-based caching policy\ndecisively outperforms the classical policies both theoretically and\nempirically.",

In this paper,\nwe exploit this property with a causal invariance perspective in the\nsingle-task setting, introducing a new type of state abstraction called\n\\textit{model-invariance}. Unlike previous forms of state abstractions, a\nmodel-invariance state abstraction leverages causal sparsity over state\nvariables. This allows for compositional generalization to unseen states,\nsomething that non-factored forms of state abstractions cannot do. We prove\nthat an optimal policy can be learned over this model-invariance state\nabstraction and show improved generalization in a simple toy domain. Next, we\npropose a practical method to approximately learn a model-invariant\nrepresentation for complex domains and validate our approach by showing\nimproved modelling performance over standard maximum likelihood approaches on\nchallenging tasks, such as the MuJoCo-based Humanoid. Finally, within the MBRL\nsetting we show strong performance gains with respect to sample efficiency\nacross a host of other continuous control tasks.",

          "description": "We study exploration in stochastic multi-armed bandits when we have access to\na divisible resource that can be allocated in varying amounts to arm pulls. We\nfocus in particular on the allocation of distributed computing resources, where\nwe may obtain results faster by allocating more resources per pull, but might\nhave reduced throughput due to nonlinear scaling. For example, in\nsimulation-based scientific studies, an expensive simulation can be sped up by\nrunning it on multiple cores. This speed-up however, is partly offset by the\ncommunication among cores, which results in lower throughput than if fewer\ncores were allocated per trial to run more trials in parallel. In this paper,\nwe explore these trade-offs in two settings. First, in a fixed confidence\nsetting, we need to find the best arm with a given target success probability\nas quickly as possible. We propose an algorithm which trades off between\ninformation accumulation and throughput and show that the time taken can be\nupper bounded by the solution of a dynamic program whose inputs are the gaps\nbetween the sub-optimal and optimal arms. We also prove a matching hardness\nresult. Second, we present an algorithm for a fixed deadline setting, where we\nare given a time deadline and need to maximize the probability of finding the\nbest arm. We corroborate our theoretical insights with simulation experiments\nthat show that the algorithms consistently match or outperform baseline\nalgorithms on a variety of problem instances.",

Its statistic is given\nby the difference in expectations of the witness function, a real-valued\nfunction defined as a weighted sum of kernel evaluations on a set of basis\npoints. Typically the kernel is optimized on a training set, and hypothesis\ntesting is performed on a separate test set to avoid overfitting (i.e., control\ntype-I error). That is, the test set is used to simultaneously estimate the\nexpectations and define the basis points, while the training set only serves to\nselect the kernel and is discarded. In this work, we argue that this data\nsplitting scheme is overly conservative, and propose to use the training data\nto also define the weights and the basis points for better data efficiency. We\nshow that 1) the new test is consistent and has a well-controlled type-I error;\n2) the optimal witness function is given by a precision-weighted mean in the\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the kernel, and is closely\nrelated to kernel Fisher discriminant analysis; and 3) the test power of the\nproposed test is comparable or exceeds that of the MMD and other modern tests,\nas verified empirically on challenging synthetic and real problems (e.g., Higgs\ndata).",

          "description": "Regularization in Optimal Transport (OT) problems has been shown to\ncritically affect the associated computational and sample complexities. It also\nhas been observed that regularization effectively helps in handling noisy\nmarginals as well as marginals with unequal masses. However, existing works on\nOT restrict themselves to $\\phi$-divergences based regularization. In this\nwork, we propose and analyze Integral Probability Metric (IPM) based\nregularization in OT problems. While it is expected that the well-established\nadvantages of IPMs are inherited by the IPM-regularized OT variants, we\ninterestingly observe that some useful aspects of $\\phi$-regularization are\npreserved. For example, we show that the OT formulation, where the marginal\nconstraints are relaxed using IPM-regularization, also lifts the ground metric\nto that over (perhaps un-normalized) measures. Infact, the lifted metric turns\nout to be another IPM whose generating set is the intersection of that of the\nIPM employed for regularization and the set of 1-Lipschitz functions under the\nground metric. Also, in the special case where the regularization is squared\nmaximum mean discrepancy based, the proposed OT variant, as well as the\ncorresponding Barycenter formulation, turn out to be those of minimizing a\nconvex quadratic subject to non-negativity/simplex constraints and hence can be\nsolved efficiently. Simulations confirm that the optimal transport plans/maps\nobtained with IPM-regularization are intrinsically different from those\nobtained with $\\phi$-regularization. Empirical results illustrate the efficacy\nof the proposed IPM-regularized OT formulation.\n\nThis draft contains the main paper and the Appendices.",

          "description": "There is a known tension between the need to analyze personal data to drive\nbusiness and privacy concerns. Many data protection regulations, including the\nEU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer\nProtection Act (CCPA), set out strict restrictions and obligations on companies\nthat collect or process personal data. Moreover, machine learning models\nthemselves can be used to derive personal information, as demonstrated by\nrecent membership and attribute inference attacks. Anonymized data, however, is\nexempt from data protection principles and obligations. Thus, models built on\nanonymized data are also exempt from any privacy obligations, in addition to\nproviding better protection against such attacks on the training data. Learning\non anonymized data typically results in a significant degradation in accuracy.\nWe address this challenge by guiding our anonymization using the knowledge\nencoded within the model, and targeting it to minimize the impact on the\nmodel's accuracy, a process we call accuracy-guided anonymization. We\ndemonstrate that by focusing on the model's accuracy rather than information\nloss, our method outperforms state of the art k-anonymity methods in terms of\nthe achieved utility, in particular with high values of k and large numbers of\nquasi-identifiers. We also demonstrate that our approach achieves similar\nresults in its ability to prevent membership inference attacks as alternative\napproaches based on differential privacy. This shows that model-guided\nanonymization can, in some cases, be a legitimate substitute for such methods,\nwhile averting some of their inherent drawbacks such as complexity, performance\noverhead and being fitted to specific model types. As opposed to methods that\nrely on adding noise during training, our approach does not rely on making any\nmodifications to the training algorithm itself.",

          "description": "Learning the representation of data with hierarchical structures in the\nhyperbolic space attracts increasing attention in recent years. Due to the\nconstant negative curvature, the hyperbolic space resembles tree metrics and\ncaptures the tree-like properties naturally, which enables the hyperbolic\nembeddings to improve over traditional Euclidean models. However, many\nreal-world hierarchically structured data such as taxonomies and multitree\nnetworks have varying local structures and they are not trees, thus they do not\nubiquitously match the constant curvature property of the hyperbolic space. To\naddress this limitation of hyperbolic embeddings, we explore the complex\nhyperbolic space, which has the variable negative curvature, for representation\nlearning. Specifically, we propose to learn the embeddings of hierarchically\nstructured data in the unit ball model of the complex hyperbolic space. The\nunit ball model based embeddings have a more powerful representation capacity\nto capture a variety of hierarchical structures. Through experiments on\nsynthetic and real-world data, we show that our approach improves over the\nhyperbolic embedding models significantly.",

The encoding module is deterministic, non-learnable, and free of\nstorage, while the embedding network is updated during the training time to\nlearn embedding generation.

          "description": "Knowledge Graphs (KG) and associated Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models\nhave recently begun to be explored in the context of drug discovery and have\nthe potential to assist in key challenges such as target identification. In the\ndrug discovery domain, KGs can be employed as part of a process which can\nresult in lab-based experiments being performed, or impact on other decisions,\nincurring significant time and financial costs and most importantly, ultimately\ninfluencing patient healthcare. For KGE models to have impact in this domain, a\nbetter understanding of not only of performance, but also the various factors\nwhich determine it, is required.\n\nIn this study we investigate, over the course of many thousands of\nexperiments, the predictive performance of five KGE models on two public drug\ndiscovery-oriented KGs. Our goal is not to focus on the best overall model or\nconfiguration, instead we take a deeper look at how performance can be affected\nby changes in the training setup, choice of hyperparameters, model parameter\ninitialisation seed and different splits of the datasets. Our results highlight\nthat these factors have significant impact on performance and can even affect\nthe ranking of models. Indeed these factors should be reported along with model\narchitectures to ensure complete reproducibility and fair comparisons of future\nwork, and we argue this is critical for the acceptance of use, and impact of\nKGEs in a biomedical setting. To aid reproducibility of our own work, we\nrelease all experimentation code.",

          "description": "Originality criteria are frequently used to compare assets and, in\nparticular, to assess the validity of intellectual property (IP) rights such as\ncopyright and design rights. In this work, the originality of an asset is\nformulated as a function of the distances between this asset and its\ncomparands, using concepts of maximum entropy and surprisal analysis. Namely,\nthe originality function is defined according to the surprisal associated with\na given asset. Creative assets can be justifiably compared to particles that\nrepel each other via an electrostatic-like pair potential. This allows a very\nsimple, suitably bounded formula to be obtained, in which the originality of an\nasset writes as the ratio of a reference energy to an interaction energy\nimparted to that asset. In particular, the originality of an asset can be\nexpressed as a ratio of two average distances, i.e., the harmonic mean of the\ndistances from this asset to its comparands divided by the harmonic mean of the\ndistances between the sole comparands. Accordingly, the originality of objects\nsuch as IP assets can be simply estimated based on distances computed thanks to\nunsupervised machine learning techniques or other distance computation\nalgorithms.

          "description": "Equivariant neural networks have been successful in incorporating various\ntypes of symmetries, but are mostly limited to vector representations of\ngeometric objects. Despite the prevalence of higher-order tensors in various\napplication domains, e.g. in quantum chemistry, equivariant neural networks for\ngeneral tensors remain unexplored. Previous strategies for learning equivariant\nfunctions on tensors mostly rely on expensive tensor factorization which is not\nscalable when the dimensionality of the problem becomes large. In this work, we\npropose unitary $N$-body tensor equivariant neural network (UNiTE), an\narchitecture for a general class of symmetric tensors called $N$-body tensors.\nThe proposed neural network is equivariant with respect to the actions of a\nunitary group, such as the group of 3D rotations. Furthermore, it has a linear\ntime complexity with respect to the number of non-zero elements in the tensor.\nWe also introduce a normalization method, viz., Equivariant Normalization, to\nimprove generalization of the neural network while preserving symmetry. When\napplied to quantum chemistry, UNiTE outperforms all state-of-the-art machine\nlearning methods of that domain with over 110% average improvements on multiple\nbenchmarks. Finally, we show that UNiTE achieves a robust zero-shot\ngeneralization performance on diverse down stream chemistry tasks, while being\nthree orders of magnitude faster than conventional numerical methods with\ncompetitive accuracy.",

Building on previous work by Mansour et al. (2009)\nwe adapt the concept of discrepancy distance between source and target\ndistributions to restrict the maximization over the hypothesis class to a\nlocalized class of functions which are performing accurate labeling on the\nsource domain. We derive generalization error bounds for such active learning\nstrategies in terms of Rademacher average and localized discrepancy for general\nloss functions which satisfy a regularity condition. A practical K-medoids\nalgorithm that can address the case of large data set is inferred from the\ntheoretical bounds.

          "description": "Deep generative modeling has seen impressive advances in recent years, to the\npoint where it is now commonplace to see simulated samples (e.g., images) that\nclosely resemble real-world data. However, generation quality is generally\ninconsistent for any given model and can vary dramatically between samples. We\nintroduce Discriminator Gradient flow (DGflow), a new technique that improves\ngenerated samples via the gradient flow of entropy-regularized f-divergences\nbetween the real and the generated data distributions. The gradient flow takes\nthe form of a non-linear Fokker-Plank equation, which can be easily simulated\nby sampling from the equivalent McKean-Vlasov process. By refining inferior\nsamples, our technique avoids wasteful sample rejection used by previous\nmethods (DRS & MH-GAN). Compared to existing works that focus on specific GAN\nvariants, we show our refinement approach can be applied to GANs with\nvector-valued critics and even other deep generative models such as VAEs and\nNormalizing Flows. Empirical results on multiple synthetic, image, and text\ndatasets demonstrate that DGflow leads to significant improvement in the\nquality of generated samples for a variety of generative models, outperforming\nthe state-of-the-art Discriminator Optimal Transport (DOT) and Discriminator\nDriven Latent Sampling (DDLS) methods.",

However, estimating treatment effects from\nobservational data is faced with two major challenges, missing counterfactual\noutcomes and treatment selection bias. Matching methods are among the most\nwidely used and fundamental approaches to estimating treatment effects, but\nexisting matching methods have poor performance when facing data with high\ndimensional and complicated variables. We propose a feature selection\nrepresentation matching (FSRM) method based on deep representation learning and\nmatching, which maps the original covariate space into a selective, nonlinear,\nand balanced representation space, and then conducts matching in the learned\nrepresentation space. FSRM adopts deep feature selection to minimize the\ninfluence of irrelevant variables for estimating treatment effects and\nincorporates a regularizer based on the Wasserstein distance to learn balanced\nrepresentations. We evaluate the performance of our FSRM method on three\ndatasets, and the results demonstrate superiority over the state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

Firstly,\nthe SE block is introduced to adaptively extract image features after each\nconvolution in the U-Net encoder, while suppressing irrelevant regions, and\nhighlighting features of specific segmentation task; Secondly, ASPP was\nemployed to replace the transition layer and the output layer, and acquire\nmulti-scale image information via different receptive fields. Thirdly, to\nalleviate the degradation problem, the traditional convolution block was\nreplaced with the residual block and thus prompt the network to gain accuracy\nfrom considerably increased depth.\n\nResults: In the LiTS17 experiment, the mean values of Dice, VOE, RVD, ASD and\nMSD were 95.71, 9.52, -0.84, 1.54 and 29.14, respectively.

Given the nature of the reinforcement\nlearning problem, we argue that standard fine-tuning strategies alone are not\nenough for efficient transfer in challenging domains. We introduce Behavior\nTransfer (BT), a technique that leverages pre-trained policies for exploration\nand that is complementary to transferring neural network weights. Our\nexperiments show that, when combined with large-scale pre-training in the\nabsence of rewards, existing intrinsic motivation objectives can lead to the\nemergence of complex behaviors. These pre-trained policies can then be\nleveraged by BT to discover better solutions than without pre-training, and\ncombining BT with standard fine-tuning strategies results in additional\nbenefits.

          "description": "Tree-based models underpin many modern semantic search engines and\nrecommender systems due to their sub-linear inference times. In industrial\napplications, these models operate at extreme scales, where every bit of\nperformance is critical. Memory constraints at extreme scales also require that\nmodels be sparse, hence tree-based models are often back-ended by sparse matrix\nalgebra routines. However, there are currently no sparse matrix techniques\nspecifically designed for the sparsity structure one encounters in tree-based\nmodels for extreme multi-label ranking/classification (XMR/XMC) problems. To\naddress this issue, we present the masked sparse chunk multiplication (MSCM)\ntechnique, a sparse matrix technique specifically tailored to XMR trees. MSCM\nis easy to implement, embarrassingly parallelizable, and offers a significant\nperformance boost to any existing tree inference pipeline at no cost. We\nperform a comprehensive study of MSCM applied to several different sparse\ninference schemes and benchmark our methods on a general purpose extreme\nmulti-label ranking framework. We observe that MSCM gives consistently dramatic\nspeedups across both the online and batch inference settings, single- and\nmulti-threaded settings, and on many different tree models and datasets. To\ndemonstrate its utility in industrial applications, we apply MSCM to an\nenterprise-scale semantic product search problem with 100 million products and\nachieve sub-millisecond latency of 0.88 ms per query on a single thread -- an\n8x reduction in latency over vanilla inference techniques. The MSCM technique\nrequires absolutely no sacrifices to model accuracy as it gives exactly the\nsame results as standard sparse matrix techniques. Therefore, we believe that\nMSCM will enable users of XMR trees to save a substantial amount of compute\nresources in their inference pipelines at very little cost.",

          "description": "Many works in signal processing and learning theory operate under the\nassumption that the underlying model is simple, e.g. that a signal is\napproximately $k$-Fourier-sparse or that a distribution can be approximated by\na mixture model that has at most $k$ components. However the problem of fitting\nthe parameters of such a model becomes more challenging when the\nfrequencies/components are too close together.\n\nIn this work we introduce new methods for sparsifying sums of exponentials\nand give various algorithmic applications. First we study Fourier-sparse\ninterpolation without a frequency gap, where Chen et al. gave an algorithm for\nfinding an $\\epsilon$-approximate solution which uses $k' = \\mbox{poly}(k, \\log\n1/\\epsilon)$ frequencies. Second, we study learning Gaussian mixture models in\none dimension without a separation condition. Kernel density estimators give an\n$\\epsilon$-approximation that uses $k' = O(k/\\epsilon^2)$ components. These\nmethods both output models that are much more complex than what we started out\nwith. We show how to post-process to reduce the number of\nfrequencies/components down to $k' = \\widetilde{O}(k)$, which is optimal up to\nlogarithmic factors. Moreover we give applications to model selection. In\nparticular, we give the first algorithms for approximately (and robustly)\ndetermining the number of components in a Gaussian mixture model that work\nwithout a separation condition.",

Leveraging this insight, we\nintroduce a novel objective to train seemingly fair models where counterfactual\nexplanations find much lower cost recourse under a slight perturbation. We\ndescribe how these models can unfairly provide low-cost recourse for specific\nsubgroups in the data while appearing fair to auditors. We perform experiments\non loan and violent crime prediction data sets where certain subgroups achieve\nup to 20x lower cost recourse under the perturbation.

The insurgence of hypergraphs has\nresulted in data of increasing size and complexity that exhibit interesting\nsmall-scale and local structure, e.g., small-scale communities and localized\nnode-ranking around a given set of seed nodes. Popular and principled ways to\ncapture the local structure are the local hypergraph clustering problem and\nrelated seed set expansion problem. In this work, we propose the first local\ndiffusion method that achieves edge-size-independent Cheeger-type guarantee for\nthe problem of local hypergraph clustering while applying to a rich class of\nhigher-order relations that covers many previously studied special cases. Our\nmethod is based on a primal-dual optimization formulation where the primal\nproblem has a natural network flow interpretation, and the dual problem has a\ncut-based interpretation using the $\\ell_2$-norm penalty on associated\ncut-costs.

          "description": "Laplace approximations are classic, computationally lightweight means for\nconstructing Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). As in other approximate BNNs, one\ncannot necessarily expect the induced predictive uncertainty to be calibrated.\nHere we develop a formalism to explicitly \"train\" the uncertainty in a\ndecoupled way to the prediction itself. To this end, we introduce uncertainty\nunits for Laplace-approximated networks: Hidden units associated with a\nparticular weight structure that can be added to any pre-trained,\npoint-estimated network. Due to their weights, these units are inactive -- they\ndo not affect the predictions. But their presence changes the geometry (in\nparticular the Hessian) of the loss landscape, thereby affecting the network's\nuncertainty estimates under a Laplace approximation. We show that such units\ncan be trained via an uncertainty-aware objective, improving standard Laplace\napproximations' performance in various uncertainty quantification tasks.",

          "description": "Zero-shot learning is a new paradigm to classify objects from classes that\nare not available at training time. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods have\nattracted considerable attention in recent years because of their ability to\nclassify unseen/novel class examples. Most of the existing approaches on ZSL\nworks when all the samples from seen classes are available to train the model,\nwhich does not suit real life. In this paper, we tackle this hindrance by\ndeveloping a generative replay-based continual ZSL (GRCZSL). The proposed\nmethod endows traditional ZSL to learn from streaming data and acquire new\nknowledge without forgetting the previous tasks' gained experience. We handle\ncatastrophic forgetting in GRCZSL by replaying the synthetic samples of seen\nclasses, which have appeared in the earlier tasks. These synthetic samples are\nsynthesized using the trained conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) over\nthe immediate past task. Moreover, we only require the current and immediate\nprevious VAE at any time for training and testing. The proposed GRZSL method is\ndeveloped for a single-head setting of continual learning, simulating a\nreal-world problem setting. In this setting, task identity is given during\ntraining but unavailable during testing. GRCZSL performance is evaluated on\nfive benchmark datasets for the generalized setup of ZSL with fixed and dynamic\n(incremental class) settings of continual learning. The existing class setting\npresented recently in the literature is not suitable for a class-incremental\nsetting. Therefore, this paper proposes a new setting to address this issue.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms\nthe baseline and the state-of-the-art method and makes it more suitable for\nreal-world applications.",

          "description": "Machine learning problems have an intrinsic geometric structure as central\nobjects including a neural network's weight space and the loss function\nassociated with a particular task can be viewed as encoding the intrinsic\ngeometry of a given machine learning problem. Therefore, geometric concepts can\nbe applied to analyze and understand theoretical properties of machine learning\nstrategies as well as to develop new algorithms. In this paper, we address\nthree seemingly unrelated open questions in machine learning by viewing them\nthrough a unified framework grounded in differential geometry. Specifically, we\nview the weight space of a neural network as a manifold endowed with a\nRiemannian metric that encodes performance on specific tasks. By defining a\nmetric, we can construct geodesic, minimum length, paths in weight space that\nrepresent sets of networks of equivalent or near equivalent functional\nperformance on a specific task. We, then, traverse geodesic paths while\nidentifying networks that satisfy a second objective. Inspired by the geometric\ninsight, we apply our geodesic framework to 3 major applications: (i) Network\nsparsification (ii) Mitigating catastrophic forgetting by constructing networks\nwith high performance on a series of objectives and (iii) Finding high-accuracy\npaths connecting distinct local optima of deep networks in the non-convex loss\nlandscape. Our results are obtained on a wide range of network architectures\n(MLP, VGG11/16) trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100.

First, we test\nthe transformer under standard white-box and black-box attacks. Second, we\nstudy the transferability of adversarial examples between CNNs and\ntransformers. We show that adversarial examples do not readily transfer between\nCNNs and transformers. Based on this finding, we analyze the security of a\nsimple ensemble defense of CNNs and transformers. By creating a new attack, the\nself-attention blended gradient attack, we show that such an ensemble is not\nsecure under a white-box adversary. However, under a black-box adversary, we\nshow that an ensemble can achieve unprecedented robustness without sacrificing\nclean accuracy. Our analysis for this work is done using six types of white-box\nattacks and two types of black-box attacks. Our study encompasses multiple\nVision Transformers, Big Transfer Models and CNN architectures trained on\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.",

          "description": "We present a novel hybrid strategy based on machine learning to improve\ncurvature estimation in the level-set method. The proposed inference system\ncouples enhanced neural networks with standard numerical schemes to compute\ncurvature more accurately. The core of our hybrid framework is a switching\nmechanism that relies on well established numerical techniques to gauge\ncurvature. If the curvature magnitude is larger than a resolution-dependent\nthreshold, it uses a neural network to yield a better approximation. Our\nnetworks are multilayer perceptrons fitted to synthetic data sets composed of\nsinusoidal- and circular-interface samples at various configurations. To reduce\ndata set size and training complexity, we leverage the problem's characteristic\nsymmetry and build our models on just half of the curvature spectrum. These\nsavings lead to a powerful inference system able to outperform any of its\nnumerical or neural component alone. Experiments with static, smooth interfaces\nshow that our hybrid solver is notably superior to conventional numerical\nmethods in coarse grids and along steep interface regions. Compared to prior\nresearch, we have observed outstanding gains in precision after training the\nregression model with data pairs from more than a single interface type and\ntransforming data with specialized input preprocessing. In particular, our\nfindings confirm that machine learning is a promising venue for reducing or\nremoving mass loss in the level-set method.",

The main difference\nbetween image classifiers and video classifiers is that the latter usually use\ntemporal information contained within the video. In this work we present a\nmanipulation scheme for fooling video classifiers by introducing a flickering\ntemporal perturbation that in some cases may be unnoticeable by human observers\nand is implementable in the real world. After demonstrating the manipulation of\naction classification of single videos, we generalize the procedure to make\nuniversal adversarial perturbation, achieving high fooling ratio. In addition,\nwe generalize the universal perturbation and produce a temporal-invariant\nperturbation, which can be applied to the video without synchronizing the\nperturbation to the input. The attack was implemented on several target models\nand the transferability of the attack was demonstrated.

Without making any statistical assumption on the degree of\nheterogeneity of local data across parties, we provide convergence guarantees\nfor Fed+ for convex and non-convex loss functions and robust aggregation.

Furthermore, we prove that one-step HOOI (i.e., HOOI\nwith only a single iteration) is also optimal in terms of tensor reconstruction\nand can be used to lower the computational cost. The perturbation results are\nalso extended to the case that only partial modes of $\\bcT$ have low-rank\nstructure.

SegFormer has two appealing features: 1) SegFormer comprises a\nnovel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale\nfeatures. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the\ninterpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the\ntesting resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders.\nThe proposed MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus\ncombining both local attention and global attention to render powerful\nrepresentations. We show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to\nefficient segmentation on Transformers. We scale our approach up to obtain a\nseries of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly\nbetter performance and efficiency than previous counterparts. For example,\nSegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3% mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5x\nsmaller and 2.2% better than the previous best method.

A more basic problem of sampling each arm once runs into\nsimilar factors.\n\nWe focus on the price of incentives: the loss in performance, broadly\nconstrued, incurred for the sake of incentive-compatibility. We prove that\nThompson Sampling, a standard bandit algorithm, is incentive-compatible if\ninitialized with sufficiently many data points. The performance loss due to\nincentives is therefore limited to the initial rounds when these data points\nare collected. The problem is largely reduced to that of sample complexity: how\nmany rounds are needed?

We first\nrigorously analyze a deterministic variant of the online threat model by\ndrawing parallels to the well-studied $k$-secretary problem in theoretical\ncomputer science and propose Virtual+, a simple yet practical online algorithm.\nOur main theoretical result show Virtual+ yields provably the best competitive\nratio over all single-threshold algorithms for $k<5$ -- extending previous\nanalysis of the $k$-secretary problem. We also introduce the \\textit{stochastic\n$k$-secretary} -- effectively reducing online blackbox transfer attacks to a\n$k$-secretary problem under noise -- and prove theoretical bounds on the\nperformance of \\textit{any} online algorithms adapted to this setting. Finally,\nwe complement our theoretical results by conducting experiments on both MNIST\nand CIFAR-10 with both vanilla and robust classifiers, revealing not only the\nnecessity of online algorithms in achieving near-optimal performance but also\nthe rich interplay of a given attack strategy towards online attack selection,\nenabling simple strategies like FGSM to outperform classically strong whitebox\nadversaries.",

          "description": "While many areas of machine learning have benefited from the increasing\navailability of large and varied datasets, the benefit to causal inference has\nbeen limited given the strong assumptions needed to ensure identifiability of\ncausal effects; these are often not satisfied in real-world datasets. For\nexample, many large observational datasets (e.g., case-control studies in\nepidemiology, click-through data in recommender systems) suffer from selection\nbias on the outcome, which makes the average treatment effect (ATE)\nunidentifiable. We propose a general algorithm to estimate causal effects from\n\\emph{multiple} data sources, where the ATE may be identifiable only in some\ndatasets but not others. The key idea is to construct control variates using\nthe datasets in which the ATE is not identifiable. We show theoretically that\nthis reduces the variance of the ATE estimate. We apply this framework to\ninference from observational data under outcome selection bias, assuming access\nto an auxiliary small dataset from which we can obtain a consistent estimate of\nthe ATE. We construct a control variate by taking the difference of the odds\nratio estimates from the two datasets. Across simulations and two case studies\nwith real data, we show that this control variate can significantly reduce the\nvariance of the ATE estimate.",

          "description": "Mirror descent (MD), a well-known first-order method in constrained convex\noptimization, has recently been shown as an important tool to analyze\ntrust-region algorithms in reinforcement learning (RL). However, there remains\na considerable gap between such theoretically analyzed algorithms and the ones\nused in practice. Inspired by this, we propose an efficient RL algorithm,\ncalled {\\em mirror descent policy optimization} (MDPO). MDPO iteratively\nupdates the policy by {\\em approximately} solving a trust-region problem, whose\nobjective function consists of two terms: a linearization of the standard RL\nobjective and a proximity term that restricts two consecutive policies to be\nclose to each other. Each update performs this approximation by taking multiple\ngradient steps on this objective function. We derive {\\em on-policy} and {\\em\noff-policy} variants of MDPO, while emphasizing important design choices\nmotivated by the existing theory of MD in RL. We highlight the connections\nbetween on-policy MDPO and two popular trust-region RL algorithms: TRPO and\nPPO, and show that explicitly enforcing the trust-region constraint is in fact\n{\\em not} a necessity for high performance gains in TRPO. We then show how the\npopular soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm can be derived by slight\nmodifications of off-policy MDPO. Overall, MDPO is derived from the MD\nprinciples, offers a unified approach to viewing a number of popular RL\nalgorithms, and performs better than or on-par with TRPO, PPO, and SAC in a\nnumber of continuous control tasks.

In\nthis paper, we investigate an emerging question: can an implicit equilibrium\nmodel's equilibrium point be regarded as the solution of an optimization\nproblem? To this end, we first decompose DNNs into a new class of unit layer\nthat is the proximal operator of an implicit convex function while keeping its\noutput unchanged. Then, the equilibrium model of the unit layer can be derived,\nnamed Optimization Induced Equilibrium Networks (OptEq), which can be easily\nextended to deep layers. The equilibrium point of OptEq can be theoretically\nconnected to the solution of its corresponding convex optimization problem with\nexplicit objectives. Based on this, we can flexibly introduce prior properties\nto the equilibrium points: 1) modifying the underlying convex problems\nexplicitly so as to change the architectures of OptEq; and 2) merging the\ninformation into the fixed point iteration, which guarantees to choose the\ndesired equilibrium point when the fixed point set is non-singleton. We show\nthat deep OptEq outperforms previous implicit models even with fewer\nparameters. This work establishes the first step towards the\noptimization-guided design of deep models.",

To address this challenge, we introduce an algorithmic framework for\nactive monitoring of a neural network.

We consider multiple\nways to learn such an orthogonal transformation, including unrolling\northogonalization algorithms, applying orthogonal parameterization, and\ndesigning orthogonality-preserving gradient descent. For better scalability, we\npropose the stochastic OPT which performs orthogonal transformation\nstochastically for partial dimensions of neurons. Interestingly, OPT reveals\nthat learning a proper coordinate system for neurons is crucial to\ngeneralization. We provide some insights on why OPT yields better\ngeneralization. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of OPT over the\nstandard training.",

In\nthis paper, we propose a theoretical framework able to compare the expressive\npower of these GNN architectures. The current universality theorems only apply\nto intractable classes of GNNs. Here, we prove the first approximation\nguarantees for practical GNNs, paving the way for a better understanding of\ntheir generalization. Our theoretical results are proved for invariant GNNs\ncomputing a graph embedding (permutation of the nodes of the input graph does\nnot affect the output) and equivariant GNNs computing an embedding of the nodes\n(permutation of the input permutes the output). We show that Folklore Graph\nNeural Networks (FGNN), which are tensor based GNNs augmented with matrix\nmultiplication are the most expressive architectures proposed so far for a\ngiven tensor order. We illustrate our results on the Quadratic Assignment\nProblem (a NP-Hard combinatorial problem) by showing that FGNNs are able to\nlearn how to solve the problem, leading to much better average performances\nthan existing algorithms (based on spectral, SDP or other GNNs architectures).\nOn a practical side, we also implement masked tensors to handle batches of\ngraphs of varying sizes.",

However, the approach suffers from\ntime and memory complexity proportional to the length $r$ of its inner\noptimization loop, which has led to several modifications being proposed. One\nsuch modification is \\textit{first-order} BLO (FO-BLO) which approximates\nouter-level gradients by zeroing out second derivative terms, yielding\nsignificant speed gains and requiring only constant memory as $r$ varies.\nDespite FO-BLO's popularity, there is a lack of theoretical understanding of\nits convergence properties. We make progress by demonstrating a rich family of\nexamples where FO-BLO-based stochastic optimization does not converge to a\nstationary point of the BLO objective. We address this concern by proposing a\nnew FO-BLO-based unbiased estimate of outer-level gradients, enabling us to\ntheoretically guarantee this convergence, with no harm to memory and expected\ntime complexity.

          "description": "As machine learning becomes more widely used for critical applications, the\nneed to study its implications in privacy turns to be urgent. Given access to\nthe target model and auxiliary information, the model inversion attack aims to\ninfer sensitive features of the training dataset, which leads to great privacy\nconcerns. Despite its success in grid-like domains, directly applying model\ninversion techniques on non-grid domains such as graph achieves poor attack\nperformance due to the difficulty to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of\ngraphs and attributes of nodes used in Graph Neural Networks (GNN). To bridge\nthis gap, we present \\textbf{Graph} \\textbf{M}odel \\textbf{I}nversion attack\n(GraphMI), which aims to extract private graph data of the training graph by\ninverting GNN, one of the state-of-the-art graph analysis tools. Specifically,\nwe firstly propose a projected gradient module to tackle the discreteness of\ngraph edges while preserving the sparsity and smoothness of graph features.\nThen we design a graph auto-encoder module to efficiently exploit graph\ntopology, node attributes, and target model parameters for edge inference. With\nthe proposed methods, we study the connection between model inversion risk and\nedge influence and show that edges with greater influence are more likely to be\nrecovered.

          "description": "Incorporating a so-called \"momentum\" dynamic in gradient descent methods is\nwidely used in neural net training as it has been broadly observed that, at\nleast empirically, it often leads to significantly faster convergence. At the\nsame time, there are very few theoretical guarantees in the literature to\nexplain this apparent acceleration effect. Even for the classical strongly\nconvex quadratic problems, several existing results only show Polyak's momentum\nhas an accelerated linear rate asymptotically. In this paper, we first revisit\nthe quadratic problems and show a non-asymptotic accelerated linear rate of\nPolyak's momentum. Then, we provably show that Polyak's momentum achieves\nacceleration for training a one-layer wide ReLU network and a deep linear\nnetwork, which are perhaps the two most popular canonical models for studying\noptimization and deep learning in the literature. Prior work Du at al. 2019 and\nWu et al. 2019 showed that using vanilla gradient descent, and with an use of\nover-parameterization, the error decays as $(1- \\Theta(\\frac{1}{ \\kappa'}))^t$\nafter $t$ iterations, where $\\kappa'$ is the condition number of a Gram Matrix.\nOur result shows that with the appropriate choice of parameters Polyak's\nmomentum has a rate of $(1-\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\kappa'}}))^t$. For the deep\nlinear network, prior work Hu et al. 2020 showed that vanilla gradient descent\nhas a rate of $(1-\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\kappa}))^t$, where $\\kappa$ is the condition\nnumber of a data matrix. Our result shows an acceleration rate $(1-\n\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}))^t$ is achievable by Polyak's momentum. All the\nresults in this work are obtained from a modular analysis, which can be of\nindependent interest. This work establishes that momentum does indeed speed up\nneural net training.",

          "description": "We introduce the sequential neural posterior and likelihood approximation\n(SNPLA) algorithm. SNPLA is a normalizing flows-based algorithm for inference\nin implicit models, and therefore is a simulation-based inference method that\nonly requires simulations from a generative model. SNPLA avoids Markov chain\nMonte Carlo sampling and correction-steps of the parameter proposal function\nthat are introduced in similar methods, but that can be numerically unstable or\nrestrictive. By utilizing the reverse KL divergence, SNPLA manages to learn\nboth the likelihood and the posterior in a sequential manner. Over four\nexperiments, we show that SNPLA performs competitively when utilizing the same\nnumber of model simulations as used in other methods, even though the inference\nproblem for SNPLA is more complex due to the joint learning of posterior and\nlikelihood function. Due to utilizing normalizing flows SNPLA generates\nposterior draws much faster (4 orders of magnitude) than MCMC-based methods.",

          "description": "In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), vehicles are expected to feature\nwith advanced applications and services which demand ultra-high data rates and\nlow-latency communications. For that, the millimeter wave (mmWave)\ncommunication has been emerging as a very promising solution. However,\nincorporating the mmWave into ITS is particularly challenging due to the high\nmobility of vehicles and the inherent sensitivity of mmWave beams to dynamic\nblockages. This article addresses these problems by developing an optimal beam\nassociation framework for mmWave vehicular networks under high mobility.\nSpecifically, we use the semi-Markov decision process to capture the dynamics\nand uncertainty of the environment. The Q-learning algorithm is then often used\nto find the optimal policy. However, Q-learning is notorious for its\nslow-convergence. Instead of adopting deep reinforcement learning structures\n(like most works in the literature), we leverage the fact that there are\nusually multiple vehicles on the road to speed up the learning process. To that\nend, we develop a lightweight yet very effective parallel Q-learning algorithm\nto quickly obtain the optimal policy by simultaneously learning from various\nvehicles. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed solution can\nincrease the data rate by 47% and reduce the disconnection probability by 29%\ncompared to other solutions.",

          "description": "The dictionary learning problem concerns the task of representing data as\nsparse linear sums drawn from a smaller collection of basic building blocks. In\napplication domains where such techniques are deployed, we frequently encounter\ndatasets where some form of symmetry or invariance is present. Motivated by\nthis observation, we develop a framework for learning dictionaries for data\nunder the constraint that the collection of basic building blocks remains\ninvariant under such symmetries. Our procedure for learning such dictionaries\nrelies on representing the symmetry as the action of a matrix group acting on\nthe data, and subsequently introducing a convex penalty function so as to\ninduce sparsity with respect to the collection of matrix group elements. Our\nframework specializes to the convolutional dictionary learning problem when we\nconsider integer shifts. Using properties of positive semidefinite Hermitian\nToeplitz matrices, we develop an extension that learns dictionaries that are\ninvariant under continuous shifts. Our numerical experiments on synthetic data\nand ECG data show that the incorporation of such symmetries as priors are most\nvaluable when the dataset has few data-points, or when the full range of\nsymmetries is inadequately expressed in the dataset.",

To address these\nlimitations, two major modifications are made, where Koopman operators are\nremoved from the analysis in light of Liouville operators (known as Koopman\ngenerators in special cases), and these operators are shown to be compact for\ncertain pairs of Hilbert spaces selected separately as the domain and range of\nthe operator.

          "description": "Learning nonlinear dynamics from aggregate data is a challenging problem\nbecause the full trajectory of each individual is not available, namely, the\nindividual observed at one time may not be observed at the next time point, or\nthe identity of individual is unavailable. This is in sharp contrast to\nlearning dynamics with full trajectory data, on which the majority of existing\nmethods are based. We propose a novel method using the weak form of Fokker\nPlanck Equation (FPE) -- a partial differential equation -- to describe the\ndensity evolution of data in a sampled form, which is then combined with\nWasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) in the training process. In\nsuch a sample-based framework we are able to learn the nonlinear dynamics from\naggregate data without explicitly solving the partial differential equation\n(PDE) FPE.

The representation is particularly advantageous for a\nspatial multi-dimensional position, e.g., pixel positions on an image, where\n$L_2$ distances or more complex positional relationships need to be captured.\nOur experiments based on several public benchmark tasks show that our learnable\nFourier feature representation for multi-dimensional positional encoding\noutperforms existing methods by both improving the accuracy and allowing faster\nconvergence.",

          "description": "High order momentum-based parameter update algorithms have seen widespread\napplications in training machine learning models. Recently, connections with\nvariational approaches have led to the derivation of new learning algorithms\nwith accelerated learning guarantees. Such methods however, have only\nconsidered the case of static regressors. There is a significant need for\nparameter update algorithms which can be proven stable in the presence of\nadversarial time-varying regressors, as is commonplace in control theory. In\nthis paper, we propose a new discrete time algorithm which 1) provides\nstability and asymptotic convergence guarantees in the presence of adversarial\nregressors by leveraging insights from adaptive control theory and 2) provides\nnon-asymptotic accelerated learning guarantees leveraging insights from convex\noptimization. In particular, our algorithm reaches an $\\epsilon$ sub-optimal\npoint in at most $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ iterations when\nregressors are constant - matching lower bounds due to Nesterov of\n$\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$, up to a $\\log(1/\\epsilon)$ factor and provides\nguaranteed bounds for stability when regressors are time-varying. We provide\nnumerical experiments for a variant of Nesterov's provably hard convex\noptimization problem with time-varying regressors, as well as the problem of\nrecovering an image with a time-varying blur and noise using streaming data.",

          "description": "Continual Learning (CL) considers the problem of training an agent\nsequentially on a set of tasks while seeking to retain performance on all\nprevious tasks. A key challenge in CL is catastrophic forgetting, which arises\nwhen performance on a previously mastered task is reduced when learning a new\ntask. While a variety of methods exist to combat forgetting, in some cases\ntasks are fundamentally incompatible with each other and thus cannot be learnt\nby a single policy. This can occur, in reinforcement learning (RL) when an\nagent may be rewarded for achieving different goals from the same observation.\nIn this paper we formalize this ``interference'' as distinct from the problem\nof forgetting. We show that existing CL methods based on single neural network\npredictors with shared replay buffers fail in the presence of interference.\nInstead, we propose a simple method, OWL, to address this challenge. OWL learns\na factorized policy, using shared feature extraction layers, but separate\nheads, each specializing on a new task. The separate heads in OWL are used to\nprevent interference. At test time, we formulate policy selection as a\nmulti-armed bandit problem, and show it is possible to select the best policy\nfor an unknown task using feedback from the environment. The use of bandit\nalgorithms allows the OWL agent to constructively re-use different continually\nlearnt policies at different times during an episode. We show in multiple RL\nenvironments that existing replay based CL methods fail, while OWL is able to\nachieve close to optimal performance when training sequentially.",

          "description": "Multi-regional interaction among neuronal populations underlies the brain's\nprocessing of rich sensory information in our daily lives. Recent neuroscience\nand neuroimaging studies have increasingly used naturalistic stimuli and\nexperimental design to identify such realistic sensory computation in the\nbrain. However, existing methods for cross-areal interaction analysis with\ndimensionality reduction, such as reduced-rank regression and canonical\ncorrelation analysis, have limited applicability and interpretability in\nnaturalistic settings because they usually do not appropriately 'demix' neural\ninteractions into those associated with different types of task parameters or\nstimulus features (e.g., visual or audio). In this paper, we develop a new\nmethod for cross-areal interaction analysis that uses the rich task or stimulus\nparameters to reveal how and what types of information are shared by different\nneural populations. The proposed neural demixed shared component analysis\ncombines existing dimensionality reduction methods with a practical neural\nnetwork implementation of functional analysis of variance with latent\nvariables, thereby efficiently demixing nonlinear effects of continuous and\nmultimodal stimuli. We also propose a simplifying alternative under the\nassumptions of linear effects and unimodal stimuli. To demonstrate our methods,\nwe analyzed two human neuroimaging datasets of participants watching\nnaturalistic videos of movies and dance movements. The results demonstrate that\nour methods provide new insights into multi-regional interaction in the brain\nduring naturalistic sensory inputs, which cannot be captured by conventional\ntechniques.",

Previous\nworks focused on utilizing the spatial and temporal information in time domain\nwhile not sufficiently taking advantage of the cues in frequency domain.

As an example, in most optimal stochastic contextual bandit\nalgorithms, there is an unknown exploration parameter which controls the\ntrade-off between exploration and exploitation.

We propose two kernel-based methods for nonlinear causal effect\nestimation in this setting: (a) a two-stage regression approach, and (b) a\nmaximum moment restriction approach. We focus on the proximal causal learning\nsetting, but our methods can be used to solve a wider class of inverse problems\ncharacterised by a Fredholm integral equation. In particular, we provide a\nunifying view of two-stage and moment restriction approaches for solving this\nproblem in a nonlinear setting. We provide consistency guarantees for each\nalgorithm, and we demonstrate these approaches achieve competitive results on\nsynthetic data and data simulating a real-world task. In particular, our\napproach outperforms earlier methods that are not suited to leveraging proxy\nvariables.",

          "description": "Multi-armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms identify the best arm among multiple arms\nvia exploration-exploitation trade-off without prior knowledge of arm\nstatistics. Their usefulness in wireless radio, IoT, and robotics demand\ndeployment on edge devices, and hence, a mapping on system-on-chip (SoC) is\ndesired. Theoretically, the Bayesian approach-based Thompson Sampling (TS)\nalgorithm offers better performance than the frequentist approach-based Upper\nConfidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. However, TS is not synthesizable due to Beta\nfunction. We address this problem by approximating it via a pseudo-random\nnumber generator-based approach and efficiently realize the TS algorithm on\nZynq SoC. In practice, the type of arms distribution (e.g., Bernoulli,\nGaussian, etc.) is unknown and hence, a single algorithm may not be optimal. We\npropose a reconfigurable and intelligent MAB (RI-MAB) framework. Here,\nintelligence enables the identification of appropriate MAB algorithms for a\ngiven environment, and reconfigurability allows on-the-fly switching between\nalgorithms on the SoC. This eliminates the need for parallel implementation of\nalgorithms resulting in huge savings in resources and power consumption. We\nanalyze the functional correctness, area, power, and execution time of the\nproposed and existing architectures for various arm distributions, word-length,\nand hardware-software co-design approaches. We demonstrate the superiority of\nthe RI-MAB over TS and UCB only architectures.",

We have then combined k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms to detect turns using data from the\nsteering angle sensor. In addition, data from an AV's speed sensor is used to\nrecognize the AV's motion state including the standstill state.

It has been proposed that they do so by becoming stable to\ndiffeomorphisms, yet existing empirical measurements support that it is often\nnot the case. We revisit this question by defining a maximum-entropy\ndistribution on diffeomorphisms, that allows to study typical diffeomorphisms\nof a given norm. We confirm that stability toward diffeomorphisms does not\nstrongly correlate to performance on benchmark data sets of images. By\ncontrast, we find that the stability toward diffeomorphisms relative to that of\ngeneric transformations $R_f$ correlates remarkably with the test error\n$\\epsilon_t$. It is of order unity at initialization but decreases by several\ndecades during training for state-of-the-art architectures. For CIFAR10 and 15\nknown architectures, we find $\\epsilon_t\\approx 0.2\\sqrt{R_f}$, suggesting that\nobtaining a small $R_f$ is important to achieve good performance.

This elicits a problem with how\nmuch inductive bias to impose on the model through known physical parameters\nand principles to reduce complexity of the learning problem to give us more\nreliable predictions. Recent work employs discrete variational integrators\nparameterized as a neural network architecture to learn conservative Lagrangian\nsystems. The learned model captures and enforces global energy preserving\nproperties of the system from very few trajectories. However, most real systems\nare inherently non-conservative and, in practice, we would also like to apply\nactuation.

We show that this forced\nvariational integrator networks (FVIN) architecture allows us to accurately\naccount for energy dissipation and external forcing while still capturing the\ntrue underlying energy-based passive dynamics.

This technique enables\ndetection of the morphologies of individual microaneurysms (MAs), which are one\nof the earliest signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR), a frequent complication of\ndiabetes that can lead to visual impairment and blindness. In contrast to\nprevious automatic models developed for MA detection on standard fundus\nphotographs, currently there is no high throughput image protocol available for\nautomatic analysis of AOSLO photographs. To address this urgency, we introduce\nAOSLO-net, a deep neural network framework with customized training policy,\nincluding preprocessing, data augmentation and transfer learning, to\nautomatically segment MAs from AOSLO images. We evaluate the performance of\nAOSLO-net using 87 DR AOSLO images demonstrating very accurate MA detection and\nsegmentation, leading to correct MA morphological classification, while\noutperforming the state-of-the-art both in accuracy and cost.",

We focus on\nscenarios where communication between agents is costly, and takes place over\nchannels with finite bandwidth. To reduce the frequency of communication, we\ndevelop a novel event-triggered distributed learning rule that is based on the\nprinciple of diffusing low beliefs on each false hypothesis. Building on this\nprinciple, we design a trigger condition under which an agent broadcasts only\nthose components of its belief vector that have adequate innovation, to only\nthose neighbors that require such information. We prove that our rule\nguarantees convergence to the true state exponentially fast almost surely\ndespite sparse communication, and that it has the potential to significantly\nreduce information flow from uninformative agents to informative agents. Next,\nto deal with finite-precision communication channels, we propose a distributed\nlearning rule that leverages the idea of adaptive quantization. We show that by\nsequentially refining the range of the quantizers, every agent can learn the\ntruth exponentially fast almost surely, while using just $1$ bit to encode its\nbelief on each hypothesis.

We further\ndemonstrate the capabilities of this framework on a series of challenging\nbenchmarks, learning the parameters of several plasticity rules including BCM,\nOja's, and their respective set of neuromodulatory variants. The experimental\nresults display that SNNs augmented with differentiable plasticity are\nsufficient for solving a set of challenging temporal learning tasks that a\ntraditional SNN fails to solve, even in the presence of significant noise.\nThese networks are also shown to be capable of producing locomotion on a\nhigh-dimensional robotic learning task, where near-minimal degradation in\nperformance is observed in the presence of novel conditions not seen during the\ninitial training period.",

In contrast to the existing deep learning\napproaches that require matched high-resolution target volume images, our\nmethod greatly reduces the effort to put into practice as the training of a\nnetwork requires as little as a single 3D image stack, without a priori\nknowledge of the image formation process, registration of training data, or\nseparate acquisition of target data. This is achieved based on the optimal\ntransport driven cycle-consistent generative adversarial network that learns\nfrom an unpaired matching between high-resolution 2D images in lateral image\nplane and low-resolution 2D images in the other planes.

In this paper we provide an\noverview of technologies that support building trustworthy machine learning\nsystems, i.e., systems whose properties justify that people place trust in\nthem.

This paper proposes\nTopology Adaptive Edge Dropping (TADropEdge) method as an adaptive data\naugmentation technique to improve generalization performance and learn robust\nGNN models. We start by explicitly analyzing how random edge dropping increases\nthe data diversity during training, while indicating i.i.d. edge dropping does\nnot account for graph structural information and could result in noisy\naugmented data degrading performance. To overcome this issue, we consider graph\nconnectivity as the key property that captures graph topology. TADropEdge\nincorporates this factor into random edge dropping such that the edge-dropped\nsubgraphs maintain similar topology as the underlying graph, yielding more\nsatisfactory data augmentation. In particular, TADropEdge first leverages the\ngraph spectrum to assign proper weights to graph edges, which represent their\ncriticality for establishing the graph connectivity. It then normalizes the\nedge weights and drops graph edges adaptively based on their normalized\nweights. Besides improving generalization performance, TADropEdge reduces\nvariance for efficient training and can be applied as a generic method modular\nto different GNN models.

While several cross domain\nsequential recommendation models have been proposed to leverage information\nfrom a source domain to improve CTR predictions in a target domain, they did\nnot take into account bidirectional latent relations of user preferences across\nsource-target domain pairs. As such, they cannot provide enhanced cross-domain\nCTR predictions for both domains simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach to cross-domain sequential recommendations based on the dual\nlearning mechanism that simultaneously transfers information between two\nrelated domains in an iterative manner until the learning process stabilizes.\nIn particular, the proposed Dual Attentive Sequential Learning (DASL) model\nconsists of two novel components Dual Embedding and Dual Attention, which\njointly establish the two-stage learning process: we first construct dual\nlatent embeddings that extract user preferences in both domains simultaneously,\nand subsequently provide cross-domain recommendations by matching the extracted\nlatent embeddings with candidate items through dual-attention learning\nmechanism. We conduct extensive offline experiments on three real-world\ndatasets to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model, which\nsignificantly and consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines\nacross all experimental settings. We also conduct an online A/B test at a major\nvideo streaming platform Alibaba-Youku, where our proposed model significantly\nimproves business performance over the latest production system in the company.",

          "description": "As an in situ combustion diagnostic tool, Tunable Diode Laser Absorption\nSpectroscopy (TDLAS) tomography has been widely used for imaging of\ntwo-dimensional temperature distributions in reactive flows.

In practice, flame in the RoI that requires to be reconstructed with\ngood spatial resolution is commonly surrounded by low-temperature background.\nAlthough the background is not of high interest, spectroscopic absorption still\nexists due to heat dissipation and gas convection. Therefore, we propose a\nPseudo-Inversed CNN (PI-CNN) for hierarchical temperature imaging that (a) uses\nefficiently the training and learning resources for temperature imaging in the\nRoI with good spatial resolution, and (b) reconstructs the less spatially\nresolved background temperature by adequately addressing the integrity of the\nspectroscopic absorption model. In comparison with the traditional CNN, the\nnewly introduced pseudo inversion of the RoI sensitivity matrix is more\npenetrating for revealing the inherent correlation between the projection data\nand the RoI to be reconstructed, thus prioritising the temperature imaging in\nthe RoI with high accuracy and high computational efficiency.

The agents need not observe the opponent's actions or\npayoffs, possibly being even oblivious to the presence of the opponent, nor be\naware of the zero-sum structure of the underlying game, a setting also referred\nto as radically uncoupled in the literature of learning in games. In this\npaper, we develop for the first time a radically uncoupled Q-learning dynamics\nthat is both rational and convergent: the learning dynamics converges to the\nbest response to the opponent's strategy when the opponent follows an\nasymptotically stationary strategy; the value function estimates converge to\nthe payoffs at a Nash equilibrium when both agents adopt the dynamics. The key\nchallenge in this decentralized setting is the non-stationarity of the learning\nenvironment from an agent's perspective, since both her own payoffs and the\nsystem evolution depend on the actions of other agents, and each agent adapts\ntheir policies simultaneously and independently.

To this end, this paper first presents a unified GNN sparsification\n(UGS) framework that simultaneously prunes the graph adjacency matrix and the\nmodel weights, for effectively accelerating GNN inference on large-scale\ngraphs.

          "description": "Energy-Based Models (EBMs) present a flexible and appealing way to represent\nuncertainty. Despite recent advances, training EBMs on high-dimensional data\nremains a challenging problem as the state-of-the-art approaches are costly,\nunstable, and require considerable tuning and domain expertise to apply\nsuccessfully. In this work, we present a simple method for training EBMs at\nscale which uses an entropy-regularized generator to amortize the MCMC sampling\ntypically used in EBM training. We improve upon prior MCMC-based entropy\nregularization methods with a fast variational approximation. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach by using it to train tractable likelihood\nmodels. Next, we apply our estimator to the recently proposed Joint Energy\nModel (JEM), where we match the original performance with faster and stable\ntraining. This allows us to extend JEM models to semi-supervised classification\non tabular data from a variety of continuous domains.",

          "description": "Networks analysis has been commonly used to study the interactions between\nunits of complex systems. One problem of particular interest is learning the\nnetwork's underlying connection pattern given a single and noisy instantiation.\nWhile many methods have been proposed to address this problem in recent years,\nthey usually assume that the true model belongs to a known class, which is not\nverifiable in most real-world applications. Consequently, network modeling\nbased on these methods either suffers from model misspecification or relies on\nadditional model selection procedures that are not well understood in theory\nand can potentially be unstable in practice. To address this difficulty, we\npropose a mixing strategy that leverages available arbitrary models to improve\ntheir individual performances. The proposed method is computationally efficient\nand almost tuning-free; thus, it can be used as an off-the-shelf method for\nnetwork modeling. We show that the proposed method performs equally well as the\noracle estimate when the true model is included as individual candidates. More\nimportantly, the method remains robust and outperforms all current estimates\neven when the models are misspecified. Extensive simulation examples are used\nto verify the advantage of the proposed mixing method. Evaluation of link\nprediction performance on 385 real-world networks from six domains also\ndemonstrates the universal competitiveness of the mixing method across multiple\ndomains.",

For\nneural networks, however, model capacity can also be increased through depth,\nyet understanding the impact of increasing depth on test risk remains an open\nquestion. In this work, we demonstrate that the test risk of over-parameterized\nconvolutional networks is a U-shaped curve (i.e. monotonically decreasing, then\nincreasing) with increasing depth. We first provide empirical evidence for this\nphenomenon via image classification experiments using both ResNets and the\nconvolutional neural tangent kernel (CNTK). We then present a novel linear\nregression framework for characterizing the impact of depth on test risk, and\nshow that increasing depth leads to a U-shaped test risk for the linear CNTK.\nIn particular, we prove that the linear CNTK corresponds to a depth-dependent\nlinear transformation on the original space and characterize properties of this\ntransformation. We then analyze over-parameterized linear regression under\narbitrary linear transformations and, in simplified settings, provably identify\nthe depths which minimize each of the bias and variance terms of the test risk.",

The recent transformer\narchitecture has demonstrated its effectiveness for achieving excellent\nperformance on a series of computer vision tasks. However, similar to that of\nconvolutional neural networks, the huge computational cost of vision\ntransformers is still a severe issue. Considering that the attention mechanism\naggregates different patches layer-by-layer, we present a novel patch slimming\napproach that discards useless patches in a top-down paradigm. We first\nidentify the effective patches in the last layer and then use them to guide the\npatch selection process of previous layers. For each layer, the impact of a\npatch on the final output feature is approximated and patches with less impact\nwill be removed. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nthe proposed method can significantly reduce the computational costs of vision\ntransformers without affecting their performances.

Recent works show that graph-based\nmethods, usually constructing a document-level graph that captures\ndocument-aware interactions, can obtain useful entity representations thus\nhelping tackle document-level RE. These methods either focus more on the entire\ngraph, or pay more attention to a part of the graph, e.g., paths between the\ntarget entity pair. However, we find that document-level RE may benefit from\nfocusing on both of them simultaneously. Therefore, to obtain more\ncomprehensive entity representations, we propose the Coarse-to-Fine Entity\nRepresentation model (CFER) that adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy involving two\nphases. First, CFER uses graph neural networks to integrate global information\nin the entire graph at a coarse level. Next, CFER utilizes the global\ninformation as a guidance to selectively aggregate path information between the\ntarget entity pair at a fine level. In classification, we combine the entity\nrepresentations from both two levels into more comprehensive representations\nfor relation extraction.

          "description": "The infection of respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) starts with\nthe upper respiratory tract and as the virus grows, the infection can progress\nto lungs and develop pneumonia. The conventional way of COVID-19 diagnosis is\nreverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is less\nsensitive during early stages; especially if the patient is asymptomatic, which\nmay further cause more severe pneumonia. In this context, several deep learning\nmodels have been proposed to identify pulmonary infections using publicly\navailable chest X-ray (CXR) image datasets for early diagnosis, better\ntreatment and quick cure. In these datasets, presence of less number of\nCOVID-19 positive samples compared to other classes (normal, pneumonia and\nTuberculosis) raises the challenge for unbiased learning of deep learning\nmodels. All deep learning models opted class balancing techniques to solve this\nissue; which however should be avoided in any medical diagnosis process.\nMoreover, the deep learning models are also data hungry and need massive\ncomputation resources. Therefore for quicker diagnosis, this research proposes\na novel pinball loss function based one-class support vector machine\n(PB-OCSVM), that can work in presence of limited COVID-19 positive CXR samples\nwith objectives to maximize the learning efficiency and to minimize the false\npredictions. The performance of the proposed model is compared with\nconventional OCSVM and existing deep learning models, and the experimental\nresults prove that the proposed model outperformed over state-of-the-art\nmethods. To validate the robustness of the proposed model, experiments are also\nperformed with noisy CXR images and UCI benchmark datasets.",

          "description": "Current federated learning algorithms take tens of communication rounds\ntransmitting unwieldy model weights under ideal circumstances and hundreds when\ndata is poorly distributed. Inspired by recent work on dataset distillation and\ndistributed one-shot learning, we propose Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning\n(DOSFL) to significantly reduce the communication cost while achieving\ncomparable performance. In just one round, each client distills their private\ndataset, sends the synthetic data (e.g. images or sentences) to the server, and\ncollectively trains a global model. The distilled data look like noise and are\nonly useful to the specific model weights, i.e., become useless after the model\nupdates. With this weight-less and gradient-less design, the total\ncommunication cost of DOSFL is up to three orders of magnitude less than FedAvg\nwhile preserving between 93% to 99% performance of a centralized counterpart.\nAfterwards, clients could switch to traditional methods such as FedAvg to\nfinetune the last few percent to fit personalized local models with local\ndatasets. Through comprehensive experiments, we show the accuracy and\ncommunication performance of DOSFL on both vision and language tasks with\ndifferent models including CNN, LSTM, Transformer, etc. We demonstrate that an\neavesdropping attacker cannot properly train a good model using the leaked\ndistilled data, without knowing the initial model weights.

Based on the so-called tensor normal (TN) distribution,\nwe propose and analyze a brand new approximate natural gradient method, Tensor\nNormal Training (TNT), which like Shampoo, only requires knowledge on the shape\nof the training parameters.

Moreover, the assumption that the sampling-based (tensor) gradient\nfollows a TN distribution, ensures that its covariance has a Kronecker\nseparable structure, which leads to a tractable approximation to the Fisher\nmatrix. Consequently, TNT's memory requirements and per-iteration computational\ncosts are only slightly higher than those for first-order methods.

Thus, the Euclidean structure of electrodes might not adequately\nreflect the interaction between signals. To fill the gap, a novel deep learning\nframework based on the graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) was presented\nto enhance the decoding performance of raw EEG signals during different types\nof motor imagery (MI) tasks while cooperating with the functional topological\nrelationship of electrodes. Based on the absolute Pearson's matrix of overall\nsignals, the graph Laplacian of EEG electrodes was built up.

          "description": "The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a recent machine learning algorithm with several\ndistinct properties, such as interpretability, simplicity, and\nhardware-friendliness. Although numerous empirical evaluations report on its\nperformance, the mathematical analysis of its convergence is still open. In\nthis article, we analyze the convergence of the TM with only one clause\ninvolved for classification. More specifically, we examine two basic logical\noperators, namely, the \"IDENTITY\"- and \"NOT\" operators. Our analysis reveals\nthat the TM, with just one clause, can converge correctly to the intended\nlogical operator, learning from training data over an infinite time horizon.\nBesides, it can capture arbitrarily rare patterns and select the most accurate\none when two candidate patterns are incompatible, by configuring a granularity\nparameter. The analysis of the convergence of the two basic operators lays the\nfoundation for analyzing other logical operators. These analyses altogether,\nfrom a mathematical perspective, provide new insights on why TMs have obtained\nstate-of-the-art performance on several pattern recognition problems.",

          "description": "Pruning is a model compression method that removes redundant parameters in\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) while maintaining accuracy. Most available filter\npruning methods require complex treatments such as iterative pruning, features\nstatistics/ranking, or additional optimization designs in the training process.\nIn this paper, we propose a simple and effective regularization strategy from a\nnew perspective of evolution of features, which we call feature flow\nregularization (FFR), for improving structured sparsity and filter pruning in\nDNNs. Specifically, FFR imposes controls on the gradient and curvature of\nfeature flow along the neural network, which implicitly increases the sparsity\nof the parameters. The principle behind FFR is that coherent and smooth\nevolution of features will lead to an efficient network that avoids redundant\nparameters. The high structured sparsity obtained from FFR enables us to prune\nfilters effectively. Experiments with VGGNets, ResNets on CIFAR-10/100, and\nTiny ImageNet datasets demonstrate that FFR can significantly improve both\nunstructured and structured sparsity. Our pruning results in terms of reduction\nof parameters and FLOPs are comparable to or even better than those of\nstate-of-the-art pruning methods.",

          "description": "As multi-task models gain popularity in a wider range of machine learning\napplications, it is becoming increasingly important for practitioners to\nunderstand the fairness implications associated with those models. Most\nexisting fairness literature focuses on learning a single task more fairly,\nwhile how ML fairness interacts with multiple tasks in the joint learning\nsetting is largely under-explored. In this paper, we are concerned with how\ngroup fairness (e.g., equal opportunity, equalized odds) as an ML fairness\nconcept plays out in the multi-task scenario. In multi-task learning, several\ntasks are learned jointly to exploit task correlations for a more efficient\ninductive transfer. This presents a multi-dimensional Pareto frontier on (1)\nthe trade-off between group fairness and accuracy with respect to each task, as\nwell as (2) the trade-offs across multiple tasks. We aim to provide a deeper\nunderstanding on how group fairness interacts with accuracy in multi-task\nlearning, and we show that traditional approaches that mainly focus on\noptimizing the Pareto frontier of multi-task accuracy might not perform well on\nfairness goals. We propose a new set of metrics to better capture the\nmulti-dimensional Pareto frontier of fairness-accuracy trade-offs uniquely\npresented in a multi-task learning setting. We further propose a\nMulti-Task-Aware Fairness (MTA-F) approach to improve fairness in multi-task\nlearning.

We design an autonomous optimization framework to discover\nthe experimental conditions within fluid systems that generate discrete and\nuniform droplet patterns. Generating discrete and uniform droplets requires\nhigh-precision control over the experimental conditions of a fluid system.\nFluid stream instabilities, such as Rayleigh-Plateau instability and capillary\ninstability, drive the separation of a flow into individual droplets.

In particular, we find that the attacker\ncan either prevent the model from learning, or poison it to learn behaviours\nspecified by the attacker.

Pure Machine Learning (ML) approaches often\nfail in the small sample regime and cannot provide actionable insights beyond\npredictions.

The application we consider is predicting the\nprogression of disease under medications, where a plethora of domain knowledge\nis available from pharmacology. Pharmacological models describe the dynamics of\ncarefully-chosen medically meaningful variables in terms of systems of Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODEs). However, these models only describe a limited\ncollection of variables, and these variables are often not observable in\nclinical environments. To close this gap, we propose the latent hybridisation\nmodel (LHM) that integrates a system of expert-designed ODEs with\nmachine-learned Neural ODEs to fully describe the dynamics of the system and to\nlink the expert and latent variables to observable quantities. We evaluated LHM\non synthetic data as well as real-world intensive care data of COVID-19\npatients.

          "description": "Sequences of events including infectious disease outbreaks, social network\nactivities, and crimes are ubiquitous and the data on such events carry\nessential information about the underlying diffusion processes between\ncommunities (e.g., regions, online user groups). Modeling diffusion processes\nand predicting future events are crucial in many applications including\nepidemic control, viral marketing, and predictive policing. Hawkes processes\noffer a central tool for modeling the diffusion processes, in which the\ninfluence from the past events is described by the triggering kernel. However,\nthe triggering kernel parameters, which govern how each community is influenced\nby the past events, are assumed to be static over time. In the real world, the\ndiffusion processes depend not only on the influences from the past, but also\nthe current (time-evolving) states of the communities, e.g., people's awareness\nof the disease and people's current interests. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Hawkes process model that is able to capture the underlying dynamics of\ncommunity states behind the diffusion processes and predict the occurrences of\nevents based on the dynamics. Specifically, we model the latent dynamic\nfunction that encodes these hidden dynamics by a mixture of neural networks.\nThen we design the triggering kernel using the latent dynamic function and its\nintegral. The proposed method, termed DHP (Dynamic Hawkes Processes), offers a\nflexible way to learn complex representations of the time-evolving communities'\nstates, while at the same time it allows to computing the exact likelihood,\nwhich makes parameter learning tractable.

          "description": "This paper presents Gem, a model-agnostic approach for providing\ninterpretable explanations for any GNNs on various graph learning tasks.\nSpecifically, we formulate the problem of providing explanations for the\ndecisions of GNNs as a causal learning task. Then we train a causal explanation\nmodel equipped with a loss function based on Granger causality. Different from\nexisting explainers for GNNs, Gem explains GNNs on graph-structured data from a\ncausal perspective. It has better generalization ability as it has no\nrequirements on the internal structure of the GNNs or prior knowledge on the\ngraph learning tasks. In addition, Gem, once trained, can be used to explain\nthe target GNN very quickly. Our theoretical analysis shows that several recent\nexplainers fall into a unified framework of additive feature attribution\nmethods. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that\nGem achieves a relative increase of the explanation accuracy by up to $30\\%$\nand speeds up the explanation process by up to $110\\times$ as compared to its\nstate-of-the-art alternatives.",

          "description": "Most existing Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols for\nprivacy-preserving training of decision trees over distributed data assume that\nthe features are categorical. In real-life applications, features are often\nnumerical. The standard ``in the clear'' algorithm to grow decision trees on\ndata with continuous values requires sorting of training examples for each\nfeature in the quest for an optimal cut-point in the range of feature values in\neach node. Sorting is an expensive operation in MPC, hence finding secure\nprotocols that avoid such an expensive step is a relevant problem in\nprivacy-preserving machine learning. In this paper we propose three more\nefficient alternatives for secure training of decision tree based models on\ndata with continuous features, namely: (1) secure discretization of the data,\nfollowed by secure training of a decision tree over the discretized data; (2)\nsecure discretization of the data, followed by secure training of a random\nforest over the discretized data; and (3) secure training of extremely\nrandomized trees (``extra-trees'') on the original data. Approaches (2) and (3)\nboth involve randomizing feature choices. In addition, in approach (3)\ncut-points are chosen randomly as well, thereby alleviating the need to sort or\nto discretize the data up front. We implemented all proposed solutions in the\nsemi-honest setting with additive secret sharing based MPC. In addition to\nmathematically proving that all proposed approaches are correct and secure, we\nexperimentally evaluated and compared them in terms of classification accuracy\nand runtime. We privately train tree ensembles over data sets with 1000s of\ninstances or features in a few minutes, with accuracies that are at par with\nthose obtained in the clear. This makes our solution orders of magnitude more\nefficient than the existing approaches, which are based on oblivious sorting.",

We\npresent D-Cliques, a novel topology that reduces gradient bias by grouping\nnodes in interconnected cliques such that the local joint distribution in a\nclique is representative of the global class distribution. We also show how to\nadapt the updates of decentralized SGD to obtain unbiased gradients and\nimplement an effective momentum with D-Cliques. Our empirical evaluation on\nMNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrates that our approach provides similar convergence\nspeed as a fully-connected topology with a significant reduction in the number\nof edges and messages. In a 1000-node topology, D-Cliques requires 98% less\nedges and 96% less total messages, with further possible gains using a\nsmall-world topology across cliques.",

          "description": "Decision-based attacks (DBA), wherein attackers perturb inputs to spoof\nlearning algorithms by observing solely the output labels, are a type of severe\nadversarial attacks against Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) requiring minimal\nknowledge of attackers. State-of-the-art DBA attacks relying on zeroth-order\ngradient estimation require an excessive number of queries. Recently, Bayesian\noptimization (BO) has shown promising in reducing the number of queries in\nscore-based attacks (SBA), in which attackers need to observe real-valued\nprobability scores as outputs. However, extending BO to the setting of DBA is\nnontrivial because in DBA only output labels instead of real-valued scores, as\nneeded by BO, are available to attackers. In this paper, we close this gap by\nproposing an efficient DBA attack, namely BO-DBA. Different from existing\napproaches, BO-DBA generates adversarial examples by searching so-called\n\\emph{directions of perturbations}. It then formulates the problem as a BO\nproblem that minimizes the real-valued distortion of perturbations. With the\noptimized perturbation generation process, BO-DBA converges much faster than\nthe state-of-the-art DBA techniques. Experimental results on pre-trained\nImageNet classifiers show that BO-DBA converges within 200 queries while the\nstate-of-the-art DBA techniques need over 15,000 queries to achieve the same\nlevel of perturbation distortion. BO-DBA also shows similar attack success\nrates even as compared to BO-based SBA attacks but with less distortion.",

          "description": "Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) has been challenging for a long\ntime due to the difficulty of computing precisely the log-likelihood gradient.\nOver the past decades, many works have proposed more or less successful\ntraining recipes but without studying the crucial quantity of the problem: the\nmixing time i.e. the number of Monte Carlo iterations needed to sample new\nconfigurations from a model. In this work, we show that this mixing time plays\na crucial role in the dynamics and stability of the trained model, and that\nRBMs operate in two well-defined regimes, namely equilibrium and\nout-of-equilibrium, depending on the interplay between this mixing time of the\nmodel and the number of steps, $k$, used to approximate the gradient. We\nfurther show empirically that this mixing time increases with the learning,\nwhich often implies a transition from one regime to another as soon as $k$\nbecomes smaller than this time. In particular, we show that using the popular\n$k$ (persistent) contrastive divergence approaches, with $k$ small, the\ndynamics of the learned model are extremely slow and often dominated by strong\nout-of-equilibrium effects. On the contrary, RBMs trained in equilibrium\ndisplay faster dynamics, and a smooth convergence to dataset-like\nconfigurations during the sampling. Finally we discuss how to exploit in\npractice both regimes depending on the task one aims to fulfill: (i) short $k$s\ncan be used to generate convincing samples in short times, (ii) large $k$ (or\nincreasingly large) must be used to learn the correct equilibrium distribution\nof the RBM.",

This allows the proposed framework to adapt\nquickly to the highly dynamic environment, to generalize robustly to recurrent\npatterns and to drive implicit coordinations among the population of managed\nvehicles. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show considerably\nimprovements over other recently proposed methods on both tasks.

          "description": "We introduce ES-ENAS, a simple yet general evolutionary joint optimization\nprocedure by combining continuous optimization via Evolutionary Strategies (ES)\nand combinatorial optimization via Efficient NAS (ENAS) in a highly scalable\nand intuitive way. Our main insight is noticing that ES is already a highly\ndistributed algorithm involving hundreds of forward passes which can not only\nbe used for training neural network weights, but also for jointly training a\nNAS controller, both in a blackbox fashion. By doing so, we also bridge the gap\nfrom NAS research in supervised learning settings to the reinforcement learning\nscenario through this relatively simple marriage between two different yet\ncommon lines of research. We demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our\nmethod over a large search space by training highly combinatorial neural\nnetwork architectures for RL problems in continuous control, via edge pruning\nand quantization. We also incorporate a wide variety of popular techniques from\nmodern NAS literature including multiobjective optimization along with various\ncontroller methods, to showcase their promise in the RL field and discuss\npossible extensions.",

          "description": "We propose SmartON, a batteryless system that learns to wake up proactively\nat the right moment in order to detect events of interest. It does so by\nadapting the duty cycle to match the distribution of event arrival times under\nthe constraints of harvested energy. While existing energy harvesting systems\neither wake up periodically at a fixed rate to sense and process the data, or\nwake up only in accordance with the availability of the energy source, SmartON\nemploys a three-phase learning framework to learn the energy harvesting pattern\nas well as the pattern of events at run-time, and uses that knowledge to wake\nitself up when events are most likely to occur. The three-phase learning\nframework enables rapid adaptation to environmental changes in both short and\nlong terms. Being able to remain asleep more often than a CTID\n(charging-then-immediate-discharging) wake-up system and adapt to the event\npattern, SmartON is able to reduce energy waste, increase energy efficiency,\nand capture more events. To realize SmartON we have developed a dedicated\nhardware platform whose power management module activates capacitors on-the-fly\nto dynamically increase its storage capacitance. We conduct both\nsimulation-driven and real-system experiments to demonstrate that SmartON\ncaptures 1X--7X more events and is 8X--17X more energy-efficient than a CTID\nsystem.",

While\nseveral methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, there is limited\nwork explaining why these methods work well. This paper has the goal of better\nexplaining a popularly used technique for avoiding catastrophic forgetting:\nquadratic regularization. We show that quadratic regularizers prevent\nforgetting of past tasks by interpolating current and previous values of model\nparameters at every training iteration. Over multiple training iterations, this\ninterpolation operation reduces the learning rates of more important model\nparameters, thereby minimizing their movement. Our analysis also reveals two\ndrawbacks of quadratic regularization: (a) dependence of parameter\ninterpolation on training hyperparameters, which often leads to training\ninstability and (b) assignment of lower importance to deeper layers, which are\ngenerally the place forgetting occurs in DNNs. Via a simple modification to the\norder of operations, we show these drawbacks can be easily avoided, resulting\nin 6.2% higher average accuracy at 4.5% lower average forgetting.

          "description": "Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are making significant progress in many\nresearch areas where decision-making needs to be accompanied by uncertainty\nestimation. Being able to quantify uncertainty while making decisions is\nessential for understanding when the model is over-/under-confident, and hence\nBNNs are attracting interest in safety-critical applications, such as\nautonomous driving, healthcare, and robotics. Nevertheless, BNNs have not been\nas widely used in industrial practice, mainly because of their increased memory\nand compute costs. In this work, we investigate quantisation of BNNs by\ncompressing 32-bit floating-point weights and activations to their integer\ncounterparts, that has already been successful in reducing the compute demand\nin standard pointwise neural networks. We study three types of quantised BNNs,\nwe evaluate them under a wide range of different settings, and we empirically\ndemonstrate that a uniform quantisation scheme applied to BNNs does not\nsubstantially decrease their quality of uncertainty estimation.",

The vast majority of the\nstate-of-the-art in detecting misinformation is fully supervised, requiring a\nlarge number of high-quality human annotations. However, the availability of\nsuch annotations cannot be taken for granted, since it is very costly,\ntime-consuming, and challenging to do so in a way that keeps up with the\nproliferation of misinformation. In this work, we are interested in exploring\nscenarios where the number of annotations is limited. In such scenarios, we\ninvestigate how tapping on a diverse number of resources that characterize a\nnews article, henceforth referred to as \"aspects\" can compensate for the lack\nof labels. In particular, our contributions in this paper are twofold: 1) We\npropose the use of three different aspects: article content, context of social\nsharing behaviors, and host website/domain features, and 2) We introduce a\nprincipled tensor based embedding framework that combines all those aspects\neffectively.

More precisely,\nif $n$ is the number of training examples, $d$ is the input dimension, and $k$\nis the number of hidden neurons in a two-layer neural network, we prove for a\nlarge class of activation functions that, if the model memorizes even a\nfraction of the training, then its Sobolev-seminorm is lower-bounded by (i)\n$\\sqrt{n}$ in case of infinite-width random features (RF) or neural tangent\nkernel (NTK) with $d \\gtrsim n$; (ii) $\\sqrt{n}$ in case of finite-width RF\nwith proportionate scaling of $d$ and $k$; and (iii) $\\sqrt{n/k}$ in case of\nfinite-width NTK with proportionate scaling of $d$ and $k$.

With imperfect\ntraining, the sub-optimality is proportional to the unsupervised approximation\nerror. The FB representation learns long-range relationships between states and\nactions, via a predictive occupancy map, without having to synthesize states as\nin model-based approaches.\n\nThis is a step towards learning controllable agents in arbitrary black-box\nstochastic environments. This approach compares well to goal-oriented RL\nalgorithms on discrete and continuous mazes, pixel-based MsPacman, and the\nFetchReach virtual robot arm. We also illustrate how the agent can immediately\nadapt to new tasks beyond goal-oriented RL.",

          "description": "Deep candidate generation (DCG) that narrows down the collection of relevant\nitems from billions to hundreds via representation learning has become\nprevalent in industrial recommender systems. Standard approaches approximate\nmaximum likelihood estimation (MLE) through sampling for better scalability and\naddress the problem of DCG in a way similar to language modeling. However, live\nrecommender systems face severe exposure bias and have a vocabulary several\norders of magnitude larger than that of natural language, implying that MLE\nwill preserve and even exacerbate the exposure bias in the long run in order to\nfaithfully fit the observed samples. In this paper, we theoretically prove that\na popular choice of contrastive loss is equivalent to reducing the exposure\nbias via inverse propensity weighting, which provides a new perspective for\nunderstanding the effectiveness of contrastive learning. Based on the\ntheoretical discovery, we design CLRec, a contrastive learning method to\nimprove DCG in terms of fairness, effectiveness and efficiency in recommender\nsystems with extremely large candidate size. We further improve upon CLRec and\npropose Multi-CLRec, for accurate multi-intention aware bias reduction. Our\nmethods have been successfully deployed in Taobao, where at least four-month\nonline A/B tests and offline analyses demonstrate its substantial improvements,\nincluding a dramatic reduction in the Matthew effect.",

In this article, we propose a simple\nplug-in kernel ridge regression (KRR) estimator in nonparametric regression\nwith random design that is broadly applicable for multi-dimensional support and\narbitrary mixed-partial derivatives. We provide a non-asymptotic analysis to\nstudy the behavior of the proposed estimator, leading to two error bounds for a\ngeneral class of kernels under the strong $L_\\infty$ norm. In a concrete\nexample specialized to kernels with polynomially decaying eigenvalues, the\nproposed estimator recovers the minimax optimal rate up to a logarithmic factor\nfor estimating derivatives of functions in H\\\"older class. Interestingly, the\nproposed estimator achieves the optimal rate of convergence with the same\nchoice of tuning parameter for any order of derivatives. Hence, the proposed\nestimator enjoys a remarkable \\textit{plug-in property} for derivatives in that\nit automatically adapts to the order of derivatives to be estimated, enabling\neasy tuning in practice.

          "description": "Counterfactual instances are a powerful tool to obtain valuable insights into\nautomated decision processes, describing the necessary minimal changes in the\ninput space to alter the prediction towards a desired target. Most previous\napproaches require a separate, computationally expensive optimization procedure\nper instance, making them impractical for both large amounts of data and\nhigh-dimensional data. Moreover, these methods are often restricted to certain\nsubclasses of machine learning models (e.g. differentiable or tree-based\nmodels). In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach that\ntransforms the optimization procedure into an end-to-end learnable process,\nallowing us to generate batches of counterfactual instances in a single forward\npass. Our experiments on real-world data show that our method i) is\nmodel-agnostic (does not assume differentiability), relying only on feedback\nfrom model predictions; ii) allows for generating target-conditional\ncounterfactual instances; iii) allows for flexible feature range constraints\nfor numerical and categorical attributes, including the immutability of\nprotected features (e.g. gender, race); iv) is easily extended to other data\nmodalities such as images.",

          "description": "We present a real-time stamp classifier of astronomical events for the ALeRCE\n(Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events) broker. The\nclassifier is based on a convolutional neural network, trained on alerts\ningested from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Using only the\n\\textit{science, reference} and \\textit{difference} images of the first\ndetection as inputs, along with the metadata of the alert as features, the\nclassifier is able to correctly classify alerts from active galactic nuclei,\nsupernovae (SNe), variable stars, asteroids and bogus classes, with high\naccuracy ($\\sim$94\\%) in a balanced test set. In order to find and analyze SN\ncandidates selected by our classifier from the ZTF alert stream, we designed\nand deployed a visualization tool called SN Hunter, where relevant information\nabout each possible SN is displayed for the experts to choose among candidates\nto report to the Transient Name Server database. From June 26th 2019 to\nFebruary 28th 2021, we have reported 6846 SN candidates to date (11.8\ncandidates per day on average), of which 971 have been confirmed\nspectroscopically. Our ability to report objects using only a single detection\nmeans that 70\\% of the reported SNe occurred within one day after the first\ndetection. ALeRCE has only reported candidates not otherwise detected or\nselected by other groups, therefore adding new early transients to the bulk of\nobjects available for early follow-up.

Then, we\npresent an LRTD-based atlas construction method to generate tumor-free liver\natlases that mitigates the performance degradation of liver segmentation due to\nthe presence of tumors. Finally, we introduce an LRTD-based MAS algorithm to\nderive patient-specific liver atlases for each test image, and to achieve\naccurate pairwise image registration and label propagation. Extensive\nexperiments on three public databases of pathological liver cases validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.

          "description": "Attention mechanisms are developing into a viable alternative to\nconvolutional layers as elementary building block of NNs. Their main advantage\nis that they are not restricted to capture local dependencies in the input, but\ncan draw arbitrary connections. This unprecedented capability coincides with\nthe long-standing problem of modeling global atomic interactions in molecular\nforce fields and other many-body problems. In its original formulation,\nhowever, attention is not applicable to the continuous domains in which the\natoms live. For this purpose we propose a variant to describe geometric\nrelations for arbitrary atomic configurations in Euclidean space that also\nrespects all relevant physical symmetries. We furthermore demonstrate, how the\nsuccessive application of our learned attention matrices effectively translates\nthe molecular geometry into a set of individual atomic contributions\non-the-fly.",

          "description": "We study the problem of estimating a rank-$1$ signal in the presence of\nrotationally invariant noise-a class of perturbations more general than\nGaussian noise. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) provides a natural\nestimator, and sharp results on its performance have been obtained in the\nhigh-dimensional regime. Recently, an Approximate Message Passing (AMP)\nalgorithm has been proposed as an alternative estimator with the potential to\nimprove the accuracy of PCA. However, the existing analysis of AMP requires an\ninitialization that is both correlated with the signal and independent of the\nnoise, which is often unrealistic in practice. In this work, we combine the two\nmethods, and propose to initialize AMP with PCA. Our main result is a rigorous\nasymptotic characterization of the performance of this estimator. Both the AMP\nalgorithm and its analysis differ from those previously derived in the Gaussian\nsetting: at every iteration, our AMP algorithm requires a specific term to\naccount for PCA initialization, while in the Gaussian case, PCA initialization\naffects only the first iteration of AMP. The proof is based on a two-phase\nartificial AMP that first approximates the PCA estimator and then mimics the\ntrue AMP. Our numerical simulations show an excellent agreement between AMP\nresults and theoretical predictions, and suggest an interesting open direction\non achieving Bayes-optimal performance.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of estimating a linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical\nsystem from a single trajectory via streaming algorithms, which is encountered\nin several applications including reinforcement learning (RL) and time-series\nanalysis. While the LTI system estimation problem is well-studied in the {\\em\noffline} setting, the practically important streaming/online setting has\nreceived little attention. Standard streaming methods like stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) are unlikely to work since streaming points can be highly\ncorrelated. In this work, we propose a novel streaming algorithm, SGD with\nReverse Experience Replay ($\\mathsf{SGD}-\\mathsf{RER}$), that is inspired by\nthe experience replay (ER) technique popular in the RL literature.\n$\\mathsf{SGD}-\\mathsf{RER}$ divides data into small buffers and runs SGD\nbackwards on the data stored in the individual buffers. We show that this\nalgorithm exactly deconstructs the dependency structure and obtains information\ntheoretically optimal guarantees for both parameter error and prediction error.\nThus, we provide the first -- to the best of our knowledge -- optimal SGD-style\nalgorithm for the classical problem of linear system identification with a\nfirst order oracle. Furthermore, $\\mathsf{SGD}-\\mathsf{RER}$ can be applied to\nmore general settings like sparse LTI identification with known sparsity\npattern, and non-linear dynamical systems.

          "description": "The prevalence of employing attention mechanisms has brought along concerns\non the interpretability of attention distributions. Although it provides\ninsights about how a model is operating, utilizing attention as the explanation\nof model predictions is still highly dubious. The community is still seeking\nmore interpretable strategies for better identifying local active regions that\ncontribute the most to the final decision. To improve the interpretability of\nexisting attention models, we propose a novel Bilinear Representative\nNon-Parametric Attention (BR-NPA) strategy that captures the task-relevant\nhuman-interpretable information. The target model is first distilled to have\nhigher-resolution intermediate feature maps. From which, representative\nfeatures are then grouped based on local pairwise feature similarity, to\nproduce finer-grained, more precise attention maps highlighting task-relevant\nparts of the input. The obtained attention maps are ranked according to the\n`active level' of the compound feature, which provides information regarding\nthe important level of the highlighted regions. The proposed model can be\neasily adapted in a wide variety of modern deep models, where classification is\ninvolved. It is also more accurate, faster, and with a smaller memory footprint\nthan usual neural attention modules. Extensive experiments showcase more\ncomprehensive visual explanations compared to the state-of-the-art\nvisualization model across multiple tasks including few-shot classification,\nperson re-identification, fine-grained image classification.

          "description": "Recent advances in deep learning have set the focus on neural networks (NNs)\nthat can successfully replace traditional numerical solvers in many\napplications, achieving impressive computing gains. One such application is\ntime domain simulation, which is indispensable for the design, analysis and\noperation of many engineering systems. Simulating dynamical systems with\nimplicit Newton-based solvers is a computationally heavy task, as it requires\nthe solution of a parameterized system of differential and algebraic equations\nat each time step. A variety of NN-based methodologies have been shown to\nsuccessfully approximate the dynamical trajectories computed by numerical time\ndomain solvers at a fraction of the time. However, so far no previous NN-based\nmodel has explicitly captured the fact that any predicted point on the time\ndomain trajectory also represents the fixed point of the numerical solver\nitself. As we show, explicitly capturing this property can lead to\nsignificantly increased NN accuracy and much smaller NN sizes. In this paper,\nwe model the Newton solver at the heart of an implicit Runge-Kutta integrator\nas a contracting map iteratively seeking this fixed point. Our primary\ncontribution is to develop a recurrent NN simulation tool, termed the\nContracting Neural-Newton Solver (CoNNS), which explicitly captures the\ncontracting nature of these Newton iterations. To build CoNNS, we train a\nfeedforward NN and mimic this contraction behavior by embedding a series of\ntraining constraints which guarantee the mapping provided by the NN satisfies\nthe Banach fixed-point theorem; thus, we are able to prove that successive\npasses through the NN are guaranteed to converge to a unique, fixed point.",

          "description": "Over the past few years, graph neural networks (GNN) and label\npropagation-based methods have made significant progress in addressing node\nclassification tasks on graphs. However, in addition to their reliance on\nelaborate architectures and algorithms, there are several key technical details\nthat are frequently overlooked, and yet nonetheless can play a vital role in\nachieving satisfactory performance. In this paper, we first summarize a series\nof existing tricks-of-the-trade, and then propose several new ones related to\nlabel usage, loss function formulation, and model design that can significantly\nimprove various GNN architectures. We empirically evaluate their impact on\nfinal node classification accuracy by conducting ablation studies and\ndemonstrate consistently-improved performance, often to an extent that\noutweighs the gains from more dramatic changes in the underlying GNN\narchitecture. Notably, many of the top-ranked models on the Open Graph\nBenchmark (OGB) leaderboard benefit from our techniques.",

          "description": "Feature selection is a prevalent data preprocessing paradigm for various\nlearning tasks. Due to the expensive cost of acquiring supervision information,\nunsupervised feature selection sparks great interests recently. However,\nexisting unsupervised feature selection algorithms do not have fairness\nconsiderations and suffer from a high risk of amplifying discrimination by\nselecting features that are over associated with protected attributes such as\ngender, race, and ethnicity. In this paper, we make an initial investigation of\nthe fairness-aware unsupervised feature selection problem and develop a\nprincipled framework, which leverages kernel alignment to find a subset of\nhigh-quality features that can best preserve the information in the original\nfeature space while being minimally correlated with protected attributes.\nSpecifically, different from the mainstream in-processing debiasing methods,\nour proposed framework can be regarded as a model-agnostic debiasing strategy\nthat eliminates biases and discrimination before downstream learning algorithms\nare involved. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat our framework achieves a good trade-off between utility maximization and\nfairness promotion.",

          "description": "Continuous, automated surveillance systems that incorporate machine learning\nmodels are becoming increasingly more common in healthcare environments. These\nmodels can capture temporally dependent changes across multiple patient\nvariables and can enhance a clinician's situational awareness by providing an\nearly warning alarm of an impending adverse event such as sepsis. However, most\ncommonly used methods, e.g., XGBoost, fail to provide an interpretable\nmechanism for understanding why a model produced a sepsis alarm at a given\ntime. The black-box nature of many models is a severe limitation as it prevents\nclinicians from independently corroborating those physiologic features that\nhave contributed to the sepsis alarm. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\ngeneralized linear model (GLM) approach to fit a Granger causal graph based on\nthe physiology of several major sepsis-associated derangements (SADs). We adopt\na recently developed stochastic monotone variational inequality-based estimator\ncoupled with forwarding feature selection to learn the graph structure from\nboth continuous and discrete-valued as well as regularly and irregularly\nsampled time series. Most importantly, we develop a non-asymptotic upper bound\non the estimation error for any monotone link function in the GLM. We conduct\nreal-data experiments and demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve\ncomparable performance to popular and powerful prediction methods such as\nXGBoost while simultaneously maintaining a high level of interpretability.",

In this work, we propose a novel neural scene\nrepresentation, Light Field Networks or LFNs, which represent both geometry and\nappearance of the underlying 3D scene in a 360-degree, four-dimensional light\nfield parameterized via a neural implicit representation. Rendering a ray from\nan LFN requires only a *single* network evaluation, as opposed to hundreds of\nevaluations per ray for ray-marching or volumetric based renderers in\n3D-structured neural scene representations. In the setting of simple scenes, we\nleverage meta-learning to learn a prior over LFNs that enables multi-view\nconsistent light field reconstruction from as little as a single image\nobservation. This results in dramatic reductions in time and memory complexity,\nand enables real-time rendering. The cost of storing a 360-degree light field\nvia an LFN is two orders of magnitude lower than conventional methods such as\nthe Lumigraph.

          "description": "Analysing whether neural language models encode linguistic information has\nbecome popular in NLP. One method of doing so, which is frequently cited to\nsupport the claim that models like BERT encode syntax, is called probing;\nprobes are small supervised models trained to extract linguistic information\nfrom another model's output. If a probe is able to predict a particular\nstructure, it is argued that the model whose output it is trained on must have\nimplicitly learnt to encode it. However, drawing a generalisation about a\nmodel's linguistic knowledge about a specific phenomena based on what a probe\nis able to learn may be problematic: in this work, we show that semantic cues\nin training data means that syntactic probes do not properly isolate syntax. We\ngenerate a new corpus of semantically nonsensical but syntactically well-formed\nJabberwocky sentences, which we use to evaluate two probes trained on normal\ndata. We train the probes on several popular language models (BERT, GPT, and\nRoBERTa), and find that in all settings they perform worse when evaluated on\nthese data, for one probe by an average of 15.4 UUAS points absolute. Although\nin most cases they still outperform the baselines, their lead is reduced\nsubstantially, e.g. by 53% in the case of BERT for one probe.

          "description": "Recently, Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update (OMWU) was proven to be\nthe first constant step-size algorithm in the online no-regret framework to\nenjoy last-iterate convergence to Nash Equilibria in the constrained zero-sum\nbimatrix case, where weights represent the probabilities of playing pure\nstrategies. We introduce the second such algorithm, \\textit{Consensus MWU}, for\nwhich we prove local convergence and show empirically that it enjoys faster and\nmore robust convergence than OMWU. Our algorithm shows the importance of a new\nobject, the \\textit{simplex Hessian}, as well as of the interaction of the game\nwith the (eigen)space of vectors summing to zero, which we believe future\nresearch can build on. As for OMWU, CMWU has convergence guarantees in the\nzero-sum case only, but Cheung and Piliouras (2020) recently showed that OMWU\nand MWU display opposite convergence properties depending on whether the game\nis zero-sum or cooperative. Inspired by this work and the recent literature on\nlearning to optimize for single functions, we extend CMWU to non zero-sum games\nby introducing a new framework for online learning in games, where the update\nrule's gradient and Hessian coefficients along a trajectory are learnt by a\nreinforcement learning policy that is conditioned on the nature of the game:\n\\textit{the game signature}. We construct the latter using a new canonical\ndecomposition of two-player games into eight components corresponding to\ncommutative projection operators, generalizing and unifying recent game\nconcepts studied in the literature. We show empirically that our new learning\npolicy is able to exploit the game signature across a wide range of game types.",

Because of its high computational complexity,\nseveral approximate GW distances have been proposed based on entropy\nregularization or on slicing, and one-dimensional GW computation. In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach for comparing two incomparable\ndistributions, that hinges on the idea of distributional slicing, embeddings,\nand on computing the closed-form Wasserstein distance between the sliced\ndistributions. We provide a theoretical analysis of this new divergence, called\ndistributional sliced embedding (DSE) discrepancy, and we show that it\npreserves several interesting properties of GW distance including\nrotation-invariance. We show that the embeddings involved in DSE can be\nefficiently learned.

          "description": "Deep neural networks have increasingly been used as an auxiliary tool in\nhealthcare applications, due to their ability to improve performance of several\ndiagnosis tasks. However, these methods are not widely adopted in clinical\nsettings due to the practical limitations in the reliability, generalizability,\nand interpretability of deep learning based systems. As a result, methods have\nbeen developed that impose additional constraints during network training to\ngain more control as well as improve interpretabilty, facilitating their\nacceptance in healthcare community. In this work, we investigate the benefit of\nusing Orthogonal Spheres (OS) constraint for classification of COVID-19 cases\nfrom chest X-ray images. The OS constraint can be written as a simple\northonormality term which is used in conjunction with the standard\ncross-entropy loss during classification network training. Previous studies\nhave demonstrated significant benefits in applying such constraints to deep\nlearning models. Our findings corroborate these observations, indicating that\nthe orthonormality loss function effectively produces improved semantic\nlocalization via GradCAM visualizations, enhanced classification performance,\nand reduced model calibration error. Our approach achieves an improvement in\naccuracy of 1.6% and 4.8% for two- and three-class classification,\nrespectively; similar results are found for models with data augmentation\napplied. In addition to these findings, our work also presents a new\napplication of the OS regularizer in healthcare, increasing the post-hoc\ninterpretability and performance of deep learning models for COVID-19\nclassification to facilitate adoption of these methods in clinical settings. We\nalso identify the limitations of our strategy that can be explored for further\nresearch in future.",

In a future world without such\nsecrecy, what decision support tools would one want to use for justified\nlending decisions? This question is timely, since the economy has dramatically\nshifted due to a pandemic, and a massive number of new loans will be necessary\nin the short term. We propose a framework for such decisions, including a\nglobally interpretable machine learning model, an interactive visualization of\nit, and several types of summaries and explanations for any given decision. The\nmachine learning model is a two-layer additive risk model, which resembles a\ntwo-layer neural network, but is decomposable into subscales. In this model,\neach node in the first (hidden) layer represents a meaningful subscale model,\nand all of the nonlinearities are transparent. Our online visualization tool\nallows exploration of this model, showing precisely how it came to its\nconclusion. We provide three types of explanations that are simpler than, but\nconsistent with, the global model: case-based reasoning explanations that use\nneighboring past cases, a set of features that were the most important for the\nmodel's prediction, and summary-explanations that provide a customized sparse\nexplanation for any particular lending decision made by the model.

          "description": "In this paper we study the problem of stochastic multi-armed bandits (MAB) in\nthe (local) differential privacy (DP/LDP) model. Unlike the previous results\nwhich need to assume bounded reward distributions, here we mainly focus on the\ncase the reward distribution of each arm only has $(1+v)$-th moment with some\n$v\\in (0, 1]$. In the first part, we study the problem in the central\n$\\epsilon$-DP model. We first provide a near-optimal result by developing a\nprivate and robust Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Then, we improve the\nresult via a private and robust version of the Successive Elimination (SE)\nalgorithm. Finally, we show that the instance-dependent regret bound of our\nimproved algorithm is optimal by showing its lower bound. In the second part of\nthe paper, we study the problem in the $\\epsilon$-LDP model. We propose an\nalgorithm which could be seen as locally private and robust version of the SE\nalgorithm, and show it could achieve (near) optimal rates for both\ninstance-dependent and instance-independent regrets. All of the above results\ncan also reveal the differences between the problem of private MAB with bounded\nrewards and heavy-tailed rewards. To achieve these (near) optimal rates, we\ndevelop several new hard instances and private robust estimators as byproducts,\nwhich might could be used to other related problems. Finally, experimental\nresults also support our theoretical analysis and show the effectiveness of our\nalgorithms.",

          "description": "Domain adaptation (DA) aims at transferring knowledge from a labeled source\ndomain to an unlabeled target domain. Though many DA theories and algorithms\nhave been proposed, most of them are tailored into classification settings and\nmay fail in regression tasks, especially in the practical keypoint detection\ntask. To tackle this difficult but significant task, we present a method of\nregressive domain adaptation (RegDA) for unsupervised keypoint detection.\nInspired by the latest theoretical work, we first utilize an adversarial\nregressor to maximize the disparity on the target domain and train a feature\ngenerator to minimize this disparity. However, due to the high dimension of the\noutput space, this regressor fails to detect samples that deviate from the\nsupport of the source. To overcome this problem, we propose two important\nideas. First, based on our observation that the probability density of the\noutput space is sparse, we introduce a spatial probability distribution to\ndescribe this sparsity and then use it to guide the learning of the adversarial\nregressor. Second, to alleviate the optimization difficulty in the\nhigh-dimensional space, we innovatively convert the minimax game in the\nadversarial training to the minimization of two opposite goals. Extensive\nexperiments show that our method brings large improvement by 8% to 11% in terms\nof PCK on different datasets.",

          "description": "Despite intense interest and considerable effort, the current generation of\nneural networks suffers a significant loss of accuracy under most practically\nrelevant privacy training regimes. One particularly challenging class of neural\nnetworks are the wide ones, such as those deployed for NLP typeahead prediction\nor recommender systems. Observing that these models share something in\ncommon--an embedding layer that reduces the dimensionality of the input--we\nfocus on developing a general approach towards training these models that takes\nadvantage of the sparsity of the gradients. More abstractly, we address the\nproblem of differentially private empirical risk minimization (ERM) for models\nthat admit sparse gradients. We demonstrate that for non-convex ERM problems,\nthe loss is logarithmically dependent on the number of parameters, in contrast\nwith polynomial dependence for the general case. Following the same intuition,\nwe propose a novel algorithm for privately training neural networks. Finally,\nwe provide an empirical study of a DP wide neural network on a real-world\ndataset, which has been rarely explored in the previous work.",

However, due to restrictions of accessibility of raw data, only\nlimited information such as local weights and local data size of each client is\nopen for quantifying the client contribution. Using data size from available\ninformation, we introduce an empirical evaluation method called Federated\nClient Contribution Evaluation through Accuracy Approximation(FedCCEA). This\nmethod builds the Accuracy Approximation Model(AAM), which estimates a\nsimulated test accuracy using inputs of sampled data size and extracts the\nclients' data quality and data size to measure client contribution. FedCCEA\nstrengthens some advantages: (1) enablement of data size selection to the\nclients, (2) feasible evaluation time regardless of the number of clients, and\n(3) precise estimation in non-IID settings. We demonstrate the superiority of\nFedCCEA compared to previous methods through several experiments: client\ncontribution distribution, client removal, and robustness test to partial\nparticipation.",

          "description": "Simulations of high energy density physics are expensive in terms of\ncomputational resources. In particular, the computation of opacities of\nplasmas, which are needed to accurately compute radiation transport in the\nnon-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) regime, are expensive to the point of\neasily requiring multiple times the sum-total compute time of all other\ncomponents of the simulation. As such, there is great interest in finding ways\nto accelerate NLTE computations. Previous work has demonstrated that a\ncombination of fully-connected autoencoders and a deep jointly-informed neural\nnetwork (DJINN) can successfully replace the standard NLTE calculations for the\nopacity of krypton. This work expands this idea to multiple elements in\ndemonstrating that individual surrogate models can be also be generated for\nother elements with the focus being on creating autoencoders that can\naccurately encode and decode the absorptivity and emissivity spectra.\nFurthermore, this work shows that multiple elements across a large range of\natomic numbers can be combined into a single autoencoder when using a\nconvolutional autoencoder while maintaining accuracy that is comparable to\nindividual fully-connected autoencoders. Lastly, it is demonstrated that DJINN\ncan effectively learn the latent space of a convolutional autoencoder that can\nencode multiple elements allowing the combination to effectively function as a\nsurrogate model.",

          "description": "Recent work [Papyan, Han, and Donoho, 2020] discovered a phenomenon called\nNeural Collapse (NC) that occurs pervasively in today's deep net training\nparadigm of driving cross-entropy loss towards zero. In this phenomenon, the\nlast-layer features collapse to their class-means, both the classifiers and\nclass-means collapse to the same Simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF), and the\nbehavior of the last-layer classifier converges to that of the\nnearest-class-mean decision rule. Since then, follow-ups-such as Mixon et al.\n[2020] and Poggio and Liao [2020a,b]-formally analyzed this inductive bias by\nreplacing the hard-to-study cross-entropy by the more tractable mean squared\nerror (MSE) loss. But, these works stopped short of demonstrating the empirical\nreality of MSE-NC on benchmark datasets and canonical networks-as had been done\nin Papyan, Han, and Donoho [2020] for the cross-entropy loss. In this work, we\nestablish the empirical reality of MSE-NC by reporting experimental\nobservations for three prototypical networks and five canonical datasets with\ncode for reproducing NC. Following this, we develop three main contributions\ninspired by MSE-NC. Firstly, we show a new theoretical decomposition of the MSE\nloss into (A) a term assuming the last-layer classifier is exactly the\nleast-squares or Webb and Lowe [1990] classifier and (B) a term capturing the\ndeviation from this least-squares classifier. Secondly, we exhibit experiments\non canonical datasets and networks demonstrating that, during training,\nterm-(B) is negligible. This motivates a new theoretical construct: the central\npath, where the linear classifier stays MSE-optimal-for the given feature\nactivations-throughout the dynamics. Finally, through our study of continually\nrenormalized gradient flow along the central path, we produce closed-form\ndynamics that predict full Neural Collapse in an unconstrained features model.",

We show that\ntheoretical justifications for recent regularisation schemes trying to enforce\nsuch a constraint suffer from a crucial flaw -- the theoretical link between\nthe regularisation scheme used and bi-Lipschitzness is only valid under\nconditions which do not hold in practice, rendering existing theory of limited\nuse, despite the strong empirical performance of these models. We provide a\ntheoretical explanation for the effectiveness of these regularisation schemes\nusing a frequency analysis perspective, showing that under mild conditions\nthese schemes will enforce a lower Lipschitz bound on the low-frequency\nprojection of images. We then provide empirical evidence supporting our\ntheoretical claims, and perform further experiments which demonstrate that our\nbroader conclusions appear to hold when some of the mathematical assumptions of\nour proof are relaxed, corresponding to the setup used in prior work. In\naddition, we present a simple constructive algorithm to search for counter\nexamples to the distance preservation condition, and discuss possible\nimplications of our theory for future model design.",

This paper proposes a principled framework for\ninteractive visual exploration of relations in data, through views most\ninformative given the user's current knowledge and objectives. The user can\ninput pre-existing knowledge of relations in the data and also formulate\nspecific exploration interests, which are then taken into account in the\nexploration. The idea is to steer the exploration process towards the interests\nof the user, instead of showing uninteresting or already known relations. The\nuser's knowledge is modelled by a distribution over data sets parametrised by\nsubsets of rows and columns of data, called tile constraints. We provide a\ncomputationally efficient implementation of this concept based on constrained\nrandomisation. Furthermore, we describe a novel dimensionality reduction method\nfor finding the views most informative to the user, which at the limit of no\nbackground knowledge and with generic objectives reduces to PCA.

          "description": "Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a promising avenue for probabilistic\nmodeling. They combine advantages of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) with\nthose of neural networks (NNs). Crucially, however, they are tractable\nprobabilistic models, supporting efficient and exact computation of many\nprobabilistic inference queries, such as marginals and MAP. Further, since PCs\nare structured computation graphs, they can take advantage of\ndeep-learning-style parameter updates, which greatly improves their\nscalability. However, this innovation also makes PCs prone to overfitting,\nwhich has been observed in many standard benchmarks. Despite the existence of\nabundant regularization techniques for both PGMs and NNs, they are not\neffective enough when applied to PCs. Instead, we re-think regularization for\nPCs and propose two intuitive techniques, data softening and entropy\nregularization, that both take advantage of PCs' tractability and still have an\nefficient implementation as a computation graph. Specifically, data softening\nprovides a principled way to add uncertainty in datasets in closed form, which\nimplicitly regularizes PC parameters. To learn parameters from a softened\ndataset, PCs only need linear time by virtue of their tractability. In entropy\nregularization, the exact entropy of the distribution encoded by a PC can be\nregularized directly, which is again infeasible for most other density\nestimation models. We show that both methods consistently improve the\ngeneralization performance of a wide variety of PCs. Moreover, when paired with\na simple PC structure, we achieved state-of-the-art results on 10 out of 20\nstandard discrete density estimation benchmarks.",

          "description": "Data augmentation is widely known as a simple yet surprisingly effective\ntechnique for regularizing deep networks. Conventional data augmentation\nschemes, e.g., flipping, translation or rotation, are low-level,\ndata-independent and class-agnostic operations, leading to limited diversity\nfor augmented samples. To this end, we propose a novel semantic data\naugmentation algorithm to complement traditional approaches. The proposed\nmethod is inspired by the intriguing property that deep networks are effective\nin learning linearized features, i.e., certain directions in the deep feature\nspace correspond to meaningful semantic transformations, e.g., changing the\nbackground or view angle of an object. Based on this observation, translating\ntraining samples along many such directions in the feature space can\neffectively augment the dataset for more diversity. To implement this idea, we\nfirst introduce a sampling based method to obtain semantically meaningful\ndirections efficiently. Then, an upper bound of the expected cross-entropy (CE)\nloss on the augmented training set is derived by assuming the number of\naugmented samples goes to infinity, yielding a highly efficient algorithm. In\nfact, we show that the proposed implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA)\nalgorithm amounts to minimizing a novel robust CE loss, which adds minimal\nextra computational cost to a normal training procedure. In addition to\nsupervised learning, ISDA can be applied to semi-supervised learning tasks\nunder the consistency regularization framework, where ISDA amounts to\nminimizing the upper bound of the expected KL-divergence between the augmented\nfeatures and the original features. Although being simple, ISDA consistently\nimproves the generalization performance of popular deep models (e.g., ResNets\nand DenseNets) on a variety of datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN,\nImageNet, and Cityscapes.",

Hurdles limiting full capitalization of recent\nadvancements in machine learning include the limited development of methods to\nlearn the underlying interactions of multiple elements, as well as the\nrelationships among multiple properties, to facilitate property prediction in\nnew composition spaces. To address these issues, we introduce the Hierarchical\nCorrelation Learning for Multi-property Prediction (H-CLMP) framework that\nseamlessly integrates (i) prediction using only a material's composition, (ii)\nlearning and exploitation of correlations among target properties in\nmulti-target regression, and (iii) leveraging training data from tangential\ndomains via generative transfer learning. The model is demonstrated for\nprediction of spectral optical absorption of complex metal oxides spanning 69\n3-cation metal oxide composition spaces. H-CLMP accurately predicts non-linear\ncomposition-property relationships in composition spaces for which no training\ndata is available, which broadens the purview of machine learning to the\ndiscovery of materials with exceptional properties. This achievement results\nfrom the principled integration of latent embedding learning, property\ncorrelation learning, generative transfer learning, and attention models. The\nbest performance is obtained using H-CLMP with Transfer learning (H-CLMP(T))\nwherein a generative adversarial network is trained on computational density of\nstates data and deployed in the target domain to augment prediction of optical\nabsorption from composition.

We extensively evaluate our system on a rich multi-type\nlinear algebra expression language, using arbitrary combinations of 100+\ngraph-rewriting axioms of equivalence. Our machine learning system guarantees\ncorrectness for all true negatives, and ensures 0 false positive by design. It\noutputs via inference a valid proof of equivalence for 93% of the 10,000\nequivalent expression pairs isolated for testing, using up to 50-term\nexpressions. In all cases, the validity of the sequence produced and therefore\nthe provable assertion of program equivalence is always computable, in\nnegligible time.",

          "description": "The fuzzy or soft $k$-means objective is a popular generalization of the\nwell-known $k$-means problem, extending the clustering capability of the\n$k$-means to datasets that are uncertain, vague, and otherwise hard to cluster.\nIn this paper, we propose a semi-supervised active clustering framework, where\nthe learner is allowed to interact with an oracle (domain expert), asking for\nthe similarity between a certain set of chosen items. We study the query and\ncomputational complexities of clustering in this framework. We prove that\nhaving a few of such similarity queries enables one to get a polynomial-time\napproximation algorithm to an otherwise conjecturally NP-hard problem. In\nparticular, we provide probabilistic algorithms for fuzzy clustering in this\nsetting that asks $O(\\mathsf{poly}(k)\\log n)$ similarity queries and run with\npolynomial-time-complexity, where $n$ is the number of items. The fuzzy\n$k$-means objective is nonconvex, with $k$-means as a special case, and is\nequivalent to some other generic nonconvex problem such as non-negative matrix\nfactorization. The ubiquitous Lloyd-type algorithms (or,\nexpectation-maximization algorithm) can get stuck at a local minima. Our\nresults show that by making few similarity queries, the problem becomes easier\nto solve.

Allocating the\nlimited resources in a cost-effective manner while maximizing the Quality of\nService (QoS) through real-time delivery and the provision of the appropriate\nrepresentations for all viewers is a challenging problem. In our paper, we\nintroduce a machine-learning based predictive resource allocation framework for\ngeo-distributed cloud sites, considering the delay and quality constraints to\nguarantee the maximum QoS for viewers and the minimum cost for content\nproviders. First, we present an offline optimization that decides the required\ntranscoding resources in distributed regions near the viewers with a trade-off\nbetween the QoS and the overall cost. Second, we use machine learning to build\nforecasting models that proactively predict the approximate transcoding\nresources to be reserved at each cloud site ahead of time. Finally, we develop\na Greedy Nearest and Cheapest algorithm (GNCA) to perform the resource\nallocation of real-time broadcasted videos on the rented resources. Extensive\nsimulations have shown that GNCA outperforms the state-of-the art resource\nallocation approaches for crowdsourced live streaming by achieving more than\n20% gain in terms of system cost while serving the viewers with relatively\nlower latency.",

Applying machine learning models to these tasks\nrequires us to create numerical representations of the changes, i.e.\nembeddings. Recent studies demonstrate that the best way to obtain these\nembeddings is to pre-train a deep neural network in an unsupervised manner on a\nlarge volume of unlabeled data and then further fine-tune it for a specific\ntask.\n\nIn this work, we propose an approach for obtaining such embeddings of code\nchanges during pre-training and evaluate them on two different downstream tasks\n- applying changes to code and commit message generation. The pre-training\nconsists of the model learning to apply the given change (an edit sequence) to\nthe code in a correct way, and therefore requires only the code change itself.\nTo increase the quality of the obtained embeddings, we only consider the\nchanged tokens in the edit sequence. In the task of applying code changes, our\nmodel outperforms the model that uses full edit sequences by 5.9 percentage\npoints in accuracy. As for the commit message generation, our model\ndemonstrated the same results as supervised models trained for this specific\ntask, which indicates that it can encode code changes well and can be improved\nin the future by pre-training on a larger dataset of easily gathered code\nchanges.",

          "description": "Optimization plays a key role in the training of deep neural networks.\nDeciding when to stop training can have a substantial impact on the performance\nof the network during inference. Under certain conditions, the generalization\nerror can display a double descent pattern during training: the learning curve\nis non-monotonic and seemingly diverges before converging again after\nadditional epochs. This optimization pattern can lead to early stopping\nprocedures to stop training before the second convergence and consequently\nselect a suboptimal set of parameters for the network, with worse performance\nduring inference. In this work, in addition to confirming that double descent\noccurs with small datasets and noisy labels as evidenced by others, we show\nthat noisy labels must be present both in the training and generalization sets\nto observe a double descent pattern. We also show that the learning rate has an\ninfluence on double descent, and study how different optimizers and optimizer\nparameters influence the apparition of double descent. Finally, we show that\nincreasing the learning rate can create an aliasing effect that masks the\ndouble descent pattern without suppressing it.

          "description": "One of the key drivers of complexity in the classical (stochastic)\nmulti-armed bandit (MAB) problem is the difference between mean rewards in the\ntop two arms, also known as the instance gap. The celebrated Upper Confidence\nBound (UCB) policy is among the simplest optimism-based MAB algorithms that\nnaturally adapts to this gap: for a horizon of play n, it achieves optimal\nO(log n) regret in instances with \"large\" gaps, and a near-optimal O(\\sqrt{n\nlog n}) minimax regret when the gap can be arbitrarily \"small.\" This paper\nprovides new results on the arm-sampling behavior of UCB, leading to several\nimportant insights. Among these, it is shown that arm-sampling rates under UCB\nare asymptotically deterministic, regardless of the problem complexity. This\ndiscovery facilitates new sharp asymptotics and a novel alternative proof for\nthe O(\\sqrt{n log n}) minimax regret of UCB. Furthermore, the paper also\nprovides the first complete process-level characterization of the MAB problem\nunder UCB in the conventional diffusion scaling. Among other things, the\n\"small\" gap worst-case lens adopted in this paper also reveals profound\ndistinctions between the behavior of UCB and Thompson Sampling, such as an\n\"incomplete learning\" phenomenon characteristic of the latter.",

          "description": "A major bottleneck in the real-world applications of machine learning models\nis their failure in generalizing to unseen domains whose data distribution is\nnot i.i.d to the training domains. This failure often stems from learning\nnon-generalizable features in the training domains that are spuriously\ncorrelated with the label of data. To address this shortcoming, there has been\na growing surge of interest in learning good explanations that are hard to\nvary, which is studied under the notion of Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\nGeneralization. The search for good explanations that are \\textit{invariant}\nacross different domains can be seen as finding local (global) minimas in the\nloss landscape that hold true across all of the training domains. In this\npaper, we propose a masking strategy, which determines a continuous weight\nbased on the agreement of gradients that flow in each edge of network, in order\nto control the amount of update received by the edge in each step of\noptimization. Particularly, our proposed technique referred to as \"Smoothed-AND\n(SAND)-masking\", not only validates the agreement in the direction of gradients\nbut also promotes the agreement among their magnitudes to further ensure the\ndiscovery of invariances across training domains. SAND-mask is validated over\nthe Domainbed benchmark for domain generalization and significantly improves\nthe state-of-the-art accuracy on the Colored MNIST dataset while providing\ncompetitive results on other domain generalization datasets.",

          "description": "Many of the recent triumphs in machine learning are dependent on well-tuned\nhyperparameters. This is particularly prominent in reinforcement learning (RL)\nwhere a small change in the configuration can lead to failure. Despite the\nimportance of tuning hyperparameters, it remains expensive and is often done in\na naive and laborious way. A recent solution to this problem is Population\nBased Training (PBT) which updates both weights and hyperparameters in a single\ntraining run of a population of agents. PBT has been shown to be particularly\neffective in RL, leading to widespread use in the field. However, PBT lacks\ntheoretical guarantees since it relies on random heuristics to explore the\nhyperparameter space. This inefficiency means it typically requires vast\ncomputational resources, which is prohibitive for many small and medium sized\nlabs. In this work, we introduce the first provably efficient PBT-style\nalgorithm, Population-Based Bandits (PB2). PB2 uses a probabilistic model to\nguide the search in an efficient way, making it possible to discover high\nperforming hyperparameter configurations with far fewer agents than typically\nrequired by PBT. We show in a series of RL experiments that PB2 is able to\nachieve high performance with a modest computational budget.",

          "description": "Data centres (DCs) underline many prominent future technological trends such\nas distributed training of large scale machine learning models and\ninternet-of-things based platforms. DCs will soon account for over 3\\% of\nglobal energy demand, so efficient use of DC resources is essential. Robust DC\nnetworks (DCNs) are essential to form the large scale systems needed to handle\nthis demand, but can bottleneck how efficiently DC-server resources can be used\nwhen servers with insufficient connectivity between them cannot be jointly\nallocated to a job. However, allocating servers' resources whilst accounting\nfor their inter-connectivity maps to an NP-hard combinatorial optimisation\nproblem, and so is often ignored in DC resource management schemes. We present\nNara, a framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) and graph neural\nnetworks (GNN) to learn network-aware allocation policies that increase the\nnumber of requests allocated over time compared to previous methods. Unique to\nour solution is the use of a GNN to generate representations of server-nodes in\nthe DCN, which are then interpreted as actions by a RL policy-network which\nchooses from which servers resources will be allocated to incoming requests.\nNara is agnostic to the topology size and shape and is trained end-to-end. The\nmethod can accept up to 33\\% more requests than the best baseline when deployed\non DCNs with up to the order of $10\\times$ more compute nodes than the DCN seen\nduring training and is able to maintain its policy's performance on DCNs with\nthe order of $100\\times$ more servers than seen during training. It also\ngeneralises to unseen DCN topologies with varied network structure and unseen\nrequest distributions without re-training.",

Such study has benefited\nfrom the renewed interest by the machine learning community in culturally\nimportant topics, leading to interdisciplinary works including collections of\nimages, quantitative approaches, and machine learning-based creativities.

We formalize the problem of disentangling multiple\ncables and present an algorithm, Iterative Reduction Of Non-planar Multiple\ncAble kNots (IRON-MAN), that outputs robot actions to remove crossings from\nmulti-cable knotted structures. We instantiate this algorithm with a learned\nperception system, inspired by prior work in single-cable untying that given an\nimage input, can disentangle two-cable twists, three-cable braids, and knots of\ntwo or three cables, such as overhand, square, carrick bend, sheet bend, crown,\nand fisherman's knots. IRON-MAN keeps track of task-relevant keypoints\ncorresponding to target cable endpoints and crossings and iteratively\ndisentangles the cables by identifying and undoing crossings that are critical\nto knot structure. Using a da Vinci surgical robot, we experimentally evaluate\nthe effectiveness of IRON-MAN on untangling multi-cable knots of types that\nappear in the training data, as well as generalizing to novel classes of\nmulti-cable knots. Results suggest that IRON-MAN is effective in disentangling\nknots involving up to three cables with 80.5% success and generalizing to knot\ntypes that are not present during training, with cables of both distinct or\nidentical colors.",

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made great breakthroughs in 2D\ncomputer vision. However, the irregular structure of meshes makes it hard to\nexploit the power of CNNs directly. A subdivision surface provides a\nhierarchical multi-resolution structure, and each face in a closed 2-manifold\ntriangle mesh is exactly adjacent to three faces. Motivated by these two\nproperties, this paper introduces a novel and flexible CNN framework, named\nSubdivNet, for 3D triangle meshes with Loop subdivision sequence connectivity.\nMaking an analogy between mesh faces and pixels in a 2D image allows us to\npresent a mesh convolution operator to aggregate local features from adjacent\nfaces. By exploiting face neighborhoods, this convolution can support standard\n2D convolutional network concepts, e.g. variable kernel size, stride, and\ndilation. Based on the multi-resolution hierarchy, we propose a spatial uniform\npooling layer which merges four faces into one and an upsampling method which\nsplits one face into four. As a result, many popular 2D CNN architectures can\nbe readily adapted to processing 3D meshes. Meshes with arbitrary connectivity\ncan be remeshed to hold Loop subdivision sequence connectivity via\nself-parameterization, making SubdivNet a general approach. Experiments on mesh\nclassification, segmentation, correspondence, and retrieval from the real-world\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SubdivNet.",

          "description": "Latent variable models for text, when trained successfully, accurately model\nthe data distribution and capture global semantic and syntactic features of\nsentences. The prominent approach to train such models is variational\nautoencoders (VAE). It is nevertheless challenging to train and often results\nin a trivial local optimum where the latent variable is ignored and its\nposterior collapses into the prior, an issue known as posterior collapse.\nVarious techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue. Most of them\nfocus on improving the inference model to yield latent codes of higher quality.\nThe present work proposes a short run dynamics for inference. It is initialized\nfrom the prior distribution of the latent variable and then runs a small number\n(e.g., 20) of Langevin dynamics steps guided by its posterior distribution. The\nmajor advantage of our method is that it does not require a separate inference\nmodel or assume simple geometry of the posterior distribution, thus rendering\nan automatic, natural and flexible inference engine. We show that the models\ntrained with short run dynamics more accurately model the data, compared to\nstrong language model and VAE baselines, and exhibit no sign of posterior\ncollapse. Analyses of the latent space show that interpolation in the latent\nspace is able to generate coherent sentences with smooth transition and\ndemonstrate improved classification over strong baselines with latent features\nfrom unsupervised pretraining. These results together expose a well-structured\nlatent space of our generative model.",

For SRL, acquiring domain-agnostic states is essential for\nachieving efficient imitation learning. Without these states, imitation\nlearning is hampered by domain-dependent information useless for control.\nHowever, existing methods fail to remove such disturbances from the states when\nthe data from experts and agents show large domain shifts. To overcome this\nissue, we propose a domain-adversarial and conditional state space model\n(DAC-SSM) that enables control systems to obtain domain-agnostic and task- and\ndynamics-aware states. DAC-SSM jointly optimizes the state inference,\nobservation reconstruction, forward dynamics, and reward models. To remove\ndomain-dependent information from the states, the model is trained with domain\ndiscriminators in an adversarial manner, and the reconstruction is conditioned\non domain labels. We experimentally evaluated the model predictive control\nperformance via imitation learning for continuous control of sparse reward\ntasks in simulators and compared it with the performance of the existing SRL\nmethod. The agents from DAC-SSM achieved performance comparable to experts and\nmore than twice the baselines.

In this paper, we revisit the vanishing-gradient problem in\nthe context of sigmoid-type activation.

While great\nresearch efforts have been devoted to exploiting deep neural networks for\nimproved stock prediction, the existing studies still suffer from two major\nissues. First, the long-range dependencies in time series are not sufficiently\ncaptured. Second, the chaotic property of financial time series fundamentally\nlowers prediction performance. In this study, we propose a novel framework to\naddress both issues regarding stock prediction. Specifically, in terms of\ntransforming time series into complex networks, we convert market price series\ninto graphs. Then, structural information, referring to associations among\ntemporal points and the node weights, is extracted from the mapped graphs to\nresolve the problems regarding long-range dependencies and the chaotic\nproperty. We take graph embeddings to represent the associations among temporal\npoints as the prediction model inputs. Node weights are used as a priori\nknowledge to enhance the learning of temporal attention. The effectiveness of\nour proposed framework is validated using real-world stock data, and our\napproach obtains the best performance among several state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks. Moreover, in the conducted trading simulations, our framework\nfurther obtains the highest cumulative profits.

We contribute to this line of\nresearch by proposing a framework that allows efficient and secure evaluation\nof full-fledged state-of-the-art ML algorithms via secure multi-party\ncomputation (MPC). This is in contrast to most prior works, which substitute ML\nalgorithms with approximated \"MPC-friendly\" variants. A drawback of the latter\napproach is that fine-tuning of the combined ML and MPC algorithms is required,\nwhich might lead to less efficient algorithms or inferior quality ML. This is\nan issue for secure deep neural networks (DNN) training in particular, as this\ninvolves arithmetic algorithms thought to be \"MPC-unfriendly\", namely, integer\ndivision, exponentiation, inversion, and square root. In this work, we propose\nsecure and efficient protocols for the above seemingly MPC-unfriendly\ncomputations. Our protocols are three-party protocols in the honest-majority\nsetting, and we propose both passively secure and actively secure with abort\nvariants. A notable feature of our protocols is that they simultaneously\nprovide high accuracy and efficiency. This framework enables us to efficiently\nand securely compute modern ML algorithms such as Adam and the softmax function\n\"as is\", without resorting to approximations. As a result, we obtain secure DNN\ntraining that outperforms state-of-the-art three-party systems; our full\ntraining is up to 6.7 times faster than just the online phase of the recently\nproposed FALCON@PETS'21 on a standard benchmark network. We further perform\nmeasurements on real-world DNNs, AlexNet and VGG16. The performance of our\nframework is up to a factor of about 12-14 faster for AlexNet and 46-48 faster\nfor VGG16 to achieve an accuracy of 70% and 75%, respectively, when compared to\nFALCON.",

To compare compositional properties across\ndifferent generators, we measure the trade-offs between reconstruction of the\nunrealistic input and image quality of the regenerated samples.

          "description": "Linear regression is a popular machine learning approach to learn and predict\nreal valued outputs or dependent variables from independent variables or\nfeatures. In many real world problems, its beneficial to perform sparse linear\nregression to identify important features helpful in predicting the dependent\nvariable. It not only helps in getting interpretable results but also avoids\noverfitting when the number of features is large, and the amount of data is\nsmall. The most natural way to achieve this is by using `best subset selection'\nwhich penalizes non-zero model parameters by adding $\\ell_0$ norm over\nparameters to the least squares loss. However, this makes the objective\nfunction non-convex and intractable even for a small number of features. This\npaper aims to address the intractability of sparse linear regression with\n$\\ell_0$ norm using adiabatic quantum computing, a quantum computing paradigm\nthat is particularly useful for solving optimization problems faster. We\nformulate the $\\ell_0$ optimization problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary\nOptimization (QUBO) problem and solve it using the D-Wave adiabatic quantum\ncomputer. We study and compare the quality of QUBO solution on synthetic and\nreal world datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nadiabatic quantum computing approach in finding the optimal solution. The QUBO\nsolution matches the optimal solution for a wide range of sparsity penalty\nvalues across the datasets.",

          "description": "Intelligent agents must pursue their goals in complex environments with\npartial information and often limited computational capacity. Reinforcement\nlearning methods have achieved great success by creating agents that optimize\nengineered reward functions, but which often struggle to learn in sparse-reward\nenvironments, generally require many environmental interactions to perform\nwell, and are typically computationally very expensive. Active inference is a\nmodel-based approach that directs agents to explore uncertain states while\nadhering to a prior model of their goal behaviour. This paper introduces an\nactive inference agent which minimizes the novel free energy of the expected\nfuture. Our model is capable of solving sparse-reward problems with a very high\nsample efficiency due to its objective function, which encourages directed\nexploration of uncertain states. Moreover, our model is computationally very\nlight and can operate in a fully online manner while achieving comparable\nperformance to offline RL methods. We showcase the capabilities of our model by\nsolving the mountain car problem, where we demonstrate its superior exploration\nproperties and its robustness to observation noise, which in fact improves\nperformance. We also introduce a novel method for approximating the prior model\nfrom the reward function, which simplifies the expression of complex objectives\nand improves performance over previous active inference approaches.",

Whilst regression and classification\ntasks for scalar and vector data are routinely solved by neural networks, a\nprincipled approach for estimating histogram labels as a function of an input\nvector or image is lacking in the literature. We present a dedicated method for\nDeep Learning-based histogram regression, which incorporates cross-bin\ninformation and yields distributions over possible histograms, expressed by\n$\\tau$-quantiles of the cumulative histogram in each bin. The crux of our\napproach is a new loss function obtained by applying the pinball loss to the\ncumulative histogram, which for 1D histograms reduces to the Earth Mover's\ndistance (EMD) in the special case of the median ($\\tau = 0.5$), and\ngeneralizes it to arbitrary quantiles. We validate our method with an\nillustrative toy example, a football-related task, and an astrophysical\ncomputer vision problem. We show that with our loss function, the accuracy of\nthe predicted median histograms is very similar to the standard EMD case (and\nhigher than for per-bin loss functions such as cross-entropy), while the\npredictions become much more informative at almost no additional computational\ncost.",

As an example\ntool-use situation, the robot performs an ingredients transfer task, using a\nturner or ladle to transfer an ingredient from a pot to a bowl.

          "description": "Generative adversarial networks built from deep convolutional neural networks\n(GANs) lack the ability to exactly replicate the high-frequency components of\nnatural images. To alleviate this issue, we introduce two novel training\ntechniques called frequency dropping (F-Drop) and frequency matching (F-Match).\nThe key idea of F-Drop is to filter out unnecessary high-frequency components\nfrom the input images of the discriminators. This simple modification prevents\nthe discriminators from being confused by perturbations of the high-frequency\ncomponents. In addition, F-Drop makes the GANs focus on fitting in the\nlow-frequency domain, in which there are the dominant components of natural\nimages. F-Match minimizes the difference between real and fake images in the\nfrequency domain for generating more realistic images. F-Match is implemented\nas a regularization term in the objective functions of the generators; it\npenalizes the batch mean error in the frequency domain. F-Match helps the\ngenerators to fit in the high-frequency domain filtered out by F-Drop to the\nreal image. We experimentally demonstrate that the combination of F-Drop and\nF-Match improves the generative performance of GANs in both the frequency and\nspatial domain on multiple image benchmarks (CIFAR, TinyImageNet, STL-10,\nCelebA, and ImageNet).",

In the model-based\nBayesian setting, there are conjugate priors that enable us to express the\nmulti-object posterior in closed form, which could theoretically provide\nBayes-optimal estimates. However, the posterior involves a super-exponential\ngrowth of the number of hypotheses over time, forcing state-of-the-art methods\nto resort to approximations for remaining tractable, which can impact their\nperformance in complex scenarios. Model-free methods based on deep-learning\nprovide an attractive alternative, as they can, in principle, learn the optimal\nfilter from data, but to the best of our knowledge were never compared to\ncurrent state-of-the-art Bayesian filters, specially not in contexts where\naccurate models are available.

          "description": "Many inference problems, such as sequential decision problems like A/B\ntesting, adaptive sampling schemes like bandit selection, are often online in\nnature. The fundamental problem for online inference is to provide a sequence\nof confidence intervals that are valid uniformly over the growing-into-infinity\nsample sizes. To address this question, we provide a near-optimal confidence\nsequence for bounded random variables by utilizing Bentkus' concentration\nresults. We show that it improves on the existing approaches that use the\nCram{\\'e}r-Chernoff technique such as the Hoeffding, Bernstein, and Bennett\ninequalities. The resulting confidence sequence is confirmed to be favorable in\nboth synthetic coverage problems and an application to adaptive stopping\nalgorithms.",

Fundamentally, training a network is a parameter estimation problem.\nIn adaptive control theory, maintaining persistency of excitation (PoE) is\nintegral to ensuring convergence of parameter estimates in dynamical systems to\ntheir robust optima. In this work, we show that network training using gradient\ndescent is equivalent to a dynamical system parameter estimation problem.\nLeveraging this relationship, we prove a sufficient condition for PoE of\ngradient descent is achieved when the learning rate is less than the inverse of\nthe Lipschitz constant of the gradient of loss function. We provide an\nefficient technique for estimating the corresponding Lipschitz constant using\nextreme value theory and demonstrate that by only scaling the learning rate\nschedule we can increase adversarial accuracy by up to 15% on benchmark\ndatasets. Our approach also universally increases the adversarial accuracy by\n0.1% to 0.3% in various state-of-the-art adversarially trained models on the\nAutoAttack benchmark, where every small margin of improvement is significant.",

We\nfound that traditional machine learning algorithms when limited to the features\nof musical prosody (1) achieve high accuracies for a single singer, (2)\nmaintain high accuracy when the dataset is expanded to multiple singers, and\n(3) achieve high accuracies when trained on a reduced subset of the total\nfeatures.",

          "description": "The federated learning (FL) framework trains a machine learning model using\ndecentralized data stored at edge client devices by periodically aggregating\nlocally trained models. Popular optimization algorithms of FL use vanilla\n(stochastic) gradient descent for both local updates at clients and global\nupdates at the aggregating server. Recently, adaptive optimization methods such\nas AdaGrad have been studied for server updates. However, the effect of using\nadaptive optimization methods for local updates at clients is not yet\nunderstood. We show in both theory and practice that while local adaptive\nmethods can accelerate convergence, they can cause a non-vanishing solution\nbias, where the final converged solution may be different from the stationary\npoint of the global objective function. We propose correction techniques to\novercome this inconsistency and complement the local adaptive methods for FL.\nExtensive experiments on realistic federated training tasks show that the\nproposed algorithms can achieve faster convergence and higher test accuracy\nthan the baselines without local adaptivity.",

VizFake leverages a very small\namount of known labels, mirroring realistic and practical scenarios, where\nlabels (especially for known misinformative articles), are scarce and quickly\nbecome dated. The F1 score of VizFake on a dataset of 50k screenshots of news\narticles spanning more than 500 domains is roughly 85% using only 5% of ground\ntruth labels. Furthermore, tensor representations of VizFake, obtained in an\nunsupervised manner, allow for exploratory analysis of the data that provides\nvaluable insights into the problem. Finally, we compare VizFake with deep\ntransfer learning, since it is a very popular black-box approach for image\nclassification and also well-known text text-based methods.

Recent attempts employ\nself-supervised training methods, such as contrastive predictive coding (CPC),\nwhere the next frame is predicted given past context. However, CPC only looks\nat the audio signal's frame-level structure. We overcome this limitation with a\nsegmental contrastive predictive coding (SCPC) framework that can model the\nsignal structure at a higher level e.g. at the phoneme level. In this\nframework, a convolutional neural network learns frame-level representation\nfrom the raw waveform via noise-contrastive estimation (NCE). A differentiable\nboundary detector finds variable-length segments, which are then used to\noptimize a segment encoder via NCE to learn segment representations. The\ndifferentiable boundary detector allows us to train frame-level and\nsegment-level encoders jointly. Typically, phoneme and word segmentation are\ntreated as separate tasks. We unify them and experimentally show that our\nsingle model outperforms existing phoneme and word segmentation methods on\nTIMIT and Buckeye datasets.

Many promising approaches to this\nchallenge consider RL as a process of training two functions simultaneously: a\ncomplex nonlinear encoder that maps high-dimensional observations to a latent\nrepresentation space, and a simple linear policy over this space. We posit that\na superior encoder for zero-shot generalization in RL can be trained by using\nsolely an auxiliary SSL objective if the training process encourages the\nencoder to map behaviorally similar observations to similar representations, as\nreward-based signal can cause overfitting in the encoder (Raileanu et al.,\n2021). We propose Cross-Trajectory Representation Learning (CTRL), a method\nthat runs within an RL agent and conditions its encoder to recognize behavioral\nsimilarity in observations by applying a novel SSL objective to pairs of\ntrajectories from the agent's policies.

          "description": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning with instance-level contrastive\nobjectives facilitate unsupervised clustering. However, a standalone datum is\nnot perceiving the context of the holistic cluster, and may undergo sub-optimal\nassignment. In this paper, we extend the mainstream contrastive learning\nparadigm to a cluster-level scheme, where all the data subjected to the same\ncluster contribute to a unified representation that encodes the context of each\ndata group. Contrastive learning with this representation then rewards the\nassignment of each datum. To implement this vision, we propose twin-contrast\nclustering (TCC). We define a set of categorical variables as clustering\nassignment confidence, which links the instance-level learning track with the\ncluster-level one. On one hand, with the corresponding assignment variables\nbeing the weight, a weighted aggregation along the data points implements the\nset representation of a cluster. We further propose heuristic cluster\naugmentation equivalents to enable cluster-level contrastive learning. On the\nother hand, we derive the evidence lower-bound of the instance-level\ncontrastive objective with the assignments. By reparametrizing the assignment\nvariables, TCC is trained end-to-end, requiring no alternating steps. Extensive\nexperiments show that TCC outperforms the state-of-the-art on challenging\nbenchmarks.",

Our\nmethod is built upon recent neural scene representation and rendering works\nwhich learn representations of geometry and appearance from only 2D images.\nWhile existing works demonstrated compelling rendering of static scenes and\nplayback of dynamic scenes, photo-realistic reconstruction and rendering of\nhumans with neural implicit methods, in particular under user-controlled novel\nposes, is still difficult. To address this problem, we utilize a coarse body\nmodel as the proxy to unwarp the surrounding 3D space into a canonical pose. A\nneural radiance field learns pose-dependent geometric deformations and pose-\nand view-dependent appearance effects in the canonical space from multi-view\nvideo input. To synthesize novel views of high fidelity dynamic geometry and\nappearance, we leverage 2D texture maps defined on the body model as latent\nvariables for predicting residual deformations and the dynamic appearance.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method achieves better quality than the\nstate-of-the-arts on playback as well as novel pose synthesis, and can even\ngeneralize well to new poses that starkly differ from the training poses.\nFurthermore, our method also supports body shape control of the synthesized\nresults.",

          "description": "We propose the convergent graph solver (CGS), a deep learning method that\nlearns iterative mappings to predict the properties of a graph system at its\nstationary state (fixed point) with guaranteed convergence. CGS systematically\ncomputes the fixed points of a target graph system and decodes them to estimate\nthe stationary properties of the system without the prior knowledge of existing\nsolvers or intermediate solutions. The forward propagation of CGS proceeds in\nthree steps: (1) constructing the input dependent linear contracting iterative\nmaps, (2) computing the fixed-points of the linear maps, and (3) decoding the\nfixed-points to estimate the properties. The contractivity of the constructed\nlinear maps guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the fixed points\nfollowing the Banach fixed point theorem. To train CGS efficiently, we also\nderive a tractable analytical expression for its gradient by leveraging the\nimplicit function theorem. We evaluate the performance of CGS by applying it to\nvarious network-analytic and graph benchmark problems. The results indicate\nthat CGS has competitive capabilities for predicting the stationary properties\nof graph systems, irrespective of whether the target systems are linear or\nnon-linear. CGS also shows high performance for graph classification problems\nwhere the existence or the meaning of a fixed point is hard to be clearly\ndefined, which highlights the potential of CGS as a general graph neural\nnetwork architecture.",

          "description": "Reference-based Super-Resolution (Ref-SR) has recently emerged as a promising\nparadigm to enhance a low-resolution (LR) input image by introducing an\nadditional high-resolution (HR) reference image. Existing Ref-SR methods mostly\nrely on implicit correspondence matching to borrow HR textures from reference\nimages to compensate for the information loss in input images. However,\nperforming local transfer is difficult because of two gaps between input and\nreference images: the transformation gap (e.g. scale and rotation) and the\nresolution gap (e.g. HR and LR). To tackle these challenges, we propose\nC2-Matching in this work, which produces explicit robust matching crossing\ntransformation and resolution. 1) For the transformation gap, we propose a\ncontrastive correspondence network, which learns transformation-robust\ncorrespondences using augmented views of the input image. 2) For the resolution\ngap, we adopt a teacher-student correlation distillation, which distills\nknowledge from the easier HR-HR matching to guide the more ambiguous LR-HR\nmatching. 3) Finally, we design a dynamic aggregation module to address the\npotential misalignment issue. In addition, to faithfully evaluate the\nperformance of Ref-SR under a realistic setting, we contribute the\nWebly-Referenced SR (WR-SR) dataset, mimicking the practical usage scenario.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed C2-Matching significantly\noutperforms state of the arts by over 1dB on the standard CUFED5 benchmark.\nNotably, it also shows great generalizability on WR-SR dataset as well as\nrobustness across large scale and rotation transformations.",

Therefore, the research community is actively working on developing\napproaches to detect whether a given text is organic or synthetic. While this\nis a useful first step, it is important to be able to further fingerprint the\nauthor LM to attribute its origin. Prior work on fingerprinting LMs is limited\nto attributing synthetic text generated by a handful (usually < 10) of\npre-trained LMs. However, LMs such as GPT2 are commonly fine-tuned in a myriad\nof ways (e.g., on a domain-specific text corpus) before being used to generate\nsynthetic text. It is challenging to fingerprinting fine-tuned LMs because the\nuniverse of fine-tuned LMs is much larger in realistic scenarios. To address\nthis challenge, we study the problem of large-scale fingerprinting of\nfine-tuned LMs in the wild. Using a real-world dataset of synthetic text\ngenerated by 108 different fine-tuned LMs, we conduct comprehensive experiments\nto demonstrate the limitations of existing fingerprinting approaches.

          "description": "Incomplete instances with various missing attributes in many real-world\nscenes have brought challenges to the classification task. There are some\nmissing values imputation methods to fill the missing values with substitute\nvalues before classification. However, the separation between imputation and\nclassification may lead to inferior performance since label information are\nignored during imputation. Moreover, these imputation methods tend to\ninitialize these missing values with strong prior assumptions, while the\nunreliability of such initialization is rarely considered. To tackle these\nproblems, a novel semi-supervised conditional normalizing flow (SSCFlow) is\nproposed in this paper. SSCFlow explicitly utilizes the observed labels to\nfacilitate the imputation and classification simultaneously by employing a\nsemi-supervised algorithm to estimate the conditional probability density of\nmissing values. Moreover, SSCFlow takes the initialized missing values as\ncorrupted initial imputation and iteratively reconstructs their latent\nrepresentations with an overcomplete denoising autoencoder to approximate the\ntrue conditional probability density of missing values.

          "description": "Ensuring the privacy of research participants is vital, even more so in\nhealthcare environments. Deep learning approaches to neuroimaging require large\ndatasets, and this often necessitates sharing data between multiple sites,\nwhich is antithetical to the privacy objectives. Federated learning is a\ncommonly proposed solution to this problem. It circumvents the need for data\nsharing by sharing parameters during the training process. However, we\ndemonstrate that allowing access to parameters may leak private information\neven if data is never directly shared. In particular, we show that it is\npossible to infer if a sample was used to train the model given only access to\nthe model prediction (black-box) or access to the model itself (white-box) and\nsome leaked samples from the training data distribution. Such attacks are\ncommonly referred to as Membership Inference attacks. We show realistic\nMembership Inference attacks on deep learning models trained for 3D\nneuroimaging tasks in a centralized as well as decentralized setup. We\ndemonstrate feasible attacks on brain age prediction models (deep learning\nmodels that predict a person's age from their brain MRI scan). We correctly\nidentified whether an MRI scan was used in model training with a 60% to over\n80% success rate depending on model complexity and security assumptions.",

          "description": "A fundamental challenge in multiagent reinforcement learning is to learn\nbeneficial behaviors in a shared environment with other simultaneously learning\nagents. In particular, each agent perceives the environment as effectively\nnon-stationary due to the changing policies of other agents. Moreover, each\nagent is itself constantly learning, leading to natural non-stationarity in the\ndistribution of experiences encountered. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmeta-multiagent policy gradient theorem that directly accounts for the\nnon-stationary policy dynamics inherent to multiagent learning settings. This\nis achieved by modeling our gradient updates to consider both an agent's own\nnon-stationary policy dynamics and the non-stationary policy dynamics of other\nagents in the environment. We show that our theoretically grounded approach\nprovides a general solution to the multiagent learning problem, which\ninherently comprises all key aspects of previous state of the art approaches on\nthis topic. We test our method on a diverse suite of multiagent benchmarks and\ndemonstrate a more efficient ability to adapt to new agents as they learn than\nbaseline methods across the full spectrum of mixed incentive, competitive, and\ncooperative domains.",

          "description": "The usage of smartphone-collected respiratory sound, trained with deep\nlearning models, for detecting and classifying COVID-19 becomes popular\nrecently. It removes the need for in-person testing procedures especially for\nrural regions where related medical supplies, experienced workers, and\nequipment are limited. However, existing sound-based diagnostic approaches are\ntrained in a fully supervised manner, which requires large scale well-labelled\ndata. It is critical to discover new methods to leverage unlabelled respiratory\ndata, which can be obtained more easily. In this paper, we propose a novel\nself-supervised learning enabled framework for COVID-19 cough classification. A\ncontrastive pre-training phase is introduced to train a Transformer-based\nfeature encoder with unlabelled data. Specifically, we design a random masking\nmechanism to learn robust representations of respiratory sounds. The\npre-trained feature encoder is then fine-tuned in the downstream phase to\nperform cough classification. In addition, different ensembles with varied\nrandom masking rates are also explored in the downstream phase. Through\nextensive evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed contrastive\npre-training, the random masking mechanism, and the ensemble architecture\ncontribute to improving cough classification performance.",

          "description": "Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a framework for Bayesian inference that can\noffer principled uncertainty estimates for a large range of problems. For\nexample, if we consider regression problems with Gaussian likelihoods, a GP\nmodel enjoys a posterior in closed form. However, identifying the posterior GP\nscales cubically with the number of training examples and requires to store all\nexamples in memory. In order to overcome these obstacles, sparse GPs have been\nproposed that approximate the true posterior GP with pseudo-training examples.\nImportantly, the number of pseudo-training examples is user-defined and enables\ncontrol over computational and memory complexity. In the general case, sparse\nGPs do not enjoy closed-form solutions and one has to resort to approximate\ninference. In this context, a convenient choice for approximate inference is\nvariational inference (VI), where the problem of Bayesian inference is cast as\nan optimization problem -- namely, to maximize a lower bound of the log\nmarginal likelihood. This paves the way for a powerful and versatile framework,\nwhere pseudo-training examples are treated as optimization arguments of the\napproximate posterior that are jointly identified together with hyperparameters\nof the generative model (i.e. prior and likelihood). The framework can\nnaturally handle a wide scope of supervised learning problems, ranging from\nregression with heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian likelihoods to classification\nproblems with discrete labels, but also multilabel problems. The purpose of\nthis tutorial is to provide access to the basic matter for readers without\nprior knowledge in both GPs and VI. A proper exposition to the subject enables\nalso access to more recent advances (like importance-weighted VI as well as\ninterdomain, multioutput and deep GPs) that can serve as an inspiration for new\nresearch ideas.",

          "description": "Retrosynthesis, of which the goal is to find a set of reactants for\nsynthesizing a target product, is an emerging research area of deep learning.\nWhile the existing approaches have shown promising results, they currently lack\nthe ability to consider availability (e.g., stability or purchasability) of the\nreactants or generalize to unseen reaction templates (i.e., chemical reaction\nrules). In this paper, we propose a new approach that mitigates the issues by\nreformulating retrosynthesis into a selection problem of reactants from a\ncandidate set of commercially available molecules. To this end, we design an\nefficient reactant selection framework, named RetCL (retrosynthesis via\ncontrastive learning), for enumerating all of the candidate molecules based on\nselection scores computed by graph neural networks. For learning the score\nfunctions, we also propose a novel contrastive training scheme with hard\nnegative mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of the proposed\nselection-based approach. For example, when all 671k reactants in the USPTO\n{database} are given as candidates, our RetCL achieves top-1 exact match\naccuracy of $71.3\\%$ for the USPTO-50k benchmark, while a recent\ntransformer-based approach achieves $59.6\\%$.

The algorithm is\nnamed Triple-Q because it has three key components: a Q-function (also called\naction-value function) for the cumulative reward, a Q-function for the\ncumulative utility for the constraint, and a virtual-Queue that\n(over)-estimates the cumulative constraint violation. Under Triple-Q, at each\nstep, an action is chosen based on the pseudo-Q-value that is a combination of\nthe three Q values. The algorithm updates the reward and utility Q-values with\nlearning rates that depend on the visit counts to the corresponding (state,\naction) pairs and are periodically reset. In the episodic CMDP setting,\nTriple-Q achieves $\\tilde{\\cal O}\\left(\\frac{1 }{\\delta}H^4\nS^{\\frac{1}{2}}A^{\\frac{1}{2}}K^{\\frac{4}{5}} \\right)$ regret, where $K$ is the\ntotal number of episodes, $H$ is the number of steps in each episode, $S$ is\nthe number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $\\delta$ is Slater's\nconstant.

Another common\napproach is to limit the ability of a particular adversary who seeks to\nmaximize parity.

          "description": "State-of-the-art deep neural networks are sensitive to small input\nperturbations. Since the discovery of this intriguing vulnerability, many\ndefence methods have been proposed that attempt to improve robustness to\nadversarial noise. Fast and accurate attacks are required to compare various\ndefence methods. However, evaluating adversarial robustness has proven to be\nextremely challenging. Existing norm minimisation adversarial attacks require\nthousands of iterations (e.g. Carlini & Wagner attack), are limited to the\nspecific norms (e.g. Fast Adaptive Boundary), or produce sub-optimal results\n(e.g. Brendel & Bethge attack). On the other hand, PGD attack, which is fast,\ngeneral and accurate, ignores the norm minimisation penalty and solves a\nsimpler perturbation-constrained problem. In this work, we introduce a fast,\ngeneral and accurate adversarial attack that optimises the original non-convex\nconstrained minimisation problem. We interpret optimising the Lagrangian of the\nadversarial attack optimisation problem as a two-player game: the first player\nminimises the Lagrangian wrt the adversarial noise; the second player maximises\nthe Lagrangian wrt the regularisation penalty. Our attack algorithm\nsimultaneously optimises primal and dual variables to find the minimal\nadversarial perturbation. In addition, for non-smooth $l_p$-norm minimisation,\nsuch as $l_{\\infty}$-, $l_1$-, and $l_0$-norms, we introduce primal-dual\nproximal gradient descent attack. We show in the experiments that our attack\noutperforms current state-of-the-art $l_{\\infty}$-, $l_2$-, $l_1$-, and\n$l_0$-attacks on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Restricted ImageNet datasets against\nunregularised and adversarially trained models.",

          "description": "Adversarial examples seem to be inevitable. These specifically crafted inputs\nallow attackers to arbitrarily manipulate machine learning systems. Even worse,\nthey often seem harmless to human observers. In our digital society, this poses\na significant threat. For example, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems,\nwhich serve as hands-free interfaces to many kinds of systems, can be attacked\nwith inputs incomprehensible for human listeners. The research community has\nunsuccessfully tried several approaches to tackle this problem. In this paper\nwe propose a different perspective: We accept the presence of adversarial\nexamples against ASR systems, but we require them to be perceivable by human\nlisteners. By applying the principles of psychoacoustics, we can remove\nsemantically irrelevant information from the ASR input and train a model that\nresembles human perception more closely. We implement our idea in a tool named\nDOMPTEUR and demonstrate that our augmented system, in contrast to an\nunmodified baseline, successfully focuses on perceptible ranges of the input\nsignal. This change forces adversarial examples into the audible range, while\nusing minimal computational overhead and preserving benign performance. To\nevaluate our approach, we construct an adaptive attacker that actively tries to\navoid our augmentations and demonstrate that adversarial examples from this\nattacker remain clearly perceivable. Finally, we substantiate our claims by\nperforming a hearing test with crowd-sourced human listeners.",

          "description": "Nearest neighbor search under elastic distances is a key tool for time series\nanalysis, supporting many applications. However, straightforward\nimplementations of distances require $O(n^2)$ space and time complexities,\npreventing these applications from scaling to long series. Much work has been\ndevoted to speeding up the NN search process, mostly with the development of\nlower bounds, allowing to avoid costly distance computations when a given\nthreshold is exceeded. This threshold, provided by the similarity search\nprocess, also allows to early abandon the computation of a distance itself.\nAnother approach, is to prune parts of the computation. All these techniques\nare othogonal to each other. In this work, we develop a new generic strategy,\n\"EAPruned\", that tightly integrates pruning with early abandoning. We apply it\nto six elastic distance measures: DTW, CDTW, WDTW, ERP, MSM and TWE, showing\nsubstantial speedup in NN search applications. Pruning alone also shows\nsubstantial speedup for some distances, benefiting applications beyond the\nscope of NN search (e.g. requiring all pairwise distances), and hence where\nearly abandoning is not applicable.

          "description": "Approximate message passing (AMP) is a low-cost iterative\nparameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with\nnon-Gaussian distributions. However, AMP only applies to independent\nidentically distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable\n(e.g. perform poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially\nfor ill-conditioned ones. To handle this difficulty, orthogonal/vector AMP\n(OAMP/VAMP) was proposed for general right-unitarily-invariant matrices.\nHowever, the Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP requires high-complexity linear minimum\nmean square error (MMSE) estimator. This limits the application of OAMP/VAMP to\nlarge-scale systems.\n\nTo solve the disadvantages of AMP and OAMP/VAMP, this paper proposes a memory\nAMP (MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is proposed for interference\nsuppression. The complexity of MAMP is comparable to AMP. The asymptotic\nGaussianity of estimation errors in MAMP is guaranteed by the orthogonality\nprinciple. A state evolution is derived to asymptotically characterize the\nperformance of MAMP. Based on state evolution, the relaxation parameters and\ndamping vector in MAMP are optimized. For all right-unitarily-invariant\nmatrices, the optimized MAMP converges to the high-complexity OAMP/VAMP, and\nthus is Bayes-optimal if it has a unique fixed point. Finally, simulations are\nprovided to verify the validity and accuracy of the theoretical results.",

Although various models exist that predict yield from remote sensing\ndata, there currently does not exist an approach that can estimate yield for\nmultiple crops simultaneously, and thus leads to more accurate predictions. A\nmodel that predicts the yield of multiple crops and concurrently considers the\ninteraction between multiple crop yields.

          "description": "Harvesting data from distributed Internet of Things (IoT) devices with\nmultiple autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a challenging problem\nrequiring flexible path planning methods. We propose a multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) approach that, in contrast to previous work, can\nadapt to profound changes in the scenario parameters defining the data\nharvesting mission, such as the number of deployed UAVs, number, position and\ndata amount of IoT devices, or the maximum flying time, without the need to\nperform expensive recomputations or relearn control policies. We formulate the\npath planning problem for a cooperative, non-communicating, and homogeneous\nteam of UAVs tasked with maximizing collected data from distributed IoT sensor\nnodes subject to flying time and collision avoidance constraints. The path\nplanning problem is translated into a decentralized partially observable Markov\ndecision process (Dec-POMDP), which we solve through a deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) approach, approximating the optimal UAV control policy without\nprior knowledge of the challenging wireless channel characteristics in dense\nurban environments. By exploiting a combination of centered global and local\nmap representations of the environment that are fed into convolutional layers\nof the agents, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the\nagents to cooperate effectively by carefully dividing the data collection task\namong themselves, adapt to large complex environments and state spaces, and\nmake movement decisions that balance data collection goals, flight-time\nefficiency, and navigation constraints.

We observe the final prediction\nin vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens,\nwhich is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation,\nwe propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens\nprogressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a\nlightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token\ngiven the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune\nredundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an\nend-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably\nprune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from\nthe nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware\nfriendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By\nhierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces\n31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of\naccuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers.

          "description": "This work presents a seemingly simple but effective technique to improve\nlow-resource ASR systems for phonetic languages. By identifying sets of\nacoustically similar graphemes in these languages, we first reduce the output\nalphabet of the ASR system using linguistically meaningful reductions and then\nreconstruct the original alphabet using a standalone module. We demonstrate\nthat this lessens the burden and improves the performance of low-resource\nend-to-end ASR systems (because only reduced-alphabet predictions are needed)\nand that it is possible to design a very simple but effective reconstruction\nmodule that recovers sequences in the original alphabet from sequences in the\nreduced alphabet. We present a finite state transducer-based reconstruction\nmodule that operates on the 1-best ASR hypothesis in the reduced alphabet. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our proposed technique using ASR systems for two\nIndian languages, Gujarati and Telugu. With access to only 10 hrs of speech\ndata, we obtain relative WER reductions of up to 7% compared to systems that do\nnot use any reduction.",

Learning branching\npolicies for MILP has become an active research area, with most works proposing\nto imitate the strong branching rule and specialize it to distinct classes of\nproblems. We aim instead at learning a policy that generalizes across\nheterogeneous MILPs: our main hypothesis is that parameterizing the state of\nthe B&B search tree can aid this type of generalization. We propose a novel\nimitation learning framework, and introduce new input features and\narchitectures to represent branching. Experiments on MILP benchmark instances\nclearly show the advantages of incorporating an explicit parameterization of\nthe state of the search tree to modulate the branching decisions, in terms of\nboth higher accuracy and smaller B&B trees.

          "description": "X-ray diffraction based microscopy techniques such as High Energy Diffraction\nMicroscopy rely on knowledge of the position of diffraction peaks with high\nprecision. These positions are typically computed by fitting the observed\nintensities in area detector data to a theoretical peak shape such as\npseudo-Voigt. As experiments become more complex and detector technologies\nevolve, the computational cost of such peak detection and shape fitting becomes\nthe biggest hurdle to the rapid analysis required for real-time feedback during\nin-situ experiments. To this end, we propose BraggNN, a deep learning-based\nmethod that can determine peak positions much more rapidly than conventional\npseudo-Voigt peak fitting. When applied to a test dataset, BraggNN gives errors\nof less than 0.29 and 0.57 pixels, relative to the conventional method, for 75%\nand 95% of the peaks, respectively. When applied to a real experimental\ndataset, a 3D reconstruction that used peak positions computed by BraggNN\nyields 15% better results on average as compared to a reconstruction obtained\nusing peak positions determined using conventional 2D pseudo-Voigt fitting.\nRecent advances in deep learning method implementations and special-purpose\nmodel inference accelerators allow BraggNN to deliver enormous performance\nimprovements relative to the conventional method, running, for example, more\nthan 200 times faster than a conventional method on a consumer-class GPU card\nwith out-of-the-box software.",

          "description": "We introduce and investigate matrix approximation by decomposition into a sum\nof radial basis function (RBF) components. An RBF component is a generalization\nof the outer product between a pair of vectors, where an RBF function replaces\nthe scalar multiplication between individual vector elements. Even though the\nRBF functions are positive definite, the summation across components is not\nrestricted to convex combinations and allows us to compute the decomposition\nfor any real matrix that is not necessarily symmetric or positive definite. We\nformulate the problem of seeking such a decomposition as an optimization\nproblem with a nonlinear and non-convex loss function. Several modern versions\nof the gradient descent method, including their scalable stochastic\ncounterparts, are used to solve this problem. We provide extensive empirical\nevidence of the effectiveness of the RBF decomposition and that of the\ngradient-based fitting algorithm. While being conceptually motivated by\nsingular value decomposition (SVD), our proposed nonlinear counterpart\noutperforms SVD by drastically reducing the memory required to approximate a\ndata matrix with the same $L_2$-error for a wide range of matrix types. For\nexample, it leads to 2 to 10 times memory save for Gaussian noise, graph\nadjacency matrices, and kernel matrices. Moreover, this proximity-based\ndecomposition can offer additional interpretability in applications that\ninvolve, e.g., capturing the inner low-dimensional structure of the data,\nretaining graph connectivity structure, and preserving the acutance of images.",

Historical data of this type can be used to\nevaluate other treatment assignment policies to guide future innovation or\nexperiments. However, policy evaluation is challenging if the target policy\ndiffers from the one used to collect data, and popular estimators, including\ndoubly robust (DR) estimators, can be plagued by bias, excessive variance, or\nboth. In particular, when the pattern of treatment assignment in the collected\ndata looks little like the pattern generated by the policy to be evaluated, the\nimportance weights used in DR estimators explode, leading to excessive\nvariance.\n\nIn this paper, we improve the DR estimator by adaptively weighting\nobservations to control its variance. We show that a t-statistic based on our\nimproved estimator is asymptotically normal under certain conditions, allowing\nus to form confidence intervals and test hypotheses.

          "description": "Task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems often need to formulate knowledge base\n(KB) queries corresponding to the user intent and use the query results to\ngenerate system responses. Existing approaches require dialog datasets to\nexplicitly annotate these KB queries -- these annotations can be time\nconsuming, and expensive. In response, we define the novel problems of\npredicting the KB query and training the dialog agent, without explicit KB\nquery annotation. For query prediction, we propose a reinforcement learning\n(RL) baseline, which rewards the generation of those queries whose KB results\ncover the entities mentioned in subsequent dialog. Further analysis reveals\nthat correlation among query attributes in KB can significantly confuse memory\naugmented policy optimization (MAPO), an existing state of the art RL agent. To\naddress this, we improve the MAPO baseline with simple but important\nmodifications suited to our task. To train the full TOD system for our setting,\nwe propose a pipelined approach: it independently predicts when to make a KB\nquery (query position predictor), then predicts a KB query at the predicted\nposition (query predictor), and uses the results of predicted query in\nsubsequent dialog (next response predictor). Overall, our work proposes first\nsolutions to our novel problem, and our analysis highlights the research\nchallenges in training TOD systems without query annotation.",

Due to\nthe nonlinear nature of the models, the state estimation problem is generally\nintractable as it involves integrals of general nonlinear functions and the\nfiltered and smoothed state distributions lack closed-form solutions. As such,\nit is common to approximate the state estimation problem. In this paper, we\ndevelop an assumed Gaussian solution based on variational inference, which\noffers the key advantage of a flexible, but principled, mechanism for\napproximating the required distributions. Our main contribution lies in a new\nformulation of the state estimation problem as an optimisation problem, which\ncan then be solved using standard optimisation routines that employ exact\nfirst- and second-order derivatives. The resulting state estimation approach\ninvolves a minimal number of assumptions and applies directly to nonlinear\nsystems with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian probabilistic models. The\nperformance of our approach is demonstrated on several examples; a challenging\nscalar system, a model of a simple robotic system, and a target tracking\nproblem using a von Mises-Fisher distribution and outperforms alternative\nassumed Gaussian approaches to state estimation.",

          "description": "Processing of medical images such as MRI or CT presents unique challenges\ncompared to RGB images typically used in computer vision. These include a lack\nof labels for large datasets, high computational costs, and metadata to\ndescribe the physical properties of voxels. Data augmentation is used to\nartificially increase the size of the training datasets. Training with image\npatches decreases the need for computational power. Spatial metadata needs to\nbe carefully taken into account in order to ensure a correct alignment of\nvolumes.\n\nWe present TorchIO, an open-source Python library to enable efficient\nloading, preprocessing, augmentation and patch-based sampling of medical images\nfor deep learning. TorchIO follows the style of PyTorch and integrates standard\nmedical image processing libraries to efficiently process images during\ntraining of neural networks. TorchIO transforms can be composed, reproduced,\ntraced and extended. We provide multiple generic preprocessing and augmentation\noperations as well as simulation of MRI-specific artifacts.\n\nSource code, comprehensive tutorials and extensive documentation for TorchIO\ncan be found at https://github.com/fepegar/torchio. The package can be\ninstalled from the Python Package Index running 'pip install torchio'. It\nincludes a command-line interface which allows users to apply transforms to\nimage files without using Python. Additionally, we provide a graphical\ninterface within a TorchIO extension in 3D Slicer to visualize the effects of\ntransforms.\n\nTorchIO was developed to help researchers standardize medical image\nprocessing pipelines and allow them to focus on the deep learning experiments.\nIt encourages open science, as it supports reproducibility and is version\ncontrolled so that the software can be cited precisely.

          "description": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is typically concerned with estimating\nsingle-step policies or single-step models, leveraging the Markov property to\nfactorize the problem in time. However, we can also view RL as a sequence\nmodeling problem, with the goal being to predict a sequence of actions that\nleads to a sequence of high rewards. Viewed in this way, it is tempting to\nconsider whether powerful, high-capacity sequence prediction models that work\nwell in other domains, such as natural-language processing, can also provide\nsimple and effective solutions to the RL problem. To this end, we explore how\nRL can be reframed as \"one big sequence modeling\" problem, using\nstate-of-the-art Transformer architectures to model distributions over\nsequences of states, actions, and rewards. Addressing RL as a sequence modeling\nproblem significantly simplifies a range of design decisions: we no longer\nrequire separate behavior policy constraints, as is common in prior work on\noffline model-free RL, and we no longer require ensembles or other epistemic\nuncertainty estimators, as is common in prior work on model-based RL. All of\nthese roles are filled by the same Transformer sequence model. In our\nexperiments, we demonstrate the flexibility of this approach across\nlong-horizon dynamics prediction, imitation learning, goal-conditioned RL, and\noffline RL.",

          "description": "Optimal Transport (OT) theory has seen an increasing amount of attention from\nthe computer science community due to its potency and relevance in modeling and\nmachine learning. It introduces means that serve as powerful ways to compare\nprobability distributions with each other, as well as producing optimal\nmappings to minimize cost functions. In this survey, we present a brief\nintroduction and history, a survey of previous work and propose directions of\nfuture study. We will begin by looking at the history of optimal transport and\nintroducing the founders of this field. We then give a brief glance into the\nalgorithms related to OT. Then, we will follow up with a mathematical\nformulation and the prerequisites to understand OT. These include Kantorovich\nduality, entropic regularization, KL Divergence, and Wassertein barycenters.\nSince OT is a computationally expensive problem, we then introduce the\nentropy-regularized version of computing optimal mappings, which allowed OT\nproblems to become applicable in a wide range of machine learning problems. In\nfact, the methods generated from OT theory are competitive with the current\nstate-of-the-art methods. We follow this up by breaking down research papers\nthat focus on image processing, graph learning, neural architecture search,\ndocument representation, and domain adaptation. We close the paper with a small\nsection on future research. Of the recommendations presented, three main\nproblems are fundamental to allow OT to become widely applicable but rely\nstrongly on its mathematical formulation and thus are hardest to answer. Since\nOT is a novel method, there is plenty of space for new research, and with more\nand more competitive methods (either on an accuracy level or computational\nspeed level) being created, the future of applied optimal transport is bright\nas it has become pervasive in machine learning.",

We exploit these confidence sets to plan trajectories that guarantee\nthe safety of the system. Our approach handles problems with high dynamics\nuncertainty where reaching the goal safely is initially infeasible by first\nexploring to gather data and reduce uncertainty, before autonomously exploiting\nthe acquired information to safely perform the task.

Commonly\nused Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer from critical slowing down\nin this limit, restricting the precision of continuum extrapolations. Further\ndifficulties arise when measuring correlation functions of operators widely\nseparated in spacetime: for most correlation functions, an exponentially severe\nsignal-to-noise problem is encountered as the operators are taken to be widely\nseparated. This dissertation details two new techniques to address these\nissues. First, we define a novel MCMC algorithm based on generative flow-based\nmodels. Such models utilize machine learning methods to describe efficient\napproximate samplers for distributions of interest. Independently drawn\nflow-based samples are then used as proposals in an asymptotically exact\nMetropolis-Hastings Markov chain. We address incorporating symmetries of\ninterest, including translational and gauge symmetries. We secondly introduce\nan approach to \"deform\" Monte Carlo estimators based on contour deformations\napplied to the domain of the path integral. The deformed estimators associated\nwith an observable give equivalent unbiased measurements of that observable,\nbut generically have different variances. We define families of deformed\nmanifolds for lattice gauge theories and introduce methods to efficiently\noptimize the choice of manifold (the \"observifold\"), minimizing the deformed\nobservable variance. Finally, we demonstrate that flow-based MCMC can mitigate\ncritical slowing down and observifolds can exponentially reduce variance in\nproof-of-principle applications to scalar $\\phi^4$ theory and $\\mathrm{U}(1)$\nand $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ lattice gauge theories.",

In this paper, we focus on\nimproving the robustness of a large class of learning algorithms that are\nformulated as low-rank semi-definite programming (SDP) problems. Traditional\nformulations use square loss, which is notorious for being sensitive to\noutliers. We propose to replace this with more robust noise models, including\nthe $\\ell_1$-loss and other nonconvex losses. However, the resultant\noptimization problem becomes difficult as the objective is no longer convex or\nsmooth. To alleviate this problem, we design an efficient algorithm based on\nmajorization-minimization. The crux is on constructing a good optimization\nsurrogate, and we show that this surrogate can be efficiently obtained by the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). By properly monitoring\nADMM's convergence, the proposed algorithm is empirically efficient and also\ntheoretically guaranteed to converge to a critical point. Extensive experiments\nare performed on four machine learning applications using both synthetic and\nreal-world data sets.

          "description": "Point clouds are a basic data type that is increasingly of interest as 3D\ncontent becomes more ubiquitous. Applications using point clouds include\nvirtual, augmented, and mixed reality and autonomous driving. We propose a more\nefficient deep learning-based encoder architecture for point clouds compression\nthat incorporates principles from established 3D object detection and image\ncompression architectures. Through an ablation study, we show that\nincorporating the learned activation function from Computational Efficient\nNeural Image Compression (CENIC) and designing more parameter-efficient\nconvolutional blocks yields dramatic gains in efficiency and performance. Our\nproposed architecture incorporates Generalized Divisive Normalization\nactivations and propose a spatially separable InceptionV4-inspired block. We\nthen evaluate rate-distortion curves on the standard JPEG Pleno 8i Voxelized\nFull Bodies dataset to evaluate our model's performance. Our proposed\nmodifications outperform the baseline approaches by a small margin in terms of\nBjontegard delta rate and PSNR values, yet reduces necessary encoder\nconvolution operations by 8 percent and reduces total encoder parameters by 20\npercent. Our proposed architecture, when considered on its own, has a small\npenalty of 0.02 percent in Chamfer's Distance and 0.32 percent increased bit\nrate in Point to Plane Distance for the same peak signal-to-noise ratio.",

          "description": "Despite the recent popularity of neural network-based solvers for optimal\ntransport (OT), there is no standard quantitative way to evaluate their\nperformance. In this paper, we address this issue for quadratic-cost transport\n-- specifically, computation of the Wasserstein-2 distance, a commonly-used\nformulation of optimal transport in machine learning. To overcome the challenge\nof computing ground truth transport maps between continuous measures needed to\nassess these solvers, we use input-convex neural networks (ICNN) to construct\npairs of measures whose ground truth OT maps can be obtained analytically. This\nstrategy yields pairs of continuous benchmark measures in high-dimensional\nspaces such as spaces of images. We thoroughly evaluate existing optimal\ntransport solvers using these benchmark measures. Even though these solvers\nperform well in downstream tasks, many do not faithfully recover optimal\ntransport maps. To investigate the cause of this discrepancy, we further test\nthe solvers in a setting of image generation. Our study reveals crucial\nlimitations of existing solvers and shows that increased OT accuracy does not\nnecessarily correlate to better results downstream.",

          "description": "Large sparse linear systems of equations are ubiquitous in science and\nengineering, such as those arising from discretizations of partial differential\nequations. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods are one of the most common methods\nof solving such linear systems, with an extensive body of underlying\nmathematical theory. A system of linear equations defines a graph on the set of\nunknowns and each level of a multigrid solver requires the selection of an\nappropriate coarse graph along with restriction and interpolation operators\nthat map to and from the coarse representation. The efficiency of the multigrid\nsolver depends critically on this selection and many selection methods have\nbeen developed over the years. Recently, it has been demonstrated that it is\npossible to directly learn the AMG interpolation and restriction operators,\ngiven a coarse graph selection. In this paper, we consider the complementary\nproblem of learning to coarsen graphs for a multigrid solver. We propose a\nmethod using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent based on graph neural networks\n(GNNs), which can learn to perform graph coarsening on small training graphs\nand then be applied to unstructured large graphs. We demonstrate that this\nmethod can produce better coarse graphs than existing algorithms, even as the\ngraph size increases and other properties of the graph are varied. We also\npropose an efficient inference procedure for performing graph coarsening that\nresults in linear time complexity in graph size.",

          "description": "Neuromorphic sensing and computing hold a promise for highly energy-efficient\nand high-bandwidth-sensor processing. A major challenge for neuromorphic\ncomputing is that learning algorithms for traditional artificial neural\nnetworks (ANNs) do not transfer directly to spiking neural networks (SNNs) due\nto the discrete spikes and more complex neuronal dynamics. As a consequence,\nSNNs have not yet been successfully applied to complex, large-scale tasks. In\nthis article, we focus on the self-supervised learning problem of optical flow\nestimation from event-based camera inputs, and investigate the changes that are\nnecessary to the state-of-the-art ANN training pipeline in order to\nsuccessfully tackle it with SNNs. More specifically, we first modify the input\nevent representation to encode a much smaller time slice with minimal explicit\ntemporal information. Consequently, we make the network's neuronal dynamics and\nrecurrent connections responsible for integrating information over time.\nMoreover, we reformulate the self-supervised loss function for event-based\noptical flow to improve its convexity. We perform experiments with various\ntypes of recurrent ANNs and SNNs using the proposed pipeline. Concerning SNNs,\nwe investigate the effects of elements such as parameter initialization and\noptimization, surrogate gradient shape, and adaptive neuronal mechanisms. We\nfind that initialization and surrogate gradient width play a crucial part in\nenabling learning with sparse inputs, while the inclusion of adaptivity and\nlearnable neuronal parameters can improve performance. We show that the\nperformance of the proposed ANNs and SNNs are on par with that of the current\nstate-of-the-art ANNs trained in a self-supervised manner.",

          "description": "Causal models are notoriously difficult to validate because they make\nuntestable assumptions regarding confounding. New scientific experiments offer\nthe possibility of evaluating causal models using prediction performance.\nPrediction performance measures are typically robust to violations in causal\nassumptions. However prediction performance does depend on the selection of\ntraining and test sets. In particular biased training sets can lead to\noptimistic assessments of model performance. In this work, we revisit the\nprediction performance of several recently proposed causal models tested on a\ngenetic perturbation data set of Kemmeren [Kemmeren et al., 2014]. We find that\nsample selection bias is likely a key driver of model performance. We propose\nusing a less-biased evaluation set for assessing prediction performance on\nKemmeren and compare models on this new set. In this setting, the causal model\ntested have similar performance to standard association based estimators such\nas Lasso. Finally we compare the performance of causal estimators in simulation\nstudies which reproduce the Kemmeren structure of genetic knockout experiments\nbut without any sample selection bias. These results provide an improved\nunderstanding of the performance of several causal models and offer guidance on\nhow future studies should use Kemmeren.",

          "description": "A long-standing challenge in artificial intelligence is lifelong learning. In\nlifelong learning, many tasks are presented in sequence and learners must\nefficiently transfer knowledge between tasks while avoiding catastrophic\nforgetting over long lifetimes. On these problems, policy reuse and other\nmulti-policy reinforcement learning techniques can learn many tasks. However,\nthey can generate many temporary or permanent policies, resulting in memory\nissues. Consequently, there is a need for lifetime-scalable methods that\ncontinually refine a policy library of a pre-defined size. This paper presents\na first approach to lifetime-scalable policy reuse. To pre-select the number of\npolicies, a notion of task capacity, the maximal number of tasks that a policy\ncan accurately solve, is proposed. To evaluate lifetime policy reuse using this\nmethod, two state-of-the-art single-actor base-learners are compared: 1) a\nvalue-based reinforcement learner, Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Deep Recurrent\nQ-Network (DRQN); and 2) an actor-critic reinforcement learner, Proximal Policy\nOptimisation (PPO) with or without Long Short-Term Memory layer. By selecting\nthe number of policies based on task capacity, D(R)QN achieves near-optimal\nperformance with 6 policies in a 27-task MDP domain and 9 policies in an\n18-task POMDP domain; with fewer policies, catastrophic forgetting and negative\ntransfer are observed. Due to slow, monotonic improvement, PPO requires fewer\npolicies, 1 policy for the 27-task domain and 4 policies for the 18-task\ndomain, but it learns the tasks with lower accuracy than D(R)QN. These findings\nvalidate lifetime-scalable policy reuse and suggest using D(R)QN for larger and\nPPO for smaller library sizes.",

          "description": "Existing rotated object detectors are mostly inherited from the horizontal\ndetection paradigm, as the latter has evolved into a well-developed area.\nHowever, these detectors are difficult to perform prominently in high-precision\ndetection due to the limitation of current regression loss design, especially\nfor objects with large aspect ratios. Taking the perspective that horizontal\ndetection is a special case for rotated object detection, in this paper, we are\nmotivated to change the design of rotation regression loss from induction\nparadigm to deduction methodology, in terms of the relation between rotation\nand horizontal detection. We show that one essential challenge is how to\nmodulate the coupled parameters in the rotation regression loss, as such the\nestimated parameters can influence to each other during the dynamic joint\noptimization, in an adaptive and synergetic way. Specifically, we first convert\nthe rotated bounding box into a 2-D Gaussian distribution, and then calculate\nthe Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the Gaussian distributions as the\nregression loss. By analyzing the gradient of each parameter, we show that KLD\n(and its derivatives) can dynamically adjust the parameter gradients according\nto the characteristics of the object. It will adjust the importance (gradient\nweight) of the angle parameter according to the aspect ratio. This mechanism\ncan be vital for high-precision detection as a slight angle error would cause a\nserious accuracy drop for large aspect ratios objects. More importantly, we\nhave proved that KLD is scale invariant. We further show that the KLD loss can\nbe degenerated into the popular $l_{n}$-norm loss for horizontal detection.\nExperimental results on seven datasets using different detectors show its\nconsistent superiority, and codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/yangxue0827/RotationDetection.",

          "description": "As autonomous machines such as robots and vehicles start performing tasks\ninvolving human users, ensuring a safe interaction between them becomes an\nimportant issue. Translating methods from human-robot interaction (HRI) studies\nto the interaction between humans and other highly complex machines (e.g.\nsemi-autonomous vehicles) could help advance the use of those machines in\nscenarios requiring human interaction. One method involves understanding human\nintentions and decision-making to estimate the human's present and near-future\nactions whilst interacting with a robot. This idea originates from the\npsychological concept of Theory of Mind, which has been broadly explored for\nrobotics and recently for autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. In this\nwork, we explored how to predict human intentions before an action is performed\nby combining data from human-motion, vehicle-state and human inputs (e.g.\nsteering wheel, pedals). A data-driven approach based on Recurrent Neural\nNetwork models was used to classify the current driving manoeuvre and to\npredict the future manoeuvre to be performed. A state-transition model was used\nwith a fixed set of manoeuvres to label data recorded during the trials for\nreal-time applications. Models were trained and tested using drivers of\ndifferent seat preferences, driving expertise and arm-length; precision and\nrecall metrics over 95% for manoeuvre identification and 86% for manoeuvre\nprediction were achieved, with prediction time-windows of up to 1 second for\nboth known and unknown test subjects.

          "description": "Multiple-Intent Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MI-IRL) seeks to find a\nreward function ensemble to rationalize demonstrations of different but\nunlabelled intents. Within the popular expectation maximization (EM) framework\nfor learning probabilistic MI-IRL models, we present a warm-start strategy\nbased on up-front clustering of the demonstrations in feature space. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that this warm-start solution produces a\nnear-optimal reward ensemble, provided the behavior modes satisfy mild\nseparation conditions. We also propose a MI-IRL performance metric that\ngeneralizes the popular Expected Value Difference measure to directly assesses\nlearned rewards against the ground-truth reward ensemble. Our metric elegantly\naddresses the difficulty of pairing up learned and ground truth rewards via a\nmin-cost flow formulation, and is efficiently computable. We also develop a\nMI-IRL benchmark problem that allows for more comprehensive algorithmic\nevaluations. On this problem, we find our MI-IRL warm-start strategy helps\navoid poor quality local minima reward ensembles, resulting in a significant\nimprovement in behavior clustering. Our extensive sensitivity analysis\ndemonstrates that the quality of the learned reward ensembles is improved under\nvarious settings, including cases where our theoretical assumptions do not\nnecessarily hold. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by\ndiscovering distinct driving styles in a large real-world dataset of driver GPS\ntrajectories.",

The textual contents convey hidden information\nsuch as personality and cognition about corresponding authors that can\ndetermine both correlations and variations between users. Emotion recognition\nfrom brief contents should embrace the contrast between authors where the\ndifferences in personality and cognition can be traced within emotional\nexpressions. To tackle this challenge, we devise a framework that, on the one\nhand, infers latent individual aspects, from brief contents and, on the other\nhand, presents a novel ensemble classifier equipped with dynamic dropout\nconvnets to extract emotions from textual context. To categorize short text\ncontents, our proposed method conjointly leverages cognitive factors and\nexploits hidden information. We utilize the outcome vectors in a novel\nembedding model to foster emotion-pertinent features that are collectively\nassembled by lexicon inductions.

          "description": "Document-level relation extraction has attracted much attention in recent\nyears. It is usually formulated as a classification problem that predicts\nrelations for all entity pairs in the document. However, previous works\nindiscriminately represent intra- and inter-sentential relations in the same\nway, confounding the different patterns for predicting them. Besides, they\ncreate a document graph and use paths between entities on the graph as clues\nfor logical reasoning. However, not all entity pairs can be connected with a\npath and have the correct logical reasoning paths in their graph. Thus many\ncases of logical reasoning cannot be covered. This paper proposes an effective\narchitecture, SIRE, to represent intra- and inter-sentential relations in\ndifferent ways. We design a new and straightforward form of logical reasoning\nmodule that can cover more logical reasoning chains. Experiments on the public\ndatasets show SIRE outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods. Further\nanalysis shows that our predictions are reliable and explainable.

          "description": "Unlike the conventional wisdom in statistical learning theory, the test error\nof a deep neural network (DNN) often demonstrates double descent: as the model\ncomplexity increases, it first follows a classical U-shaped curve and then\nshows a second descent. Through bias-variance decomposition, recent studies\nrevealed that the bell-shaped variance is the major cause of model-wise double\ndescent (when the DNN is widened gradually). This paper investigates epoch-wise\ndouble descent, i.e., the test error of a DNN also shows double descent as the\nnumber of training epoches increases. By extending the bias-variance analysis\nto epoch-wise double descent of the zero-one loss, we surprisingly find that\nthe variance itself, without the bias, varies consistently with the test error.\nInspired by this result, we propose a novel metric, optimization variance (OV),\nto measure the diversity of model updates caused by the stochastic gradients of\nrandom training batches drawn in the same iteration. OV can be estimated using\nsamples from the training set only but correlates well with the (unknown)\n\\emph{test} error, and hence early stopping may be achieved without using a\nvalidation set.",

We used lateral view knee radiographs from MOST public use\ndatasets (n = 5507 knees). Patellar region-of-interest (ROI) was automatically\ndetected using landmark detection tool (BoneFinder). Hand-crafted features,\nbased on LocalBinary Patterns (LBP), were then extracted to describe the\npatellar texture. First, a machine learning model (Gradient Boosting Machine)\nwas trained to detect radiographic PFOA from the LBP features. Furthermore, we\nused end-to-end trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) directly on\nthe texture patches for detecting the PFOA. The proposed classification models\nwere eventually compared with more conventional reference models that use\nclinical assessments and participant characteristics such as age, sex, body\nmass index(BMI), the total WOMAC score, and tibiofemoral Kellgren-Lawrence (KL)\ngrade. Atlas-guided visual assessment of PFOA status by expert readers provided\nin the MOST public use datasets was used as a classification outcome for the\nmodels. Performance of prediction models was assessed using the area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC), the area under the\nprecision-recall (PR) curve-average precision (AP)-, and Brier score in the\nstratified 5-fold cross validation setting.Of the 5507 knees, 953 (17.3%) had\nPFOA.

In this paper, leveraging a recent linear algebraic theory called\nGershgorin disc perfect alignment (GDPA), we propose a fast projection-free\nmethod by solving a sequence of linear programs (LP) instead. Specifically, we\nfirst recast the SDP relaxation to its SDP dual, where a feasible solution $H\n\\succeq 0$ can be interpreted as a Laplacian matrix corresponding to a balanced\nsigned graph sans the last node. To achieve graph balance, we split the last\nnode into two that respectively contain the original positive and negative\nedges, resulting in a new Laplacian $\\bar{H}$. We repose the SDP dual for\nsolution $\\bar{H}$, then replace the PSD cone constraint $\\bar{H} \\succeq 0$\nwith linear constraints derived from GDPA -- sufficient conditions to ensure\n$\\bar{H}$ is PSD -- so that the optimization becomes an LP per iteration.\nFinally, we extract predicted labels from our converged LP solution $\\bar{H}$.\nExperiments show that our algorithm enjoyed a $40\\times$ speedup on average\nover the next fastest scheme while retaining comparable label prediction\nperformance.",

However, it remains\nchallenging to carry the well-trained deep models for online real-time\ninference serving, with respect to the time-varying web-scale traffics from\nbillions of users, in a cost-effective manner. In this work, we present JIZHI -\na Model-as-a-Service system - that per second handles hundreds of millions of\nonline inference requests to huge deep models with more than trillions of\nsparse parameters, for over twenty real-time recommendation services at Baidu,\nInc. In JIZHI, the inference workflow of every recommendation request is\ntransformed to a Staged Event-Driven Pipeline (SEDP), where each node in the\npipeline refers to a staged computation or I/O intensive task processor. With\ntraffics of real-time inference requests arrived, each modularized processor\ncan be run in a fully asynchronized way and managed separately. Besides, JIZHI\nintroduces heterogeneous and hierarchical storage to further accelerate the\nonline inference process by reducing unnecessary computations and potential\ndata access latency induced by ultra-sparse model parameters. Moreover, an\nintelligent resource manager has been deployed to maximize the throughput of\nJIZHI over the shared infrastructure by searching the optimal resource\nallocation plan from historical logs and fine-tuning the load shedding policies\nover intermediate system feedback. Extensive experiments have been done to\ndemonstrate the advantages of JIZHI from the perspectives of end-to-end service\nlatency, system-wide throughput, and resource consumption.

          "description": "Despite the recent advancement in NLP research, cross-lingual transfer for\nnatural language generation is relatively understudied. In this work, we\ntransfer supervision from high resource language (HRL) to multiple low-resource\nlanguages (LRLs) for natural language generation (NLG). We consider four NLG\ntasks (text summarization, question generation, news headline generation, and\ndistractor generation) and three syntactically diverse languages, i.e.,\nEnglish, Hindi, and Japanese. We propose an unsupervised cross-lingual language\ngeneration framework (called ZmBART) that does not use any parallel or\npseudo-parallel/back-translated data. In this framework, we further pre-train\nmBART sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder model with an auxiliary task\nusing monolingual data of three languages. The objective function of the\nauxiliary task is close to the target tasks which enriches the multi-lingual\nlatent representation of mBART and provides good initialization for target\ntasks. Then, this model is fine-tuned with task-specific supervised English\ndata and directly evaluated with low-resource languages in the Zero-shot\nsetting. To overcome catastrophic forgetting and spurious correlation issues,\nwe applied freezing model component and data argumentation approaches\nrespectively. This simple modeling approach gave us promising results.We\nexperimented with few-shot training (with 1000 supervised data points) which\nboosted the model performance further. We performed several ablations and\ncross-lingual transferability analyses to demonstrate the robustness of ZmBART.",

          "description": "Contrastive learning has shown superior performance in embedding global and\nspatial invariant features in computer vision (e.g., image classification).\nHowever, its overall success of embedding local and spatial variant features is\nstill limited, especially for semantic segmentation. In a per-pixel prediction\ntask, more than one label can exist in a single image for segmentation (e.g.,\nan image contains both cat, dog, and grass), thereby it is difficult to define\n'positive' or 'negative' pairs in a canonical contrastive learning setting. In\nthis paper, we propose an attention-guided supervised contrastive learning\napproach to highlight a single semantic object every time as the target. With\nour design, the same image can be embedded to different semantic clusters with\nsemantic attention (i.e., coerce semantic masks) as an additional input\nchannel. To achieve such attention, a novel two-stage training strategy is\npresented. We evaluate the proposed method on multi-organ medical image\nsegmentation task, as our major task, with both in-house data and BTCV 2015\ndatasets. Comparing with the supervised and semi-supervised training\nstate-of-the-art in the backbone of ResNet-50, our proposed pipeline yields\nsubstantial improvement of 5.53% and 6.09% in Dice score for both medical image\nsegmentation cohorts respectively.

In modern settings, the\ncompression of high-dimensional neural representations to low-dimensional\nbinary codes is a challenging task and often require large bit-codes to be\naccurate. In this work, we propose a novel method for Learning Low-dimensional\nbinary Codes (LLC) for instances as well as classes. Our method does not\nrequire any side-information, like annotated attributes or label meta-data, and\nlearns extremely low-dimensional binary codes (~20 bits for ImageNet-1K). The\nlearnt codes are super-efficient while still ensuring nearly optimal\nclassification accuracy for ResNet50 on ImageNet-1K. We demonstrate that the\nlearnt codes capture intrinsically important features in the data, by\ndiscovering an intuitive taxonomy over classes. We further quantitatively\nmeasure the quality of our codes by applying it to the efficient image\nretrieval as well as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problems. For\nImageNet-100 retrieval problem, our learnt binary codes outperform 16 bit\nHashNet using only 10 bits and also are as accurate as 10 dimensional real\nrepresentations.

          "description": "Mutual knowledge distillation (MKD) improves a model by distilling knowledge\nfrom another model. However, not all knowledge is certain and correct,\nespecially under adverse conditions. For example, label noise usually leads to\nless reliable models due to the undesired memorisation [1, 2]. Wrong knowledge\nmisleads the learning rather than helps. This problem can be handled by two\naspects: (i) improving the reliability of a model where the knowledge is from\n(i.e., knowledge source's reliability); (ii) selecting reliable knowledge for\ndistillation. In the literature, making a model more reliable is widely studied\nwhile selective MKD receives little attention. Therefore, we focus on studying\nselective MKD and highlight its importance in this work.\n\nConcretely, a generic MKD framework, Confident knowledge selection followed\nby Mutual Distillation (CMD), is designed. The key component of CMD is a\ngeneric knowledge selection formulation, making the selection threshold either\nstatic (CMD-S) or progressive (CMD-P). Additionally, CMD covers two special\ncases: zero knowledge and all knowledge, leading to a unified MKD framework. We\nempirically find CMD-P performs better than CMD-S. The main reason is that a\nmodel's knowledge upgrades and becomes confident as the training progresses.\n\nExtensive experiments are present to demonstrate the effectiveness of CMD and\nthoroughly justify the design of CMD. For example, CMD-P obtains new\nstate-of-the-art results in robustness against label noise.",

In\nparticular, the Transformer's kernel is characterized as having an infinite\nfeature dimension. Along the way we consider an extension of the standard\nkernel learning problem to a binary setting, where data come from two input\ndomains and a response is defined for every cross-domain pair. We prove a new\nrepresenter theorem for these binary kernel machines with non-Mercer\n(indefinite, asymmetric) kernels (implying that the functions learned are\nelements of reproducing kernel Banach spaces rather than Hilbert spaces), and\nalso prove a new universal approximation theorem showing that the Transformer\ncalculation can learn any binary non-Mercer reproducing kernel Banach space\npair. We experiment with new kernels in Transformers, and obtain results that\nsuggest the infinite dimensionality of the standard Transformer kernel is\npartially responsible for its performance.

In this work, we\nanswer representational questions raised by the architectures in (Shen et al.,\n2018a, 2019), as well as some transition-based syntax-aware language models\n(Dyer et al., 2016): what kind of syntactic structure can current neural\napproaches to syntax represent? Concretely, we ground this question in the\nsandbox of probabilistic context-free-grammars (PCFGs), and identify a key\naspect of the representational power of these approaches: the amount and\ndirectionality of context that the predictor has access to when forced to make\nparsing decision. We show that with limited context (either bounded, or\nunidirectional), there are PCFGs, for which these approaches cannot represent\nthe max-likelihood parse; conversely, if the context is unlimited, they can\nrepresent the max-likelihood parse of any PCFG.",

          "description": "The goal of controlled feature selection is to discover the features a\nresponse depends on while limiting the proportion of false discoveries to a\npredefined level. Recently, multiple methods have been proposed that use deep\nlearning to generate knockoffs for controlled feature selection through the\nModel-X knockoff framework. We demonstrate, however, that these methods often\nfail to control the false discovery rate (FDR). There are two reasons for this\nshortcoming. First, these methods often learn inaccurate models of features.\nSecond, the \"swap\" property, which is required for knockoffs to be valid, is\noften not well enforced. We propose a new procedure called FlowSelect that\nremedies both of these problems. To more accurately model the features,\nFlowSelect uses normalizing flows, the state-of-the-art method for density\nestimation. To circumvent the need to enforce the swap property, FlowSelect\nuses a novel MCMC-based procedure to directly compute p-values for each\nfeature. Asymptotically, FlowSelect controls the FDR exactly. Empirically,\nFlowSelect controls the FDR well on both synthetic and semi-synthetic\nbenchmarks, whereas competing knockoff-based approaches fail to do so.\nFlowSelect also demonstrates greater power on these benchmarks. Additionally,\nusing data from a genome-wide association study of soybeans, FlowSelect\ncorrectly infers the genetic variants associated with specific soybean traits.",

          "description": "How can we make use of information parallelism in online decision making\nproblems while efficiently balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off? In\nthis paper, we introduce a batch Thompson Sampling framework for two canonical\nonline decision making problems, namely, stochastic multi-arm bandit and linear\ncontextual bandit with finitely many arms. Over a time horizon $T$, our\n\\textit{batch} Thompson Sampling policy achieves the same (asymptotic) regret\nbound of a fully sequential one while carrying out only $O(\\log T)$ batch\nqueries. To achieve this exponential reduction, i.e., reducing the number of\ninteractions from $T$ to $O(\\log T)$, our batch policy dynamically determines\nthe duration of each batch in order to balance the exploration-exploitation\ntrade-off. We also demonstrate experimentally that dynamic batch allocation\ndramatically outperforms natural baselines such as static batch allocations.",

          "description": "Iteratively reweighted least square (IRLS) is a popular approach to solve\nsparsity-enforcing regression problems in machine learning. State of the art\napproaches are more efficient but typically rely on specific coordinate pruning\nschemes. In this work, we show how a surprisingly simple reparametrization of\nIRLS, coupled with a bilevel resolution (instead of an alternating scheme) is\nable to achieve top performances on a wide range of sparsity (such as Lasso,\ngroup Lasso and trace norm regularizations), regularization strength (including\nhard constraints), and design matrices (ranging from correlated designs to\ndifferential operators). Similarly to IRLS, our method only involves linear\nsystems resolutions, but in sharp contrast, corresponds to the minimization of\na smooth function. Despite being non-convex, we show that there is no spurious\nminima and that saddle points are \"ridable\", so that there always exists a\ndescent direction. We thus advocate for the use of a BFGS quasi-Newton solver,\nwhich makes our approach simple, robust and efficient. We perform a numerical\nbenchmark of the convergence speed of our algorithm against state of the art\nsolvers for Lasso, group Lasso, trace norm and linearly constrained problems.\nThese results highlight the versatility of our approach, removing the need to\nuse different solvers depending on the specificity of the ML problem under\nstudy.",

          "description": "Federated Learning allows training machine learning models by using the\ncomputation and private data resources of a large number of distributed clients\nsuch as smartphones and IoT devices. Most existing works on Federated Learning\n(FL) assume the clients have ground-truth labels. However, in many practical\nscenarios, clients may be unable to label task-specific data, e.g., due to lack\nof expertise. In this work, we consider a server that hosts a labeled dataset,\nand wishes to leverage clients with unlabeled data for supervised learning. We\npropose a new Federated Learning framework referred to as SemiFL in order to\naddress the problem of Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL). In SemiFL,\nclients have completely unlabeled data, while the server has a small amount of\nlabeled data. SemiFL is communication efficient since it separates the training\nof server-side supervised data and client-side unsupervised data. We\ndemonstrate various efficient strategies of SemiFL that enhance learning\nperformance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our communication\nefficient method can significantly improve the performance of a labeled server\nwith unlabeled clients. Moreover, we demonstrate that SemiFL can outperform\nmany existing FL results trained with fully supervised data, and perform\ncompetitively with the state-of-the-art centralized Semi-Supervised Learning\n(SSL) methods. For instance, in standard communication efficient scenarios, our\nmethod can perform 93% accuracy on the CIFAR10 dataset with only 4000 labeled\nsamples at the server. Such accuracy is only 2% away from the result trained\nfrom 50000 fully labeled data, and it improves about 30% upon existing SSFL\nmethods in the communication efficient setting.",

Nearly all of these\nmethods assume every unlabeled instance encountered will belong to a handful of\nknown classes for which one has examples. This can be problematic for\nreal-world use cases where one routinely finds 'none-of-the-above' examples. In\nthis paper we describe this challenge of identifying what we term\n'out-of-support' (OOS) examples. We describe how this problem is subtly\ndifferent from out-of-distribution detection and describe a new method of\nidentifying OOS examples within the Prototypical Networks framework using a\nfixed point which we call the generic representation. We show that our method\noutperforms other existing approaches in the literature as well as other\napproaches that we propose in this paper.

          "description": "Normalizing flows are invertible neural networks with tractable\nchange-of-volume terms, which allows optimization of their parameters to be\nefficiently performed via maximum likelihood. However, data of interest is\ntypically assumed to live in some (often unknown) low-dimensional manifold\nembedded in high-dimensional ambient space. The result is a modelling mismatch\nsince -- by construction -- the invertibility requirement implies\nhigh-dimensional support of the learned distribution. Injective flows, mapping\nfrom low- to high-dimensional space, aim to fix this discrepancy by learning\ndistributions on manifolds, but the resulting volume-change term becomes more\nchallenging to evaluate. Current approaches either avoid computing this term\nentirely using various heuristics, or assume the manifold is known beforehand\nand therefore are not widely applicable. Instead, we propose two methods to\ntractably calculate the gradient of this term with respect to the parameters of\nthe model, relying on careful use of automatic differentiation and techniques\nfrom numerical linear algebra. Both approaches perform end-to-end nonlinear\nmanifold learning and density estimation for data projected onto this manifold.\nWe study the trade-offs between our proposed methods, empirically verify that\nwe outperform approaches ignoring the volume-change term by more accurately\nlearning manifolds and the corresponding distributions on them, and show\npromising results on out-of-distribution detection.",

          "description": "Learning to reach goal states and learning diverse skills through mutual\ninformation (MI) maximization have been proposed as principled frameworks for\nself-supervised reinforcement learning, allowing agents to acquire broadly\napplicable multitask policies with minimal reward engineering. Starting from a\nsimple observation that the standard goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) is encapsulated\nby the optimization objective of variational empowerment, we discuss how GCRL\nand MI-based RL can be generalized into a single family of methods, which we\nname variational GCRL (VGCRL), interpreting variational MI maximization, or\nvariational empowerment, as representation learning methods that acquire\nfunctionally-aware state representations for goal reaching. This novel\nperspective allows us to: (1) derive simple but unexplored variants of GCRL to\nstudy how adding small representation capacity can already expand its\ncapabilities; (2) investigate how discriminator function capacity and\nsmoothness determine the quality of discovered skills, or latent goals, through\nmodifying latent dimensionality and applying spectral normalization; (3) adapt\ntechniques such as hindsight experience replay (HER) from GCRL to MI-based RL;\nand lastly, (4) propose a novel evaluation metric, named latent goal reaching\n(LGR), for comparing empowerment algorithms with different choices of latent\ndimensionality and discriminator parameterization.

Using the CodeXGLUE benchmark, we show that\nthe accuracy of Code2vec for this task is comparable to simple\ntransformer-based methods such as pre-trained RoBERTa, and outperforms more\nnaive NLP-based methods. We achieved an accuracy of 61.43% while maintaining\nlow computational requirements relative to larger models.",

          "description": "The assessment of program functionality can generally be accomplished with\nstraight-forward unit tests. However, assessing the design quality of a program\nis a much more difficult and nuanced problem. Design quality is an important\nconsideration since it affects the readability and maintainability of programs.\nAssessing design quality and giving personalized feedback is very time\nconsuming task for instructors and teaching assistants. This limits the scale\nof giving personalized feedback to small class settings. Further, design\nquality is nuanced and is difficult to concisely express as a set of rules. For\nthese reasons, we propose a neural network model to both automatically assess\nthe design of a program and provide personalized feedback to guide students on\nhow to make corrections. The model's effectiveness is evaluated on a corpus of\nstudent programs written in Python. The model has an accuracy rate from 83.67%\nto 94.27%, depending on the dataset, when predicting design scores as compared\nto historical instructor assessment. Finally, we present a study where students\ntried to improve the design of their programs based on the personalized\nfeedback produced by the model. Students who participated in the study improved\ntheir program design scores by 19.58%.",
